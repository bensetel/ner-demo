# Let The Salary Wars Commence!! Another Biglaw Firm Has Matched The $190K Scale
## Another Biglaw firm is ready to play!

Get ready for the new $190K normal!

Yesterday Milbank — shall we say Thrillbank — [rocked the Biglaw world](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) by announcing associate raises across the board — to the tune of $10,000 to $15,000 depending on class year. Yesterday the litigation boutique of [Hueston Hennigan matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-firm-has-matched-the-new-milbank-scale/), and today we’ve gotten word that [Proskauer matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-match-the-new-associate-raises/). Now Winston & Strawn is on board as an early adopter of the new pay scale, and it’d fair to say that three Biglaw firms make a trend!!

Winston associates will now be making the new market scale:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Classes 2018/2017: $190,000
Class 2016: $200,000
Class 2015: $220,000
Class 2014: $250,000
Class 2013: $275,000
Class 2012: $295,000
Class 2011: $315,000
Class 2010: $330,000

Oh, and summer associates are getting in on the bigger payday too.

It remains to be seen exactly how many firms are ready to get on board with the new salaries. There’s been a growing gap between the very top of the Biglaw world and the rest. But if firms aren’t ready[ to pony up with what amounts to slight raise over a cost of living adjustment](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/)… that says a lot about their financial situation.

But for now, we know that Winston is ready to play with the big kids.

# Power Niche Marketing: Every Client And Every Customer Is Different
## Sorry, but there's no single magic marketing bullet that will work for all clients all the time.

One lesson that seems obvious but really is not at all is that every client is very different in its desires for legal representation. There is therefore simply not a one-size-fits-all solution to marketing. Marketing is a wonderful area to work in for that reason: you can craft and create all sorts of ideas and see what works. And always remember that no matter how much you think and prepare, you are not playing with widgets; you are dealing with human beings. You have to be open-minded and flexible, or you will end up failing too much.

If you are like most people – including me – you probably hope to find that something – that special thing – that you could do that would work like a magic marketing bullet.  It would be a consistent solution in your marketing pitch that you could use all the time that would result in a pile of clients pouring in the door.

But – alas – that is just not how it works.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Law, especially, is a “personal” service business. There is, therefore, a “person” that is being serviced by your legal work. And because of that, each client and each customer is different and wants different things from you.

Let me try out an example. Let’s pretend you are seeking to bring in a client for real estate transactional work. You launch into your pitch and maybe say you are a really great negotiator and you can achieve great results at the bargaining table. After your eloquent and convincing pitch, however, you learn that this client really likes to do the negotiation himself, and just wants lawyers to just document the results of his negotiations. Oops!

Or maybe you tell the client at the pitch that you are super careful on documentation and nothing ever gets missed. But then the client mentions that he just can’t stand “overly detail-oriented lawyers.” They drive him crazy. He doesn’t believe in the documents anyway, and he just likes to get deals done. Oops, again….

You get my point. Clients want different things from their lawyers.  Admittedly, an effective marketing strategy logically has a “default style” if you really have no idea what the client wants. I urge that your marketing style should be very flexible, however, so you can tailor the service you deliver to be the kind of service that the client seeks.

Notably, what I am saying here in this article does not necessarily apply to things like data analytics and marketing campaigns that literally go out to hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of customers. I recognize that sometimes these concepts can be hugely successful, but that is not within the scope of my expertise.

To conclude, there is not going to be a single magic marketing bullet that will work for all clients all the time. Accordingly, I urge you to become a student of marketing in order to be successful.

Weil Gotshal created the bankruptcy practice. We’re probably steadier in our results than some of our peers that might be weighted to a particular economy. We don’t plan for pandemic, but we do plan for recession, and we make sure we are well suited when a recession happens to make sure our results will continue to be strong, and knock on wood, that’s exactly what’s happening this year.

— Weil Gotshal executive partner Barry Wolf, commenting on the Biglaw firm’s [successes during the coronavirus crisis](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/10/recession-highs-how-some-firms-are-ahead-in-2020/). Weil has largely dominated debtor-side representation matters in its bankruptcy and restructuring practice, and the firm’s billable hours are ahead of budget for 2020.

This is just my opinion, but the legal industry’s own snobbery comes back to bite it in the butt.

If you think that a person who didn’t go to a top 20 law school can’t do quality legal work and you refuse to hire a person or work with a person like that, or you refuse to pay them a rate that they’re willing to work for, then you’re creating artificial scarcity.

— [Nathan Cemenska](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/experts/nathan-cemenska), the director of legal operations and industry insights at Wolters Kluwer’s ELM Solutions, commenting on one of the reasons why there [aren’t enough Biglaw associates](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-talent-battle-natural-selection-or-artificial-scarcity) to perform all of the legal work that prestigious clients like big banks have to offer — work that could perhaps be handled by a [smaller firm at a much lower price](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2022/02/25/is-snobbery-causing-banks-to-overpay-outside-counsel/).

# A Failed Merger Might Explain Why These Firms Haven't Announced Raises
## Both of these firms' financials suffered in 2015.

Back in May, we first started [hearing rumors](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/morning-docket-05-09-16/) that Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer were [considering combining](https://bol.bna.com/will-kaye-scholer-and-arnold-porter-do-the-dance/). A merger between the two would have created a firm with about 1,000 lawyers with healthy revenue numbers that could have crossed the billion-dollar mark.

Now, thanks to a report from [The Lawyer](http://www.thelawyer.com/kaye-scholer-arnold-porter-merger-talks-off/), we’re hearing that the merger talks are off the table. It seems that Michael Solow, Kaye Scholer’s managing partner, told the paper that no firm had “presented us with a proposition that’s beneficial enough to our clients.” Thomas Milch, Arnold & Porter’s former chairman, said, “We talk to law firms all the time,” and refused to discuss his firm’s possible merger with Kaye Scholer.

Per the latest Am Law 100 rankings, Arnold & Porter’s gross revenue fell by 6.4 percent, to $650 million, and its profits per partner fell by 12.6 percent, to $1.21 million. By Law.com’s estimation, only two Am Law 100 firms had double-digit drops in net income and profits per partner last year, and Arnold & Porter was one of them. Kaye Scholer, on the other hand, sustained less severe declines in gross revenue (down 1.3 percent to $370 million) and profits per partner (down 2.1 percent to $1.38 million).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Is this failed merger — coupled with both firms’ suffering financials — the reason why neither of them have announced raises on the new Cravath salary scale? Kaye Scholer is ranked No. 66 and Arnold & Porter is ranked No. 74 in terms of [profits per partner for all Am Law 200 law firms](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202758259924), and several firms ranked lower than one or both of them have already announced raises (No. 67 [Brown Rudnick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-announces-raises-kinda-screws-over-the-older-folks/); No. 69 [Covington](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-changes-course-on-associate-compensation/); No. 70 [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/peer-pressure-causes-another-firm-to-increase-associate-compensation/); No. 79 [Baker & McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-raises-salaries-but-amount-remains-unclear/); No. 75 [Bracewell](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/monday-night-money-party-another-firm-announces-salary-hikes/); and No. 115 [Locke Lord](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-raises-salaries-but-doesnt-quite-match-market/)).

Their time for excuses may be running out, while we wait for Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer to ante up, we welcome your speculations as to why they may be reluctant to pull the trigger on increasing salaries for their associates. Please feel free to contact us.

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Law Firm Revenue Is Up Because We're Just Making People Pay More For Less
## One market segment had a surprisingly good quarter.

It’s not that lawyers aren’t giving individual clients as much dedicated, high-quality work product as they always have, it’s that there’s not nearly as much of that work to go around. But the legal industry is nothing if not resilient when it comes to its own bottom line and firms found a way — yet again — to snatch big bucks from the jaws of declining demand this quarter.

David Altuna and Gretta Rusanow of Citi Private Bank’s Law Firm Group [wrote about this phenomenon this morning](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/05/13/law-firm-revenue-rose-as-demand-dropped-in-the-first-quarter-of-2019/), based on survey results from 75 Am Law 100 firms, 52 Am Law 101-200 firms, and 60 niche/boutique firms, even though the conclusions could have come from nearly any quarter of the last decade:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The legal industry saw greater revenue growth during the first quarter of 2019 than it did to start the strong year of 2018. However, the drivers of that growth were much different, as the demand growth that characterized 2018 gave way to a demand decline during the first quarter of 2019, and much of the revenue growth came in the form of cash collections from 2018 inventory. Billing rate increases continued at the elevated pace that we saw in 2018, and they retake their position as the primary revenue driver to begin 2019, as they have been for much of the post-recession period.

So much for efficiency-minded clients! Perhaps there was always this much elasticity in high-end legal services, but to hear clients adamantly declare that they will not pay for associate salary increases and invest a great deal of rhetorical energy into legal operations with an eye toward improving efficiency, it creates a bit of cognitive dissonance to see clients forking over more and more money while demand sinks.

For what it’s worth, Altuna and Rusanow identify collections on 2018 billings as contributing to the 2019 revenue spike, but drops in the bucket remain mere drops in the bucket:

Revenue growth of 4.5% in the first quarter of 2019 was driven largely by lawyer billing rate growth of 4.4%, as demand declined 0.3%.

Meanwhile, expenses continued to grow, eating into partner profits and revealing that no matter how inexorable billing rate increases feel, the firms are actually letting the clients off light.

One big surprise from these results is that mid-tier firms — the firms that have been falling farther and farther behind the elite in Biglaw for years — actually had a better quarter for a change:

Looking at the results by revenue size, Am Law 51-100 firms had the best start to the year. These firms saw the greatest revenue growth at 8.1% and were the only segment to see revenue growth exceed expense growth. They also saw the greatest demand growth at 1.2% and saw lawyer billing rate increases of 4.1%. They had by far the greatest shortening of the collection cycle at 3%, and this materially aided their revenue growth. Even so, they also carry a 4.9% inventory increase into the second quarter, the second-largest among the segments.

Can these firms keep up the pace? If the tide has finally turned and clients are again embracing the middle of the pack, that significantly changes the landscape.

But it probably hasn’t. Let’s hold out for second quarter numbers before we go around resurrecting a market segment that’s been hammered for years.

# The $415K Associate Salary Scale Continues Its Takeover Of The Biglaw Elite
## Another Biglaw firm re-raises associate salaries.

If you want to prove to associates that they are well and truly valued — a necessity, given the white-hot lateral market — Biglaw firms know they’re going to have to pony up the top-of-market salary scale set by [Cravath this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/). Yes, even if they already raised salaries this year. Both the Milbank and Davis Polk scales have been overtaken, and that’s the game Biglaw firms have to play if they want to remain elite.

So, it isn’t surprising that O’Melveny, a firm that took in $835,097,000 in gross revenue in 2020 — making it 54th on the Am Law 100 — has decided to raise salaries again. According to the voicemail associates received last night, O’Melveny is doing a full match of the *new* prevailing market rate as set by Cravath.

For those who have not yet memorized the scale, this is the new compensation grid at OMM (and a whole bunch of other firms):

Class Year	Salary
2014	$415,000
2015	$400,000
2016	$370,000
2017	$345,000
2018	$295,000
2019	$250,000
2020	$225,000
2021	$215,000
Like the last round of raises, these increases are retroactive to January 1.

Lateral Link, along with our sister divisions Cadence Counsel and Bridgeline Solutions, is proud to announce five new hires. Please welcome Jaclyn Genchi, J’lene Mortimer, Susan Agopian, Naomi Kaplan, and Stephanie Ruiter to our team!

“We have a simple plan. As we are only as good as our recruiters, we hire the best talent possible. The Lateral Link family is thrilled to welcome Jackie, J’lene, Naomi, Stephanie, and Susan. Collectively, our fabulous new additions speak four languages, have lived abroad for over a lifetime in multiple continents, maneuver with precision both cars and motorcycles, and are some of the brightest, most hardworking, and interesting people in our space. Please join me in welcoming our newest team members to Lateral Link. We are proud to work alongside them in servicing our clients and candidates across the country,” said Michael Allen, founder/CEO of Lateral Link.

##Jaclyn Genchi


[Jaclyn Genchi](https://www.laterallink.com/team/jaclyn-genchi/) is a Director based in South Florida. She focuses on placing associates and partners at Am Law 100 and 200 law firms, prominent regional firms, and elite boutiques throughout the Southeast, and also on placing in-house attorneys and general counsel in corporate legal departments nationwide.

Prior to joining Lateral Link, Jackie was an associate for 10 years at two Am Law 100 firms, working on bankruptcy matters in New York, litigation matters in Miami, and FCPA/investigation matters in Paris and D.C. As she made a lateral move herself, which included a practice group switch and a move from New York to Miami, she well understands the process from the candidate’s perspective.

Jackie received her BA and MA from the University of Florida and her JD from Duke University School of Law. She lives in West Palm Beach, Florida, with her rescue pup Winnye and, in her free time, Jackie is a devoted spa junkie with a fondness for French skincare.

Jackie can be reached at JGenchi@LateralLink.com.

##J’lene Mortimer


[J’lene Mortimer](https://www.laterallink.com/team/jlene-mortimer/) practiced at several law firms including Jones Day, Quinn Emanuel, and McGuireWoods before joining Lateral Link. J’lene completed her undergraduate education at the University of California, Berkeley and received her law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law.

Originally from Los Angeles, California, J’lene now lives outside of Philadelphia with her husband, three sons, and chocolate Labrador.  When she is not working, J’lene is an avid recreational runner and a devoted hockey and lacrosse mom.  Although with the many geographic allegiances in her house, she is torn whether to root for the Flyers, the Capitals, or the Kings!

J’lene can be reached at JMortimer@LateralLink.com.

##Susan Agopian


[Susan Agopian](https://www.laterallink.com/team/susan-agopian/) specializes in partner representation in the lateral market in California. Born and raised in Bulgaria, Susan brings a unique and worldly perspective to her current position. She spent her formative years traveling through Europe with her mother, a prima ballerina, before making Los Angeles her permanent home in 1994 and allowing basketball to complement her lifelong love affair with soccer. Susan’s MA in Philosophy enabled her to turn down Virginia law school, instead spending the past decade mastering the headhunting profession. Susan manages to balance her work life with a wide range of culinary and bucket list items. An animal lover, she is a passionate supporter of the ASPCA and the Humane Society. She is also a movie buff, 70s music fan, car enthusiast, and an avid follower of Grand Prix motorcycle racing.

Susan can be reached at SAgopian@LateralLink.com.

##Naomi Kaplan


[Naomi Kaplan](https://www.laterallink.com/team/naomi-kaplan/) is a Director in the Los Angeles office focusing on document review solutions nationwide for law firms and corporations, as well as temporary attorney and support staff placements. Prior to joining Lateral Link, Naomi owned a legal recruiting firm and worked at The Walt Disney Company. Prior to recruiting, Naomi was a litigation associate with Manatt, Phelps & Phillips LLP.

Naomi holds a JD, cum laude, from Boston College Law School where she was Senior Articles Editor of The Third World Law Journal, and a BA in English, cum laude, from Boston University. Between college and law school, Naomi worked as a Litigation Paralegal at Skadden in Boston and then lived and worked in Benin, West Africa, with the Peace Corps for two years.

Naomi can be reached at NKaplan@LateralLink.com.

##Stephanie Ruiter 


[Stephanie Ruiter](https://www.laterallink.com/team/stephanie-ruiter/) moved to New York and joined Lateral Link as a Director after practicing as a litigator at two small D.C.-area firms. She finds the skills she used in helping her clients as an attorney transfer to her recruiting practice; both careers require truly listening to your clients to best understand the right strategy and approach to achieving their goals. The key to Stephanie’s success as a recruiter is to develop a relationship with clients that extends past their placement.

Stephanie attended the University of Delaware for undergrad and received her law degree from the University of Georgia. Stephanie currently resides in Brooklyn, New York, with her 3-year-old rescue lab, Trina the Diamond Princess. She loves to do the New York Times crossword puzzle and is hoping to one day compete in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. On weekends, you can catch her exploring the city or cheering on her beloved Dawgs.

Stephanie can be reached at SRuiter@LateralLink.com.

Reach out to our new team members today with any questions you might have about your next big career move.

We look forward to seeing Jaclyn, J’lene, Susan, Naomi, and Stephanie in Las Vegas for our annual company retreat in mid-October.

# Exploring AI's Role In Legal Drafting: Can AI End The Blank Page Curse?

If the letters actually made words, I’d be all set!

We’ve all been taunted by the blinking cursor. It mocks us from the blank page, its incessant repetition a ruthless reminder of our inability to put thoughts into words.

Whether you’re writing contracts, pleadings, legal briefs, or creative essays, a basic draft that captures the essence of your ideas is the only thing that can repudiate the dreaded blank page curse. 

You just need a starting point. And that is precisely what generative AI offers. 

When prompting a generative AI tool to produce a first draft, you can let ideas flow without judgment. The tool assists in creating an initial draft which you build up and hone into a masterpiece.

Let’s look at the benefits and challenges of using trained AI models to instantly generate contextually appropriate legal documents. You’ll see how using this technology can save you countless hours of work.

Use AI To Generate A Helpful First Draft Of Legal Documents

While you’ve been juggling multiple matters, researching legal issues, and meeting tight deadlines, generative AI has emerged as a powerful ally. Custom AI models have been trained on vast amounts of legal text and documents, using techniques like natural language processing and deep learning to duplicate legal language patterns, structures, and terminology. 

With [just a few prompts](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/4-tips-for-lawyers-to-master-the-art-of-productive-ai-conversations/), you can generate a first draft that captures the core elements of the legal document you need. The draft adheres to consistent language, style, and formatting conventions, reducing opportunities for errors and omissions. You can also base AI-generated documents on predefined templates and standardized clauses, helping ensure contracts and agreements use the most up-to-date language. 

Simply tell the AI tool what type of contract you need, and it generates it for you. Rather than wasting hours staring at a blank page or searching through unsuitable examples to copy and paste, you’re ready to refine your draft into a final document.  

Generative AI speeds up draft review and revision, too. Simply prompt the tool to include relevant details, clauses, and provisions and ask it to suggest commonly used clauses that meet your client’s specific needs and situation. Following your prompts, AI can unearth legal aspects you may have overlooked otherwise. 

Overcome Challenges Of Generating Legal Documents With AI

By using generative AI to generate legal documents, you provide personalized legal services efficiently and affordably. But as with most good things, a few challenges exist. These include:

Ensure High-Quality And Diverse Training Data

An AI model trained on a single data set has a narrow view. However, concerns around data privacy, security, and IP rights can make it challenging to access large, comprehensive legal text datasets. 

Industry stakeholders are working to overcome this hurdle, encouraging the creation of open legal data sets, developing data-sharing protocols, and creating new ways to access existing data. Vendors are also developing generative AI tools with publicly available legal data.  

Reveal The Mystery Of AI Black Boxes

Trust and transparency are critical in legal work. But AI “black boxes” make understanding the reasoning behind a model’s generated output difficult. Interdisciplinary teams with legal, technical, and ethical experts can help mitigate biases and ensure greater transparency. AI models must be designed with interpretability in mind. 

Understand Legal Language Nuances

Legal documents often contain intricate nuances, specialized terminologies, and context-specific requirements. Over time, continuous fine-tuning and input from legal professionals helps AI models increase their precision and expertise to better comprehend and generate legal language accurately. 

Manage Liability Risks

Any generative AI tool and its data must [comply with established rules](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/todays-responsible-ai-practices-help-legal-teams-meet-tomorrows-ai-regulations/) and stay current with regulatory changes. Implementing rigorous compliance checks and audits can help mitigate risks associated with potential breaches or inadequacies. After all, lawyers retain full responsibility for final documents. 

You still must ensure final documents are accurate and meet client needs. The difference now is how quickly and easily you get to the final version. Rather than anxiously contemplating every word before it hits the page, feeling your confidence wane with each cursor blink, AI liberates your creative freedom. AI offers speed, accuracy, and quality in an efficient and elegant process. Are you ready to turn the blank page from your foe into a canvas awaiting your brilliance?

# Biglaw Firms Are Holding Leverage Over Associates' Heads With Their In-Office Work Mandates
## The tables have turned, and power has shifted back to Biglaw firms.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Yes, some lawyers will leave those law firms that are increasingly mandating more time in the office. But as long as demand remains depressed, especially in transactional work and big deals, there’s less work to go around and the “war for bodies” is over, other elite firms will have leverage to make office attendance mandates.

— Christine Simmons of Law.com, writing in the latest [Barometer report](https://www.law.com/2023/07/20/four-days-in-office-reflects-big-laws-new-management-attitude/) that leverage is now back in the hands of Biglaw firms, with leaders attempting to reclaim their power through four-day in-office work mandates. “Whether management will keep this leverage,” she writes, “will depend on forces in the broader economy.”

# Lawyers Often Have Little Understanding Of Legal History
## Such a gap could make it more difficult for these attorneys to learn from the lessons of the past.

Versions of the expression that “those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it” have been attributed to Edmund Burke, Winston Churchill, and George Santayana. In any event, people who do not learn the lessons from the past might not understood how they can avoid similar mistakes in the future, and it is useful to learn history to have a solid foundation for making choices in the present. Legal history is likely not a required course in many — if any — law schools, but lawyers should know about the history of the legal profession so that they can avoid making bad choices.

I have always been a history buff. I got my master’s degree in American history during my senior year of college, and while in law school, I took a few legal history classes. One of the best resources of Above the Law is that it is a solid chronicle of recent legal history, and I regularly google recent legal history events and see ATL articles discussing them.

However, many lawyers might not know some recent events in the legal profession, which could make it more difficult for these attorneys to learn from the lessons of the past. A while ago, I was at a party, and I met a lawyer who was around the same age as I was but who had entered the legal profession much later in life. We were discussing large law firms and the conversation took us to law firms that no longer existed.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
At one point I mentioned the dearly departed Dewey LeBoeuf, and how I knew a bunch of lawyers who were impacted by the collapse of that firm. The lawyer confessed that he had never heard of Dewey LeBoeuf, likely because he had only entered the legal profession in the past few years. This was unfortunate, since many lessons can be learned from that episode, including how law firms should not grow too quickly or promise partners too much money, and how lawyers should not manipulate numbers to make it look like a law firm is operating better than it actually is.

Of course, I cannot really fault this lawyer for not knowing about an episode that occurred in the profession years because that person became an attorney. What happened to Dewey LeBoeuf definitely did not break into the mainstream news cycle, and legal news outlets were likely the only ones to cover this story heavily. However, this cautionary tale should be known by more lawyers as an example of what law firm leaders should not do so that they can avoid a similar blowup in the future.

As another example, I met a recent law student not too long ago, and we were talking about our experiences in law school more than a decade apart. I talked about how when I was in law school, the law students were forced to do book research in the law library even though all of the students were given free accounts to Lexis and Westlaw. This involved us using reporters and digests to look up cases, and double-checking summaries to ensure that authority was still good law.

This recent law school graduate did not need to do book research in school, which makes complete sense since almost no lawyers still consult reporters and books when writing legal papers. As we further talked, this recent graduate conveyed that he did not realize that legal citations were made to reporters that used to be printed and consulted in law libraries. Of course, this is not a big deal, but not learning about antecedent practices in the legal profession might make it more difficult to operate in the present in some circumstances.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I am not calling for law schools to mandate classes in legal history, and understanding the history of the legal profession might only provide marginal benefits to legal practitioners. However, more lawyers should know about the history of the legal profession so they have a foundation to respond to situations they face in the present.

If you look five or 10 years down the road, the people entering the profession appear to have significantly worse mental health. I don’t expect the need to address these issues to abate.

— Law firm mental health consultant [Patrick Krill](https://www.prkrill.com/patrick-r-krill), in comments given to Jenna Greene of [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/stressed-lonely-overworked-what-new-study-tells-us-about-lawyer-suicide-risk-2023-02-15/) on the need for law firms and legal employers to offer policies that will reduce lawyers’ stress and allow them to set meaningful work-life balance boundaries. Krill recently co-authored a study which found that highly stressed lawyers were 22 times more likely to [experience thoughts of suicide](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/lawyers-who-are-highly-stressed-are-22-times-more-likely-to-consider-suicide/).

(If you or someone you know is depressed and in need of help, please call the [Suicide & Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/) (988) or a [lawyer assistance program](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state.html) in your state. You can also get in touch with someone at the [Lawyers Depression Project](https://www.lawyersdepressionproject.org/). Remember that you are loved. Please reach out if you need help.)

# Banking On Design
## It is not surprising that at least some attempt to weaponize design patents would be undertaken by an ambitious patent owner.

Design patents are not usually at the root of aggressive patent enforcement campaigns. At best, they have been relegated to supporting roles in big-ticket patent litigation, perhaps most prominently in the Apple-Samsung case that I spoke about to my eldest son’s fourth-grade class way back when. (If you needed another reminder that time flies, he starts college in less than a month.) As some readers may recall, it was Apple’s design patents that led to a big chunk of the damages tentatively awarded before the worldwide patent dispute between Apple and Samsung settled. If anything, that long-running saga proved that design patents could be quite useful in certain types of patent litigation battles, particularly because of the broad, if uncertain, reach of 35 USC § 289, which requires an adjudged infringer to compensate the design patent holder “to the extent of his total profit” of the sale of an “article of manufacture” embodying a patented design.

Considering the general malaise of many a patent holder looking for litigation riches in this age of IPR and Alice, it is not surprising that at least some attempt to weaponize design patents would be undertaken by an ambitious patent owner. One entity in particular, WePay Global Payments LLC, has been quite active in terms of asserting a single design patent, US Pat. No. [D930702](https://patents.google.com/patent/USD930702S1/en?oq=U.S.+Patent+No.+D930%2c702), against a variety of large targets, including leading banks and smartphone manufacturers. Ten of the cases remain pending, including two IPRs that were filed this spring. In the most recent set of developments, two recent decisions on motions to dismiss were entered, one by Judge Albright in the WDTX, and the [other](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20220606639) by Judge Horan in the WDPA.

Both results are discussed in a recent IP Watchdog [article](https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2022/07/20/tale-two-motions-closer-look-motions-dismiss-design-patent-cases/id=150270/), which notes that WePay was successful in fending off one of the motions to dismiss, while losing on the other one. As pointed out by former [interviewee](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/3-questions-for-design-patent-guru-sarah-burstein/) and leading design patent expert, Sarah Burstein, the two decisions may have come down in different directions — but for good reason. In the WDTX case, the basis of the motion to dismiss was based on invalidity grounds, which are “less amenable to disposition on the pleadings.” Indeed, Albright himself found that a motion to dismiss on invalidity grounds was “not the proper vehicle to assess the Defendant’s arguments against the complaint.” The lesson for other design patent defendants is clear. Look for another path of attack, especially if you are trying to get the case dismissed with as much dispatch as possible.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And a more promising line of attack is available, particularly for defendants facing weaker claims of infringement, as demonstrated by Horan’s decision in the WePay case against PNC Bank. To start, it is established that in contrast to Albright’s comments on motions to dismiss based on invalidity, “courts may dismiss claims of design infringement on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion where, as a matter of law, no reasonable factfinder could find infringement.” In terms of evaluating infringement, courts are charged to apply the famous Egyptian Goddess “ordinary observer” test, which comprises a two-step comparison of the asserted (or patented) design and the accused design. In the WePay case, however, the court first took note of the fact that it was apparently a question of first impression presented, in that “the consumer has not voluntarily chosen the design at issue” when downloading and then using the allegedly infringing mobile app. As a result, Horan raised the prospect that a design patent infringement claim could not stand where “the Complaint does not allege a purchase or transaction by a consumer with regard to the Accused Design over the Asserted Design.” As Sarah Burstein, Professor of Law at Suffolk Law, notes in a [recap](https://patentlyo.com/patent/2022/06/animated-design-patents.html) of the decision on Patently-O, there is no requirement that a sale take place for design patent infringement to lie. Thankfully for the defendant, Horan also found other grounds for granting the motion to dismiss.

On top of noting the infirmity of the design patent infringement claim in the absence of a customer’s selection of the accused design, Horan also applied the Egyptian Goddess test in finding that the accused design differed from the asserted design, such that “[a]ny similarity between the two designs is limited to basic geometric shapes, but with notable differences in shape size and spacing such that no ordinary observer would mistake the Accused Design with the Asserted Design or vice versa.” And because the side-by-side comparison was so definitively not in the patentee’s favor, there was no reason to continue the case, leading to dismissal. Unsurprisingly, the patentee lodged an appeal to the Federal Circuit, which should be an interesting case to track for design patent aficionados.

Ultimately, the WePay cases illustrate the importance of picking the right infringement highway off-ramp when attempting to get a case dismissed quickly. Just as an Alice motion can be much more promising than a noninfringement or prior-art based motion to dismiss in the utility patent context, so too noninfringement-based motions to dismiss in the design patent context may be preferable in certain scenarios over motions brought on other grounds. In fact, irrespective of how the WePay appeal goes, it likely makes sense for design patent defendants to ask their assigned judge to conduct an ordinary observer test at the motion to dismiss stage. If successful, the case is derailed before it can generate too much cost or disruption. And if unsuccessful, it is better to know sooner rather than later in a case whether you have an uphill battle on infringement. At this point, there is little to indicate that there is a raft of other patent holders looking to follow WePay’s lead into the volume patent assertion business. Still, it is important for defendants to consider whether a noninfringement motion to dismiss is their ticket out of a design patent mess. Because even without volume plaintiffs, there will surely be other patent holders in the future looking to make bank on the strength of their design patents.

# Why Aren't More Women Being Promoted To Partner In Law Firms?
## We desperately need to solve this ""law firm math problem.""

Most U.S. law firms have a math problem. According to the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL), women comprise only 18 percent of law firm equity partnerships, and the typical law firm has only 22 percent women on their highest U.S.-based governance committee. At the same time, according to the American Bar Association, women represent more than 47 percent of J.D.s awarded and roughly the same percentage of associates in law firms.

So, here’s the math problem: if nearly half of the partner candidate pools for law firms are comprised of women, but less than 20 percent of their equity partners are women, are they choosing the best candidates for partner? The answer: statistically, probably not.

— [Bryan L. Olson](http://www.klgates.com/bryan-l-olson/), Chief Human Resources Officer of [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/), commenting on the “law firm math problem” in an op-ed published at [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/perspective-men-and-the-law-firm-math-problem/). To solve this problem, Olson suggests that male leaders must be made aware of their implicit bias, and then must sponsor women lawyers at their firm in an effort to improve gender equality.

Even to the casual legal observer, it’s well-known that immigration law is complex and packed with unique challenges.

It’s not uncommon to hear the system described as “Kafkaesque” or see it compared to Alice in Wonderland, a place where everything seems upside down.

The pay-off, of course, is helping people and changing their lives.

In this white paper, our friends at Embroker explore some of the biggest challenges you can expect to face when practicing immigration law.

Download it to get a lay of the land and know what to expect before exploring this field.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Litigation Boutiques Are Making Moves To The $180K Scale
## The Cravath scale -- it's not just for Biglaw.

The Cravath scale — it’s not just for Biglaw. The very first firm to make the move to the newly established $180,000 pay scale was a California boutique, [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/), so we really shouldn’t be surprised that yet another boutique is matching. There should be no more doubt, the new pay scale is for all the power players, regardless of the number of lawyers at the firm.

[Greenberg Gross](http://ggtriallaw.com/) bills themselves as the firm to turn to for high-stakes business cases and they are showing that they’re a player, matching the Cravath scale. The raise is effective June 26 (compared to the industry standard July 1), so they’re getting a few more days of big cash. Sure, the email only lists class salaries up to the class of 2010, although maybe that’s more related to the size of the firm, than some sort of malice towards senior associates.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Folks at the firm are happy with the bump, and, according to our tipster, the pressure of competitors ([Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/) and [Irell](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-west-coast-firm-adopts-the-180k-salary-structure/) moving to the Cravath scale) raising compensation is a big part of them making the move:

Not too surprising given GG includes several former Irell alums and tries to align itself with Hueston Hennigan. But nonetheless a very well appreciated gesture.

Let’s take a tip from name partner Alan Greenberg and raise a toast to the associates at the Greenberg Gross firm. They are celebrating today.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# So You Want To Build A Well-Being CLE Program? 10 Tips For Accreditation
## Offering CLE credit is an excellent incentive for overscheduled, overstressed attorneys to attend well-being programs — but it can be tricky to get these programs accredited.

Given the importance of well-being to the productivity and success of attorneys and the firms they work for, it’s no wonder that Biglaw is increasingly keen on offering programs focused on well-being. But how do you get overscheduled, overstressed attorneys to make time to attend?

While the benefits of a well-being program speak for themselves, offering CLE credit can be an excellent incentive for attendance. Professional development teams must tread carefully, however: it can be tricky to get well-being programs accredited. Here are 10 tips to consider as you develop yours:

- Ensure that your learning objectives support attorney well-being. Keep in mind that well-being CLE programs must clearly be about attorney well-being or well-being in the legal profession. Program content can’t be about general (or client) well-being.
- Focus on awareness and recognition of substance abuse or other well-being issues that impair an attorney’s ability to perform legal services with competence — and be sure to address the consequences of attorney mental health issues. Your examples should relate specifically to law firms, the practice of law, and attorneys.
- Well-being, mental health, and substance abuse awareness topics qualify for professional responsibility credit in many states. For accreditation purposes, tie your discussions to rules of professional conduct, raising issues that may implicate attorneys’ potential ethical obligations.
- Reference the ABA’s [National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being](https://lawyerwellbeing.net/). The Task Force’s 2017 report identifies lawyer well-being as “a continual process of seeking to thrive in each dimension of one’s life: Emotional, Occupational, Intellectual, Spiritual, Physical, and Social.” On its website, you can find definitions of these dimensions as well as resources and recommendations.
- Review the benefits of well-being programs. Discuss where and how to find available help (such as [Lawyer Assistance Programs](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state/) (LAP)), treatment options, and the benefits, success stories, and examples of addressing well-being challenges. Discuss metrics and best practices to measure the effectiveness of well-being programs, and how to incentivize attorneys and professional staff to attend these programs. (Hint: Credit is a great incentive!)
- While practicing mindfulness is always recommended, be aware that participants shouldn’t be asked to meditate or perform other treatments or exercises during the accredited portion of your program. States will not approve meditation sessions; some, like [California](http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/MCLE-CLE/MCLE-Providers/Qualifying-Activities), explicitly disqualify it.
- On that note, make your program more about the topic of well-being, not the treatment of attorneys’ issues. Instructors aren’t qualified to dispense treatment, and CLE regulators aren’t in the position to evaluate it.
- Make sure all your program materials also support attorney well-being. Regulators frequently ask to see the materials for these programs.
- Of course, you should always read your state’s CLE rules — regulators will take different stances on well-being programs. Look to other well-being programs that have been approved for examples.
- Still not sure? Call your state’s regulators and ask for guidance!

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 01.05.17
## * Both Lady Gaga and Katy Perry have now been dragged into the legal battle between Kesha and producer Dr. Luke that's been ongoing since October 2014. During a recent discovery hearing, a judge ruled that Dr. Luke may show Perry a text message sent from Kesha to Gaga that had previously been sealed by the court. The contents of the mysterious message are currently unknown to the public. [[Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4087740/Lady-Gaga-Katy-Perry-dragged-Kesha-s-sex-assault-case-court-orders-Tic-Tok-singer-Dr-Luke-intriguing-secret-text-sent-Gaga-share-Perry.html)] * Oopsie! U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts is recusing himself from the Life Technologies v. Promega patent case that was heard on December 6. As it turns out, Roberts owns $175,000 of stock in Thermo Fisher Scientific -- which owns Life Technologies -- but his chambers ""inadvertently failed to find this potential conflict."" Thanks to the error, only seven of the high court's eight justices will render a decision in the case. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL1N1EU1TB?il=0)] * Democratic leaders of the California Legislature have hired former AG Eric Holder, now a partner at Covington & Burling, to represent them in any legal fights against Donald Trump's Republican White House administration. Having Holder on their side will cost a pretty penny, but ""[t]he cost will be very minimal compared to the billions of dollars at stake if California doesn’t adequately make its case."" [[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/us/california-eric-holder-donald-trump.html)] * Uh-oh... The European and Middle Eastern arm of King & Wood Mallesons has stopped paying its staff members ahead of its forthcoming administration. The number of staff who have been placed on unpaid leave pending expected layoffs is around 100 at the moment. They were notified earlier this week that while they're still technically employed by the firm, they won't receive pay checks. Happy New Year! [[Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/01/04/kwm-stops-paying-100-european-staff-as-administration-looms/)] * ""Their malfeasance has made it to where we can't get federal loans anymore, but they still want us to pay full price and give them that same amount and pretend like they didn't do anything wrong - like it was our fault."" Charlotte Law students aren't too keen about taking out private loans to complete their degrees at Florida Coastal Law, and in fact, they'd like to see the school president and dean loss their jobs.

# Beach Balls, Confidentiality, And Privilege: What Lawyers Need To Know To Build Trust With Clients
## Understanding the fundamentals of privacy, confidentiality, and privilege in your work with clients can help build trust, strengthen your relationships, and improve your advocacy.

On October 5, Practising Law Institute will host [Building Trust: Client Confidentiality and Attorney Privilege](https://bit.ly/34gfJSV), a live, interactive webcast featuring a new interface with advanced learning and engagement tools. Program Speaker [Alicia Aiken](https://bit.ly/2GsqeKg), Director of the Danu Center’s Confidentiality Institute and a Principal at the Danu Center for Strategic Advocacy, explains why attorneys will benefit from this one-of-a-kind program.

What is the program about and who is it for?

Building Trust is about getting back to the fundamentals — in a way that we didn’t all get in law school. We haven’t always done a great job in training lawyers on these basics: How do we think about information when we work with clients? How do we think about who owns it, who controls it, and who decides when we use it or when we don’t? The idea is to go back to the fundamentals of privacy, confidentiality, and privilege, to pull those three strands apart, and understand how we use them to improve the client relationship and get a better outcome.

This program is focused on the individual client-lawyer relationship, not on the issues that arise when representing a corporation. That said, there is nothing different about representing an individual on an eviction or on buying a $4 million home. Either way, you’re working with a person, making them promises and building a relationship.

What are some misconceptions attorneys have about these issues?

One of the pitfalls is confusing confidentiality and privilege. Confidentiality is a pretty broad requirement that prevents a lawyer from voluntarily sharing most of what an attorney and a client talk about when they work together. Privilege says neither the attorney nor the client can be forced to share something in court — a narrower rule. Many lawyers tend to conflate the two. This affects how we work with our clients in a really practical way.

Can you tell us about your beach ball analogy?

Think about an empty beach ball — as a lawyer, you’re handing it to your client and saying, “Tell me things that would help me to represent you.” In sharing with you, they’re choosing how much to blow up, when to put a cap on it and hand it to you; your duty is to protect it. Think about how easy it is to lose track of a beach ball; if you’re careless, it’s out in the ocean in no time. That’s the client’s privacy.

With confidentiality, you’re going to protect the beach ball, and you’ll talk with the client before you decide to let any air out. Once you let the air out, it’s gone — you can’t get that control back.

Privilege is if somebody official like a police officer or a judge comes along and tries to take the ball away. You and the client get to say no; you can’t be punished. But if the client says, “actually, give them the ball,” you would hand it over, because the privilege doesn’t belong to the lawyer — even if the lawyer thinks handing it over is a terrible idea. These are important elements of your relationship with the client from the beginning.

What are the consequences of not knowing how to handle client information?

If your clients don’t trust you, they’re not going to tell you things. In the most extreme example, from my experience of working with domestic violence survivors, I know this can have tragic consequences. These are clients who have experienced the most extraordinary breach of trust in their most intimate relationships. They are endangered often because somebody who knows them incredibly well is trying to hurt them, and now they just don’t trust – and they may have good reason not to. As a lawyer, if I don’t communicate the principles of privacy and confidentiality correctly, a client can end up feeling betrayed by the way in which I manage their information, even when I’m technically following the ethical rules.

When clients feel they’ve been treated like people with value, they’re more likely to be satisfied with the outcome of their work with you, whether they win or lose their issue.

Are there other reasons attorneys should take this program?

We all know that Ethics credits can be a challenge. This is the least boring Ethics credit you can get during the pandemic – or any time, really! PLI has done a great job, even before we all went remote, of adapting its content online, with interactive features like quizzes and real-time Q&As. Plus there are cartoons! I think this program effectively mixes the law and the theory of privacy with practical, actionable things you can do in your practice – the afternoon after you take the course.

# The Biglaw Firms Where Lawyers Did The Most Pro Bono Work (2018)
## Which law firms were the best at giving back?

Over the course of the last year, members of the legal profession have sprung into action to deal with crisis after crisis after crisis, offering their services without cost to those in need. From travel bans to natural disasters to border family separations, lawyers in America were inspired to do their very best to help those who needed their assistance the very most.

But which law firms were able to contribute the most to society?

The American Lawyer has compiled a ranking of Am Law 200 firms based on their pro bono work in 2017. Half of their scores come from the average number of pro bono hours per lawyer, while the other half represents the percentage of lawyers who performed more than 20 hours of pro bono work.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Here are the top 10 firms when it came to pro bono emergencies in 2017:

- Jenner & Block
- Covington & Burling
- Orrick
- Patterson Belknap
- Hughes Hubbard
- Gibson Dunn
- Buckley Sander
- Dechert
- Ropes & Gray
- Paul Hastings
It should be noted that at each firm listed, the average attorney performed about 100 hours or more of pro bono work last year, and the Am Law 200 as a whole contributed more than 5 million hours of pro bono work. Congratulations!

It’s a dreary Friday for most of the East Coast, and to boot it’s the day before a long weekend. If you can’t manage to sneak out of the office early, at the very least we can get some jollies from [our favorite legally themed Instagram account](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/an-instagram-must-for-attorneys/), @[attorneyproblems](https://www.instagram.com/attorneyproblems/).

Whether you’re interested in looking back on the tribulations of law school, worrying over student loans, regretting your life choices, or have annoying clients to deal with, this IG feed has it all. So, sit back and scroll through the memes. You can always bill the time to reading industry publications.

According to data collected for the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, what Am Law 100 firm saw the largest drop in profits per partner in 2017?

Delay spelled D…L…A… in this case. Look, we’ve done the “paid the piper”-themed jokes to death.

DLA Piper, Am Law’s number 3 with $3,685,205,000 in revenue last year, just sent out a memo to U.S. associates informing them that the firm would be matching the market

The firm is raising salaries effective January 1, with payments reflected in the January 26th paycheck.

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$225K
Class of 2022	$235K
Class of 2021	$260K
Class of 2020	$310K
Class of 2019	$365K
Class of 2018	$390K
Class of 2017	$420K
Class of 2016+	$435K
As for bonuses, the firm has a whole set of policies for eligibility — including a timekeeping requirement coming in for 2024 — but it boils down to this:

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$15K (pro-rated)
Class of 2022	$20K
Class of 2021	$30K
Class of 2020	$57.5K
Class of 2019	$75K
Class of 2018	$90K
Class of 2017	$105K
Class of 2016+	$115K
Higher bonuses available based on billing and performance rating, with the memo indicating some associates will be getting 50 percent or more based on hours. Associates will be notified of their personal bonus separately.

Congrats.

# Credit Suisse Reportedly Dumps Biglaw Firm Over A Lost Briefcase, Firewalls, And Conflicts
## Credit Suisse has reportedly blacklisted Allen & Overy.

Credit Suisse is taking a break from its longtime outside counsel at Allen & Overy. Apparently, Credit Suisse General Counsel Romeo Cerutti has “personally” decided to limit the work it gives A&O — the bank will reportedly stop giving the firm new work, though existing engagements will persist. So… what’s up?

According to tipsters and[ reports](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-credit-suisse-blacklisted-allen-overy-after-associate-left-briefcase-train), there are a number of factors are in play, with one tipster telling ATL that it involves — at least in part — an A&O attorney “losing a mysterious briefcase with, it is said, highly confidential Credit Suisse documents on a train in Finland.” And while these data breach concerns (though the briefcase is said to have been recovered) played a role in the souring relations, there is more brewing under the surface. That [appears](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2021/11/19/credit-suisse-to-impose-sanctions-on-allen-overy-over-conflict-data-breach-concerns/) to include A&O’s representation of the failed financial firm Greensill Capital.

CS has taken a bath on its involvement with Greensill, and, [as reported by ](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-credit-suisse-blacklisted-allen-overy-after-associate-left-briefcase-train)Roll on Friday, that had Cerutti taking a hard look at A&O’s representation of both Greensill and Credit Suisse:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Credit Suisse ran a group of investment funds with Greensill worth $10 billion, and since its collapse the bank has been seeking to recover a shortfall of $2.3 billion to repay investors.

Heads have rolled at Credit Suisse over the Greensill fiasco and a $5.5 billion loss incurred when Archegos, a US hedge fund backed by the bank, disintegrated. Swiss regulators have opened a probe into its activities after the two failures.

Cerutti and his team are understood to have been unhappy that A&O worked on both sides of the Greensill matter, and began identifying perceived issues with the firm’s work, including alleged data leaks across the Chinese Wall between A&O’s Credit Suisse and Greensill teams, and the Finnish Train Incident.

Folks have OPINIONS on the move — as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2021/11/25/hypocritical-and-harsh-market-reacts-to-the-ao-credit-suisse-fall-out-292-101895/) Law.com, some have called it “harsh,” “unfair,” and “outstanding” (not in a good way), with at least one general counsel calling out the move as “hypocritical”:

As a result, one GC at an industrials group feels its decision to impose sanctions on A&O is “hypocritical”, in light of the bank’s own reputational hits.

He added: “Credit Suisse has had a shocking few years and it’s helpful if they can point elsewhere. It all feels very hypocritical, and [taking issue] over Greensill seems very much like the pot calling the kettle black.”

While others disagreed:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“There’s nothing hypocritical about it. Just because you have standards to hold your external firms to, it doesn’t mean you’re perfect,” [another GC] said.

That GC welcomed more accountability and similar measures being taken by institutions, adding: “Accountability is refreshing and important. My view is there is not enough of this.”

Not that disengaging from A&O will be easy for the bank.

Credit Suisse may also find it difficult to untangle itself from A&O given it has used the firm for many years. The industrials group GC said it may be easier for Credit Suisse to simply keep A&O as an adviser due to it having an “awful lot of knowhow and knowledge” on the bank. This type of relationship with incumbent law firms is “very, very hard to unwind”, the GC added, as well as expensive.

“If it will cost you much more money to move to another firm, then it becomes hard to do. It can lead to a difficult conversation with your CFO further down the track.”

The London-based senior finance partner echoes this, saying that while Credit Suisse can “manage without A&O”, it’s more a question of “how quickly Credit Suisse can instill the same corporate memory [to another firm]”.

A&O’s work for Credit Suisse is reportedly in the £25 million a year range, so that’s a big chunk of change over a lost briefcase (and conflicts, don’t forget those).

It’s a much larger investment than just adding another 25,000 square feet in New York. New York remains the most important legal market in the U.S., and the U.S. remains the most important legal market in the world.

— [Gary Wingens](https://www.lowenstein.com/people/attorneys/gary-wingens), chair and managing partner of Lowenstein Sandler, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/lowenstein-bets-nycs-in-person-future-with-expanded-office-lease-2021-09-27/) on the firm’s decision to expand its New York City office space to 125,000 square feet and renovate its existing space. “[It’s] highly unlikely we’re going back to the style of work and frequency of in-office work we had before the pandemic,” Wingens noted. That said, Lowenstein plans to [“completely reimagine”](https://www.lowenstein.com/news-insights/firm-news/lowenstein-sandler-doubles-down-on-commitment-to-new-york-city) its office space to include single-size offices as well as collaborate workspaces, plus “a new restaurant-style eating space, as well as expanded fitness, health and wellness facilities.” The firm has “indefinitely delayed” its return-to-office plans, previously set for September 6 and October 4, due to the Delta variant.

# Cravath Sows Seeds Of Discontent With New Vacation Policy
## Cravath spoils the dream of a post-corona vacation.

The latest spike in coronavirus cases is upon us, casting doubt on holiday travel plans around the country. That is, of course, deeply worrying, but the reality of it has been tempered by some recent good COVID news. I’m talking about the latest from Pfizer who announced their vaccine has a [90 percent efficacy rate](https://medcitynews.com/2020/11/with-90-efficacy-against-covid-19-pfizer-biontechs-vaccine-jumps-ahead-in-global-race/) and could be approved before the end of this forsaken year.

Experts are cautioning that even with a vaccine it’ll be a while until we “get back to normal.” But still, between the soon-to-be approved vaccine and a president-elect that believes in science, normal — finally — seems attainable. Part of that normalcy that people are craving is travel and good old-fashioned vacations. Pretty much all of those got cancelled in 2020, but maybe — just maybe — in 2021 we can all dust off our passports, or hit the open road or do whatever it is you like to get away from the house you’ve spent quarantine hiding out in.

Unfortunately, Cravath just made the dream of a long, overdue vacation that much more difficult.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The Biglaw firm recently announced some changes to their vacation and sick time policy. Associates still get four weeks of vacation time, but the amount of carryover days allowed from one year to the next has been cut in half, from 10 down to 5. Given the dearth of vacation opportunities in 2020, lots of folks were probably planning on banking those days. Plus they’ve changed how those days are accounted for — now any carryover days will be counted as being used last, when they’d previously been the first days associates used.

As you might imagine, according to tipsters, people at the firm are pissed off at the changes:

To do this during a pandemic when people can’t actually go on vacation has a lot of people pissed off. To add insult to injury they also changed the policy to use those days last instead of first so it makes it harder to carry over days two years in a row. There’s no reason that should be the case and they’ve given zero rationale for it.

Now, it’s true that Biglaw associates often leave vacation days on the table ([if a firm even has a formal limit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/another-firm-offers-unlimited-vacation-for-associates/)) given the “billable hours above all else” mentality the permeates the industry. And, yes, four weeks is a nice chunk of vacation time even if there’s no ability to bank vacation days. So, in practice, very little may actually be different for associates. But a change to the vacation policy now, when vacations are the dream of most of the country, just feels like kicking somewhen when they’re down.

# Mergers And Office Openings: UK Firms Seek Growth In The US
## UK 'Magic Circle' law firms are increasingly looking to the US for growth, as evidenced by the proposed merger of Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling and the expansion of Clifford Chance into Houston.

When Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling [announced](https://www.announcingaoss.com) last month their agreement to merge, it was big news on many fronts. Purely on its own terms, the prospect of a combined transatlantic firm with nearly 4000 attorneys was notable. The fact that Shearman had finally found a merger partner, after extensive talks with Hogan Lovells [fell through](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/hogan-lovells-shearman-sterling-abandon-merger-talks-2023-03-03/) in March, was another interesting angle.

But the merger is also reflective of another emerging trend: the “Magic Circle” UK firms are increasingly [looking to the US](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/uk-law-firms-fight-us-invasion-by-merging-raiding-rivals) for growth.

Accelerating expansion efforts

Magic Circle firms have had a presence in New York for many decades, and several have been active in other US cities, especially Washington DC. But in recent years, the scope of the top UK firms’ ambition in the US market has come into clearer focus. Freshfields’ entry into California in late 2020 was a notable moment, marking the first West Coast Magic Circle venture since 2007, when Clifford Chance called it quits in California after five years. Allen & Overy quickly followed Freshfields, opening in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Silicon Valley. A&O now has six US offices, with a presence in New York, DC, and Boston in addition to its West Coast push. Like its Magic Circle competitors, A&O’s tendency has been to enter US markets modestly, relying on smaller scale hires of individuals and groups. 

The merger with Shearman is a significantly more ambitious play. Not since 2000, when Clifford Chance combined with Rogers & Wells, has a major UK firm merged with a US counterpart. Rogers & Wells had 400 lawyers at its peak. Shearman is more than double that size.

Less splashy than A&O’s announcement, but also important, is the news this month that Clifford Chance has opened an office in Houston, anchored by hires from Latham & Watkins, Jones Day and Kirkland & Ellis. This is the first time a Magic Circle firm has set up shop in Texas and is a particularly notable choice considering that Clifford Chance’s recent US presence has been limited to New York and DC. Following the completion of the Shearman merger, A&O will also be present in Texas (Houston, Dallas, Austin). The Magic Circle’s arrival will intensify the battle for top talent in a Texas market still adapting to an influx of major US firms. Firms that have recently set up shop in Texas include O’Melveny & Myers, Morrison & Foerster, and McDermott Will & Emery.

“We’ve had a parade of office openings in recent years, and the competition for talent is more intense than I’ve ever seen,” says [Wendy Boone Jaikaran](https://laterallink.com/team/wendy-boone/), a Houston-based Lateral Link Senior Principal. “It’s a particular challenge for the Texas-headquartered national firms, which are fighting hard to defend their home turf against deep-pocketed and highly motivated new arrivals. The entry of the Magic Circle firms will escalate that challenge even further.”

Mergers are on the upswing

Some observers are [predicting](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2023/05/28/ao-shearman-is-just-the-first-domino-in-the-merger-rally/) that the A&O-Shearman combination will inspire a wave of large-scale mergers in the industry. That remains to be seen, but at a minimum, we can say that merger activity is on the upswing. Consider, for example, the Chicago market, which has seen a steady stream of recent mergers. Among larger firms, the most prominent example is Chicago-based Schiff Hardin’s combination last year with D.C.-based Arent Fox. But activity has also been robust among midsize firms. In particular, there is a trend of large Am Law 200 firms entering the Chicago market through mergers with top-ranked midsize or regional firms. A prime example is Atlanta-based Smith, Gambrell & Russell’s combination with Chicago-headquartered Freeborn & Peters to form a global Am Law 150 law firm.

“Existing Chicago midsize firms offer Am Law 200 law firms seeking to expand into Chicago the stability of deep sophisticated complementary practice groups and institutional Chicago clients,” observes [Jesse Hyde](https://laterallink.com/team/jesse-hyde/), a Lateral Link Managing Director based in Chicago. “Midsize and regional firms also provide the ability to service Am Law 200 firms’ existing clients with transactional and litigation outside counsel needs in Chicago. Likewise, Am Law 200 firms can benefit local Chicago midsize and regional firms by expanding the firm’s national or international reach and capabilities. So it would not surprise me to see more of these mergers in the near future.”

# Key Issues In International Taxation For 2022

Today’s business environment transcends borders. Companies are continuing to expand around the globe, increasingly operating in [emerging markets](https://www.pli.edu/programs/doing-business-in-and-with-emerging-markets?t=live).

As businesses ramp up their global activities, transactions and investment activities will increasingly trigger international tax issues. That means that companies that deal in global markets, as well as the attorneys who advise them, will need a firm understanding of the U.S. international tax rules. The 2017 Tax Act, in particular, is critically important to tax and corporate professionals in all sectors.

PLI is offering an intensive, two-day program, [Basics of International Taxation 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/basics-of-international-taxation?t=live&p=332717&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), both online and live in New York and San Francisco, at which international tax experts will address specific types of outbound and inbound investment and activities, how the new U.S. tax rules address them, and what the corresponding U.S. tax consequences are. 

The panels will give special emphasis to how the U.S. tax rules impact financings, mergers, acquisitions, and other commercial activities. Other important topics to be covered include:

- How to distinguish between situations where a U.S. investor should structure a foreign corporation to operate directly, and those where they should form a separate entity, under the new requirements of the 2017 Tax Act
- How to identify the types of expenses that can be allocated to gross income
- How to apply foreign tax credit baskets to the foreign income of U.S. shareholders in a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”)
- How to recognize the impact of the sale of CFC stock on the repatriation of earnings of a foreign corporation
- How to identify foreign corporations whose U.S. owners are not subject to U.S. tax until a dividend
This program will benefit all professionals in corporations, law firms, and accounting firms who deal with cross-border transactions. Attendees will leave with a working knowledge of relevant U.S. international tax rules. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/basics-of-international-taxation?t=live&p=332717&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

We are frequently asked whether an Asian woman candidate is tough enough.

—- [Victoria Reese](http://www.heidrick.com/Where-We-Work/Consultants/Reese_Victoria_10832), managing partner at the [Heidrick & Struggles](http://www.heidrick.com/) search firm, [commenting on the bias](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/03/14/where-are-the-asian-american-partners/) that Asian Americans, and particularly women, receive in the industry. Recent employment numbers reveal Asian Americans have one of the lowest conversion rates from associate to partner, and they leave Biglaw at the highest rates.

# Combating Law Firm-Related Stress
## Steps every firm and individual should take to improve work-life balance.

It is true that some amount of stress is endemic to being a lawyer. We’re conditioned for it from law school through the bar exam — this is part of your life now. However, after a series of high-profile Biglaw lawyer deaths that were attributed at least in part to stress, it seems reasonable to expect that firms are going to turn more of their attention to this problem. Last year, a candidate with whom I was working committed suicide. She had left her job because of stress before we ever connected and was trying to get back into Biglaw with a few-month gap on her résumé. Firms were largely balking. On a Friday, she emailed me to apply to a whole raft of firms, which I did.  She took her life over the weekend. While suicide is obviously multifactorial, the strain from her previous job and the lack of success she was having reinvigorating her career surely played a part.

What can firms do?

Flexible working

I personally love the occasional work-from-home day. I am just as efficient from my home office as I am from the Major, Lindsey & Africa office in downtown San Francisco. On days when something is bothering me, I really appreciate that I can stay home in my sweats and not have too much interaction with the outside world. If an associate is getting his/her work done and is not brand new and acculturating to the team, he/she should be able to work from wherever suits at least a day a week.

Reasonable expectations

I recently helped an associate move firms. For her first few weeks, on Fridays, she was telling her new partners what her weekend plans were. The partner eventually reached out to me and asked me why this was happening. I told him that this was 100 percent the expectation at her last job and that she honestly thought she had to give him the rundown before leaving (late on Friday night) for the “weekend.” Sure, there are occasional fire-drills in every practice, but you should not have to check in at work about the fact that you’re going to a movie on Saturday night. You don’t work 9-5, but equally it’s not reasonable to be on call 24/7.

Resources

Firms can provide invaluable, low-cost resources for their associates that can make a world of difference. An on-site gym is a massive value-add and doesn’t have to be fancy to be effective. I work out every afternoon just after lunch, and I find that the difference between my morning and afternoon stress levels is palpable. A firm that builds in an easy way for its associates to get some exercise during the workday will find that it pays dividends. Some other small resources that can go a long way are dry cleaning pick-up and delivery (offered at a few elite San Francisco firms) and healthy, plentiful snacks.

Staffing managers

These people are so important to the emotional health of associates. Partners could in theory have full visibility into an associates’ usage, but in practice, they simply send new projects to the person they want to work with. Firms would be well-advised to uniformly adopt the model of staffing managers (ideally not partners in the office/on the same team) who can portion out work and make sure that Associate A is not getting absolutely slammed month after month. He/she may not be the one to wave the white flag, so it’s on the firm to track this — and act on it.

What can you as an individual do?

Mentors

Our recent millennial survey showed that young associates on the whole prefer more informal mentoring programs to those written in stone, but all the same, having someone you can talk to in the partnership is incredibly important. To the extent you prefer and/or your firm primarily encourages informal mentorship, seek this person out early and often. They don’t need to be in your practice group, though ideally they are in your office. Take them out to tea and get to know them. Having an authority figure who can also serve as an outlet and a gladiator can mean everything. One of my candidates had to take a leave of absence due to stress and having a partner she could speak to about it made all of the difference.

Set limits

Say it with me: it’s okay to say no. I know that it doesn’t feel okay, but it is. If you’re at full capacity and can’t take something else on, be clear and direct and say no. Point to objective metrics (hours billed/utilization) and say you look forward to working with the partner on the next case/transaction.

Take advantage of the resources offered

It’s really easy to just live in the routine you’ve created (get to work at 8, eat the same sad salad at your desk, work until 10), but if you’re beyond stressed out, now is the time to deviate. Take a walk. Use the office gym. Most Am Law 100 firms are offering you a chance here and there at stress reduction. Take it!

Most of all, if you’re suffering, please seek the help of a licensed mental health provider. I know, you think you don’t have time. Make time. Nothing is more important than being well.

Is your firm lagging on technology adoption in a way that drags on profitability?

Has it effectively brought on solutions that make you more efficient in document management?

Has new technology revolutionized other aspects of your workflow?

Along with our friends at Wolters Kluwer, [we are exploring](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0p6pntUFtuUpicu) just how the legal industry’s technology adoption is affecting law firms’ daily operations. 

If you work at a midsize or large law firm, please take this brief, completely confidential survey — and catch a glimpse of the sector’s key tech-adoption areas.

# It Takes Two To Tango, And DLA Piper Just Danced Away With A Fleet Of Attorneys
## After a loss like this... Dentons is still huge.

Laterals are like small-scale acquisitions. One person over here, a person over there, a bit of paperwork and a conflict check — routine stuff. But every now and again, laterals are an exceptional part of doing business. This is one of those times. From The Recorder:

DLA Piper has completed the hiring of a more than 50-person intellectual property team from Dentons on the West Coast, with six partners, along with 24 other lawyers, six agents and technical advisers and 15 professional staff.

The group is led by partner Peter Yim, along with partners Christopher Eide, Brian Ho, Randy Omid, Michael Swett and Parker Kuhl, who joined the firm in the last few weeks. The overall team is primarily based in DLA’s San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Seattle offices.

Much of the team has been together for more than a decade, focused on serving a Fortune 5 software company client on patent strategy and procurement. The group also brings extensive experience in patent litigation and support and analysis for various corporate transactions.

Now that’s a big group lateral hire! Getting to work at a new firm can be rough, but I’m sure having a dream team of folks you’ve been billing with for a decade will help ease the growing pains. It is nice to read a feel good story about a group of Biglaw lawyers who actually enjoy working with each other. I’d take this story over a partner calling me a “[f**king piece of sh*t worthless human](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/biglaw-partner-benchslap-taylor-english/)” any day.

# Former Client Sues Biglaw Firm Over $213 Million Judgment
## Is this just sour grapes?

When you have a client that is ordered to pay a $213 million judgment and all the appeals have run out, well, you’re going to have an unhappy client. And while malpractice lawsuits are a reality for any law firm, most clients that get a bad result are sophisticated enough to understand the risks inherent in litigation, and not sue their own attorneys when they lose.

Unfortunately for Biglaw giant Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, that is not what happened with their billionaire client Ira Rennert and his company, Renco Group Inc. Rennert and Renco were assessed liable for $117 million in damages for diverting money from Magnesium Corp. of America to build a mansion in the Hamptons. A trustee for MagCorp, which has since declared bankruptcy, argued massive environmental claims against the company were already piling up when the money was redirected to Rennert’s real estate project.

The $117 million verdict became the eye-popping $213 million when the judge ordered 14 years worth of interest to be paid on the award. After an appeals court upheld the judgment and the Supreme Court declined to review it, there was little left to do but sue the lawyers for “careless and negligent errors.” As [Big Law Business reports](https://biglawbusiness.com/billionaire-rennert-wants-arnold-porter-kaye-scholer-to-pay-213-million-judgment/), Rennert isn’t happy with having to pay $213 million — who would be? — and he places the blame squarely with the attorneys:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In a lawsuit filed Monday in state court in Manhattan, Renco blamed the law firm, Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, for mistakes that led to the verdict. The company said the firm failed to push for proper jury instructions and questions on the verdict form that would have resulted in a different outcome.

Which, while this litigation is very much in its earliest stages, seems to have the odor of sour grapes. Hopefully more details will emerge as the litigation unfolds. A&P hasn’t yet commented on the case.

Biglaw firms don’t always (or often) use contingency fees — but when they do, the results can be amazing.

Yesterday we brought you word of a [$210 million contingency fee award](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/good-news-out-of-the-kl-gates/) that should do wonders for the 2016 profits of [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/). Today we can report that [Baker Botts](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/baker-botts/) is benefiting from contingency work too — and sharing the wealth with its hardworking associates, as one of them informed us:

Last Friday the firm announced it’s handing out special bonuses due to the recent settlement in the Liberty Media v. Vivendi Universal lawsuit ([$775 million!](http://www.reuters.com/article/vivendi-libertymedia-settlement-idUSL2N16517T)). Apparently we handled it on a partial-contingency basis, and it’s created a huge windfall for the firm. The partners are sharing some of that with the associates, which is nice. Here’s how it works out:

Year / Bonus
1st / $5,000
2nd / $7,500
3rd / $15,000
4th / $15,000
5th + / $30,000

Bonuses will be paid on March 21. We’re all quite happy about it.

We reached out to the firm, which issued this statement through spokesperson Stephen Hastings:

As reported, the firm represented Liberty Media in its dispute with Vivendi S.A., both at trial and through the settlement negotiations. The firm’s representation was on a partial contingency basis.

In keeping with our firm’s core values of professional excellence, teamwork and collegiality, integrity and service to the communities in which we practice, the partners of the firm felt it was appropriate to share the rewards of this significant victory with every person at the firm, including associates, special counsel, staff and partners.

The bonus awards arising out of the Liberty Media representation are separate and distinct from our annual bonus program.

As you may recall, the Baker Botts year-end bonuses [left something to be desired](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-very-disappointing-below-market-bonuses/). But these supplemental bonuses basically move the firm up to the market scale, which should help associate morale.

Congratulations to Baker Botts on its successful work for Liberty Media, and congrats to its lawyers and staff on the special bonuses.

# Bonus Season Spreads In Biglaw: It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year
## Hope you had a restful Thanksgiving, because Biglaw bonus season is about to kick into high gear.

It’s the week after Thanksgiving, which is the traditional start of bonus season. This year played on slightly differently when [Cravath announced their bonuses a week earlier than usual](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/), but this is usually when Biglaw firms decide to make their bonus announcements. So it’s no surprise that early on the first day back from the long holiday weekend firms are ready with their bonus news.

This morning, Davis Polk got in on the bonus action. They announced they are giving associates market bonuses. The bonuses will be paid out on December 14 — which gives the lucky associates plenty of time to splurge on holiday gifts.

Here’s the firm’s bonus scale for those that do not (yet) have the market bonuses memorized:

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Announces Big-Money Raises For Associates
## Counsel are getting in on the action, too!

Another day, another announcement made in the 2021 race to raise associate salaries across the Biglaw landscape. There are just a few Am Law top 50 firms that have [yet to match the new market salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/time-to-pay-up-these-am-law-top-50-firms-havent-announced-raises-yet/), but one by one, slowly but surely, they’re making salary moves to remain viable as competition to attract and retain associates in this hot lateral market. Which firm is up next in this financial beauty pageant?

It’s Perkins Coie, a firm that brought in $1,001,498,000 gross revenue in 2020, which helped it to land at No. 42 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. The Seattle-based firm let associates and counsel know yesterday afternoon that salary increases would be coming in July:

In all our offices, first-year and second-year associate salaries will be increased by $15,000, third-year and fourth-year salaries will be increased by $20,000, and fifth-year and more senior associate and counsel salaries will be increased by $25,000.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In Perkins Coie offices where associates were receiving market salaries, their new salary scale look like something this, otherwise known as the Davis Polk scale:

- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000
As noted in the firm’s memo, salaries aren’t the only thing that’s being worked on. Other changes at Perkins Coie may soon include:

- consideration of moving to a uniform 1950-hour expectation in all offices for some or all practice groups;
- continuing to reduce the differences in compensation among our various markets as the market for talent becomes more national in many practice areas;
- reviewing our current parental leave policies to ensure they continue to be competitive in the market; and
- reinforcing policies and best practices that support and encourage time away from work.

It’s the most amazing and underrated perk to be able to do things like that instead of waiting until you retire.

— [Al Saikali](https://www.shb.com/professionals/s/saikali-alfred), a partner in Shook Hardy & Bacon’s Miami office, commenting on some of the wonderful things he was able to do [during his three-month sabbatical from the firm](https://biglawbusiness.com/big-law-promotes-well-being-by-asking-lawyers-to-get-away), like taking his teenage daughter to the movies at noon. At Shook Hardy, lawyers are eligible for these sabbaticals every six years once they’ve spent seven years at the firm. Saikali also took a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Middle East during his time away from the firm.

# Sullivan & Cromwell Enters The Special Bonus Arena
## The firm Biglaw used to rely on for spring bonuses is back at it.

Another elite Biglaw firm bites the dust when it comes to the spring 2021 bonus wars. After waiting a week and a half to see how this would play out, Sullivan & Cromwell has arrived. Is another immediate match afoot?

Before we get to that, in case you need a little refresher on spring special bonuses, first came [Willkie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/), which started the latest bonus game in the first place. Next came [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/), which blew the Willkie scale out of the water, and other firms matched it one by one (and now [more than two dozen firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) have done so).

And now the news you’ve been waiting for. SullCrom’s black bonus box has been smashed open, and it looks like the firm will be matching DPW’s generous scale (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/sullcrom-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- Class of 2020: $12,000
- Class of 2019: $16,000
- Class of 2018: $32,000
- Class of 2017: $44,000
- Class of 2016: $52,000
- Class of 2015: $59,200
- Class of 2014: $64,000
As usual at the firm, there are no hours requirements attached to these bonuses (which are backloaded, just like DPW’s), which will be paid out on April 30 and September 30. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/sullcrom-special-bonus-2021//2/) to see the full memo from Sullivan & Cromwell.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# The Messy Family Drama Of A Biglaw Firm Founder
## This Biglaw founder had a fascinating career.

William Gibbs McAdoo, the founding partner of what white shoe Biglaw firm, is also known for his political career, having served as Treasury Secretary under Woodrow Wilson? He also ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1920. Though he led in the first ballot at the convention, his nomination was ultimately blocked by Wilson — who has also McAdoo’s father-in-law. [Awkward.] Wilson had hoped a deadlocked convention would lead to calls for him to serve a third term in office.

Hint: McAdoo is also known for serving as general counsel for the founders of United Artists, taking a 20 percent share of the venture for the effort.

# Chicago Firm Bumps Salaries In Multiple Offices
## Raises for associates in many different parts of the country.

There’s a delicate balancing act when it comes to releasing news about raises. Releasing the news on a Friday night may keep all that distracting partying off of company time, but you’ve also just guaranteed that your associates spent the whole week refreshing Above the Law instead of doing their jobs. It’s a tough call.

One firm that opted for the Friday route and raised salaries in the waning hours of last week was Chicago staple Chapman and Cutler. Our tipster didn’t provide a full memo, so we can’t report on the fallout for senior associates, but we’re hearing that the firm at least made good for the younger folks, with the Chicago, New York, Washington, and San Francisco offices all moving to $180K. Those associates in the firm’s Salt Lake City office will be paid on a scale starting at $130K.

With each passing announcement, eyes turn increasingly to the firms that haven’t yet joined the pack and we start asking… what’s wrong?

Jennifer Bard

Just yesterday we brought you the [story of drama](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/dean-increases-rankings-drama-at-law-school/) at Cincinnati College of Law. A group of law faculty were unhappy with the administration of dean Jennifer Bard and they expressed as much to the interim provost, Peter Landgren.

Without getting overly specific on details — at least as much as have been released to date — a group of faculty members wanted to take a vote of no confidence on Bard, who’s in the second year of a five-year contract.

Now comes word that Provost Landgren has decided to cut ties with Bard, putting her on administrative leave. He sent out the below email (via [TaxProf Blog](http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2017/03/-provost-removes-cincinnati-law-school-dean-less-than-two-years-into-her-five-year-term.html)) yesterday:

From: Landgren, Peter (landgrpe)
Sent: Wednesday, March 22, 2017 4:24 PM
Subject: College of Law Leadership

Dear College of Law Community,

After much deliberation and after many conversations with the dean and many of you who are part of the College of Law community, I have met with Dean Jennifer Bard today and taken steps to place her on administrative leave effective immediately.

The goal of this leave is to allow me time to solidify a transition plan for the College of Law. We have arrived at this point in time after much consideration. This decision is precipitated by a thorough evaluative process that involved in large part the College of Law community. I will work with the dean to develop a thoughtful transition plan in an expeditious timeframe.

While Dean Bard is on leave, I will ask senior faculty to step into transitional leadership roles to help with day-to-day operations both internal and external to the college.

I will also make myself available to the college and will plan to meet with faculty and staff of the College of Law community as soon as possible.

Please know that the needs of the college and the outstanding education we provide our students are my highest priorities in this time of transition and beyond.

Sincerely,

Peter
Peter E. Landgren
Interim Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost
Office of the Provost
University of Cincinnati
[(513) 556-2588](tel:(513)%20556-2588)

Yes, for those following the details of the situation closely, this is a major shift in how Landgren has decided to handle the case. In January, Landgren (and Bard) signed a six-month plan to improve relationships at the school, so what’s changed? Well, for one thing, the school’s U.S. News and World Report ranking. After [touting](http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2017/03/19/university-of-cincinnati-law-dean-under-fire-from.html) the 22-spot increase under Bard in January, the [2018 ranking](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/leaked-are-these-the-2018-u-s-news-law-school-rankings/2/) had Cincinnati down 12 spots. Still a net 10-spot increase, but perhaps that’s not enough.

According to Cincinnati.com, in a statement Bard [expressed her frustration](http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/03/23/uc-law-school-dean-out-now/99531776/) at this new development:

“We had an agreement for a process that included bringing in a mediator to address these issues,” Bard said in the statement. “I am deeply disappointed that the Interim Provost chose to close down this process and take this unprecedented action to frustrate the College of Law’s progress.”

Bard also appears to be keeping her options open:

Bard, who joined UC as dean in July 2015, said in a statement she was “surprised at the precipitous action the University took so soon after this matter became public and revealed the deep divisions within the Law School Community and tensions over the use of the school’s resources.”

….

She said Landgren’s action raises serious questions about UC’s failure to support the financial goals for which she was hired and the due process to which she is entitled. Bard’s legal counsel is currently evaluating her legal options, the statement said.

We’ll be keeping our eyes peeled for any other rapid-fire changes to this story.

# Biglaw Partner Files Class Action Lawsuit Over 'Male-Dominated Culture'
## These allegations are stunning.

Traci Ribeiro

If you were the third-highest revenue generator at your law firm, you’d probably expect you’d get the bump to equity partner pretty quickly. Well, not if you’re a woman at Sedgwick, according to a recent lawsuit.

Traci Ribeiro, an insurance partner in Sedgwick’s Chicago office with an impressive book of business, joined the firm in 2011 and was promoted to non-equity partner in 2012. According to her lawsuit filed this week, she has now butted up against the firm’s glass ceiling. She believed that working hard and consistently bringing in the big bucks for the firm would mean her promotion to equity partner, but that wasn’t to be. After years of dealing with a “male-dominated culture,” she has now filed a lawsuit seeking to certify a class of women at the firm who are paid less than their male counterparts.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yeah, buckle up folks, because the allegations in this suit are infuriating. The suit not only alleges that as one of the top three rainmakers at the firm Ribeiro was unable to crack into the ranks of equity partnership, but the unequal pay was also in the associate ranks, with women associates making up to $50,000 less than men. And when Ribeiro tried to advocate for the female associates working for her, it was… not taken well. As Law.com [reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/07/27/seeking-equal-pay-for-women-sedgwick-partner-sues-her-firm/):

One female associate was being paid $50,000 less than a male counterpart despite being more productive and profitable, according to Ribeiro’s complaint. Another was underpaid by $40,000. Ribeiro said that those associates eventually earned raises and were paid similarly to their male counterparts.

At a November 2012 equity partners meeting shortly after she raised an issue over associate pay, the complaint states that Bruce Celebrezze, a fellow insurance partner at Sedgwick in San Francisco, told his colleagues that Ribeiro “needed to learn how to behave,” and suggested she receive a pay cut.

That is just… wow. I wish I had a snappier comeback, but I’m paradoxically equal parts shocked and resigned that this is what allegedly gets said behind closed doors at Biglaw firms. If true, comments like this show that while the equity partnership undoubtedly had no issue cashing in on Ribeiro’s hard work, they don’t really see her as a partner or an equal.

This [isn’t the first time](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-alleges-sexism-derailed-her-career-in-a-new-lawsuit/?rf=1) a female Biglaw partner has sued over allegedly discriminatory compensation practices, but this case is distinct because of the eyebrow-raising rhetoric that is alleged to go on at Sedgwick.

The complaint further details other alleged incidents of sexism that contribute to what Ribeiro claims is a culture of discrimination. For example, at a 2013 meeting about Ribeiro’s role at the firm she was allegedly told, “Don’t worry, we’re not going to bring you out to the woodshed.” The complaint definitely takes issue with that one:

A comment like this is characteristic of the paternalistic, dismissive and gender-biased way Ribeiro has been treated by Sedgwick and would not have been said to a male attorney… Discussion of a spanking has no place in a conversation about a female’s professional prospects.

Ribeiro is still working at the firm and filed an EEOC complaint in January, which is ongoing. The complaint also notes there’s been an investigation by Seyfarth Shaw. And for its part, Sedgwick denies the allegations in the suit:

“We are confident there has been absolutely no discrimination or retaliation in the partner compensation process or otherwise, and we will defend the firm against these baseless allegations,” said [Sedgwick chair Michael] Healy.
…
“Sedgwick takes a fair, open and consensus-driven approach to partner compensation and other partnership issues, and we do not engage in or tolerate discriminatory or retaliatory conduct of any kind,” he said. “In fact, Sedgwick is proud to be widely recognized as a leader in initiating and promoting diversity in all aspects of the firm and in our communities.”

But this is a juicy lawsuit, and we’ll be following the developments closely.

Ed. note: Please welcome our newest columnist, [Scott Mozarsky](https://www.bna.com/scott-mozarsky-a17179885733/) of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg BNA.

The winds of change aren’t just blowing in the legal profession. They’re howling.

Take a couple of interesting stories from recent weeks. In one, labor and employment firm Jackson Lewis [announced the launch of a data analytics practice group](https://bol.bna.com/this-law-firm-is-betting-on-data/). The group, which includes statisticians as well as lawyers, will not only support the firm’s legal work (for example, providing damages estimates) but also help clients with non-legal projects such as determining their optimal headcount. In the second story, Eversheds and Atlanta-based Sutherland Asbill & Brennan [announced a transatlantic merger](https://bol.bna.com/eversheds-and-sutherland-to-combine-in-transatlantic-merger/) to create a combined, global firm of 2,300 lawyers across 29 countries.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There is a level of familiarity to both pieces of news. Firms have been creating practice groups and executing mergers for decades, after all. But it does not take close inspection to realize that developments such as these are becoming more and more common. They reflect profound changes occurring at an increasingly rapid pace within the legal profession. Those changes are being driven by two forces in particular: technology and globalization.

Jackson Lewis’s new group is a great example of the ways that law firms are enhancing their legal services—and creating entirely new lines of business—through the use of cutting-edge technology and data analytics. Meanwhile, a merged Eversheds Sutherland will become the latest iteration of a breed of law firm that is still in the process of defining itself: the truly global firm with depth and breadth worldwide.

I’ve been lucky enough to experience the factors driving such exciting and disruptive change—the forces of globalization and technological advancement—at a close distance for my entire professional career. Long before I became President of Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg BNA’s Legal Division in November, I spent my first years out of law school at two multinational law firms. Representing technology companies, among other clients, I spent part of that time doing cross-border transactions globally with a strong focus on inbound and outbound deals in Japan (where I lived after college) and China. I later moved to UBM, where as General Counsel of its Americas business and leading parts of PR Newswire and UBM Tech, I saw the transformative power of technology and globalization affecting a wide range of industries from media to B2B technology and health care.

The legal profession, traditionally slow to embrace change, is experiencing rapid and meaningful change. The stories mentioned above are two of the latest examples of accelerating transformation in the legal industry. Major trends impacting the profession include:

- The use of analytics: While firms were not early adopters, many firms ultimately came around to using analytics to assist with functions such as billing and marketing. Now, through new tools including Bloomberg Law’s [Litigation Analytics](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/an-important-new-tool-for-litigators-in-federal-court/), law firms and in-house lawyers are embracing analytics as a major asset in strategic decisions, including where to file litigation and how to better estimate resource allocation and fees.
- Workforce composition: Firms seeking to maximize production from attorneys and create flexible work options are innovating in the ways they compose their talent pools. The increased reliance on staff attorneys is an obvious way that law firms are leaving behind the era in which their lawyers fit into clear buckets as associates, counsel, or partners.
- Expanding service offerings: Whether through investment, joint ventures, or organic builds, firms are beginning to offer subscription services to their clients and to act as publishers and data providers in order to create new revenue streams and differentiate themselves.
- Client relationships: Analytics and advanced marketing tactics are making it easier for firms to win clients in the absence of the personal relationships that used to be the primary driver of new business. They are also making it easier for in-house counsel to make educated decisions on which firms to retain.
This column will be a space to watch, digest, and analyze the transformations occurring in these and many other areas within the legal profession. Such changes give rise to new opportunities, challenges, and patterns. Some lawyers with whom I have spoken view the significant transformation that the profession is going through, as well as transformative factors such as the introduction of tools built on artificial intelligence, as unsettling and disruptive. I don’t dismiss such concerns. But as I watch the profession transforming, I can’t help but be optimistic about its future and the numerous opportunities associated with globalization, technology, and analytics.

Howling winds can be scary, but they also make the journey that much more exciting. If you’re in the right boat, they can steer you in the right direction.

For almost two decades, [Kinney Recruiting](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/) has been a top international legal recruitment agency and home to some of the most distinguished legal recruiters in the world. With vast market experience and our trademark “no BS” approach, Kinney’s recruiters are favorites among candidates and clients in the legal industry. We are keen to share some of what we have learned with more people, so we’ve chosen some FAQs and will be publishing them with our take regularly, starting with the questions below. Beyond this, we are here if you have any questions. We are real people who show up every day and work hard to know as much about the legal industry as anyone. The fruit of our experience is, really, our stock in trade. Do you want to know more about how legal recruiting works? Do you want our take on the market? Do you have a random question of your own? Email [askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com](mailto:askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com) and we will get back to you with our take!

Question: “What should I do when a job interview question leaves me stumped?”

[Robert Kinney](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/robert-kinney/): First, remember that lawyers are not expected to know everything. The best lawyers know where to find the answer, are willing to put in the time to find it, and almost have a sixth sense about when something just doesn’t add up. Beyond that, the best way I have found to get something useful out of my memory when it’s not coughing up what I want is to try a different prompt. In other words, reframe the question. Ask some questions for clarification, throw out a few initial ideas, and ask the interviewer for thoughts. If you can get a conversation started, you’re likely to find paths that let you talk about your own problem-solving skills and arrive at a more thoughtful answer. Finally, remember that the best interviews are usually when the interviewer is doing most of the talking. People always like what they have to say. So, as long as you’re thoughtful with what you say, all you really need to do is get the person you are speaking with to take over.

[Daniel Roark](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/daniel-roark/): Inevitably all professionals over the course of their careers will face difficult questions in interviews that leave them stumped. What do you do when you are in the hot seat and your mind goes blank? First, take a beat, draw a breath, and refrain from defaulting to a reflexive “I don’t know.” Even a bad question or a difficult one offers the opportunity for a candidate to display their analytical and problem solving acumen which is often more valuable information than the “correct answer.” Robert correctly advises that posing clarifying questions to the interviewer or reframing the question audibly can trigger either a thread of thought or prompt the interviewer (if they are generous and/or engaged) to provide more context. And then begin scaffolding an answer just as you did over the course of three years of opaque law school exams. A candidate can also request the interviewer to return to the topic later, thus permitting the candidate time to think and hopefully resulting in a more clear interrogatory when the topic is revisited. On rare occasions, our candidates have been posed with interview questions that seek a singular response – e.g, “Which rule of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure discusses Claims for Attorneys Fees?” In these legal trivia types of situations, one either knows the answer (Rule 54) or they don’t, therefore providing the tried and true, “I don’t know the answer, but I will follow-up right after the interview” is an honest placeholder. [“It’s in the 50s” would also be a fine answer. The issue usually is whether you even care.] Anyone who says they will follow up should then do that. I encourage candidates to practice articulating answers aloud prior to their interviews. Compelling interview answers require self-editing, phrase sculpting, and substance. And this is a difficult combination to achieve on the fly in a pressure-filled room. The best candidates enter the room prepared. As Winston Churchill famously said to his driver whilst waiting in his car for several quiet minutes prior to entering a pressure-filled forum where he would deliver a speech, “I’m just preparing my impromptu remarks.”

Question: “What does an associate have to do to get fired on the spot?”

[Lora Kenyon](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/lora-kenyon/): I almost never hear of this happening, and I’ve heard some crazy things that associates have done. If there is an issue with the associate not performing to the firm’s standards, the associate is typically given the opportunity to improve or is told they should start looking for another job and given a couple of months to find something else before being let go. The actions that may result in being fired on the spot are typically more egregious (like threatening or endangering co-workers or being severely impaired due to drugs or alcohol), involve ethical concerns, or endanger important client relationships.

Question: “I just found out I’m pregnant while working with a recruiter to apply at big firms. Should I tell the recruiter about the pregnancy?”

[Cindy Summerfield](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/cindy-summerfield/): This is an easy one. Absolutely. It is entirely your decision whether or not you would like to disclose your pregnancy with a recruiter, but the more transparent the candidate is with us, the better the result. To be clear, we won’t ask you if you are pregnant and you do NOT have to tell us or your potential future employer whether you are pregnant. If you DO choose to disclose your pregnancy (which we would normally recommend if asked for our advice), then my advice is to get through your first round of interviews/screener and then be open with the firm/company about it. A good recruiter can help you navigate the timing of this as well as figure out whether the firm has the work/life balance and culture you are looking for once the baby arrives. We see this issue frequently and I can’t think of a scenario when it has cost the candidate in any way to be transparent.

Have a question of your own? Email [askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com](mailto:askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com) and we will get back to you with our take!

# Rising Associate Compensation A 'Red Flag' For Biglaw Firms

The salary wars will continue or even escalate, and firms that are not proactive in addressing salary issues could be facing a significant loss of talent.

— The results of the fourth annual LawVision and Iridium Technology (now part of BigHand) [law firm profitability survey](https://www2.bighand.com/iridium-lawvision) revealed that 80 percent of respondents say they disagree or are neutral about whether they have a plan to address rising talent compensation. The survey authors describe that as a “major red flag” which could impact the long term health of the firm.

# Is Biglaw's Drinking Culture Making Sexual Harassment Problems Worse?
## Fueled by booze, these lawyers sometimes cross professional lines in terms of workplace sexual harassment.

With the holiday season approaching, associates at Biglaw firms across the country are facing some intense pressure. If they don’t meet their billable hours requirements, they won’t be in good standing at their firms, and if they’re not in good standing, they won’t receive their full bonuses. At their wits’ end, stressed-out attorneys search for the easiest comforts they can find, and those quick comforts are usually found inside a bottle of alcohol. Fueled by booze, these lawyers sometimes cross professional lines in terms of workplace sexual harassment.

Law firms know this well, and yet gallons upon gallons of alcohol continue to be introduced at work-related events almost each and every day. With year-end parties quickly approaching where outrageous amounts of alcohol will be served, we had to wonder, is Biglaw’s drinking culture making sexual harassment problems worse?

[Patrick Krill](https://www.prkrill.com/about-1/), the founder of Krill Strategies, a behavioral health consulting firm focused on the legal industry, thinks the answer to that question is yes. In his latest Well Counseled column on Law.com, Krill, citing studies which have shown that workplace harassment increases when alcohol is involved, says that “by introducing alcohol into the context of work-related events or gatherings, [law firms] are also introducing elements of unpredictability and volatility into their risk portfolio.”

Coincidentally, the more women are sexually harassed at their firms, the more women who have been harassed will turn to alcohol. Krill has more [information](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/11/13/unhappy-hour-law-firms-drinking-culture-amplifies-sexual-harassment-problems/):

In addition to alcohol increasing the likelihood of some sort of sexual misconduct or gender harassment, however, there’s an equally troubling flipside to the equation as well: Problem drinking increases as a result of being sexually harassed. That’s right, not only do harassed individuals have to suffer that indignity itself, but they then could be victimized a second time by the dysfunctional coping mechanisms that the experience may prompt them to adopt.

Research demonstrates that experiences of sexual harassment are associated with increased frequency of drinking, escapist motivations for drinking, heavy episodic drinking, drinking to intoxication, and use of prescription drugs (such as sedatives, antidepressants) and cigarettes. Moreover, ongoing sexual harassment is predictive of increased quantity of alcohol consumption by the harassed individual, a fact that is particularly problematic given that sexual harassment is often chronic in nature. Keep in mind, this is in addition to the psychological distress that numerous studies have linked to sexual harassment, including depression, anxiety, irritability, loss of self-esteem, and a sense of helplessness and vulnerability.

Krill says law firms leaders need to ask themselves some “sobering questions” about their attorneys’ drinking behaviors, and we couldn’t agree more. Biglaw managing partners and other members of firm leadership need to decide what is more important to them: the well-being of their employees or the well-being of their bottom lines. We’re of the opinion that if the former improves, the latter is likely to improve as well.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We’re definitely fielding questions from clients across the firm. And we are also trying to educate the firm, as well as our clients on the different scenarios that may impact contracts, rulemakings, grants, guidance, things of that nature.

— [Matt Leggett](https://www.klgates.com/Matthew-H-Leggett), a partner in the public policy and law practice group at K&L Gates, in comments given to the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/09/27/law-firms-brace-clients-for-possible-government-shutdown/) on what the firm has been doing to prepare clients for a possible government shutdown. “Once you enter into the shutdown phase,” Leggett continued, “on top of helping a client navigate through what the shutdown itself means for them, you also are going to have to participate and be active in monitoring, if not trying to shape and influence, the resolution of the shutdown in order to protect your clients’ interests.”

ATL is joining our friends at the leading legal intelligence provider [Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/) to field a survey that seeks to shine a light on the experiences of both gender and ethnically diverse attorneys at large law firms. The survey is specifically seeking input from diverse attorneys.

Our survey hopes to glean insights into a wide range of matters, including the fairness of firms’ assignment systems, opportunities for informal networking and mentorship, and the phenomenon of “window dressing,” where some firms pay lip service to action without instituting operational policies.

Please [take our survey here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ATL_DivSurv24) (share the link with your colleagues!) and help us gain greater insight into these crucial issues.

# Managing A High Volume Of Acquisitions With A Lean In-House Team
## How a veterinary services provider optimized contract workflows with Bloomberg Law Contract Solutions.

[](https://bit.ly/3QCxUvm)To achieve their mission of providing top-notch, locally managed veterinary practices, VetCor continues to rapidly expand its impressive network of 800+ practices across the United States and Canada. VetCor’s growth objectives include more than 100 acquisitions closed annually, which amounts to a lot of work for the in-house legal team.

“Our team is small but nimble, and we’re responsible for handling 99% of our acquisitions in-house,” said John Prindiville, senior corporate counsel for VetCor. “It’s a considerable amount of paperwork for our team to process, and that’s why we began looking for solutions that could assist us in maximizing the efficiency of our document review and drafting.”

The true tipping point, said Prindiville, was when VetCor merged with a competitor and identified the potential risk of having conflicting documents in the marketplace.

“We realized that it was a very good time for us to deploy some new technology to try to map things over and standardize our documents as we go out into the market as a new, unified brand,” Prindiville said.

Finding a solution built to suit their needs

Even before the VetCor legal team determined they needed a technology solution, Prindiville regularly received sales pitches for various contract management products, but he wasn’t convinced. The well-established products on the market didn’t offer the kind of tailored solution that addressed the team’s needs.

However, in May 2023 Bloomberg Law debuted [Contract Solutions](https://bit.ly/3QCxUvm), an AI-powered solution for storing, managing, drafting, reviewing, negotiating, and analyzing contracts.

Prindiville was initially attracted to Contract Solutions because it’s a new product that offers the opportunity to influence the development from the start.

“We feel like our input is valued,” he said of working with the Bloomberg Law product development team. “We’re thrilled that each time we provide our feedback, the team takes that back to the developers and they’re building things that are going to be useful to us.”

He also appreciates that the Bloomberg Law developers came from a place of deep knowledge and understanding of the contract workflow challenges impacting in-house counsel.

“They understood from the minute that we met them what our needs were and how to address them,” Prindiville said.

In fact, Bloomberg Law Contract Solutions was developed in close consultation with corporate legal teams and with feedback from hundreds of in-house attorneys and legal professionals.

Its features include:

- A secure, centralized repository that automatically extracts clauses from finalized agreements providing an organized single source of truth for all contracts, clauses, templates, and related documents that can be filtered, sorted, and searched across – with little to no data entry.
- Seamless integration with Microsoft Word that allows users to access their cloud-based contract repository and clause library directly from their document, providing a fast and easy starting point for drafting and revising contracts.
- Advanced analysis tools built into Microsoft Word accelerate the review of draft agreements and allow users to efficiently identify and incorporate preferred language to ensure favorable terms.
- AI-powered extraction of key dates and contractual terms, provides greater visibility into final agreements to help identify and flag potential risks and obligations.
A smarter approach to document review and drafting

The stand-out functionality of Bloomberg Law Contract Solutions from Prindiville’s point of view is the effortless integration with Microsoft Word. For example, the instant access to the company’s clause library, as well as clauses from millions of publicly available contracts, and the ability to compare or find similar clauses without having to leave Word.

“Most attorneys will tell you that they are in Word all day, every day, regardless of what line of trade they’re in,” Prindiville said. “It’s been very helpful for us to be able to have one window open with a particular document and to be able to work within that atmosphere. It does save a considerable amount of time.”

Another common challenge for the VetCor team when reviewing or editing a clause is understanding how similar language was handled in the past. Work that previously required a significant amount of time is now as simple as a single click in Contract Solutions.

“The way that Bloomberg Law Contract Solutions uses AI in the clause identification tool is very helpful for our team because the tool removes the guesswork of determining whether there is a modification to our agreement that requires our full attention,” said Prindiville.

Spending less time on review and more time on negotiations

The ease of implementation meant that the VetCor legal team began realizing the benefits of [Bloomberg Law Contract Solutions](https://bit.ly/3QCxUvm) right away.

“Everyone’s noticed the value of having this tool is getting time back in our day,” Prindiville said. “We have more time to spend on a thoughtful response to opposing counsel and really to perform more efficiently because of this tool.”

What previously could take hours of painstaking review, flipping back and forth between versions, or repeatedly checking for definitions, is now possible with the click of a button using Contract Solutions. This saves Prindiville and his team from rote, tedious tasks that take time away from more highly skilled legal work and consultation.

“This product enables you to think more clearly and be more focused in your negotiations,” Prindiville said. “It saves you time, it makes you a better attorney by allowing you to develop greater depth in each document, and it gives you more opportunities to provide a thoughtful response.”

# Biglaw Firm That Lost $62 Million Assures Everyone They're Going To Be Just Fine Financially
## This is why we have insurance, people.

[Last week we told you ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/husch-blackwell-charles-renner-biglaw-62-milion-arbitration-award/)about the arbitration brought against the Biglaw firm Husch Blackwell by, what I presume is now a former client, engineering firm Burns & McDonnell. Burns & McDonnell alleged that Husch Blackwell partner Charles Renner, in his role as outside counsel for the Kansas City city council, tanked their bid to build the new KC airport. Meanwhile another client of Renner’s ultimately scored the airport contract.

The arbitration panel found Renner breached his duty of loyalty to a firm client. They awarded Burns & McDonnell $62 million, representing the anticipated profits to the engineering firm, had it won the contract.

There was a confidentiality clause in the arbitration agreement, so Husch Blackwell has been mum on the entire sitch. At least publicly.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Internally, an email sent by Paul Eberle, the firm’s chief executive officer, and Catherine Hanaway, the firm chair, provides a tiny bit more detail on how the firm’s dealing post-decision. The email reveals that the firm thinks the decision is “wrong on its merits,” but it will move forward “despite this setback.”

Importantly — particularly given Biglaw concerns over a coming economic downturn — the email makes clear that there will not be a “material impact on the firm’s financial condition.” Good ole’ professional liability insurance will be covering the costs.

You can read the full email below.

# Top Biglaw Rolls Out In-Office Tracking Tool, And Associates Are Pissed -- But They Shouldn't Be
## This really isn't as bad as it seems.

With Labor Day in the rearview mirror, many Biglaw firms are now expecting their associates to be working from the office, at least four days each week. Some firms have yet to take the leap and make such a mandate, but instead, they’ve put technology into place that will track associates to see who is in the office, and perhaps most importantly, where.

This happened recently at Goodwin Procter, where the firm rolled out a new system called “Colleague Connect.” Though the firm — which brought in $2,211,469,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 13 on the Am Law 100 — intended to use the program to “enhance the way we interact with each other, making our office communication more efficient and productive,” many associates weren’t immediately on board, with some referring to the implementation of the technology as a Big Brother-esque invasion of privacy.

In fairness to Goodwin Procter, most, if not all, firms are already tracking their associates’ office attendance thanks to card swipes — this new system is just allowing people to see where people are located. In fact, we here at Above the Law once [called a system like this](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/managing-the-hybrid-office-of-the-future-with-a-couple-clicks/) the way to “manag[e] the hybrid office of the future.” The firm entered into this new office management model with the best intentions, telling the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/31/good-business-or-big-brother-in-office-tracking-is-a-contentious-subject-and-messaging-matters/) that the firm remains “committed to continuing to improve the hybrid work experience for all members of the Goodwin community.”

Here are some additional details from Am Law:

Goodwin explained some of the thinking behind the rollout of Colleague Connect.

“For extra flexibility, we are able to vary our individual schedules on a weekly basis,” the firm said in a statement. “Our people have noted that our flexible model means they do not always know when colleagues are in the office, on different floors for example. To address this, we designed Colleague Connect to make it easier for us to connect with each other in-person on any particular day when we are working from a Goodwin office. Because Colleague Connect is designed to facilitate in-person collaboration, it provides a snapshot only of who is an office that particular day.”

One supportive Goodwin associate said, “Honestly, I appreciate this, it’s always a pain to figure out who is in when I’m in.” We suspect there are even more associates who feel the same way.

Though associates may be wary of the firm’s implementation of this system thanks to its recent history of [outright](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) and [stealth](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/goodwin-is-conducting-performance-reviews-that-have-resulted-in-job-cuts/) layoffs, let’s look at this through rose-colored glasses: this shouldn’t be seen as a burden, but as a benefit. Goodwin is embracing its flexible attendance model and offering associates new ways to connect with their colleagues while they’re working in the office. This is good for morale, and it might just make associates happier about being in the office if they have a simple way to find their friends.

# With Legal Hiring Cooling Down, Are Layoffs Looming For Biglaw Associates?
## Uh-oh....

Biglaw firms now find themselves in a rather curious spot in our post-pandemic world. While 2021 and the start of 2022 were marked by frenzied hiring, pay raises, and bonuses galore, the tail end of 2022 is looking a little gloomier. Coupled with a slowdown in work, legal recruiters are saying that “demand for associates [no longer exceeds supply](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/want-a-big-signing-bonus-with-your-biglaw-lateral-move-not-in-this-economy/),” with some firms reportedly [enacting hiring freezes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/) while others have performed stealth layoffs. Is legal hiring in a recessionary slump, or are we just approaching a new(er) normal?

A new report at Law.com examines this issue, and further opines on the question everyone is wondering about: could layoffs be ahead for associates?

It’s not just the lower volume of lateral movement that’s indicating a cooling of the legal industry’s hiring environment; recruiters interviewed for this report said firms are investing less in their talent acquisition teams, while the sign-on bonuses offered to associates have been reduced to a minimum.

Firms are also reportedly becoming more circumspect about the productivity of their associates and business generation of their partners, pushing out those who aren’t worth the inflated personnel costs that firms have incurred.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to Jeff Lowe, global managing partner of legal recruiter Major, Lindsey & Africa, the lateral hiring market is “very level” right now, but recessionary fears are real indeed. “Firms are taking time to pause and take a breath, and also the market has started to slow down, particularly the M&A market,” he said in an interview with Law.com. “They’re thinking we better slow things down to more of a normal hiring process that was common in pre-pandemic times.”

Albert Tawil, founder of Lateral Hub, told Law.com that while the hiring market seems to look strong, firms are trying to cut their lateral hiring costs. “One example is a chief talent officer or partner will be given a directive to say we’re continuing to hire laterals, but let’s try to cut our recruiting costs,” he said. “Let’s try to be more mindful of that as part of our business.”

But what about layoffs? Are there going to be layoffs? Lowe has some thoughts on that — and you’re probably not going to like them very much.

If the economic slowdown exacerbates after such minor austerity measures are implemented, Lowe said at some point firms will begin to move people out following performance reviews, otherwise known as “stealth layoffs.”

While the Major Lindsey head said he hasn’t heard about impending mass layoffs, he said there is a sense among firms that they need to be more circumspect about associate ranks and making sure they can try to keep people busy.

Layoffs can — and will — happen, but only if things are truly dire. “It just depends how severe the economy becomes,” Lowe said. “We’ve seen before many times: Some firms, at the first hint of crisis, will fire a ton of people. They’ve done it before and they’ll do it again.”

Yikes. We sincerely hope that you’re not a victim of a stealth layoff — or any other kind of layoff, should it come to that. Good luck out there, everyone.

Bonus season is always exciting around Above the Law. Mostly because it provides an opportunity to stretch our pun muscles with groan-inducing headlines that you all complain about (but secretly love… we know it).

And when bonuses come packaged with raises… all the better.

You know the drill by now. Hogan Lovells brought in $2,432,000,000 in revenue last year placing them 12th in the Am Law 100. The firm [may not have absorbed Shearman this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/rumored-merger-between-hogan-lovells-and-shearman-scrapped/), but it still ended up with an [influx of talent from Stroock & Stroock](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-end-may-be-near-as-stroock-loses-more-than-half-its-partners-to-hogan-lovells/).

Base compensation set to increase effective January 1.

Class of 2023: $225,000
Class of 2022: $235,000
Class of 2021: $260,000
Class of 2020: $310,000
Class of 2019: $365,000
Class of 2018: $390,000
Class of 2017: $420,000
Class of 2016+: $435,000

Bonuses are as follows:

Class of 2022: $20,000
Class of 2021: $30,000
Class of 2020: $57,500
Class of 2019: $75,000
Class of 2018: $90,000
Class of 2017: $105,000
Class of 2016+: $115,000

Those will be paid in the last paycheck of the year. Additional bonuses available to those who exceeded billing requirements.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Shows Associates How Much They Love 'Em!
## Hardworking associates getting rewarded.

The bonus news is coming in fast and furious today! And that’s great news for associates who’ve been biting their nails as the [bonus season started slower](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/leader-of-top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-incredibly-frank-colorful-reasoning-behind-slow-bonus-season/) than expected this year.

But now that’s all in the past! The latest firm to delight associates with eye-popping bonuses is Hogan Lovells. The firm, ranked number 9 on the Am Law 100 with $2,605,973,000 in revenue last year, is matching the prevailing market rate on year-end bonuses. That means the bonuses will range from $20,000 to $115,000, depending on seniority.

The firms bonus scale:

2015 (and senior)	$115,000
2016	$105,000
2017	$90,000
2018	$75,000
2019	$57,500
2020	$30,000
2021	$20,000
Bonuses are subject to the firm’s minimum hours requirement, and will be paid out on December 30th. And the extra good news? Those who put in a bunch of hours this year will get a little something extra in their stocking, er… paycheck. As the firm writes, “Additional bonuses will be paid to those eligible associates who exceed their minimum hours expectations, in accordance with the firm’s associate bonus schedule.”

You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/top-10-biglaw-firm-shows-associates-how-much-they-love-em/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# 'Black Lawyers Matter,' And It's Time For Law Schools And Law Firms To Realize That
## Black law students are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to their post-graduate employment.

It’s impossible for me not to conclude that law schools have long had systems in place that preference and prioritize the employment outcomes of white graduates over Black graduates.

— Jim Leipold, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement, in comments given at the [“Black Lawyers Matter” conference](https://www.lsac.org/black-lawyers-matter-2021), an event co-hosted by University of Houston Law Center, Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, and the Law School Admission Council. According to Leipold, Black law school graduates usually have the [lowest rate of employment in private sector firms](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/is-big-laws-addiction-t-14-hobbling-diversity-efforts-2021-10-18/). To make matters worse, the gap between Black and white law school graduates finding jobs that require bar exam passage averaged 18 percentage points over the past six years.

One of the hardest parts about marketing yourself today is understanding and quickly conveying your unique value to the digital-age reader. You may be saying, “But, I’ve worked at Fortune 100 companies and top-tier law firms, why aren’t recruiters knocking down my door when my resume comes across their desk?”

A big part of my work as an executive resume writer is reading through dozens of resumes a week from legal executives, C-suite leaders in other industries, and board members. On the legal side, this includes the general counsel at a Fortune 25 company, an assistant general counsel or deputy general counsel of a private equity company or tech start-up, or an equity partner of an Am Law 50 firm (who is gunning for an in-house leadership role). Some have not updated their resume in years; others have continued to use the same template since they graduated law school in the 1990s or early 2000s.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Most often, these resumes have a combination of [foundational problems](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/3-mistakes-youre-making-in-your-legal-resume-and-how-to-fix-them/): long block paragraphs of text, not enough granular detail showcasing achievements or accomplishments, dozens of bullet points that don’t get to the root of the candidate’s value and feel more like a copy-paste of a job description, and a lack of organization that diminishes the overall readability and comprehension.

If you’re struggling to write your own resume, welcome to the club — it’s hard to write about yourself because you’re looking at your career from an internalized and subjective perspective, not the 30,000-foot view of an outsider.

The average recruiter is skimming your resume for just seconds (typically less than 10), so you need to grab their attention quickly, put the important data in front of them, and make them want to call you for an interview. The reader of your resume does not have time to sit and read through pages and pages of information, or go on a fishing expedition to find the important details. It’s not a casual night out at the Cheesecake Factory where you’re studying the 14-page menu with 250 items to choose from. Think of your reader as someone who just sat down at a 5-star steakhouse, already knows what cut of steak they want, and anticipates looking at a small menu with a limited number of choices. It has to be clear, concise, and scream delectable.

Here are six practical ways to [streamline your resume](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/how-to-write-a-compelling-legal-resume-that-lands-interviews/), making it more readable and skimmable for recruiters:

Modern font. Use a modern, sans serif font like Calibri. Times New Roman or any variation of it, such as Garamond, is outdated and coined as the [sweatpants of resume fonts](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/times-new-roman-resume-best-worst-fonts_n_7167390) (yes, I was quoted in that infamous article reference). This is because the curvature in the letters constricts the readability. Sans serif fonts are notoriously easier to read on a digital device or screen, and why you’ll always see them on websites.

Create clear headers and separators. One of the challenges of writing a resume is making sure your reader knows where a section ends and where it begins. This includes centering headlines for your “Professional Experience” and “Education and Bar Admissions” sections and putting a border line around it or below. This is helpful because it creates hard stops for the reader and makes it easier to parse. While a dark color like navy is perfectly acceptable for headers, do not opt for fancy graphics or columns — it creates confusion for the reader due to the eye shifting movements that occur. As I’ve written in past articles, legal resumes and executive resumes in general favor [clean, modern design](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/quick-ways-to-refresh-optimize-and-modernize-your-legal-resume/).

Consider the theme of your resume. If you’re seeking a corporate generalist role, it needs to delve into the major corporate generalist areas of what a GC does, focusing on that broad corporate legal function. The more specialized roles in areas such as data privacy, labor and employment, or intellectual property will favor very specific attributes, such as a being a licensed patent attorney, or having the data privacy certification and deep expertise in that niche on a variety of pressing issues. Relevant keywords matter but don’t keyword stuff. Remember, you have to show factual support in your resume as to your skills, so listing 30 skills in your resume will not help if you don’t provide the reader with evidence of the impact you’ve driven with those skills.

Professional summary. This is prime real estate to demonstrate your value — if you’re targeting a public company general counsel role and you’ve served as the general counsel at three major public companies, include that fact. If you’ve worked at an Am Law 50 firm on securities transactions, include that fact. The professional summary should only be a few lines, and no more than one to three sentences. It’s a very small section, and one that I always write last when I’m crafting a client’s resume. It’s similar to the short paragraph on the back of a book jacket — it makes the reader want to continue reading.

Give enough detail but don’t overkill. The resume is not an endless list of every single thing you’ve done at a company or law firm. It’s not your autobiography. It’s merely a snapshot that’s used to tell a narrative of your career highlights and provide a sampling of your accomplishments and achievements. Consider organizing your resume by broad competency areas and then giving a few bullet points that speak to that experience. The resume should have a mix of quantitative and qualitative achievements.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
If you’ve managed large legal teams, give the number. If you’ve managed legal budgets, explain the size. It’s one thing to say you’ve drafted and negotiated a $10 million supply chain agreement, but the better bullet of information is one that explains the value that $10 million agreement drove for the company, the long-term impact it had, and the significance it played in your role as the general counsel.

White space matters. Keep your margins no smaller than half an inch around and make sure there is ample white space all around, including in between bullets and other sections. Remember, your bullets need to be digestible — keep them to no more than two or three lines. Executive resumes in general can run to two or three pages, with the third page functioning as an [addendum of representative matters](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/creating-an-effective-career-management-strategy/) (in the case of someone with heavy litigation management experience) or a deal/transaction sheet (for those with extensive M&A transactions experience).

You knew they had to — hell, if I were betting, I think all the [Biglaw firms with over a billion dollars in revenue](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-billion-dollar-biglaw-firms-that-have-not-raised-associate-salaries/?rf=1) will really have to raise associate salaries to the now familiar Franken-[Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale. It’s more than just the sheer economics that will propel these elite Biglaw firms to spread the wealth with their associates — it is also the recognition that the biggest and best firms are doing it. If you want the cachet of being the best, you have to pay for it.

Now [Morgan Lewis & Bockius](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/morgan-lewis-bockius/), with its $2,001,000,000 in gross revenue for 2017, has announced they are raising associate salaries and providing special bonuses in line with those going around the market. The firm made the announcement over voicemail — how 2006 of them! — but we can confirm the following base salaries at the firm:

Class of 2017: $190,000
Class of 2016: $200,000
Class of 2015: $220,000
Class of 2014: $255,000
Class of 2013: $280,000
Class of 2012: $305,000
Class of 2011: $325,000
Class of 2010+: $340,000

# Law Firm Cancels Summer Associate Program, Leaving Law Students Reeling
## What is your firm planning to do with its summer associate program amid coronavirus concerns?

American law firms seem to be in a full panic thanks to the arrival of the novel coronavirus pandemic that’s been sweeping the globe. From salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs, these firms have done just about everything as far as cost-saving measures are concerned to maintain their financial health — well, almost everything.

Summer associate season is just around the corner, and while some firms have [deferred start dates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/summer-associate-programs-and-pay-cut-short-thanks-to-coronavirus/) and others have embraced the [possibility of remote work](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firms-cant-seem-to-decide-what-theyre-going-to-do-with-summer-associate-programs/), others still have been dragging their feet, waiting for some guidance before deciding to make a move that could impact the rest of their student employees’ lives.

As Zeughauser Group legal consultant Kent Zimmermann has [mused](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaws-bleak-reality-the-layoffs-have-only-just-begun/) regarding this year’s summer programs, “[s]ome [firms] have canceled, made [an] internal announcement, but have not yet publicly announced the decision.” Today, we’ll be publicly announcing one law firm’s decision for them.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
FordHarrison, one of the nation’s largest labor and employment law firms, contacted students earlier this week to let them know that its summer program would not be taking place. Here’s an excerpt from the letter students received:

We have made the difficult decision to cancel our 2020 summer associate program as a result of the uncertainty and challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 16, many FordHarrison offices have been operating remotely and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Relationship building and face-to-face interaction between lawyers and summer associates are essential to our recruiting process and the opportunity we committed to provide to you. Client demand for our services remains high, but it is very difficult to anticipate what the coming months may bring even when the on-site work resumes. Given this level of uncertainty, we determined we will not have the appropriate learning opportunities available to provide a meaningful summer associate experience.

We reached out to FordHarrison for comment, but have not yet received word back. We will update this article with any responses we receive.

While we understand where the firm is coming from, this really puts the law students who expected to spend the summer working at FordHarrison — in any form, remotely or in person — in a horrible position. Not only will they be jobless, but the financial insecurity the firm’s would-be employees will be facing during a public health crisis is beyond the pale. “It hurts to know that summer associates matter so little,” said one of the law students affected by FordHarrison’s decision. “I hope I’ll be able to find something before May (or, at the very least, I hope I can even pay rent).”

# ABA President Wants Every Lawyer To Take One Simple Test
## This is a crucial test all lawyers and law students should take.

Four Times Square may no longer consciously [look like](http://www.truedwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/download1.jpg) the fictional [Four Freedoms Tower](http://i1.wp.com/facomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fourfreedoms.jpg), but you can’t really shake the feeling that something fantastic is in the air with a lobby filled with Skadden lawyers and models visiting Condé Nast. Meanwhile, through the building’s West entrance, the NASDAQ Marketsite provided a forum for ABA President Paulette Brown to deliver a short keynote about the legacy of Miranda and the future of law.

The event, hosted by MyCase (Brown was followed by our own columnist [Niki Black](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/niki-black/) of MyCase), seized on the recent observance of Law Day to reflect on the erosion of Miranda. So, not a cheery subject. She began the speech asking if we’d had too much to drink at the happy hour beforehand — apparently she knew ATL was there — and while no one was drunk yet, Brown gave everyone enough cause to drown their constitutional sorrows afterward.

To underscore the importance of the decision, Brown positioned Miranda at the heart of the fight against implicit bias, which she characterized as “corrosive to the pursuit of justice, fairness, and the integrity of the legal system.” For anyone still confused about implicit bias, Brown referenced the famous Written in Black and White test — which [ATL covered here](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/proof-that-typos-are-racist/) — where identical legal memos received wildly disparate criticism based on whether senior lawyers thought the author was black or white.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The most important lesson to take from that experiment is not that there are some racists in Biglaw, but that implicit bias is everywhere and that lawyers need to stop being afraid to admit it to themselves. Figure out your biases and then undertake the conscious effort to fight back against your unconscious. If you haven’t taken an implicit test, [you should do so here](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html). It’s a real mindf**k because biases you’d probably never imagine come out of the woodwork. I saw a public display of this test at the Utah State Bar Fall Forum last year from my fellow keynoter Kimberly Papillon (my speech covered the decidedly less heavy value of good press damage control), and the depths of biases, many forged as a toddler, are amazing to behold.

Brown encouraged lawyers of all stripes to take an implicit bias test. Given that prosecutors hold massive reserves of arbitrary power — Brown described them as holding more power than anyone else in the justice system — she feels it’s critical for these lawyers to take the time to identify their own often unconscious biases. But it’s not just prosecutors. Even the social justice warriors in the public defender trenches suffer from biases that can derail justice. We all know public defenders face massive workloads and too little time — how they manage their time can be fraught with implicit bias and do serious harm to justice.

And considering the lawyers are, Brown noted, less diverse than accountants, surgeons, and engineers, confronting explicit bias isn’t enough. African-American women make up less than 2 percent of partners and women of color generally only comprise around 2.5 percent.

No matter what corner of the legal world a lawyer occupies, implicit biases play a role. Stop being afraid to admit them. Diagnose yourself and get working on it. The profession depends on you.

# Law Firms Finished 2017 Better Than 2016 And Everything's Still Malaise

The [annual report from the Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/07/citi-report-strong-fourth-quarter-pushes-2017-financials-past-2016-results/) is here to break down the financial fortunes of the legal landscape. Did the report reveal any exciting curveballs that will turn the industry on its head and leave firms scrambling to adapt to a new paradigm?

Nope!

No, the 2017 report provides us exactly what we’ve heard every quarter on the quarter for years. Demand is stagnant, billing rates are up, this results in a mildly positive year overall, but ultimately any good news is almost entirely off the backs of the most elite firms and the specialized boutiques while the rest of the Am Law 200 limp along with their growing market weaknesses obscured by the moderately happy top line. The premier industry barometer is looking more like a broken clock that strikes “modest growth” every quarter.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Revenue growth of 4.5 percent was greater than the 3.8 percent growth seen the previous year. Lawyer billing rate increases, improved accrual realization and improved demand (total timekeeper hours), drove revenue growth, which was tempered only by a slowdown in collections.

There’s that improved overall revenue driven by billing rates. Remember when clients threatened that they were finally putting their foot down and [refusing to countenance higher rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/)? That was funny. Top firm billables are as elastic as Laffy Taffy.

A pickup in demand in the fourth quarter also helped to redeem what had been a sluggish year. Demand ended the year up 0.7 percent after being down 0.2 percent through nine months, and compares quite favorably to last year’s 0.1 percent growth.

And there’s the sad demand figure. It’s truly telling when an industry is excited about demand growth under 1 percent. Here’s a quiz: is that passage from the 2017 report or the 2016 report?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It is 2017, but admit it, you thought about it for a second.

Dispersion in performance was also evident between industry segments, based on revenue size. Am Law 1-50 firms outperformed the other segments in revenue, net income and PPEP growth for the second consecutive year. They tied niche/boutique firms for the largest demand growth (1.7 percent), and had the strongest growth in year-end inventory (8 percent), putting themselves in the best position for collections at the start of 2018. And this growth was enjoyed by the largest proportion of firms of any of the segments—with 68 percent reporting growth in demand (up from 53 percent in 2016) and 87 percent in PPEP (up from 83 percent in 2016).

The experience was very different for Am Law 51-100 and Second Hundred firms, which both experienced comparatively weaker billing rate increases along with declines in demand. Indeed, half of the Am Law 51-100 firms reported declining demand, while 60 percent of Am Law Second Hundred firms experienced a decline.

What do you know, the Am Law 51-200 generally took it in the shorts? It’s almost like we’re seeing a trend away from the high overhead model and toward specialized boutiques and increased in-house coverage — both fueled in part by technological advances that allow fewer lawyers to handle previously labor-intensive work — while the most elite firms reap the benefits of clients doubling down on the best in the event they do seek a larger outside counsel experience.

This is why we need [the Big 4 to swoop in](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/twilight-of-the-law-firms-the-big-4-are-poised-to-conquer-the-legal-landscape/) as the avenging angel of death to feast upon the souls of the Am Law Middle. To see them driven before PwC and to hear the lamentations of their managing partners.

It’s not going to be pretty, but it’s pretty clear that we’ll be writing this exact column every quarter until something drastic happens.

# Jones Day's Notorious Black Box Now Starts At $190K -- For Summer Associates
## Good news for first years, not so much for older associates.

The good news here is that summer associates (on a prorated basis) at Jones Day will receive a raise. Yesterday, the firm announced they were moving these extremely junior associates from the $180,000 rate to $190,000. That number sure sounds like the firm has moved to the new market compensation scale set earlier this week by Milbank, but the reality at Jones Day is more complicated.

UPDATE (06/08/18): But, as of now, that increase only means the NEXT class of associates will be getting the raise. First-years making $180K right now are still making their $180K.

See, Jones Day believes everyone is a special goddamned snowflake, and so, after their first year, associates receive individualized compensation. There’s no lockstep scale to go on, and nobody knows what anyone else makes (at both the associate and partner level). They’re not even supposed to talk about it. The firm claims this [“closed comp”](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/) or [“black box”](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/inside-straight-analyzing-black-box-compensation/) system breeds congeniality, but from Above the Law’s perspective, all it breeds is frustration.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
After the last round of raises in 2016, ATL spent [a lot of timing digging into the numbers behind Jones Day’s compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/?rf=1). What we found was — by and large — compensation below market rates and a lot of angry associates. Compounding the issue is another difference in the JD model: The firm doesn’t pay year-end or midyear bonuses; you get just your base salary. Midyear, you’re notified of what your base salary will be for the coming year, which allegedly should be above market to reflect the lack of bonuses, but is not so much the reality for associates on the ground. The new salary goes into effect on July 1, and then the following June you get your next pay raise letter, restarting the circle of compensation at JD.

The bulk of the compensation letters have yet to go out at JD, so associates more experienced than summers have no idea how the firm will stack up against the market… yet. But based on the historical data, things don’t look good.

Once associates at JD get their comp letters, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jones%20Day) (subject line: “Jones Day”) or text us (646-820-8477) with any and all information you have about your compensation or comp for other associates you know. You can provide a range for pay if you prefer doing that over giving an exact number, and you can give historical data (i.e., comp figures from prior years) if you’re more comfortable doing so.

We’d love another crack at opening up Jones Day’s black box.

Say what you will about the never-Trumpers turned into a political action committee marketing machine, The Lincoln Project, but they sure have made this election cycle interesting. Even those outside of the confines of Manhattan heard about their latest endeavor, a pair of Times Square billboards taking aim at Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and the Trump administration’s COVID-19 response.

And Kushner and Trump? Well, they’ve gotten a little lesson in the [Streisand effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)

You see, when The Lincoln Project put up the billboards featured below, Kushner and Trump decided to call in the lawyers.

The pair are represented by the Biglaw firm of Kasowitz Benson Torres. And none other than name partner Marc Kasowitz penned a cease and desist letter calling the billboards defamatory and threatening to sue: “Of course, Mr. Kushner never made any such statement, Ms. Trump never made any such gesture, and the Lincoln Project’s representations that they did are an outrageous and shameful libel. If these billboard ads are not immediately removed, we will sue you for what will doubtless be enormous compensatory and punitive damages.”

And though that legal move got even more people talking about the billboards, it wasn’t enough to stop The Lincoln Project. Their own lawyer, [Matthew Sanderson](http://www.capdale.com/msanderson) of Caplin & Drysdale, went to town tearing the proposition that the billboards in question would lead to any liability for the PAC. Saying, “Please peddle your scare tactics elsewhere. The Lincoln Project will not be intimidated by such empty bluster.”

The first, and most obvious, line of attack is that the First Amendment has repeatedly been held to project criticism of public figures. And the letter notes, “Your clients are no longer mere Upper East Side socialites, able to sue at the slightest offense to their personal sensibilities.”

“Public officials have periodically tried, as Kr. Kushner and Ms. Trump do here, to evade accountability and muzzle dissent by threatening or filing defamation lawsuits against critics. Fortunately, substantial constitutional protections are afforded to those who speak out about public officials.”

And besides, that “actual malice” standard is a pretty high bar.

But though sufficient, that is far from the only defense Sanderson has. “The Lincoln Project billboards are, in any event, are entirely accurate.” And then refers to a[ Vanity Fair article for the Kushner quote](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate) used in the billboard, and [Trump’s Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCpS4ewBpaV/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) to refute the bizarre claim that she never made “any such gesture.”

The letter also drops a footnote arguing that Kushner and Trump are libel-proof, which is a delightfully subtle way of dealing with the issue. But the closing, well, it seems that the PAC is more than willing to go to court over this issue:

“The Lincoln Project would welcome the opportunity to further establish the truthfulness of its Times Square billboards through litigation and discovery, so sue if you must. In the meantime, may I suggest that if Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump are genuinely concerned about salvaging their reputation, they would do well to stop suppressing truthful criticism and instead turn their attention to the COVID-19 crisis that is still unfolding under their inept watch. These billboards are not causing Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump’s standing with the public to plummet. Their incompetence is.

This isn’t over. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump will hear more from The Lincoln Project soon.”

A simple “come at me, bro” would have done the same job in fewer words.

The Lincoln Project’s legal response to the frivolous threat of a lawsuit from Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump’s lawyer.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Legal Malpractice Hitting 'Troubling New Heights'
## Firms on a lateral hiring spree need to be careful.

According [to a study by](https://amesgough.com/law-firms-see-u-s-legal-malpractice-claims-costs-soar-as-they-rush-to-cope-with-rapid-change/) insurance broker Ames & Gough, the cost of settling legal malpractice claims is rising — “reaching troubling new heights.” Eleven insurers were surveyed, representing malpractice insurance to 80 percent of the top 100 Biglaw firms, and it’s clear payouts under these policies are on the rise.

Of the 11 insurers surveyed, over the past two years, 10 made a claim payout of more than $50 million. Three participated in payouts in the $150 million to $300 million range, and four had claims of more than $300 million. However, due to claim limits and excess insurance, the study reports that it’s likely that multiple insurers participated in some of these big-ticket claims.

The report also identified the practice area with the most claims: trusts and estates, business transactions, and corporate and securities. Plus, insurance defense and taxation saw increases in claims.

And what types of errors are causing the issues, you ask? Conflict of interest, and clerical or scrivener’s errors lead the list. As the report notes:

“Given the larger size and increasing complexity of some business transactions, even an otherwise ‘simple mistake’ can lead to a large legal malpractice payout. Firms should be double- and triple-checking their work, with multiple eyes on the same document to ensure accuracy.”

The report also called out Biglaw’s booming lateral market. Though these moves are seen as a revenue stream for a lateral partner’s new firm, 35 percent of law firms have malpractice issues stemming from lateral partner hires.

# Latham Rocks The Bonus Market With A Very Special Bonus Announcement
## Stub-years are finally getting some special bonus cash!
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

Throughout the entirety of the 2021 bonus season, Biglaw’s most-junior associates — members of the Class of 2021 — have lamented the fact that at some firms, they’ve been left off the year-end bonus grid entirely, and at virtually all firms, they’ve been left off the special bonus track. Thanks to one of the most elite firms in the country, that ends now.

Just before Christmas Eve, Latham & Watkins — a firm that brought in $4,333,763,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 2 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — did something out of the ordinary and made a bonus move ahead of time. The firm is known for announcing its year-end bonuses in January (and they usually beat the going market rate). This year, the firm made an announcement in December, bringing extra holiday cheer to its attorneys.

Here’s the bonus scale that the firm is using. While it looks quite familiar, there’s one change that sure to please Latham’s youngest associates:



Unlike its peer firms, Latham is not Lathaming special bonuses for the Class of 2021. A major Biglaw firm is finally showing its newest associates some love in the form of special bonuses, and they’ll be bringing home $2,500.

Will any other law firms make an effort to match Latham’s largesse for stub-year associates? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see, but in this hot lateral market, offering up what amounts to a token amount of cash to the Class of 2021 should be an easy decision for law firm leaders to make.

Special bonuses at the firm will be paid on December 30, and its regular year-end bonuses will be announced and paid out in January 2022.

Congratulations to everyone at Latham!

Two weeks ago, I walked into a courtroom that was in recess, looking for my judge. I clerk for the senior judges, so most of them aren’t too difficult to catch up with. As I entered the courtroom, I didn’t recognize any faces. More pertinently, none of the faces recognized me. One of the Biglaw attorneys, a 40-ish looking woman with curly red hair — let’s call her Courtroom Karen — asked if she could help me. Now I was thinking, “This isn’t how things work! I’m the one with the staff badge and she was there on a visitor’s pass,” but I let it slide because I was in a hurry.

“Yeah, I’m looking for Judge A,” I said to her in an unconcerned tone as I scanned the large courtroom for my judge.

Karen looked at me, then at my staff ID, then back at me and sneered in what came across to me as her I’d-like-to-speak-to-the-manager voice, “This isn’t his courtroom! Judge A retired.”

Unfazed, I looked back at Courtroom Karen and told her, flatly, “He took on senior status last month. He was in this courtroom this morning. I’m his law clerk.”

Karen fumbled with her words a bit, “Oh well, um, I didn’t know.”

I turned around and left before she could utter another word. That interaction left me feeling both desolate and frustrated. Adding insult to injury? All this during Black History Month, too!

I’d like to think that interaction was unique but when it comes to clerking at the court, despite my professional attire, no one assumes I’m the law clerk. I’ve been asked if I was the court reporter, court officer, tipstaff, interpreter, witness, and defendant. I’ve even been asked to leave the courtroom. To the attorneys, I’m just another nameless, faceless court worker whho they don’t have to bother dealing with … until they do.

Piggybacking on that TikTok trend, “Yes, I’m a judicial law clerk. Of course, attorneys don’t bother introducing themselves to me until they realize I’m the one making recommendations on their motions to the judge.”

My experience of being called out as anything but the law clerk happens at EVERY SINGLE TRIAL I’m on. My judges routinely have to say, “No, she’s my law clerk.” Despite working in a diverse city, this scenario plays out week after week.

Once I’m introduced as the law clerk, suddenly the attorneys change their tune.  They want to introduce themselves. They ask for my email address. They give me their business cards. Over and over again, this happens every single trial.

I’m dressed up nicely just like everyone else. So it made me wonder … Is it the hair? Do I not look “professional” enough. Am I getting these reactions because I’m a Black woman with unapologetic natural hair? Or is simply being a Black face in a typically white space enough to trigger that reaction?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I’m far from the only Black woman who has endured these courtroom biases. In 2021, [Barrister Alexandra Wilson tweeted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9joVcbZYx4), “Today, I was assumed to be a defendant 3 times and a journalist once. There must be something about my face that says ‘not barrister’ because I am literally wearing a black suit like everyone else.”

This is my reality. Such “mistakes” or microaggressions can deeply affect one’s mental health and be very taxing. In a profession already riddled with impostor syndrome, the notion that as a Black woman I must not be the law clerk or attorney is further emphasized by the regular assertions that I must hold a different profession, rather than the judicial law clerk one I already hold.

In 2022, I, along with the [Black Law Students Association](https://sls.gmu.edu/blsa/) at George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School, held the [Black Hair Big Law Symposium.  ](https://blackhairbiglaw.com/)It was a global meeting of the minds where we discussed whether Black natural hair is compatible with working in Biglaw.

As part of the symposium, I conducted research and quantitative analysis on attitudes on Black hair for individuals working in the legal field: attorneys, paralegals, law clerks, etc. We asked questions such as, “How do you wear your hair to work?” and “Has a colleague or client ever remarked negatively about your hair?” You can read all about this survey in [Black Hair Big Law (Part II): The Harshest Critics Of Black Attorneys’ Hair](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/black-hair-big-law-part-ii-the-harshest-critics-of-black-attorneys-hair/) and the follow up article [Black Hair Big Law (Part III): ‘Professionalism,’ Work Hair, And Interview Hair](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/black-hair-big-law-part-iii-professionalism-work-hair-and-interview-hair/).

The last question asked, “Is there anything you’d like to tell us?” Wow, did we get a big response here!

What I found most jarring in the responses were the revelations that even within the judiciary, there were troubling reflections of prejudice. Judges, who should stand as bastions of fairness, were not exempt from displaying obvious bias against natural styles. For example, one attorney recalled a judge who critically commented on her wig. She wrote, “I had a Caucasian judge comment that my hair was wild and eccentric when I had a wig on.”

Another lawyer discussed that she felt it necessary to wear straightened hair to circumvent a common presumption faced by many Black attorneys — being mistaken for the court reporter or even the defendant instead of being assumed to be the attorney: “Depending on the court, I used to change my hair. As a Black woman in many jurisdictions, the court assumes I am either a party to the case or the court reporter. So I would style my hair differently and in fact, dress differently to set myself apart or rather to attempt to set myself apart.”

A third trial attorney observed that her hair seemed to be scrutinized as much as her legal argument. A fourth trial attorney recalled preparing for an oral argument before the First Circuit. “[I was] trying to decide if I should keep my braids in or wear some other style. I decided I needed to spend more time preparing for my argument than dealing with my hair and left the braids in. I realized that after years of attending arguments with my colleagues I had never seen a Black woman at all so either way I would stick out. Fortunately, I won my argument but if I had lost, I would have wondered if my hair had anything to do with the decision.”

Even Moot Court has presented issues for Black law students. “In law school, when in mock trial competitions my hair was judged and questioned by my coaches.”

A fifth trial attorney commented, “I never want my appearance to be a distraction, hair included. Practicing in courts in which mostly white men practice and preside, makes me think about how my appearance may affect the perceived effectiveness of my advocacy.”

Dealing with daily biases, encountering Courtroom Karens, facing routine microaggressions, and striving for genuine acknowledgment means that clerking while Black ain’t easy.

The insights I gained from organizing and leading the Black Hair Big Law Symposium have been enlightening, enhancing my appreciation for my natural hair. I am thankful for the chance to wear my natural coily hair to work, free from the pressure to straighten it.

I’d like to extend my gratitude to George Mason’s Black Law Students Association and the American Bar Association. A special thanks to MothersEsquire for making this Black Hair Big Law Series possible on Above the Law.

# Law Firm Closing Up Its Offices For The Month Of August
## They're going fully remote this summer.

One of the lessons of the COVID pandemic that the legal industry has learned is that remote work works. Sure, a fully remote workplace may have issues establishing a positive culture or with training young associates, but we know that top-notch legal work can happen outside of the office.

The real question for many law firms is striking the right balance of flexibility and capturing the intangible benefits of working alongside your colleagues. Some firms have decided to go with a limited number of days in the office per week, some have monthly in-office requirements, while others are just crossing their fingers and hoping it all works out.

But Seward & Kissel recently announced a new twist to their remote work policy that’s pretty exciting.

Like the European summer shutdowns Americans have heard so much about, the firm of Seward & Kissel is shutting down this August. Well, that’s not entirely accurate, the firm decided they’d be going fully remote for the month of August (July 28th – September 4th). So folks will still be working, but they just might be doing it from an oceanfront beach house watching the tide roll in. That is… not the worst way to work.

In the announcement, available in full below, the firm’s managing partner James Cofer also noted the firm would be fully remote the week of Thanksgiving and the last week of December, greatly increasing their employees’ flexibility in those high travel weeks.

Of course there is the standard caveat that if a particular matter requires office time, folks should be ready to meet those client needs. But establishing that the default presumption that work will be fully remote during these times is a solid benefit I’m sure associates at the firm appreciate.

Is your firm also innovating new remote work policies? We’d love to hear about it! If your firm has an interesting work-from-home policy, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Remote Work”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# 'Arrested In Dawn Raids' Is Certainly One Way For A Law Firm To End

Axiom DWFM ([not to be confused with legal services provider Axiom Law](https://www.axiomlaw.com/)) was a UK law firm on the rise. As its LinkedIn page described the firm’s upward trajectory, “we are now becoming the preferred legal partner to many businesses within London, across the UK and internationally.” To further fuel that growth, Axiom DWFM started acquiring other firms, specifically Plexus and Ince.

Why do the UK firms all sound like late-night infomercial products?

The combined firm, Axiom Ince, employed around 1400 people. It is decidedly not the preferred legal partner of many businesses anymore. Let’s check out the website: Well, that’s not great.

[And it gets worse](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/seven-arrested-axiom-ince-dawn-raids)!

The Serious Fraud Office has arrested seven people in dawn raids as it launches a criminal investigation into the suspected theft of £66m of client money from collapsed law firm [Axiom Ince](https://www.rollonfriday.com/taxonomy/term/1652).

Early on Tuesday morning more than 80 SFO investigators and Met police officers bashed doors down at nine locations across the south of England to grab their targets and carry out searches.

The theory of the case is that the “£66m of client money” got diverted [to fund the mergers and further growth](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/11/axiom-ince-dawn-raids-and-arrests-as-serious-fraud-office-launches-probe/), making this a sort of law firm Ponzi scheme.

And the allegations read like something out of a Madoff documentary:

Modhwadia is [accused](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/modhwadia-allegedly-forged-bank-letter-trick-pinsent-masons) of doctoring a letter from the State Bank of India so it falsely showed that it was holding a £57m sum missing from the firm’s Barclays client account. He is alleged to have given the forged letter to [Pinsent Masons](https://www.rollonfriday.com/firm/pinsent-masons), which he had instructed to represent Axiom Ince in the SRA investigation, and Pinsents dutifully passed the letter to the regulator.

According to RollOnFriday’s reporting, Axiom’s founder and sole shareholder Pragnesh Modhwadia was somehow NOT one of the folks arrested this week, even though his house was among those searched.

The ongoing liberty of Pragnesh Modhwadia, Axiom’s founder and sole shareholder, has left ROF commenters baffled after he [admitted](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/axiom-inces-missing-millions-all-spent) spending most of the missing money.

Yeah, that is a stumper.

# Fighting An Asymmetrical Battle In Litigation
## If lawyers at smaller firms take certain steps they can be on an equal, if not far superior, playing field against bigger law firms.

Over the course of my career, I have worked for both large and smaller law firms. Some people may think that bigger law firms have all the advantages in litigation since they can deploy the most resources and talent to handle a given legal issue. However, smaller firms have many advantages of their own and can adopt strategies to effectively litigate cases against larger law firms. There are a few strategies that lawyers at smaller firms can employ when litigating against larger firms that may have more resources.

One of the benefits of larger law firms is that they can put numerous lawyers and other legal professionals on a project in order to produce work product on a tight deadline. Smaller law firms may have difficulty producing work product in a short amount of time because smaller law firms usually have fewer attorneys and less bandwidth that can be devoted to legal matters. Of course, there are ways in which that work can be farmed out to other lawyers, but that might not be an option depending on the finances of a case.

However, if small firm lawyers plan, conduct research, and begin writing work product early enough, they can be on an equal, if not far superior, playing field against bigger law firms. For instance, earlier in my career, I believed that I would be on the receiving end of a massive motion to dismiss filed by a large law firm. In order to prepare for the inevitable motion practice, I started beginning my opposition research even before the lawsuit was filed. This also had the added benefit of allowing me to review copious materials related to my causes of action, and I was able to bolster my papers prospectively in order to account for arguments that could be made against my causes of action.

Of course, lawyers cannot predict everything that another attorney will argue in motion practice. In addition, it rarely makes sense to write a facts section or other elements of papers too far in advance, and if a motion is never filed, the work done on opposition research is mostly wasted. However, if the finances of the case permit work to be performed far in advance, it often pays to perform such work, especially since this could offer numerous benefits to the representation.

One of the easiest ways to defeat motions is to point out how the motion or other part of the litigation process is procedurally defective. Lawyers at Biglaw firms may not know as much about the procedures of certain jurisdictions, especially state courts, since they do not often engage in the same volume of cases as small-firm lawyers and are often in federal court where bigger cases are usually litigated. Earlier in my career, I remember watching a partner at a large law firm being forced to attend CCP in Brooklyn and being befuddled by the procedures there, even though any street lawyer would have been able to handle the process with ease.

In any event, judges love to decide matters on procedural grounds since they often need to do less work this way, and showing how Biglaw lawyers made procedural mistakes can be a good method of asymmetrical litigation. For instance, I once had to oppose a nasty motion to compel and spoliation motion, and the papers were very well written. However, the jurisdiction required that lawyers submit an affirmation noting how they tried to resolve a matter before seeking judicial intervention, and this was not adequately done in our case. I pointed out to the court that the required affirmation had not been supplied, and this was the basis for denying the motion. In this way, a few paragraphs of argument were able to defeat a motion that was dozens of pages long.

Financial Pressure

In some ways, lawyers at small firms can use the financial pressures of litigation in order to face off against larger law firms. Biglaw firms often charge several times more per hour than smaller firms. Moreover, smaller law firms are far more likely to have alternative fee arrangements with their clients which might eliminate financial burdens from the equation of pursuing strategies in litigation. Of course, in some matters, large clients will pay any cost in order to be successful in litigation, and in such cases, financial issues may not make a large impact on cases.

However, in smaller and medium cases, smaller firms can sometimes play a war of attrition against larger law firms because each motion, deposition, discovery demand, and other aspect of the litigation may cost the client of a large law firm several times more than the client of a smaller law firm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
All told, larger law firms definitely have many advantages in litigation, and there is a reason why many large companies hire large law firms for serious matters. Nevertheless, smaller law firms can still litigate against larger law firms using a variety of asymmetrical litigation tactics which can have benefits to clients of smaller law firms.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Hint: “Litigation performed at the expected level,” the firm’s co-chair of the executive committee said. “It was a good year in litigation. [The firm’s financial] decline was attributed entirely to our corporate practice, which is highly dependent on the capital markets and M&A transactions. With headwinds within geopolitical situations and inflation worries, the leveraged finance market was down about 75%. That was what contributed to us falling off where we were in 2021.”

# Local Counsel Might Be Better Than Traveling Counsel
## Costs alone are not the only good reason why it sometimes pays to hire local counsel.

Many clients wish to use only certain lawyers or law firms to handle as much of their legal work as possible. Clients might build strong relationships with their counsel over a long time, and clients might not trust other attorneys to provide the same work quality that their trusted lawyers can provide. However, in certain instances, it might be better for clients to hire local counsel than to have their trusted counsel travel to distant locations, especially if counsel is not familiar with the jurisdiction in which they are to provide services.

Earlier in my career, I traveled a ton for depositions and court conferences for a few large clients. Once or twice a month, I would need to travel to a city about 350 miles from my home to appear at uncomplicated court conferences on behalf of the client. Typically, it would take me all day to travel to court and return home. Not only would the client need to pay for my appearance and travel time, the transportation costs could run to thousands of dollars.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
At these court conferences, a ton of local counsel appeared for numerous co-defendants in the cases. The lawyers who were local to the city where we needed to appear probably spent less than 30 minutes walking from their offices to the courthouse and had no transportation costs associated with their appearances. Of course, I loved the easy billing, and traveling was usually a lot of fun so long as there were no flight delays, but I did not understand why our clients did not hire local counsel instead of paying exorbitant costs to have us appear at standard court conferences.

Costs alone are not the only good reason why it sometimes pays to hire local counsel. Sometimes, an out-of-state lawyer can present a distraction to a court, which might not reflect well on a client. I was once sitting in a courtroom, in which counsel for dozens of defendants were assembled for a given mass torts matter. Counsel for one of the defendants stood up to argue a motion before the court and in front of all the lawyers and others who were present.

The lawyer began speaking, and he had a very thick southern accent. The judge was a very senior jurist, and he interrupted the lawyer after a short while to ask where the lawyer was from, and I believe the judge also asked why the client had sent this lawyer to argue the matter. This was all pretty distracting, and I can’t help but think this might have had negative consequences on the matter.

On the other side of this coin, I once worked as a local counsel hired by an Oklahoma-based company. We had to argue an important motion, and the company’s outside general counsel, from Oklahoma, came to town to see the motion argued. While preparing for oral argument, the out-of-state attorney said that he did not want to pro hac vice into the case since he felt that a local counsel might do a better job advocating for the client. To some extent, the lawyer may have been correct, since the partner in my office who argued the case just presented the arguments and did not need to answer questions about where he came from and why he was there.

Of course, several solid reasons exist for having one trusted lawyer or law firm handle matters even if they need to travel to make appearances and even if they might need to submit pro hac vice papers. Some clients do not want to deal with multiple lawyers or law firms for administrative purposes since it is a pain to pay and oversee multiple attorneys. Some clients might think it is worth it to hire one lawyer for more matters notwithstanding transportation costs for this reason. Also, sometimes clients believe that a particular lawyer will perform a better job than other attorneys and are willing to pay a premium for this value.

However, clients can get better value from local counsel in a variety of circumstances. Attorneys should be more willing to suggest this option if it makes sense for a client in a given circumstance.

Today’s topic: life as a lawyer representing startup companies.

1. What do you do in a typical day?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It really depends on what the clients have going on, as tech startup practices tend to be much more client-driven than deal-driven. When a number of clients do have significant transactions on the table—like a venture financing, an IPO or a sale of the company—those transactions usually take precedence over the more routine work other clients need on a day-to-day basis. Startup lawyers spend most of a typical day working on bigger transactions for their clients (to the extent they have any at the moment), while trying to spend the short lulls in between handling small questions or requests from clients that don’t have active deals pending. It can be a lot to juggle!

2. Who do you work with?

Attorneys in this practice area work very closely with the founders and executives at their startup company clients, and eventually the company’s general counsel (once the company has reached a stage where they’ve hired an in-house lawyer). Attorneys representing investors work directly with the venture capitalist making the investment and possibly the fund’s GC or COO. Whichever side startup lawyers are on, they’re likely also interacting a lot with lawyers representing the counterparties on the transactions.

Within a law firm, fairly junior attorneys work with either a partner or senior associate. They also often consult with the firm’s specialists in executive compensation, employment, IP and commercial transactions, and tax, as these are the areas outside of corporate/securities where most startups have frequent legal questions and issues.

3. What does a common career path look like?

Startup practice provides some interesting opportunities for junior lawyers because of the sheer volume of clients. Because there are so many smaller, early-stage clients, senior associates often play a larger role in managing client relationships, and junior associates have a lot more client contact and responsibility earlier than they would in some other practice areas. Partners rely on junior lawyers to manage the day-to-day in order to provide the client with an accessible on-demand resource and to keep the client’s costs down. This gives junior startup lawyers the opportunity to develop more quickly, though it also means that junior lawyers need to demonstrate good judgment, maturity and independence early in their careers. That substantial early experience can come in handy, whether these attorneys eventually become law firm partners, go in-house at companies or VC funds, or launch startups of their own.

4. If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?

Muy caliente! Startup lawyers, despite being at law firms, typically function as general counsel for their startup clients because early-stage companies rarely have in-house legal resources. As a result, startup lawyers end up fielding a wide variety of questions and requests, only some of which are strictly legal in nature. As with any in-house legal role, when lawyers work directly with business teams and are their first stop for any quasi-legal question, every day brings new surprises. Interestingly, law students often have the opposite impression of startup practice—they tend to think it’s highly specialized and sometimes opt for the well-trodden path to a white-shoe corporate firm (where they can rotate through different practice areas), because they think it will provide them with more variety.

5. How much wear and tear?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
When startup lawyers spend most of their time working on the company side, they can get stretched pretty thin. Startups like to move very quickly (as Facebook once put it, they aim to “move fast and break things”)—which can be especially hard on their lawyers, who are usually managing dozens of active companies. First-time founders, in particular, often have unrealistic expectations about how long deals—and legal work, in general—should take. Thus, it’s a constant negotiation, not with the other side but with the startup lawyer’s own client, about timing expectations. Take that trend and multiply it by the many startup companies these lawyers are representing at any given time, and the pace can become challenging.

On the investor side, it’s often a bit better. There’s typically less work to do when representing investors, and the client is also usually more sophisticated about how these deals get done (since they do deals for a living). VCs tend to be easier to work with than investment bankers or private equity investors. Having a nice mix between company representations and investor-side deals can make a startup lawyer’s workload more bearable.

6. Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?

Many have complaints that are common among most corporate lawyers, with work/life balance probably at the top of the heap. Some startup lawyers find it increasingly frustrating to explain the same things repeatedly to unsophisticated company founders. Venture financing deals can also be very formulaic, which means attorneys often find themselves negotiating the same few points on every deal (which can get old quickly). Finally, there’s a lot of fee pressure with cost-sensitive startup clients, making some attorneys practicing in the space feel like the clients don’t value their work.

7. Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?

Many lawyers go into corporate law because they’re also interested in the business side. Unlike most corporate lawyers, however, startup lawyers are regularly asked to give business advice to their company clients. These clients, many of whom are launching a business for the first time, turn to their lawyers for help with deal terms as well as advice on finding and managing investors, and startup lawyers often enjoy being a business and strategic adviser in addition to a legal counselor.

Startup lawyers also enjoy being the first to know about a lot of interesting developments in the technology space and having clients working on cool or interesting products and services. Another plus for many junior startup lawyers is that they have the ability to bring in business early in their careers, since there are more prospective clients in their age cohort and personal networks than would usually be the case in other practice areas.

8. Are there common avenues out of this practice area?

As with most other areas of law, a small minority of the lawyers who start out in this field end up becoming partners in big law firms. Many startup lawyers end up moving client-side, either to their startup company clients or to VC funds (where they often take GC/COO roles). Some lawyers who go into this type of practice do so because they think they eventually want to launch their own startups. Experience in a law firm startup practice can also prepare lawyers for eventually striking out on their own and hanging a shingle.

9. What are some market trends that impact this practice area?

Startup practices can sometimes be countercyclical, because people who are laid off in economic downturns often decide to start their own businesses. However, by and large, this practice area is closely tied to the strength of the VC funding market, as well as M&A and IPO activity.

After significant increases in private company valuations in recent years, there has been a lot of talk among tech industry observers that we may be in the midst of another tech bubble (albeit of a different sort than we saw in the late ’90s). Though there have been some signs that startup financing markets have taken a breather of late, the party does not appear to be over quite yet.

10. If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?

This practice area requires a lot of soft skills: interpersonal skills, communication skills and pragmatic judgment. While it’s not strictly necessary, a demonstrated interest in tech can help land a job at a firm specializing in representing startups, as jobs in startup law practices have become highly coveted in the last few years. Finally, successful junior associates in this area need to be self-starters—being proactive with clients and issue spotting before a problem becomes a problem turns a junior lawyer into a trusted adviser in short order.

# Biglaw Firms Want Summer Associates Working In Person -- Which Means Lawyers Need To Show Up, Too
## Some firms are asking summers to work from the office three or four days each week.

Firms are doing lots of things to encourage participation from attorneys in summer associate activities. Firms understand that summer associates are their future. So I expect there will be strong participation.

— [Grover Cleveland](https://lessonsforsharks.com/bio/), a law career success consultant with [Lessons for Sharks](https://lessonsforsharks.com/), commenting on what may be in store for Biglaw attorneys during their firms’ summer associateship programs. Cleveland is running in-person [trainings for summer associates](https://lessonsforsharks.com/sa-programs/) at about 20 firms this year. According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firms-hope-see-summer-associates-office-least-most-week-2022-05-06/), unlike in 2020 and 2021, many firms are requiring in-person attendance from their summers at least three (Cooley, Skadden, and Orrick) or four (Mayer Brown and Vinson & Elkins) days each week.

# Biglaw Firm Reverses Austerity Measures And Associates Will Receive True-Up Payments -- If They Bill Enough
## The firm's come a long way since attorney layoffs.

There’s good news at Dorsey & Whitney! The Am Law 100 firm, which [underwent a series](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/am-law-100-firm-cuts-retirement-benefits-and-makes-other-cost-cutting-moves/) of [COVID-19 austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/biglaw-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-and-salary-cuts/?rf=1), has reversed course.

The big news is that the pay cuts that defined the firm’s austerity measures are a thing of the past, effective this month. That means for associates, who took a 15 percent pay cut, their yearly compensation will be 95 percent of their base. And, as the email from Managing Partner William R. Stoeri notes, there is the ability for associates to earn their full compensation — if they bill enough:

For associates and others with the true-up option, that option remains but starts at 95%; you will get 95% of salary regardless of hours and if your guideline hours come in above 95%, you will receive a corresponding proportion up to and including all of the remaining 5%.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
You can read the full memo [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/dorsey-rollbacks/2/%E2%80%8E).

Reactions from insiders at the firm has been pretty positive — who doesn’t want to see their firm recover from the economic ravages of COVID, especially since the firm had to make[ attorney layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/biglaw-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-and-salary-cuts/?rf=1) as part of its austerity measures? But there is a downside. A tipster reveals what’s been going on with year-end bonuses at the firm:

The downside is the firm is still hemming and hawing on whether any bonuses will happen. Of course, as a midwest cow-town firm (albeit one with NYC presence and once or twice making the Vault 100 ranks in ancient history), no one was expecting bonuses right now but associates seem unwilling to work any harder unless there’s a guarantee that there will be bonuses as per the internal (although still very black-box) mileposts and guidelines in effect prior to COVID-19. As of now, associates seem to have no incentive to work any harder than meeting the minimum hours.

Overall, though, people are really happy and appreciative of this decision. We are finally the best firm in Minneapolis. We don’t need mega mergers to prove ourselves and try too hard. Midwest side till I die….

At least insiders seem to see the upside in all this.

# Lawyers Should Usually Bcc Less When Emailing
## Lawyers need to implement practices and procedures that minimize risk of exposing confidential communications and increase efficiency.

This website has covered a number of “reply all” fiascos at law firms, law schools, and in other parts of the legal profession over the years. As we all know from firsthand experience, even though email is pretty easy to use, some functions can cause trouble from time to time. One email practice that leads to problems and inefficiency is bcc’ing. For those who do not know, bcc (which stands for “[blind carbon copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_carbon_copy)”) is a practice in which a party is added to an email, but other recipients of that email do not know that the bcc’ed person received it. Although it may be convenient for lawyers to loop in clients or other attorneys without other people knowing that the message has been circulated to additional parties, bcc’ing can be fraught with issues.

One common practice within the legal profession is to forward relevant emails sent by counsel to clients so that clients can be apprised of updates on matters. Some clients separately forward emails to their clients so that they can selectively circulate important exchanges. However, forwarding a message requires separate effort from a lawyer. By placing the client in a bcc line, the lawyer can ensure that a client receives the message without extra effort.

However, it is more likely that a client will have a “reply all” mishap when they are bcc’ed on a message than when a message is forwarded to them. When a client replies all to a forwarded message, just the lawyer and anyone the lawyer specifically added to the message will be responded to. However, if the client replies all to a bcc’ed message, they will reply to everyone on the original message, which can include opposing counsel and others.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Numerous times in my career, I have seen this happen. Indeed, sometimes, I have seen client and lawyer engaging in discussions through email because of a bcc reply all mishap, not knowing that an opposing counsel was on the chain until several emails had been exchanged back and forth. Not only can this be embarrassing, but clients and their lawyers can reveal confidential information that they do not wish to expose, and this can have a negative impact on a representation. Lawyers should try to do everything in their power to keep attorney-client communications from being revealed, and this usually means that they should rely less on the bcc function in their email.

Bcc’ing can also lead to confusion among lawyers and other stakeholders to a legal matter since individuals may not know who knows what information and who should be told about developments. There are often numerous parties involved in a legal matter. This includes lawyers, clients (which, for organizations, can involve numerous people) accountants, experts, staffs of lawyers, and other professionals. It is usually important to know which professionals are in the loop so that individuals can avoid duplicative efforts.

One time when I was in Biglaw, I prepared a summary of happenings in a case to date for a partner who I assumed had not been involved to that point. However, the partner told me later that he was being bcc’ed on most messages and that he was pretty well apprised of the content of the emails and the happenings in a case. If the partner’s involvement in the emails was out in the open, like in the cc line of the emails, I would have known that the lawyer knew significant information related to the case and did not need a separate summary.

Moreover, and this point is subjective and definitely open to debate, there seems to be something surreptitious (or at least nontransparent) about sending messages to others using bcc. People usually assume that all of the recipients of a message are listed on an email either in the to or cc line, and most people do not consider that parties might be bcc’ed on a message. Parties might take a different approach if they think all of the contemporaneous recipients of an email are visible. Of course, it is commonly understood among lawyers that emails are usually not confidential. Indeed, everyone knows that emails can be forwarded to all types of parties, used during motion practice, and are otherwise shared. However, sending a message contemporaneously to a party unbeknownst to the other recipients of that message can seem duplicative, and accordingly, lawyers should give more thought about when they should bcc parties to email messages.

All told, lawyers need to implement practices and procedures that minimize risk of exposing confidential communications and increase efficiency in the operation of a law practice. For a variety of reasons, reducing the times a lawyer uses the bcc function of an email platform can increase transparency and minimize the chances of a “reply all” or other mishaps while using email.

# Office Politics: Are You Safely Navigating The Waters Of Your Firm?
## If you’re not thoughtfully analyzing the political landscape of your firm, you are self-imposing a ceiling on your career advancement.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. Eamon Welch is based in Massachusetts where he oversees attorney placements and client services in the Boston and New York markets. Prior to joining Lateral Link, Eamon practiced law in Goodwin Procter’s Boston office and Greenberg Traurig’s Miami office. Eamon earned his J.D. magna cum laude and Order of the Coif from the University of Miami School of Law, and he also holds an M.A. from Duke University and a B.A. from Trinity College.

It’s the end of November and we’re rapidly approaching annual review season for Biglaw associates. Bill 2100 hours? Check. Complete assignments on time? Check. Turn in error-free work product? Check. Job security, maximum bonus, and promotion guaranteed as a result? Nope.

Too often, associates at all levels overlook or neglect the importance of office politics — to their own detriment. It’s easy to say “I’ll let my work speak for itself” or simply dismiss office politics as unsavory. But don’t be mistaken: office politics mater. If you’re not thoughtfully analyzing the political landscape of your firm and practice group and positioning yourself accordingly, you are self-imposing a ceiling on your career advancement.

Here are some considerations and tips that, if incorporated, will allow you to maximize your professional trajectory at your firm:

- Not all partners are created equal. Although you should always endeavor to do your best work for all supervising attorneys and make them happy, the reality is that there’s a partner hierarchy. Does your firm have multiple partnership tracks (i.e., equity vs. non-equity)? Equity partners have more influence. There are exceptions, such as a young non-equity partner who’s known as a rising star or a soon-to-be-retired equity partner who’s handed off all of his clients, but 9 times out of 10, this is the case. Which partners have substantial books of business? Those partners who generate more revenue for their firm typically enjoy a higher standing (just because a partner often works for a certain client doesn’t mean that he or she is the relationship partner for that client and credited by the firm accordingly). Are there partners who consistently work on deals or try cases that make the Wall Street Journal or receive attention in industry periodicals? Generally speaking, partners renowned in their area of practice are well-regarded internally. Do partners whom you frequently work for sit on the executive committee or otherwise hold leadership positions in the firm or their practice group? Firm leadership can have a greater impact on your career. The more you can align yourself with partners who hold sway at your firm or in your practice group, the better off you’ll be. Again, the point isn’t to discount the importance of junior or less influential partners (as treating them differently would be detrimental to your career), but simply to highlight an internal firm reality.
 

- Be nice, be likable — to everyone. This one should be self-evident, but it’s amazing how many associates disregard it, particularly when they encounter non-attorneys/support staff. It costs you nothing to smile and say hello when you pass a colleague in the hall or are waiting for a cup of coffee to brew, and it contributes to making the office a friendlier environment. People talk, and it’s much better to have a reputation as someone who’s “nice” than someone who’s a “jerk.” Another mistake junior/midlevel associates make is overestimating their value to partners vis-à-vis non-attorneys. An experienced paralegal or a long-time assistant is often far more valuable to a senior partner than a new junior associate, keep that in mind. In a similar vein, it’s in the self-interest of senior associates to treat more junior associates well; you’d rather have your deal or case team motivated to work hard than phoning it in. You don’t want to be the senior associate whom no junior associate wants to work for — that’s not helpful for your reputation around the firm.
 

- Reviews. In addition to written commentary, many firms have a system where, prior to each review period, partners discuss in detail the performance of associates in their department. These discussions can influence, among other things, final reviews, bonus amounts, class-year advancement, and actual retention. Find out who the vocal advocates are in these meetings and have them — or at least one of them — on your side. It does you no good to spend all of your time working for a partner(s) who won’t champion you internally.
 

- Show up. Make an effort to attend firm and firm-sponsored events. You don’t have to devote every second that you’re not logging .1s to socializing with your colleagues. But presence at major firm happenings and informal gatherings is important, whether expressly required or not. Think about it: in many cases, partners have committed most, if not all, of their careers to a particular firm. Accordingly, the firm is a significant part of their lives. Moreover, the overall health of the firm directly affects their financial well-being. Partners implicitly expect a certain personal investment in the firm from Associates; constant lack of attendance doesn’t go unnoticed…
 

- Geographic office and practice group. This item is beyond your individual control, but it’s a material factor in the overall calculus. Is your city the firm’s headquarters, or is it a satellite office? If it’s a satellite office, does the office originate its own clients and matters, or does it function to service overflow work from the firm’s headquarters? Is your practice group prominent internally and standalone, or is it complementary to more prioritized practice groups? The nearer you are to the center of your firm’s action, the better positioned you’ll be. It’s harder to get internal traction when your office or practice group is less central to the firm’s strategy.
 

- Assisting with client development and client relations. Contributing to client development and client relations is another way to improve your standing. You don’t need to originate an eight-figure client to offer value on this front; there are many more minor actions that you can take to pitch in. Is your firm hosting a training for one of its marquee clients? Volunteer to participate. Is a client being honored at an industry event and your firm has purchased a table? Go if invited. Did you learn that one of the business contacts at a firm client was promoted or read an informative article about a company that your firm represents? Pass the information along to the relationship partner. These small measures demonstrate to partners that you understand the importance of client development and how crucial it is to your firm’s operations.
 

- Get to know your colleagues. Yes, some firm cultures are more formal than others, and some attorneys are more reserved about their personal lives. But when you’re working with other attorneys at your firm, there’s usually some opportunity get to know them personally. Despite the impression that Biglaw associates and partners have no lives outside of the office, that’s rarely ever the case. Find out about your colleagues’ families, hobbies, and interests. When you get to know your colleagues on a more personal level, it enhances your working relationship and general interactions with them.
 

- Promotion and slowdown. All else being equal, firms will promote associates whom they like, politically, to partnership. If partnership is your goal, it’s critical that you don’t stumble upon this realization the year that you’re being evaluated for elevation. You also want to be safe during a slowdown. Three centuries ago, Newtonian physics taught us that what goes up, must come down. Although the legal economy is thriving now (and hopefully it will be for many more years to come!), probability dictates that growth will slow down eventually. If and when the next recession strikes, it’s harder for a firm to let go of someone whom people genuinely like; it’s much easier to dismiss someone whom people dislike or don’t really know.
In conclusion, ask yourself if you’ve been successfully navigating the political waters of your firm and practice group. If not, the good news is that you can start fresh and implement the tips in this article from the beginning.

# Bonus Season Should Already Be In Full Swing, But Biglaw Is Waiting For Cravath To Make A Move
## When will the rest of this year's bonuses (and salary increases) be announced? Stay tuned!

It’s November 20, and Thanksgiving is just days away, which means that Biglaw’s full-blown bonus season is nearly upon us. In fact, bonus season should already be here. As our readers know all too well, Milbank was the [first to announce bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) on November 7, but not a single firm has announced a match yet. How could that be? Almost two full business weeks have passed. It’s all because of the pesky $10K salary increase across all class years that accompanied the compensation leader’s year-end bonus scale. At this point, all eyes are on Cravath to give associates a little something extra to be thankful for this year.

While we impatiently wait for the next bonus to be announced, let’s chat about bonuses for a moment, shall we? This is what [Milbank’s bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) look like (and they match last year’s [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cravath-bonuses-22/) bonuses):

- Class of 2023 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016 – $115,000
- Class of 2015 – $115,000
As we noted in our [annual bonus survey report](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/for-how-much-biglaw-associates-are-billing-they-arent-expecting-anything-special-this-bonus-season/), associates weren’t really expecting any kind of special bonus on top of their regular bonuses this year, much less a raise. Maybe some insight into when bonuses are generally announced will ease associates’ minds as to when bonus — and hopefully raise! — reason will finally begin. Here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

- 2022: November 21 ([Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/)); November 29 ([Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cravath-bonuses-22/))

Cravath tends to stick to a schedule as far as these things are concerned, and the firm likes to announce its bonus news on Mondays (usually the last Monday in November). But with another firm in the race and a salary increase added to the mix, Cravath may have a timing surprise up its sleeve. When will the firm announce a bonus match? Will the firm also announce a salary match? Either could happen, perhaps even as soon as later this afternoon.

The best thing for associates to do while they wait is to just keep billing, just keep billing, just keep billing. In the meantime, we’ll be right here along with you, waiting on bonuses to be announced. Tick tock, Cravath….

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# Biglaw Firm Continues To Bleed Lawyers, Business Leaders In Search For Merger Partner
## This firm is leaking lawyers like a sieve.

Try as it might, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan is still facing difficulties in its efforts to find a merger partner, and those difficulties are making it hard for the firm to hold onto its partners and business-side leaders, much less recruit new partners.

When we last checked in with the firm, Stroock had officially [dumped its pension liabilities](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/biglaw-firm-dumps-its-problematic-pension-to-find-merger-partner/) through a buyout. Despite that, the firm is still losing lawyers, and now its business leaders are heading to the exits as well. As noted by the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/08/23/stroock-loses-business-side-leaders-as-uncertain-merger-future-poses-recruiting-challenges/), the two most recent departures on the firm’s business side include Regina Robbins, director of talent acquisition, and Jessica Grayson, managing director of business development and marketing.

In an interview with the NYLJ, Robbins said leaders at Stroock told her she could “ride out” recruitment challenges their merger talks posed, pleading that she “please don’t go anywhere.” Here are some additional details:

Robbins said publicity of Stroock’s merger discussion with other firms, following the departure of 43 restructuring lawyers to Paul Hastings, made it difficult to laterally recruit new partners. Stroock previously entered some form of merger talks with several firms, including McGuireWoods, Steptoe & Johnson, Squire Patton Boggs and Nixon Peabody, but has yet to find a fit, The American Lawyer has previously reported.

“Joining Stroock, my goal was to focus on partner hiring…We were seeing a lot of success,” Robbins said. “When the information was getting out in the marketplace about the Paul Hastings group and about the merger talks, it was difficult to help the firm find partners and grow.”

“When it’s out there in the media, even though everyone knows it’s just [firms] talking, it’s enough to create questions in people’s minds,” Robbins told the NYLJ. “Even when it’s correct, it creates enough of a question mark.”

Hopefully Stroock is able to stop accumulating so many question marks as it attempts to find a new merger partner.

# Stat Of The Week: Lawyers On ‘Jeopardy!’
## How the legal industry crossed paths with an iconic show.

As the world continues to mourn the loss of Alex Trebek, many are visiting the “J! Archive” database, where “Jeopardy!” superfans have compiled clues and contestants from 37 seasons of the show. 

[The “J! Archive”](http://www.j-archive.com/) reveals that the legal industry was significantly represented among contestants: A search for “attorney” brings up 691 player results, and “lawyer” brings up 261. (These include a few “Teen Tournament” and “College Championship” players who said they were considering a career in the law, as well as some duplicate appearances.)

Over the years, Above the Law has detailed instances where the legal industry crossed paths with the show, noting that “Jeopardy!” [could be a source of meme-age anxiety](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/law-school-professor-appears-on-jeopardy-tonight-shes-pretty-sure-she-didnt-do-anything-embarrassing/) for the lawyers who appeared and that attorneys have provided [substantial fodder](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/did-you-notice-jeopardy-had-a-law-firms-category/) for its 400,000-plus clues.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Indeed, the “J! Archive” shows that “lawyer” and “attorney” have a combined 954 results in the clues from the Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, and Tiebreaker rounds. The terms have also made 21 Final Jeopardy appearances — including two whose correct response is “Who is Atticus Finch?” and one correctly answered by “Who is Harper Lee?” 

And while we continue to grieve the loss of the show’s host, many “Jeopardy!” fans have discussed potential successors. One of Trebek’s own suggestions?
