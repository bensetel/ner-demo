From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Like some of today’s other movers, Mintz isn’t known for being quick on the salary draw — [back in 2018, it took almost two months](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/?rf=1) for the firm to match. It really makes you wonder exactly what’s different this time around….

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# The Circuit: Vegas, Baby!
## Why is Las Vegas such a magnet for legal conferences?

Ed. note: This is the third piece by Above the Law’s newest legal technology columnist, [Monica Bay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/monica-bay-1525707). In case you missed them, you can read her prior posts [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/the-circuit-legaltech-new-york-2016/) and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/the-circuit-warm-up-to-e-discovery/?rf=1).

Got an itch for [Las Vegas](http://www.lvcva.com)? There’s a good bet that you could find a [convention](http://www.lasvegastourism.com/conventions_apr.htm) to attend this month, whether you are a legal professional—or a radiology business manager, excavation safety expert, pizza shop owner, tobacco connoisseur, digital signage executive, doctor or veterinarian, travel adviser, financial services specialist, member of the Western Political Science Association—or if you need a tutorial in musculoskeletal imaging. Among the law/legal tech-related March options are the Annual Corporate Counsel Conference & National Moot Court Competition and Adobe Summit 2016.

There’s no question that many legal organizations favor Vegas. For example, the International Legal Technology Association’s annual conference was held there in 2010 (ARIA), 2013 and 2015 (Caesars Palace) and will go back next year (Mandalay Bay). (Granted, 2010 was only because Nashville’s Opryland was flooded.) The American Bar Association also is a steady customer.

Why is Vegas such a magnet? There are many reasons: It’s pragmatic and outrageous; it’s relatively easy to get there (not much snow and airfares are usually tolerable); it’s open 24 hours; there are a zillion hotels (and some are great); there’s plenty of huge conference rooms (but don’t expect decent wi-fi); you don’t need a car (unless you wanna go explore that [big dam](https://www.vegas.com/attractions/near-las-vegas/hoover-dam/)); there are unending distractions: gambling, shows, spas and some really good restaurants (but be careful, they can be surprisingly expensive); and for those of us who hate weddings, it’s the perfect place to elope.

Lawyernomics

Among the April hordes trekking to Nevada’s biggest playground are the attendees of [Avvo](http://www.%20avvo.com)‘s [Lawyernomics](http://conferences.avvo.com) annual conference at the upscale [Wynn Las Vegas ](http://www.wynnlasvegas.com/?_ga=1.202041105.1625441030.1457625124)hotel. If you aren’t familiar with Avvo, you probably work in the Am Law 50 and don’t have time to follow ABA politics re: online legal services (tech-savvy, family/small business-friendly shops like Avvo, Rocket Lawyer and LegalZoom). [See, CodeX Blog, “[The ABA-Rocket Lawyer Ramifications](https://law.stanford.edu/2016/03/09/the-aba-rocket-lawyer-ramifications/).”]

Avvo offers fixed-fee legal services, including document review ($149 & up), advice sessions ($39) and start-to-finish support (starting at $399). Typical issues include family matters, immigration and business, among others.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Lawyernomics offers three days of education, networking and fun. This year’s event kicks off on April 7 with a reception and continues with two full days of presentations and workshops: April 8 focusing on “How to Market Your Practice,” April 9 targeting “Run Your Firm Like a Business.” The event wraps up with a party at the hotel’s XS Nightclub.

The two marketing keynotes feature:

• “UnSelling: The New Customer Experience,” Scott Stratten, president of[ UnMarketing](http://www.unmarketing.com/about/) and author of [The Book of Business Awesome.](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118315227.html)
• “Good Content v. Good Enough Content: A Fight for Sore Eyes,” [Ann Handley](http://www.annhandley.com), author of [Everybody Writes](http://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/), and co-author of [Content Rules](http://www.contentrulesbook.com/about/).

Avvo “strives for a mix of legal and non-legal keynotes,” explained Dan Lear, Avvo’s Director of Industry Relations. Avvo looks for speakers who will be “accessible and provocative,” he said, because “legal audiences are smart, but often not as attuned to the latest technology or marketing trends. We want our speakers to meet our legal audience where they are—but then take them somewhere unique and valuable.”

For the marketing segment, Lear said, “topics will range from search engine optimization, online branding, social media to video and content marketing. We’ll also offer professional headshots, Avvo profile optimization, website audits, and gadget troubleshooting.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For the firm management agenda, Avvo wants to address “the shifts in demand for transparent and convenient delivery of quality services which present a tremendous opportunity for attorneys,” said Lear. “We want to help attendees understand and navigate this landscape. Lawyers must leave behind the comforts and simplicity of the billable hour and learn how to run sophisticated businesses that deliver consumer-centric services. This is a tremendous change.”

Advice for Biglaw Refugees

We asked Lear what advice he would give to Biglaw lawyers who want to join or create small “boutique” firms. “Lawyers’ biggest marketing challenge is that they don’t understand who their ideal clients are—or how to find them,” he said. Whether young or veterans, “lawyers must be very deliberate in thinking about how they will bring business in the door.” Biglaw lawyers cannot—and should not—assume that clients will just “find them” because of their experience, he said.

The Bottom Line

Says Avvo’s founder and CEO Mark Britton: “Lawyernomics explores the many intersections of law and business. We take good lawyers and send them home better businesspeople. It’s that simple.”

[Registration info](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lawyernomics-2016-tickets-16947603739). Cost: $700. (It’s too late for early bird tickets that were $500 and $600.)

# The Questioner Versus The Answerer

The associate sends a draft brief to the partner.

The associate then swings by the partner’s office to get comments.

Who has the upper hand?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In one sense, of course, the associate has the upper hand: He’s read all the cases, and thought about them, and sweated over the brief for endless hours. He knows everything about this particular legal issue, and the partner is likely to know far less.

In the important sense, however, the partner has the upper hand, for two reasons: First, the associate’s draft presents all of the associate’s ideas to the partner. Suppose the associate came up with six arguments; five were routine, and any clown would have noticed them, but the sixth is pure brilliance, which almost no one (and surely not this partner) would have ginned up. This associate is great!

The partner reads the draft. Having been presented with all six arguments on a plate, the partner naturally thinks that, unaided, the partner would have crafted all the same arguments. The partner thus naturally discounts the value of the associate’s contribution to the case. The partner then gins up a seventh — not particularly convincing — argument, perhaps worthy of a footnote. The partner thinks: “Why did that foolish associate miss the seventh argument? Anyone should have noticed that!”

The person who thinks about an issue last — here, the partner — may thus naturally discount the value of the person who thought about the issue earlier and then shared all of his ideas — the associate.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The injustice doesn’t stop there. When the partner asks the associate about the brief, the partner can ask about anything remotely related to the brief: What are the specific facts of the case we cite in footnote three? Did this witness make this admission at his deposition? Did you consider this possible analogy, which might shed light on our issue? And so on.

The associate must thus be ready to defend not just his work, but also anything remotely related to the work. The partner may not naturally realize the (1) difficulty and (2) tremendous amount of preparation time needed for a person in the “answerer’s” — the associate’s — role.

Other examples illustrate the same point: What’s easier — arguing to the appellate panel, or sitting on the appellate panel?

The lawyer knows the case cold and has studied everything in the neighborhood. But the judges can ask about anything — whether [contraception is a mortal sin or a venial sin](http://jonathanturley.org/2014/02/17/posner-spars-with-university-lawyer-and-threatens-to-cut-off-oral-argument-due-to-his-babbling/), to take just one example from a recent appellate argument. The questioner — the judge — has the upper hand, because the judge can ask about anything, and it’s awfully hard for the lawyer to know absolutely everything.

Here’s one last example: Is it easier to report to the board of directors or to serve on the board? Board service can be challenging, of course, and a diligent board member might spend hours poring through background materials distributed before meetings. But the person presenting to the board must be ready to answer any question on any issue; knowing everything about everything is a tough job.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
You could make a presentation about data privacy, for example, describing when personal information can be transferred out of the European Union. And the board member can note that many large companies have recently been hacked. Has the company properly guarded against hacking?

Data privacy is one thing and data security is another; a lawyer who understands data privacy is unlikely also to serve in the IT function of data security. But, if the questioner asks, the “answerer” is supposed to respond. The questioner is unlikely even to realize just how unfair the question is.

What’s the point?

Questioners — be sensible! Recognize that asking questions is often much easier than answering them. It’s hard to be ready to answer every conceivable question, and pinning down the answer to a question may take hours — or days, or weeks — of effort. Don’t lightly criticize a person who can’t answer a question.

Answerers — take heed! It’s your job to anticipate every question — even the off-the-wall ones — that your questioners may ask, and to be ready to respond intelligently. Don’t go into the partner’s office, or the appellate courtroom, or the boardroom, or the like, without having prepared completely and anticipated the tangents that your presentation might suggest. The mismatch in power, and the relative difficulty of the roles of questioner and answerer, doesn’t let you off the hook.

# Orrick Rolls Back All COVID-19 Salary Cuts
## They're committing to matching last year's bonus scale, too (but no fall bonuses).

Another day, another firm that’s decided the time has come to do away with its austerity measures. In case you don’t remember, this spring, a slew of Biglaw firms introduced various cuts to combat the coronavirus crisis to make sure they’d be able to stay the course during the financial upheaval that was caused by COVID-19 across the globe.

Orrick — a firm that brought in $1,158,537,000 in 2019 gross revenue, placing in at No. 31 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings — instituted a series of initiatives back in April that were meant to save cash on hand to [prudently manage the firm and avoid any job loss](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/orrick-rolls-out-salary-cuts-paired-with-make-whole-cash-rewards/?rf=1). Specifically, the firm reduced salaries for all employees on a graduated scale. On the attorney side of things, career associates took a 5 percent cut, associates took a 10 percent cut, managing/senior associates and most of counsel took a 15 percent cut, and partners, of counsel, and executive staff took the deepest cuts of all. On the staff side, the most junior employees saw salary cuts of just 1 percent, while more senior staff members saw up to a 15 percent salary cuts. On top of those cuts, staff members whose roles depended on in-office activity were asked to work on reduced schedules while secretaries were asked to work four-day schedules. Last but not least, the firm postponed the start date of its 2020 associate class to January 2021.

Today, Orrick will be rolling back all of those salary cuts. This is what will be happening at the firm going forward in 2020, as of October 1:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- All associate, of counsel, and staff salaries impacted by COVID salary reductions will be restored to 100 percent prospectively;
- All staff moved to a reduced FTE (i.e., roles impacted by office closures) will be moved back to full-time;
- Equivalent adjustments will happen in Europe and Asia, including conducting postponed 2020 staff reviews; and
- Last but not least, the firm’s associate bonus program will at least match the 2019 scale.
Here’s a statement from [Mitch Zuklie](https://www.orrick.com/en/People/8/5/E/Mitchell-Zuklie), Orrick’s chairman and chief executive officer:

Our entire team has worked very hard to support our clients throughout 2020 and deliver extraordinary results for them. We put a variety of cost management measures in place in March, at a time of uncertainty regarding how 2020 would unfold, in order to give us flexibility. It’s time to reverse some of that, express our gratitude to our associates and staff and recognize their relentless hard work. 

Sources we’ve heard from have expressed disappointment that the firm will not be handing out special fall bonuses, with some going so far as to say that morale at the firm is “cratering.” This is unfortunate, but others have told us that Orrick will at least “consider” the fact that other firms have made fall bonus payments to their associates when setting its year-end bonus scale.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As noted previously, Orrick is offering [special “make whole” awards](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/orrick-rolls-out-salary-cuts-paired-with-make-whole-cash-rewards/) to top contributors, no matter their role, and this money will be separate from the firm’s annual bonuses. We know that a little more than half of the firm’s associates have been made whole so far, and the firm expects even more to be made whole by the end of the year.  We’ve been told that staff make wholes will be determined at year end.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Enjoy Your Bonuses Before The Associate Compensation Bubble Bursts And Biglaw's Bottom Falls Out
## It's bound to happen -- and perhaps sooner than later.

Only firms that compete with Cravath for associates need to be competitive with their comp scale. But if history is any guide, a very large number of firms across the country will eventually follow. This will increase the magnitude of the bubble that has been growing on associate comp. I predict it will burst when the economy softens.

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/people/kent-zimmermann/), a law firm management consultant at the Zeughauser Group, offering commentary on [Biglaw’s year-end bonuses](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/11/19/a-week-early-cravath-kicks-off-associate-bonus-season/) and the summer raises and special bonuses that preceded them. As we’ve [noted previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/could-biglaw-see-another-associate-pay-raise-followed-by-a-recession/), recessions tend to follow increases in Biglaw associate compensation, so Zimmerman’s prediction could come true. In the meantime, [enjoy your money](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/).

# Proposed A&O Shearman Merger Needs 75% Partnership Approval To Survive
## Will the firms be able to get the votes in? Senior partners seem confident.

On Sunday, Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling announced their [plans to merge](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/). The new firm will be called Allen Overy Shearman Sterling, or A&O Shearman for short. Once combined, the firm will have 3,900 lawyers with approximately 800 partners, spread across 49 offices. A&O Shearman’s combined revenue will total $3.4 billion.

This sounds like a wonderful plan, but before anything becomes official, the partners of each firm will need to weigh in.

According to [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/22/ao-shearman-needs-75-partnership-approval-to-get-merger-done-405-122952/), both firms will need to get the approval of 75% of each of their partnerships before moving forward. A&O and Shearman are joining together in the wake of prior merger talks gone awry — [A&O with O’Melveny](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/after-over-a-year-allen-overy-and-omelveny-call-off-merger/) and [Shearman with Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/rumored-merger-between-hogan-lovells-and-shearman-scrapped/).

What makes them think they’ll be able to stay the course with the A&O Shearman plan? Here’s the scoop:

On a call with Law.com International, the senior partners of both firms said they are highly confident that their respective partnerships will vote in favor of the merger.

A&O’s senior partner Wim Dejonghe said: “We are both really confident of getting that [75% threshold]. We wouldn’t have brought it to market if we weren’t.”

According to Dejonghe and Shearman’s senior partner, Adam Hakki, a partnership vote will likely take place simultaneously “later in the summer.” Cross your fingers for A&O Shearman’s future.

Every few years, a law firm will adopt an unlimited vacation days policy and sell it as a recognition of that associates are “adults” and “professionals” capable of managing their own schedules. Which is an odd pitch since those associates would have to be born yesterday to believe that. And yet, despite everyone being clued in on this bait-and-switch tactic for [over a decade now](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/03/latham-lathams-accrued-vacation/), Quinn Emanuel decided maybe its associates wouldn’t piece it together.

Spoiler: They pieced it together.

The firm sent around a memo yesterday offering the same tired pitch to its associates about the magical world of unlimited vacation.

All: We are revising our vacation policy for attorneys. Under the new policy, U.S. attorneys will have unlimited vacation days, subject to case and business needs.

Effective January 1, 2022, U.S. attorneys will no longer have limited vacation days. Instead, everyone understands their professional obligations and the traditional time commitments required for this job. As long as individual lawyers meet their obligations, they are entitled to take as much or as little vacation as they desire. In order to implement this change, at the end of this year you will receive a buy out of your accrued vacation time, and beginning next year you will no longer accrue such time.

As transparent as the crystal clear air on that mountain you won’t actually be climbing because you’re going to spend the whole year in the office. Much respect to whoever tried to write “as they desire” and make it sound earnest. There should be awards for that sort of thing.

I’ve worked here for quite a few years and have never taken more than 2-3 vacation days in an entire year. The effect of this policy for the vast majority will be less money (because we aren’t paid out for unused vacation) and no more vacation than before.

Because this policy doesn’t give associates the ability to take “as much or as little vacation as they desire.” Those associates will still labor under the firm’s minimum billables requirement, already higher than its peer firms, to get their bonuses and, you know, to keep their jobs. Attorneys never use all their allotted vacation time anyway. The only value to the three or four weeks that serve as a shiny object on the firm’s NALP profile is the possibility of rolling it over for an extended sabbatical or, more often, getting a cash-out at the end of the year or when the attorney leaves the firm. It’s that payout that the firm hopes to recoup under the guise of its new, magnanimous policy. If attorneys also feel pressure to never leave the office based on the ephemeral hope that the firm will offer them a shot at the golden ring years down the line, that’s just another perk of taking away a perk.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Associates are in a total uproar…. I cash out yearly to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. But the new policy means associates no longer accrue any vacation time. The result is that associates will still take the same (small) number of vacation days and make tens of thousands of dollars less each year without the vacation payout that most in this industry have come to expect.

Really crappy move, and the timing isn’t ideal for Quinn which has made a string of annoying policy changes during COVID that have hurt associates monetarily.

Unfortunately, this sort of short-changing is likely to take the whole industry by storm in the near future. Even if most firms continue to see vacation time as an inviolable fringe benefit, the way some firms discuss hybrid work models draw upon the same mindset. Firms that eschew a set three- or four-day in-office work week in favor of a hybrid model with “no minimum days in the office” have functionally announced a five-day minimum office week. Because no minimum days in the office also means no maximum days in the office and senior attorneys will take the lack of clarity and run with it.

Being a lawyer is a seven-day work week anyway… but there’s an expectation that the weekend will frequently be at home. When a firm says “four days in the office,” the lawyer isn’t working less, they’ve just shifted to add Friday to the days they’ll — more often than not — log in from home. Setting that expectation matters.

Sorry, Quinn associates. And everyone else.

Minor Edit: Added “Future” to the title because I thought someone might misconstrue it and think the firm was taking away already accrued unused vacation. They’re paying that out for this year and then taking away any pay out for future years by not having a set vacation policy.

Penn Law’s Amy Wax is back at it, [appearing on Tucker Carlson](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/amy-wax-thats-the-headline-you-know-what-she-did/) to talk about the problem with Black people and Asians. We cover Wax’s shenanigans and the impact they have on the law school’s credibility a lot, but it does make us wonder where we draw the line between informing the public and just feeding a troll. We also talk about Kim Kardashian’s ongoing quest to become a lawyer reaching [a new high water mark](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/kim-kardashians-baby-bar-exam-essay-selected-as-model-answer/) and Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli [losing his Biglaw attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/biglaw-firm-wants-out-because-pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-cant-pay-his-bills/).

If you were at Weil Gotshal or Kirkland, and your rate was $800 an hour and the client really loved you, then the client is going to really love you at $450 an hour.

— [Grant Walsh](https://www.culhanemeadows.com/attorney/grant-walsh/), a co-founder of [Culhane Meadows](https://www.culhanemeadows.com/),
a virtual law firm [that is growing rapidly](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784525264/StayatHomeRainmakers-A-Growing-Threat-to-Big-Law) and allows partners to set their billable rates, keep 80 percent of the revenue for matters they originate, and handle all of it while working from home. Another virtual law firm, [FisherBroyles](https://www.fisherbroyles.com/) (which Culhane Meadows spun off from), says it will crack the Am Law 200 next year due to its annual gross revenue growth.

# Associates Hit With Unannounced Bonus Reductions For Not Being In The Office Enough
## Fit to be tied.

The hybrid office policy at Ropes & Gray is basically a supervillain origin story. Once a paragon of a flexible return to the office policy with a three-day model, fissures grew as partners began [complaining that associates were taking advantage of the policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/ropes-three-days-a-week/). The firm removed the “flexible” part, [mandating a Tuesday through Thursday regime](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/the-biglaw-firm-that-ended-the-5-day-in-office-work-week-announces-3-mandatory-in-office-days/) and launching what associates described as an Orwellian surveillance policy to [check up on associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firms-three-day-office-workweek-descending-into-paranoid-surveillance/) whenever they didn’t make it into the office.

Now, the firm is apparently docking bonuses for associates with “insufficient” compliance with the mandatory office attendance rule.

You might point out that [in the firm’s bonus announcement this month](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/ropes-bonus-2022/), there’s no mention whatsoever of reducing bonuses based on the mandatory attendance policy. According to the memo, bonuses would be reduced for failing to meet hourly targets, but made no mention of physical office attendance. Associates received no follow-up policy amendment, with the firm telling associates in their individual performance reviews that bonuses are getting docked by as much as 15 percent.

Which is exactly why associates — even those who dutifully complied with the policy and received the full bonus — are so irritated.

As one tipster put it:

There was no warning about this policy which is making some people pretty mad…. If they wanted to force people in, no one understands why they didn’t just warn us about this policy instead of being silent and then penalizing people without any warning.

Firms do need to get associates back in the office. There’s too much “soft learning” that new associates pick up by the happenstance of screwing up in front of a midlevel who may not even be in the same practice group. [Revamping training models](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/firms-are-using-acting-to-get-their-associates-to-write-better-emails/) can only convey so much when it comes to those accidental lessons. There are also critical business development connections forged in the office because — in Biglaw — future clients are generally the associate you have lunch with who will one day be the Deputy GC somewhere else.

Which is why this all reads like an origin story. The best villains have entirely reasonable motivations. They just take it too far.

Because associates generally understand all these concerns and that’s why very few voices are out there agitating for permanent remote work. But they want flexibility. If there isn’t any business reason to go in on Tuesday, they want to be able to go in Friday. If their best child-care arrangement involves coming in Monday-Wednesday, that’s what they want to do. Or, perhaps more to the point, they want to be treated like professionals in making those decisions.

We reached out to Ropes multiple times for comment on these reports yesterday and have not heard back. We will update this story if we do.

# Perkins Coie And MoFo Prepare For Diversity Spite Suits

Since the SFFA decision, the threats of spite suits against organizations that dare have a diversity initiative have been on the rise. And while it sucks to know you’re courting a lawsuit, it is important to know that you are fighting the good fight. As expected, Perkins Coie is preparing its ranks to fight right-wing [attack librarians](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/this-is-absolutely-what-you-need-to-start-calling-the-lawyer-in-your-life/) that get in a tizzy over equity programs. Thankfully, they aren’t alone — they are joined by Morrison & Foerster. From [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/perkins-coie-morrison-foerster-lawyer-up-for-dei-lawsuits):

Perkins Coie and Morrison & Foerster are building out their legal teams as the firms gear up to defend against the legal attacks by Edward Blum on their diversity fellowships.

Perkins Coie has hired attorneys from Jenner & Block and attorney Jared Eisenberg from Lynn Pinker Hurst & Schwegmann, a complex-litigation boutique based in Dallas.

Morrison & Foerster has retained representation from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, which is teaming up with attorneys from Gelber Schachter & Greenberg, a Miami-founded boutique firm, according to a firm spokesperson.

Would you look at that! Maybe MoFo and Gibson Dunn didn’t back out as hard as previously thought! Does their change to less specific language on the diversity initiative still suck? Yes, but respect is due where it’s due. Teamwork makes the dream work, etc.

# Where’s The Unicorn? 20-Plus Years Of Trial And Error In Retooling From Biglaw

When I graduated from law school in 1999, I had no crystal ball to know what the future would hold for my legal journey. I did what many “traditional path” law students do — I clerked for a district judge and then joined a prestigious Biglaw practice that focused on restructuring. Since then, I’ve traveled to a smaller firm, taught, and started a solo practice. I’m very happy in my current solo practice, which focuses on representing romance novelists, science fiction authors, and podcasters, and I wanted to share some of the (many) lessons I have learned along the way.

During my time at Biglaw I worked on some amazing cases and forged mentorships, friendships, and personal relationships that continue to this day. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be flying all over the world to work on the restructuring of the century — the Enron bankruptcy.

Working for a 2,000-plus lawyer firm was a dream come true. While I do not regret joining a big international law firm and working countless hours during the six years I was there, it presented challenges personally and professionally. Was billing those hours something I wanted to do for the foreseeable future? Once the partnership track was looming, and I had to face a decision about whether to move, I had to ask myself: “Truthfully, do I see myself there in five years?” Pregnant with our second child, and mother to a toddler, I couldn’t see how I could make it happen. So, I decided to try something else. And this was the first time I “retooled.”

I found an opportunity to join the law faculty at a nearby, regional law school and was very excited to pursue it. My colleagues were great, and the work schedule was more flexible, but I found out that I missed law practice (shockingly). After a couple of years of teaching and the birth of our third child I was eager to return to court.

Looking for my next opportunity (and deciding whether to go back to Biglaw or not), I was invited to join a medium-size local law firm of Biglaw refugees. I was coming in to build and provide support to current firm clients and help with the restructuring and litigation department. The hours were more flexible, and clients were local. But not having practiced locally before, I found it challenging to have a thriving restructuring law practice without the steady flow of work from large Biglaw clients.

Around the five-year mark at this firm a New York Times bestseller author approached me with a question about whether her contract with a publisher would be enforceable in bankruptcy. From this one case, an entire new law practice developed for me. Five years later I left my midsize firm. I now have my own solo IP practice, focused on author copyright issues and contracts, with over 60 clients. One of my client’s cases was the subject of a New York Times feature and has drawn a lot of interest in the IP bar — but it also was stressful, time-consuming, and personally challenging .

Just like falling in love, you have to make sure you fall in love with the same one over and over — and with law, I needed to do that too. I do not want to focus on the why I left Biglaw but on the pointers I wish someone had given me once I made the decision to go. The biggest challenge in all of these retoolings has been to identify specifically what I wanted and what I specifically needed to do to get there. Identifying “what you want” is a lot more elusive than what it may originally seem, and the grass really does always seem greener on the other side.

Five Lessons Learned

Here are the top 5 questions/considerations that you need to address when you are thinking about a change. Some I learned with trial and error — and some with a little pain as well.

Lesson 1: Make sure you understand what you NEED in your new venture before making the change. Ask yourself: Is the change I am making going to require me to learn new skills, or relearn what I had always taken as granted? For example, when I moved from Biglaw, I gave up 24-hour word processing, paralegals that would come to the office at any time, and Westlaw and Lexis access that was basically free. I “knew” I was giving up these support systems — but I had not thought through what that really meant in terms of how I would replace them. I realize now that I did not think enough about the basic logistics of what I need to succeed where I was going.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Lesson 2: You need a business plan and a network. You are excited about your new venture. But are potential clients? The question you have to ask yourself is: How am I going to develop clients to continue to grow my career and sustain my income? When I went from a national law practice to a more local one, I realized I had never even joined the local bar association. The lawyers I was practicing with and against had local networks they had developed. I did not, and I felt that put me at a big disadvantage. I had not considered the importance of this factor when I joined the smaller firm.

Lesson 3: How am I going to cover my basics and how do I allocate money to all the things I never thought about. How much do I want to earn? What about health care? What about malpractice insurance? When I decided to go solo I suddenly had to make tons of very practical decisions in these areas. Other issues to think about are whether you need to set up a client funds account, or how to pay franchise taxes.

Lesson 4: Am I making the right move? Did I ask the right questions when choosing where to go? Your choice is never just “stay here or go there.” You have more options than you think. Every time I have made a move I was reminded, in hindsight, about other options I could have considered — for example, when I began teaching, I simply failed to consider other practice options as alternatives where I could have kept on going serving clients and going to court.

Lesson 5: Does my move have potential, or is it the same wrapped in another package? Related to the business plan question above, you have to ask yourself: What are the growth opportunities in this new position — am I growing my practice or someone else’s? If I go to a smaller firm, am I just changing the name on the letterhead, or am I going to have opportunities to build “my clients” and “my practice”?

In Sum

In my search for a “perfect” fit I found myself not only retooling from Biglaw, but also retooling practice areas. I now feel that I have found the perfect fit — but it did not come without its own stresses and challenges. And it continues to bring up both big-picture questions (what are my goals, what do I need to get there) and highly practical ones about bank accounts, taxes, and the like. I hope that my experiences can be helpful to you as you travel on your journey in the law.

Margarita Coale is a solo practitioner in Dallas, focused exclusively on the representation of authors, and romance writers in particular. A love of romance novels is one of the few constants in her well-travelled, adventurous life. Born and raised in Monterrey, Mexico, she attended law school at the University of Texas, worked for several years at the white-shoe New York firm representing Enron in its epic bankruptcy filing, and then taught procedure and international law at the Texas Wesleyan School of Law in Fort Worth. Her current practice grew out of her business-law work and has expanded to include writers worldwide on a host of commercial and intellectual property issues. “Mom” to four children (and wife to one more), she also involved in scouting, her children’s schools in various capacities and coordinates volunteers for the junior high and high school. She can often be heard speaking to her clients about their universes in negotiation for mystical babies and hopes in 2021 to be able to travel and visit family and finally rock climb her way through some mountains.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Pitches Full Reopening In January 2022, Encourages In-Person Office Work Through Year-End
## Plus, is a raise in store for associates at the firm?

Another day, another Biglaw firm that won’t be fully reopening its doors until next year thanks to COVID-19.

For more than 18 months now, associates and staff members at large law firms have been working remotely due to the coronavirus crisis. All the while, law firm leaders’ return-to-office plans have been delayed, postponed, and quashed due to the continually evolving coronavirus crisis. What’s a firm to do in unprecedented times like these?

At BakerHostetler, the answer is a full reopening on January 4.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Paul M. Schmidt, the firm’s chairman, has been vocal about law firm reopenings in our “post”-pandemic world. BakerHostetler was supposed to officially reopen on September 8, but those plans were scrapped because of the Delta variant. The firm had not announced a new reopening date until late last week.

“How long can we wait ‘til we start doing irreparable harm to your culture, to training, to all those value propositions from in-person interaction?” Schmidt wondered in September during an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/are-biglaw-leaders-doing-irreparable-harm-to-their-firms-by-delaying-full-reopenings/). “Once you get past the beginning of November, you’re looking at Thanksgiving, and then the December holidays. If you miss that window, you’re probably talking about sometime early in 2022, which is a really daunting thing to think about.”

Rather than fully missing that window, starting this week, BakerHostetler is encouraging all employees to work in its offices on Wednesdays and Thursdays through the end of 2021.

In addition to its formal reopening plans, another thing that may be brewing at BakerHostetler is a salary increase. As has been claimed on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/biglawboiz/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/biglawboiz/status/1448844450126573575), and [Fishbowl](http://fishbowlapp.com/post/can-anyone-confirm-the-10-increase-in-salaries-happening-at-bakerhostetler-in-dec), the firm will reportedly be giving associates 10% bumps across the board as of December 15. Sources say the firm previously boosted only first-year compensation to the new Davis Polk scale. Is a cash influx on the horizon for other class years at the firm? We’ve reached out to BakerHostetler for comment. If and when we receive word back, we will provide an update here.

# Biglaw Firms Are Way Too Eager To Make People Who Were Traumatized By The Pandemic Return To The Office

I’m a real believer that coming back into the office is going to be almost as traumatic as leaving it 18 months ago. Because in the intervening months, people have gone through a hell of a lot of trauma and anxiety.

You’ve got a different group of people coming back. And the firms that are going to be the most successful will understand that and manage their people well.

— Jim Jones, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Law Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession, commenting on the [toll that the pandemic has taken on lawyers and staff](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/09/22/firms-will-bring-people-back-to-the-office-but-they-wont-be-the-same/). Jones notes that law firm personnel are in no way the same as they were before COVID-19 forced them to leave the office, so law firms must be prepared.

# 8 Time Management Tips For Young Lawyers
## As an associate, you often have limited control over your own schedule -- but there are still some actions you can take to improve your use of time and cut out unnecessary stress.

If you’re an associate, you’re probably thinking, “What?! As if I have any control over my own schedule!” And you’re right, your ability to manage your time will never be perfect.

I understand. I was an associate myself for seven-plus years. But there are still some actions you can take to improve your use of time and cut out some of the unnecessary stress.

- When you are given a new assignment, always ask right away what the deadline is. I can’t tell you how many times as an associate I failed to ask this important question because I said to myself, “This will take no time at all, I can do it right away,” only to have a more urgent task land on my desk — and I wished I’d asked upfront instead of begging for more time later on.
- Many of us lawyers are Type A personalities, and we love that feeling of completing a task and checking it off the “to do” list. But I find the easiest way to prevent procrastinating about the next task is to start it right away. Just get three minutes in, then you can take that coffee or bathroom break. When I’m jumping back into an established rhythm instead of getting my mind around a new project, it’s much easier to get back to work.
- Believe that there is no such thing as a huge, daunting project. Everything can be broken down into smaller, bite-sized morsels. Take on one mini-project at a time.
- Put everything on your calendar. I assume I won’t remember anything. I include project deadlines and my to-do list items as 30-minute calendar entries. I have repeating calendar reminders to pay my credit card bills, renew my dog’s license annually… there is nothing in my life not on my calendar because the last thing I want to be stressed about is that I may have forgotten something I need to be stressed about!
- I also block time for work (and personal) projects on my calendar. Even if I end up changing the start and end times multiple times, it helps me to be able to eyeball my projects for the day, estimate how long they will take, and plan accordingly.
- Find ways to use your down time productively. What down time? Even law firm associates have down time. Mine often came at 1 a.m. as I was waiting on a senior lawyer to send me the next mark-up. But I was determined to reclaim this time for myself. So what did I do? I started a travel blog. It was a creative outlet I could turn to even at my desk in the middle of the night. So those late nights in the office were not a complete waste in terms of my personal life. I also made a point of having dinner with a work friend almost every night, even if it was for 10 minutes at their desk or mine. If you’re not inclined to start a blog or write a novel or screenplay, use your scarce breaks to update your resume and deal sheet, work on a business plan, keep in touch with contacts ([build relationships!](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/the-importance-of-authentic-networking/)). Or research for your next vacation! Have a plan for how you’ll use your free time so it doesn’t go to waste.
- Whatever your goal may be — hitting the gym a few times a week, putting together a business plan, catching up with one law school classmate each day — establish an accountability partner. It could be a friend, a colleague or even a journal. Keeping track will help keep you honest!
- If you’re truly feeling underwater, ask for help. Firms are investing more and more into associate life and associate development resources. Even if you’re not comfortable talking with a partner, there is likely someone you can talk with. And you can always reach out to a trusted recruiter to learn what your realistic options might be for a new job offering a better work-life balance.
Making small changes to your daily routines may buy you only a few extra minutes each day at this stage in your career, but these actions will help you build good habits for when you do gradually take on more control of your schedule. I’d love to hear what time management tricks have worked for you!

# Summer Associate Offer Rates (2017): Which Firms Had 100 Percent Offer Rates?
## Did everyone at your firm receive an offer? Let us know!

Aside from the summer associate who was [allegedly fired for making racist remarks](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/summer-associate-allegedly-fired-for-making-racist-remarks/), we’ve had an incredibly slow season in terms of summer associate gossip. Much to my colleague Joe Patrice’s chagrin, nary a summer associate has even [blown a goat](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/can-a-summer-associate-please-blow-a-goat-or-something/) in an effort to make summer associate programs great again. We suspect that one of the main reasons for that — on top of their fears of indebtedness and unemployment — is that summer associates have been on their very best behavior in the hopes of earning a glamorous $180K paycheck as a first-year associate after graduating from law school.

Money makes the Biglaw world go ’round, and it also makes summer associates act like a bunch of little goody two-shoes. That being the case, you’d think that this summer’s offer rates would be absolutely awesome. But are they? Let’s find out which firms have handed out offers to 100 percent of their summers — information that rising 2Ls will want to know as on-campus interviewing season starts up very soon at law schools across the country.

Many firms haven’t issued offers yet — some wait until the summer program is done, and some even wait until summer associates are back in school. In fact, so far we’ve only heard about 100 percent offer rates at one law firm:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The Hogan Lovells New York office summer program ended on Friday. All summer associates received offers along with champagne and power ball tickets for the $300 million jackpot. The 23 2Ls got offers and the two 1Ls received offers to return next summer.



What a great sendoff gift! Now, imagine if one of those HoLove summers were to actually win the jackpot. That would be absolutely, positively amazing.

If you have offer rate information to share, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer Associate Offer Rates”), or text us (646-820-8477). We keep our tipsters anonymous. When we receive enough information, we’ll do a follow-up.

Thanks a bunch, and to those of you who have already landed offers, congrats!

Biglaw firms are known for taking care of their associates, and attorneys at these shops are pampered in unbelievable ways.  Large firms typically provide many fringe benefits including subsidies for buying phones, free rides home from the office late at night, free meals, and paying all manner of bar fees and other professional expenses.  Indeed, Biglaw firms truly have a “cradle to grave” system in which recent law school graduates receive stipends to study for the bar, and departing attorneys get generous severance packages on their way out.

However, not all law firms offer such benefits, and this can really affect one’s bottom line.  Of course, everyone probably understands that smaller law firms do not provide the more extravagant fringe benefits that one can expect at a large firm.  However, many smaller law firms do not pay for some of the most basic costs associated with being an attorney.  Having to pay for professional expenses yourself, and not being able to take advantage of other fringe benefits, can really hurt one’s ability to save money and pay off student loans.  As such, it is important to consider some important perks and benefits when contemplating where to work.

Although it is usually assumed that all law firms pay bar membership fees for attorneys, some firms do not provide this benefit.  Indeed, while working at my first job after leaving Biglaw, I was responsible for paying all of my own bar membership fees.  In addition, I also had to pay for the fees associated with joining the bar of a federal court, even though I was required to be a member of that bar to work on some of the matters assigned to me by my employer.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
These expenses added up quickly.  I am a member of two state bars, and I had to pay hundreds of dollars to gain admission to a federal bar.  One year, I paid nearly $1,000 in bar membership fees!  This is a lot of money that could have been devoted to paying down my student loans, and one should try to work at a firm that will cover these expenses to avoid going out-of-pocket for these costs.  In addition, it is best to gain admission to federal bars while working in Biglaw, since then your firm will likely cover the cost.  If you later end up working at a firm that does not pay for these expenses, you will already be admitted to federal bars and will not have to cover this cost yourself.

In addition, although Biglaw firms typically pay for CLEs, and many even have in-house CLE programs, many smaller law firms will not pay for CLE classes.  Indeed, while working at my first job after leaving Biglaw, my firm did not pay for CLE classes, and I had to pay hundreds of dollars a year just to make sure that I fulfilled all of the requirements to keep my law licenses.  There are many ways you can obtain CLE credits on the cheap, and some outlets even offer free CLE classes.  However, one should try to work at a firm that covers these costs so that one can save money to devote more cash toward student loans.  In addition, anyone hoping to leave Biglaw should take care of CLE credits while employed at a larger firm just in case this cost is not covered by your new firm.

Many smaller law firms also do not pay for the costs associated with being a member of a state or local bar association.  I had to let all of my memberships in bar associations lapse while working at my first job after leaving Biglaw, since my firm did not pay for these expenses, and I wanted to save my money to pay down student loans.  Not paying for associates to become members of bar associations is somewhat “penny wise and dollar foolish,” since there are many benefits to joining these organizations, including access to cheap legal research platforms, opportunities to network, and other advantages.  However, the reality is that many smaller law firms do not pay for these costs, and one should consider this when choosing which firm to work at after leaving Biglaw.

After all this “doom and gloom” about perks that smaller law firms might not offer, I wanted to relate one advantage of working at some smaller shops that could benefit your bottom line when paying off student loans.  Although most Biglaw firms (with some notable exceptions) have lockstep bonus structures in which associates with similar experience get a set bonus, many smaller firms offer bonuses based on the number of hours an associate bills.  As a result, an associate who bills an insane number of hours at a smaller law firm might receive a bigger bonus than a similarly-situated associate in Biglaw.  If you are willing to put in extra hours, such bonus systems can really benefit someone trying to pay down student loans, and this perk should be researched when considering employment opportunities.

All told, there are many aspects about working at smaller law firms that can affect your ability to save money to pay off student loans.  However, with some research and consideration, you can land at a firm that will put you in the best position to pay down your student debt.

Waaaaaay back on Thursday, when the Biglaw compensation market moved to $200,000 for first-year associates, [thanks to Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/), McDermott, Will & Emery [was the first firm to match the raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/we-have-our-first-match-of-the-new-biglaw-compensation-scale/), doing so within a matter of hours. But then [Davis Polk played spoiler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/), coming over the top of the Milbank scale.

But MWE is not to be deterred. On Friday, the firm announced a re-raise of associate salaries, with the below note, which, without explicitly confirming it, sure makes it seem like the they have more in the tank should another firm — cough Cravath cough — come back over the top:

We are so happy to be in a position to be able to reward our hardworking, best-in-class Associates in this way. We see your amazing level of commitment and know you are “all in” and very aligned with our plans to be the number one career accelerant in the legal profession.
Maybe the games continue or maybe we’re done: Who knows? What we hope for, at least, is that you enjoy your weekend and appreciate these brighter days.

In truth, we expected the re-raise. [That’s what happened in 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/?rf=1) when Cravath came over the top of Milbank’s raises. There will almost certainly be more of the $200K scale firms moving to the $205K scale, they just might be waiting until… other big players in associate compensation make their move so they don’t have to issue a third compensation memo within a matter of days.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Organizations that adopt cloud-based eDiscovery identify key information quickly amid what can often be chaotic and expansive document sets. 

These platforms promote seamless collaboration, optimize efficiencies across workflows, and provide better control and higher data security.

In partnership with our friends at the leading eDiscovery provider [Everlaw](http://bit.ly/2y2v9fZ), we’re fielding a brief [survey](http://bit.ly/3bLiv6j) to gain insight into how law firms are implementing and utilizing their eDiscovery platforms — whether in the cloud or on premise.

# The Law Schools Where The Most Graduates Got Jobs At Large Firms (2017)
## You don't necessarily need to go to a top law school to get a job at a top law firm.

Do you like money? Of course you do, you’ve got student loans to pay off. Do you like prestige? Obviously, you’re a Type A law student. If you’re like the majority of your colleagues and you’d like to embark upon upon a career path that’ll pad your wallet and get you in on the ground floor at a prestigious firm, then you’ll probably want to compete for a job at a large firm.

[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/04/25/law-grads-hiring-report-job-stats-for-the-class-of-2017/) produced several helpful charts based on law school employment data for the class of 2017. Today, we will take a look at one of the more interesting charts, the law schools that sent the highest percentage of their most recent graduating class into large firms with 100 or more lawyers. On this list, you’ll find a dazzling array of law schools from the T14, but we’re not here to tell you what you already know — that graduates of top law schools get top jobs. That being said, we’re going to dive a little deeper into the list and highlight the schools you may not realize are some of the top large-firm contenders. Here they are for your viewing pleasure:

- Fordham: 41.26 percent
- Howard: 29.13 percent
- Southern Methodist: 26.27 percent
- Indiana-Bloomington: 23.16 percent
- UC Hastings: 19.64 percent
- Cardozo: 18.84 percent
- Temple: 17.97 percent
- Brooklyn: 17.39 percent
- Catholic: 15.32 percent
- Detroit Mercy: 15.23 percent

Nobody likes waiting for an expected compensation email while it seems every other peer firm is getting base salary increases and bonuses. Thankfully, the wait is over for Seward & Kissel! Here are the new numbers:





Congrats on making the big bucks! Looking to spread the joy? Consider sharing some of your windfall with the Brooklyn-based [Read718](https://www.read718.org/). Even the more boring parts of the job take their fair share of reading comprehension — what better way to pay it forward than helping kids understand the books (or PDFs) in front of them?

We like hearing about bonuses almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Chris Williams became a social media manager and assistant editor for Above the Law in June 2021.

He is a former boatbuilder who cannot swim, [a published author on critical race theory, philosophy, and humor](https://www.academia.edu/33296970/Lets_Be_Frank_Parrhesia_and_the_Black_Comedic_Tradition), and has a love for cycling that occasionally annoys his peers.

# Lawyers Should Get Work Product Right The First Time
## Fast and wrong is rarely preferred to slower and better.

I used to work for a partner who always wanted work product to be drafted and delivered to him by associates as soon as possible. Even if there were no set deadlines that required such a quick delivery of the work product, the partner reasoned that if he had work product delivered from an associate sooner, he could better organize his reviewing and refining work. However, partners should not emphasize delivering work product fast if no external deadline requires it. Getting the work product right the first time is far better than getting it drafted as soon as possible.

Perhaps the main reason why it is important to get work product right the first time — even if this takes more time — is because lawyers often have the best chance to make the biggest impact on work product on the first draft they write. For instance, if a lawyer works on a lease, purchase contract, or any other commercial deal, they will have a much better chance at getting changes accepted by the other side if they raise those changes earlier in the negotiating process. Once parties start exchanging drafts of edits and revisions, it becomes much harder for changes to be accepted by all of the stakeholders.

When deals come to a conclusion, people are usually only willing to change minor details about the transaction as opposed to major deal terms. If lawyers rush when getting out an initial draft of documents, it is possible for attorneys to miss something major that they should have included in the documents in the first place. As a result, even if deals require quick turnarounds or other time pressures are present, it is important to get things right the first time so that matters are not forgotten that cannot be fixed later on.

Another reason why lawyers should get work product right the first time is because the lawyer may be judged on that work product without an understanding that it was produced on short notice. Most work product does not include a disclaimer noting that it was created in a short time and does not reflect an attorney’s full capabilities. Most people will simply look at work product and believe that it is either the best that a lawyer can do or is the type of work product that an attorney produces in the course of their business.

When a client sees errors in work product, they likely will not care whether the work product was produced in a short time. They will just see that their lawyer made mistakes, and this will alter the perception a client has of their counsel. Moreover, courts will usually not understand that a lawyer had little time to complete filings and will usually just think that a brief or other filing contains the best argument a lawyer could make on behalf of a client. Accordingly, lawyers should try to get extensions of litigation deadlines or other flexibility whenever possible so that they can do the work correctly rather than merely filing as soon as possible.

Another reason why you should get work product right the first time is because it might actually take more time and resources to edit work product that is bad when it is first circulated than if it was done properly the first time. This not only applies to when attorneys try to push materials out as quickly as possible but when the wrong personnel at a law firm takes a first stab at a project.

At many law firms, there is some pressure to keep associates busy with work, and partners may want to assign to associates projects that partners might be more qualified to handle so an associate has billable work. However, by the time a partner goes through the associate’s work, they might spend more time on a matter than if the partner had simply done the work the first time around. Of course, I am not saying that partners should never assign work to associates, and there are definitely projects that associates are very qualified to handle without the involvement of partners. However, partners should evaluate the total cost to a client in terms of delay and number of hours billed when determining if they should just complete the assignment right the first time.

In the end, lawyers may not have the luxury of time, and may need to rush out work product as soon as possible. However, whenever possible, lawyers should strive to generate the best work product possible the first time around.

# Top Firm To Pay Senior Associates Full Biglaw Salaries For Working In Yearlong Justice Fellowships
## Orrick is really putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to racial and social justice.

We wanted to do more than write a check. We asked ourselves what we could be doing. And pretty quickly we defaulted to the concept of partnering with organizations that were experts in facilitating change.

We saw the richness of the experience they had to learn and grow as lawyers and to learn more directly from organizations we admire. It is easy for organizations, in the moment, to make a commitment and close it over time. We wanted to make a lasting difference that was financially meaningful, had the energy required to make change and to give some of our best people the chance to be part of a new public-private partnership and have a real impact in the community.

— [Mitch Zuklie](https://www.orrick.com/people/8/5/e/mitchell-zuklie), chairman and CEO of Orrick, commenting on the firm’s Racial, Social & Economic Justice Fellowship Program, during an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/10/22/senior-associates-are-a-hot-commodity-orrick-is-lending-out-6-of-them-for-the-next-3-years/). For the past year, six senior Orrick associates have worked as fellows at [Howard University’s Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center](https://thurgoodmarshallcenter.howard.edu/), [NYU Law’s Policing Project](https://www.policingproject.org/), the [Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law](https://www.lawyerscommittee.org/), the [Law Foundation of Silicon Valley](https://www.lawfoundation.org/), [Common Future](https://www.commonfuture.co/), and [A New Way of Life](https://anewwayoflife.org/), all while earning their full Biglaw salaries and bonuses. Orrick is the first Biglaw firm to run any kind of full-salaried program like this, and recently decided to extend its fellowship initiative for the next three years.

# Yet Another Firm Ends Merger Talks With Stroock
## Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.

One month ago, Stroock announced that it was in talks with Pillsbury Winthrop, and the pair had [signed a non-exclusive letter of intent to merge](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/stroock-is-talking-to-another-am-law-100-firm-about-merging-but-its-not-exclusive/). If the proposed tie-up had been successful, it would have brought an international presence to Stroock. Unfortunately, those talks have come to an end, putting Stroock back on the singles market in its time of need.

Pillsbury offered a statement to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/26/pillsbury-ends-merger-talks-with-stroock/) on why things didn’t pan out:

“We considered different options, including a combination and a lateral acquisition, but ultimately determined that we could not reach an agreement that adequately balanced Pillsbury’s long-term strategic objectives with the more immediate financial and other risks involved,” a Pillsbury representative said in an email statement Thursday.

The firm added: “We remain impressed with the quality of Stroock’s lawyers and wish them and their professional staff the very best.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Stroock has this to say about its latest merger failure: “Given our current options, after careful consideration, we also concluded that a Pillsbury-Stroock combination was not the right path for us. Pillsbury is a world-class firm with excellent people, and we wish them and their professional staff the best.”

All of Stroock’s most important financial metrics dropped in 2022 (gross revenue by ~8.8%, revenue per lawyer by ~2%, and profits per equity partner by ~7.5%). On top of its financial losses, the firm has been [leaking lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/partners-associates-staff-flee-biglaw-firm-after-merger-efforts-crumble/) like a sieve ever since it [broke up](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-merger-effort-crumbles/) with Nixon Peabody. Prior to that, the firm had gone so far as to [cut salaries and hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-reportedly-cut-pay-hours-as-it-struggled-to-find-merger-partner/) for senior staff members and [conduct layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/stroock-layoffs/) among its attorneys and staff. Given this backdrop, the firm does not seem to be in a very good place right now, so hopefully those “options” work out.

[Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/) started the trend, then [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/) hopped on board. Today, Weil Gotshal informed attorneys they’ll have to be in the office four days a week, starting in September.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/11/weil-gotshal-to-require-four-days-of-office-attendance/) Law.com, associates will be expected to be in the office Monday – Thursday. Additionally, associates and counsel will have 12 “flexible remote days” a year (they’ll get four flex days for the remainder of 2023 when the policy starts in the fall). Attorneys will also have the option to work remotely the last two weeks of August, the week of Thanksgiving, and the week between Christmas and New Year’s.

In announcing the policy change, the firm noted the benefits of in-person lawyering for training, professional development, and more:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“Over the past year, we have all seen the many benefits that come with people working regularly in-person — especially with the predictability of knowing people will be in consistently on the same days,” the email stated. “Training for our lawyers at all levels has benefited from the full return, as have mentorship, morale and professional development.”

The only real question is which other firms will take an iron-fist approach to office attendance. Now that three Biglaw firms are on board, it is officially a trend, and you’d best believe the industry will take notice.

As soon as you find out about office attendance plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

Dechert’s long-running Neil Gerrard headache continues.

It all started when the firm’s former white collar practice chief Gerrard began working for the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (he began working for ENRC at DLA Piper, but brought the engagement with him when he lateraled to Dechert). ENRC hired Gerrard to conduct an internal investigation into its Kazakhstan operations.

Given that, [during the time in question](https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/anticorruption/press/news/details/153783?lang=en#:~:text=Kazakhstan%20has%20for%20the%20first,in%202019%20(34%20points).), Kazakhstan scored a solid 3 out of 100 in the international corruption index, this was probably a prudent move for ENRC!

Everyone knows that it’s important to set a budget in any legal engagement. ENRC planned on this matter costing around £400,000. The matter cost £13,000,000. Damn surge pricing!

The massive spike in costs came as the investigation ballooned to include inquiries into dealings in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iran. Which, to be fair, also raise some red flags as business partners!

Though allegations arose that Gerrard referred to the billing model as “[rape mode](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-most-offensive-way-to-refer-to-biglaw-bills/)” casting doubt on the legitimacy of those inquiries. Ultimately, Gerrard got benchslapped for [making leaks to discredit his client](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/biglaw-partner-treated-client-as-cash-cow-gets-benchslapped-in-court-judgment/), seemingly in a bid to get them to hire him to help them out of the public jams created by those leaks? The last time we checked in on that case, Dechert had agreed to an interim $20 million payment.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now an unrelated [new lawsuit in the Southern District of New York](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/10/Dechert-Gerrard.pdf) against Dechert and Gerrard among others seeks “total damages in excess of $100 million” for obstruction, witness tampering, money laundering, mail and bank fraud, and… yes… doing the RICO.

[Farhad Azima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhad_Azima) claims Gerrard and Dechert colluded with others to target Azima after Azima sought to expose human rights abuses committed by a Dechert client. Per the complaint:

Dechert played a central role in the Enterprise’s affairs and criminal activity. To carry out its scheme, Gerrard and the Enterprise relied upon Dechert’s infrastructure, partners, employees, financial resources, and reputation. Dechert received millions of dollars in fees as a direct result of the Enterprise’s continuing campaign of criminal conduct. Dechert and its leadership were at least willfully blind or recklessly indifferent to Gerrard’s misconduct. The firm ignored “red flags” regarding Gerrard beginning when it first hired him as a partner in 2010 and turned a blind eye to increasingly clear evidence that emerged over the following decade showing that Gerrard was involved in serious ethical violations, human rights abuses, and criminal activity, including hacking.

This dovetails with [a lawsuit brought by former WSJ reporter Jay Solomon in the District of DC](https://abovethelaw.com/job/senior-policy-manager-child-welfare-remote/), alleging that Dechert hired hackers based in India to get his emails with Azima. Solomon says those emails included “suggestive language creating a wrongful appearance of alleged improper, unethical and/or fraudulent dealings between Mr. Solomon and Mr. Azima that never occurred.” The leaking of the hacked emails cost Solomon his job.

Dechert denies the allegations, but whether the allegations prove true or not, Gerrard’s probably not getting the Dechert alumni holiday card this year.

# Biglaw Firms 'Flush With Cash' Are Getting Even Bigger With Group Lateral Moves
## They've got the money, and they're using it to grow strategically.

If you aren’t moving forward, you are falling behind. It is an increasing imperative for firms to grow more as their peer firms do so. Many firms are flush with cash, and they are investing that money in growth. At the same time, about 20% of the market has had a disappointing two to three years. Those firms are increasingly becoming the outliers, and high-quality teams are starting to question whether they are on the right platform.

— Law firm consultant Kent Zimmermann of the Zeughauser Group, offering his thoughts to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/08/more-law-firms-are-using-large-lateral-groups-to-drive-growth-strategy/) on the recent trend that’s been spreading through Biglaw: group lateral moves. As far as even larger law firm growth is concerned, Zimmermann said Zeughauser’s merger practice is “busier than it has ever been by about four times,” and that he expects merger activity to pick up at the end of the year. “That speaks to the strategic imperative for firms to get bigger and more profitable,” he said. “Firms don’t want to get overshadowed.”

# $400K Is Now The Official Market Rate For Supreme Court Clerk Bonuses
## But not everyone is thrilled that the number has climbed so high.

Just how high will signing bonuses for Supreme Court clerks go? It was just last summer that the going the market rate rose to a new peak — [$350,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/supreme-court-clerk-bonuses-hit-an-incredible-new-high/) — but it’s now been confirmed that $400,000 is now the prevailing rate. Yes, you’re reading that correctly. Biglaw firms and prestigious boutiques are now willing to pay former Supreme Court clerks almost half a million dollars in bonus money just for signing on the dotted line, on top of their base salaries and regular bonuses. Former SCOTUS clerks are making almost double their Supreme bosses’ salaries. This is crazy.

We first [hinted at this trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-the-complete-clerk-roster-for-october-term-2018/) back in August, when my colleague David Lat mentioned that at least six firms — Jones Day, Kirkland & Ellis, Orrick, Paul Weiss, Skadden Arps, and Susman Godfrey — were offering $400,000 bonuses to their SCOTUS clerk recruits. Michael Scanlon, hiring partner at Gibson Dunn, now confirms that “the market appears to have settled” at $400K.

Court-watchers are having trouble believing Biglaw firms are willing to pay this much money just for a new associate’s résumé line, and some have even suggested that ethics rules be consulted. Tony Mauro of the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2018/11/14/400k-for-scotus-clerks-a-bonus-too-far/) has the details:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“It’s become absurd,” said Todd Peppers, who has written books about Supreme Court clerks. “These firms can no longer credibly argue that they are compensating these former clerks for the additional education and training obtained during their Supreme Court clerkships. Yes, these former clerks are very smart. That being said, this is about access and insight into the individual chambers.”

U.C. Hastings College of the Law professor Rory Little, himself a former clerk, said, “If I were a clerk today and knew that I could get an extra almost half-million dollars, I would feel very careful about the firms’ Supreme Court cases while clerking. Seriously, an ethics expert needs to look at this carefully, under the current ethics rules and concerns we adopt for lawyers and judges in other situations. All 37 clerks or more feel that same ‘tug,’ even if it is implicit or unconscious.”

More clerks at one firm than at any other may be feeling that “tug” right now, and that’s because Jones Day just [emerged victoriously](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/11/13/jones-day-lands-a-record-11-supreme-court-law-clerks-as-associates/?cmp=share_twitter) from this year’s wooing of the SCOTUS clerks, having cornered the market after hiring 11 of them. That’s a $4.4 million investment in signing bonuses alone for a group of new hires who may wind up taking the money and running after just a few years at the firm.

As noted by Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus, “Jones Day is paying a lot of money for a photograph.” Oof, Jones Day needs to open up a personal injury practice group for that sick burn. Luckily for the firm, there’s a pretty big chance it’ll be staffed by some highly intelligent Supreme Court clerks.

If you know that your firm is paying $400,000 for SCOTUS clerks, [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=SCOTUS%20Clerkship%20Bonuses) (subject line: “SCOTUS Clerkship Bonuses”) or text us (646-820-8477), and we’ll compile a list of every firm that’s paying so generously for talent of Supreme proportions.

# Biglaw Firm's New Partner Compensation Model Leads To Blockbuster Salaries
## $11 million a year? That's quite the payday.

In 2015 Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson made some significant changes to the way they handle partner compensation. While the partnership was never lockstep, the changes — which were made to lure lateral talent — have led to a tripling of the nonequity partnership and growing the gap between the highest and lowest paid partner.

According to a[ report](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/08/14/pay-model-evolves-at-fried-frank-paving-way-for-outsized-earnings/) by the New York Law Journal, the firm has moved away from a points system to a target salary for each partner, and that means some blockbuster paydays for the top rainmakers:

Three legal industry sources with knowledge of some Fried Frank compensation details, speaking on condition of anonymity, told ALM that Lawrence Barshay, a top rainmaker at the firm, has lately been paid at least $11 million a year. Barshay, whose book of business is said to be more than $50 million a year, is head of Fried Frank’s asset management practice. (His brother, Scott Barshay, was reportedly paid nearly $10 million after joining Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison from Cravath, Swaine & Moore in 2016.)

Perhaps it is unsurprising given this change, but Fried Frank has picked up some notable lateral talent including finance partner Adam Summers from Cadwalader, capital markets partner Meredith Mackey from Davis Polk, real estate and distressed debt litigation partner Matthew Parrott from Katten Muchin Rosenman, and financial services litigation and enforcement partner Michael Keats from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.

David Greenwald, chairman of the firm since 2014, has said the changes were designed to reward high achievers and hold those not performing accountable:

“[T]the merit-based approach was largely aligned with the way in which we determined compensation anyway. So it made sense to formalize the process. In doing so, we are strengthening our ability to attract and retain the very best talent. A merit-based system enables us to reward the behaviors we want and to hold people accountable.”

The system winds up being a hybrid black box (and we all know the [issues those are alleged to cause](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-hit-with-explosive-gender-discrimination-case/)) with partners receiving limited information about what their partners make:

[I]nternally, the firm reveals to partners the compensation of its 10 highest-paid partners, as well as pay to partners on the firm’s compensation committee who are not on the top 10 list, attorney sources told ALM. The firm also reveals a scattergram of anonymous partner pay so that partners can see how their pay stacks up against the rest of the partnership.

While firm management may be pleased they can attract laterals under the new system, that doesn’t mean everyone is happy. The ballooning nonequity partnership ranks and the growing disparity between highest and lowest paid partner can breed resentment says law firm management consultant Lisa Smith:

“One of the things that keep managing partners up at night is how do you get the right balance. There is a little bit of a zero-sum game,” she said. Adding the extra money given to star performance has “got to come from somewhere,” Smith said. “That’s what gives some people some pause: Can you have that big of a gap?”

Only time will tell if this change will lead to an exodus of partners from Fried Frank, hoping to find better deals at other firms.

There are many different and exciting ways to rank law firms. How prestigious are they? How much money are they making? How much take-home cash do partners earn? How big are they?

Yes, size matters, and because the legal profession is obsessed with every single measurable and quantifiable factor law firms have to offer, there’s obviously a ranking for that.

Today, the National Law Journal unleashed its [annual NLJ 500](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/06/28/nlj-500-2018-survey-of-the-nations-largest-law-firms/), a ranking of largest law firms in the United States covering the previous calendar year. If you’ve ever wondered about precise law firm headcounts, this is the ranking for you.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For your counting pleasures, here are the 10 largest law firms in the United States:

- Baker McKenzie: 4,719
- DLA Piper: 3,609
- Norton Rose Fulbright: 3,339
- Hogan Lovells: 2,685
- Jones Day: 2,513
- Latham & Watkins: 2,436
- White & Case: 2,039
- Kirkland & Ellis: 1,997
- Greenberg Traurig: 1,944
- Morgan Lewis & Bockius: 1,943
Head to the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/06/28/nlj-500-charts-2018) if you’re curious about the firms ranked 11-500.

Congratulations go out to Baker McKenzie for employing more lawyers than any other firm. You know you’ve made it big when you’ve got more equity partners (701) than the firm that started the latest salary war has total attorneys (Milbank, 690).

Given the sheer numbers alone, the millennial cohort of attorneys will — inevitably and soon — overtake their elders, bringing with them their distinct perspective, working style, and outlook to bear on the future of the legal industry. It is incumbent on the legal industry to understand this generation’s motivations and priorities and adapt accordingly — not necessarily the other way around.

To help understand this changing landscape, we here at Above the Law have partnered with our friends at Major, Lindsey & Africa for the second time to field a series of surveys aimed at exploring changing law firm dynamics and highlight any generational differences between younger lawyers and their more experienced counterparts.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Matches Cravath Compensation For Associates Who Are 'On Scale'
## What does this mean for associates who *aren't* 'on scale'?

Money is flying around Biglaw right now, and firms throughout the Am Law 200 continue to swoop in to match the Cravath salary scale. With associates now earning between $215,000 and $415,000, that’s a nice payday.

A little birdie told us that the latest firm to adopt the Cravath compensation system is Alston & Bird, a firm that’s currently ranked at No. 53 in the most recent Am Law 100. With $851,601,000 gross revenue in 2020, this firm can certainly afford to share its largesse with associates. This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:



It’s worth noting, however, that only those associates who are “on scale” will be receiving these raises. So, what does “on scale” mean here? Some of the associates we’ve heard from seem a bit wary about that language. The memo from the firm seems a bit vague, if we’re being honest.

Are these raises tied to hours? Are these raises discretionary? Could this be a match in name only? Alston & Bird associates, we’re relying on you to let us know. Please reach out to us give us your opinion on these raises. Your comments may find their way into an update (anonymously, of course).

Congrats to everyone at the firm who may (or may not) be receiving raises.

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Alston & Bird.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# A Top Texas Firm Matches In All U.S. Offices

This doesn’t come as a huge surprise — we [predicted it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/morning-docket-06-13-16/) a few days ago — but it’s still welcome news. We’re happy to report that [Andrews Kurth](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/andrews-kurth/) just raised associate salaries to the [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) scale.

The now-familiar scale starts at $180,000, for first-year and incoming associates (class of 2016), and tops out at $315,000, for eighth-year associates. Summer associates are getting bumped up as well, and it all takes effect on July 1. Salaries for counsel, of counsel, and non-U.S. associates “are being evaluated and will be addressed separately.”

One tipster was ecstatic:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
[W]e have been waiting!!!! So excited, especially since most of the big historic firms in Houston have matched with the exception of Fulbright.

That’s right. If you cross Andrews Kurth off this list of [non-raising firms in Texas](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/by-region-which-top-10-vault-ranked-firms-have-not-raised-salaries-for-associates/2/), the two remaining names are Norton Rose Fulbright and Jones Day.

UPDATE (8:30 p.m.): It didn’t show up on our prior list of [Texas non-raisers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/by-region-which-top-10-vault-ranked-firms-have-not-raised-salaries-for-associates/2/) because it’s not in the [Vault top 10 for Texas](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/?sRankID=14) (it’s #11), but Haynes & Boone has yet to raise pay — and we’ve heard from many HayBoo associates who asked us to underscore that fact.

Presumably Andrews Kurth’s [settlement](http://www.law360.com/articles/759999/settlement-reached-in-200m-andrews-kurth-malpractice-suit) in that [giant malpractice case](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/which-biglaw-firm-just-got-hit-with-a-200-million-malpractice-verdict/) wasn’t too financially onerous (or was covered in whole or in part by insurance). Congratulations, AK associates, and welcome to the [MoneyLaw](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/moneylaw/) club!

# Did Kanye West Find A New Biglaw Firm To Represent Him?
## Updated with a statement from the firm.

This week has been full of news in the overlapping Venn diagram that is Biglaw, music, and antisemitism. That may seem like a strange combo, but strange times and all that.

As you’ve likely heard by now, Kanye West has [launched a barrage ](https://www.billboard.com/lists/kanye-west-hate-speech-consequences-timeline/celebrities-react-to-death-con-tweet/)of media appearances and social media posts espousing problematic views. There were the antisemitic attacks on social media that got him booted from Twitter. [He spread](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1129747423/kanye-west-george-floyd-lawsuit) vicious, unfounded rumors that it wasn’t former police officer Derek Chauvin that caused George Floyd’s death but rather fentanyl — and as a result is facing a $250 million lawsuit. He wore a [“White Lives Matter” shirt](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kanye-wests-white-lives-matter-drama-everything-to-know/) to his Yeezy fashion show.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And there have been consequences. He lost deals with Balenciaga and [Adidas](https://fashionista.com/2022/10/adidas-kanye-west-partnership-ending). He was dropped by Creative Artists Agency, and film and television studio MRC announced they were ditching a completed documentary on West.

So, yeah. Ye is going to need some world-class lawyers if he’s going to bounce back from all this. But that hasn’t gone smoothly. First was the news that Kanye picked up [Johnny Depp’s former lawyer, Camille Vasquez](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/amid-fallout-from-antisemitic-rants-george-floyd-conspiracy-theories-and-more-kanye-west-turns-to-familiar-biglaw-face-for-legal-help/) of Brown Rudnick. But when the rapper declined to back off of his antisemitic remarks, t[he firm backed off the representation](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firm-passes-on-representing-kanye-west-after-rapper-refuses-to-back-away-from-antisemitic-remarks/). Cadwalader, the firm that previously represented Ye in his split with Gap, also [distanced themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/second-biglaw-firms-dump-kanye-west-over-antisemitic-remarks/) from the rapper.

But, if Kanye’s [recent Instagram post](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2022/10/27/kanye-west-returns-to-instagram-addresses-losing-billionaire-status-in-love-speech/) is to be believed, he may have found a Biglaw firm to represent him in his mounting legal woes.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
My guess is no one told Kanye what happens to privileged material when it is shared with the world…

Hmmm, one does wonder who MF at Quinn Emanuel actually is. Of course, MF could just be a delightful, if raunchy, nickname Ye uses for this lawyer in his phone.

Ye has since deleted the Instagram story.

UPDATE: Quinn Emanuel provided the following statement:

“QE is opposed to all forms of bigotry and hate.  In the rare instance a client espouses such abhorrent views we consider whether and how we can exit the representation consistent with our ethical obligations as lawyers.”

# Cleta Mitchell Out At Foley & Lardner After Troubling Donald Trump Call
## Firm avoids potentially damaging business repercussions.

After [participating in a phone call](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/donald-trump-drags-biglaw-firm-into-middle-of-election-interference-effort/) where Donald Trump was captured on tape pressuring Georgia election officials to commit what election law experts identified as well within the statutory definition of election fraud, Cleta Mitchell is gone as a Foley & Lardner partner.

New York Times reporter Michael S. Schmidt relayed the Foley & Lardner statement moments ago.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Cleta Mitchell has resigned from [@FoleyandLardner](https://twitter.com/FoleyandLardner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). The firm said in a statement: ""Cleta Mitchell has informed firm management of her decision to resign from Foley & Lardner effective immediately."" [https://t.co/2peHwUTjOi](https://t.co/2peHwUTjOi)

— Michael S. Schmidt (@nytmike) [January 5, 2021](https://twitter.com/nytmike/status/1346568330656833536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The parties apparently [never bothered to establish that the call was confidential](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-donald-trump-call-shouldnt-have-been-leaked-if-counsel-were-even-remotely-doing-their-jobs/), resulting in a bombshell when the Washington Post and Atlanta Journal-Constitution published the audio and transcript.

While Mitchell has resigned, there’s ample reason to believe this was less than a unilateral decision. Mitchell’s appearance on the call clearly shocked Foley & Lardner, who were quick to announce that the firm itself was not retained to represent Donald Trump, despite Mitchell’s rhetoric on the call where she spoke of reviewing evidence in the case and explaining allegations that “we” made in Trump’s filings challenging election results. As of yesterday, Foley & Lardner said they were concerned and investigating Mitchell’s private involvement in the case. Given that attorneys in law firms cannot easily practice side gigs without inviting myriad ethical and insurance coverage issues, Foley & Lardner had reason to be deeply troubled.

With some clients already expressing a desire to terminate their relationships with the firm, and [outside groups gearing up to pressure others](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/foley-lardner-to-feel-wrath-of-the-lincoln-project/), the firm has now cleared itself of a potential drag on its overarching business. It’s the sort of move that firms like Jones Day have yet to make, preferring instead to withdraw from specific, publicized matters while [preserving the opportunity to pursue future voter suppression work](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/), a practice [it has famously pursued for years](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/gop-lawyer-slams-trump-for-undermining-election-confidence-despite-long-career-of-undermining-election-confidence/).

The only remaining question is the identity of the third attorney on the now-infamous call. The transcript identifies Cleta Mitchell, Georgia attorney Kurt Hilbert, and someone only referred to as “Alex.” We have received some anonymous tipster input suggesting that this lawyer is another Biglaw attorney and have contacted the firm potentially involved but we have been unable to confirm. If you know who this wily attorney is, please let us know.

# Hold Onto Your Billing Rate: Over 80 Percent Of Companies Plan On Cutting Legal Spend
## It's kinda a bad news/good news thing (if you want to leave Biglaw).

Bad news if you’re hoping the good times in the Biglaw legal market will continue indefinitely. According to an [EY survey](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/tax/why-the-legal-function-must-be-reimagined-for-the-digital-age), 82(!) percent of in-house leaders said they plan on cutting the amount of money they spend on legal matters over the next two years. The survey, which received responses from 1,058 senior legal practitioners in 25 countries, further found that of those planning on reducing what they spend on outside counsel, 37 percent said they plan on slashing their legal spend by 11 – 20 percent.

So, why are these companies planning on cutting back on legal spend? Well, as reported by [Law.com](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2019/06/24/survey-most-companies-will-reduce-legal-spend-in-the-next-2-years/), a lot of it comes down to talent. With lawyers in private practice seeing salary increases, in-house departments have to sweeten the pot monetarily if they want to attract the best and the brightest, and that money has to come from somewhere:

“Lawyers’ salaries have been on a steep upward trend in markets like London, and therefore firms pay hefty salaries to attract mid‑career or newly qualified lawyers,” EY Riverview Law CEO Chris Price said in the report. “Having made the hire, the legal function is then forced to keep up with private practice salary expectations, often outstripping their internal counterparts’ salary increments.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And even when in-house employers are able to pony up the big bucks, making the legal work in-house lawyers do is actually interesting can be a challenge. With increased career options for lawyers, including contract work or legal tech opportunities, in-house jobs aren’t quite as coveted by those looking to escape Biglaw:

“The recruitment challenge for legal teams seeking junior lawyers is to attract them with meaningful work, not routine activities, and demonstrate the potential for career progression,” Paula Hogéus, EY global labor and employment law leader, said in the report.

Perhaps what is bad for Biglaw has tremendous upside for those looking to go in-house.

# Immersion Is The First Step To Mastering Legal Oversight Of AI
## It isn't just diving in. It's diving in over and over, day after day.

Theoretical swimmers don’t win Olympic competitions. Studying and discussing swimming styles doesn’t prepare a swimmer to compete. Champion swimmers must dive into the water and practice, building endurance and refining their techniques daily.

For lawyers who must oversee the use of AI in their organizations and legal practices, success requires the same hands-on, immersive approach. In highlighting the importance of immersion, persistence, and practical learning below, I shed light on how lawyers can master the skills and techniques to better engage with and oversee the evolving world of AI.

Hands-On Learning For More Effective AI Oversight

Through continuous oversight, lawyers address AI systems’ potential risks, biases, and ethical concerns while protecting individual rights, promoting fairness, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Just as swimmers can’t succeed by merely understanding aquatics principles, lawyers can’t optimize AI’s full potential without immersing themselves in its practical applications. Actively engaging in deploying and using AI tools for daily tasks teaches you about their actual functions, limitations, and potential. 

Much of the information online is hype and speculation. Firsthand knowledge of how AI technologies function in real-world scenarios increases your ability to evaluate actual potential business impacts. Immersion provides the space for lived experience, helping you more deeply understand the cause-and-effect relationships in AI systems and empowering you to:

- Establish appropriate guidelines and policies for when and how employees should use various AI applications.
- Discover the legal and business tasks most suitable for automation.
- Observe the performance of AI tools across various workflows to determine whether they are more efficient than traditional methods.
- Easily detect potential issues and take measures to prevent misuse.
Like an Olympic swimmer who must attend daily training sessions to ensure peak physical and technical abilities, your persistence in learning through AI tools strengthens your competencies. It prepares you for the complex challenges ahead. 

Refine Oversight Strategies Through Iterative Learning

Reading books and articles on AI expands your knowledge base, but only through immersion can you enhance your experience level. When crafting AI oversight programs, your firsthand experiences form the foundation for the subsequent introspection, evaluation, and execution stages. 

Dive into projects that involve AI’s practical application, identify improvement areas, and refine your oversight strategies through the iterative learning process. Ultimately, the legal oversight function will maximize AI benefits for clients, leading to more accurate and comprehensive legal analyses for more data-driven decision-making and improved legal outcomes. 

There will be moments of triumph, with breakthroughs akin to coding mastery and challenging periods when AI implementation stumbles. Embracing these fluctuations helps you build resilience and competence, while your experiential knowledge empowers you to overcome inevitable challenges. 

Swimmers often push their limits to strive for record-breaking achievements. You can likewise target ambitious initiatives that create meaningful change and implement AI technologies that enhance the overall impact of your legal services. Committing to hands-on experimentation and overcoming setbacks will spur personal and professional growth, leading to greater AI implementation success. 

What AI-related initiatives do you want to pursue? How will you measure your progress? What AI-related learning can you apply to your next endeavor?

# InterAction+ Brings Power Of CRM Software To Law Firms Of All Sizes
## The only legal CRM with exclusive content from LexisNexis®.

Marketing professionals and administrators at large law firms have long understood the power of [Client Relationship Management (CRM)](https://bit.ly/44LTrFI) software as an engine to drive firm revenues and business performance. CRM applications surface crucial intelligence derived from relationship data, which helps law firms make better business decisions and build stronger relationships with clients.

“A CRM system is not just a tool, it’s a powerful strategy for customer relationship building and business growth,” [writes](https://bit.ly/3ZgujpA) Chris Fritsch, in JD Supra. “You can … see a significant positive impact on your business growth and retention efforts.”

The specific benefits to law firms that rely on CRM applications can even be measured. LexisNexis [commissioned a study](https://bit.ly/3ZcYoWU) conducted by Forrester Consulting in 2021, which found that customers deploying InterAction — the leading CRM solution specifically designed for legal and professional services — achieved, on average, a 62% efficiency improvement in their marketing and business development staff and a 34% efficiency improvement among lawyers and legal professionals.

Moreover, the [Forrester analysts concluded](https://bit.ly/44Ikly5) that these firms realized a 2% increase in revenues that was directly attributable to using InterAction. Indeed, for almost three decades, InterAction has helped law firms drive business relationships, accelerate firm growth and increase revenues by embedding client intelligence at the heart of every engagement. The platform is used by three-quarters of the Am Law 100 and the majority of the largest law firms worldwide.

But while most large law firms have been embracing the power of CRM software for some time now, small and mid-sized law firms have been hesitant to jump on board. One [report](https://bit.ly/3rb6KSs) from Legaltech News found that just one in eight firms in this market niche own a CRM platform, and even fewer actively use their systems. The result is that these firms are either managing their relationship data through Outlook, Excel spreadsheets, or mass-market CRM tools that were not intended for the unique nature of law firm operations.

There is now good news for marketing professionals and administrators working in this segment of the legal services market who have felt that an advanced law firm CRM platform was out of reach for their firms.

This summer LexisNexis [announced](https://bit.ly/3P5NAoU) the launch of InterAction+, a new cloud-based CRM solution that accelerates business growth in law firms of all sizes with the only legal CRM platform that utilizes relationship intelligence and reveals new business opportunities for a competitive advantage.

The new offering is an important development in the industry and was greeted with enthusiasm by legal tech media outlets such as [Legaltech News](https://bit.ly/3Ph2l8m), [Legal IT Insider](https://bit.ly/44N9eUD), and the [Dewey B Strategic](https://bit.ly/48dkfBN) blog.

“In a move to make the software available to mid- and smaller-sized law firms, LexisNexis is releasing InterAction+, a cloud-based product that unites many of the features of the legacy version with a more-modern user experience and mobile connectivity,” [wrote](https://bit.ly/4882SCd) Bob Ambrogi, a veteran legal technology journalist, on his LawSites blog. His review noted that InterAction+ also features “unique integrations with LexisNexis content relevant to business development and relationship management.”

InterAction+ extends the power of CRM software to law firms of all sizes in three critical ways:

1. Strengthen Relationships

The platform helps law firm professionals pro-actively manage and grow key relationships with actionable client data to enhance client services and uncover new revenue opportunities.

2. Generate New Business

InterAction+ uncovers new business and cross-practice marketing opportunities that deliver a competitive edge to lawyers.

3. Mitigate Revenue Loss

The software surfaces hidden and weakened connections with an at-a-glance dashboard that reveals clients at risk, which helps firms mitigate potential lost revenues with improved client retention.



Small- and mid-sized firms will be especially empowered by access to actionable insights that InterAction+ delivers by drawing on various LexisNexis tools and related content databases. For example, InterAction+ is integrated with [Context](https://bit.ly/2NeEbLe), a LexisNexis litigation analytics product, which provides law firms with robust litigation data specific to their existing clients, prospective clients and law firm competitors.

InterAction+ is available to law firms of any size and existing InterAction customers can add the cloud-hosted solution of InterAction+ with minimal effort. In the meantime, LexisNexis will continue to develop and support the traditional on-premises version of InterAction.

# Laid-Off Attorneys Face Unfair Biases
## Attorneys who are laid off from firms deserve kindness and understanding, since the are likely experiencing a difficult time in their lives.

As this website has covered at length for over a decade, layoffs are common within the legal profession.  Mass reductions in force can occur at law firms for a wide variety of reasons.  For instance, economic conditions, such as those experienced during the Great Recession, might lead to less demand for legal service.  As a result, law firms may need to reduce their headcount in order to account for the decrease in demand.  In addition, clients often choose to work with different legal counsel, and this might mean that firms must eliminate attorneys who worked on matters that are no longer handled by a firm.  Furthermore, cases settling or partners retiring can all impact a firm’s decision to reduce headcount.

Although there are many times when firms need to terminate employees due to performance, in the vast majority of instances, [layoffs have absolutely nothing to do with a lawyer’s work](https://www.rothmanlawyer.com/limitations-on-the-right-to-fire-employees/).  Indeed, attorneys usually have no impact on the more global conditions that influence layoff determinations.  However, attorneys who are laid off may still face biases and stigma when searching for new positions.

I recently went to an attorney social event and met a lawyer who had been laid off because of the collapse of LeClairRyan.  This attorney has been applying to jobs for weeks, and had some interviews lined up for a variety of roles.  I told this lawyer that he was looking for work in a relatively strong job market, and he should expect to have a new job before too long.  This attorney had an excellent background, and employers should know about all of the craziness at LeClairRyan that precipitated this attorney being let go.

However, I couldn’t help but think that this attorney might be at a disadvantage when looking for work.  Surely, any reasonable person should know that an associate at a bankrupt law firm was not terminated because of job performance, but because of a number of external factors.  However, people may think that this attorney might have landed at another firm with a departing partner if their work was up to snuff or that this attorney otherwise had some ownership over the situation.

I faced a similar sentiment when I was laid off at the beginning of my career.  A little more than a year after I started practicing, I was laid off in a mass reduction of force along with dozens of other attorneys and staffers.  The layoffs were motivated by a number of external factors, including a major matter settling and economic issues with our firm.

However, even though I was laid off with dozens of other lawyers, and many articles were published about the troubles at our firm, I couldn’t help but feel that people thought I was responsible for my situation.  Based on the questions I received at interviews, I felt like attorneys held the belief that I could have avoided my fate if I had worked harder.  Despite any logic to the contrary, I felt that it was impossible to shake this flawed perception among legal professionals, and this made it difficult to get hired at other shops.

Another unfair issue with being laid off is that it places an indelible dark mark on your career.  Attorneys are oftentimes addicted to prestige, and hiring partners like to recruit people who are on an upward trajectory in their careers.  Getting laid off along the way, even if the attorney had nothing to do with this process, can put a lawyer at a disadvantage when compared to attorneys who were never laid off.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Many lawyers, especially those who practiced during the Great Recession, were laid off at some point or another, or know someone close to them that was.  Being laid off is a traumatic experience that leads to isolation, depression, and a number of negative outcomes.  Attorneys who are laid off from firms deserve kindness and understanding, since the are likely experiencing a difficult time in their lives.

As a result, it is important for people making hiring decisions to understand that many layoffs have absolutely nothing to do with an attorney’s work performance.  In most instances, there is nothing that an attorney could have done to avoid getting laid off, since external factors beyond the attorney’s control contributed to the layoff.  Hiring partners should not hold an associate liable for the bad decisions of senior partners or the choices of clients that likely motivated the reduction in force.  In addition, hiring staff should understand that being laid off is not a huge blemish on a legal career, and will not affect an associate’s performance at a new firm.

I wish everyone searching for work as a result of the LeClairRyan bankruptcy and other mass reductions in force the best of luck in finding new jobs.  Professionals within the legal industry should be compassionate to these individuals and should not unfairly judge applicants because they were laid off.

Be sure to also read [Part I (Interviews)](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/timeline-for-a-lateral-associate-move-and-the-offer-acceptance-process-interviews-part-i/) of this series.

To best plan and execute a lateral associate move, it is important to understand the usual timeline for a move and how various factors can affect that timeline. In [last week’s installment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/timeline-for-a-lateral-associate-move-and-the-offer-acceptance-process-interviews-part-i/), I discussed the timing of the interview process. This week, I discuss the offer and acceptance process. Remember, the timeline below in italics is just an example of a more standard timeframe but every lateral move is different.

Offer & Acceptance

Weeks 5-6: Firm makes an offer

A firm may make an offer immediately after the final round of interviews, but it’s more common for partners to meet to decide if they will make an offer or not. On occasion, an offer is delayed because the firm is discussing the class year or salary at which they will make the offer. It’s also common to receive a call from a partner extending a verbal offer before receiving a written offer letter. Be prepared. Know how you are going to react before you get the offer call. It may be helpful to discuss or even rehearse with your recruiter your response when you are on the spot, to be sure you convey the right tone.

Week 7: You accept the offer

The written offer letter may state the date by which you must accept. Even if it does not, it’s standard to respond within 7-14 days. In no case should you let communications lapse between you and the firm during this time. Keep the firm updated (directly or via your recruiter) on your intended timing for giving them an answer and let them know if you have questions or would like to speak with additional people before making your decision. Do not mislead the firm, but do convey your enthusiasm about the offer.

The firm’s recruiting department should be able to arrange meetings with additional partners and/or associates if those meetings would be useful in making your final decision. These may be team members you did not meet through the interview process or this may just be a chance to meet these lawyers again where you may ask questions that may not have been fully appropriate during the interview process. It’s your chance to see the associate in a more informal setting. That said, always be professional. Keep in mind the firm can rescind your offer if you act inappropriately at any point in the acceptance process or give them reason to doubt that you are not enthusiastic about the new opportunity.

A note of caution: Read your offer letter carefully! You are a lawyer. You have no excuse not to read every word and be sure you understand it. Of course, this is another place where a recruiter can be of great value. We can tell you if there is anything non-standard and what might be negotiable and what probably is not. We can also advise on how to best approach the discrepancy. It may be best for the recruiter to speak directly with HR, to avoid awkwardness between you and your future employer.

One detail likely included in your offer letter: You may be asked to produce a good standing certificate from all jurisdictions where you claim to be admitted (or at least from the local jurisdiction) before you start work at the new firm. Be sure you are up to date on your CLEs and on your bar dues so that you won’t run into any trouble with this! Admitting to a firm that you are not actually in good standing is a sure way to get off on the wrong foot, if you even still have a job with the new employer. If you are admitted in New York, First Department, [here is the form](http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/ad1/Committees&Programs/CFC/CFC_Certificate%20of%20Good%20Standing%20Request%20FormFillable.pdf) you’ll need to fill out to request the certificate.

How do you actually accept? Many offer letters require you to sign the letter and return it in order to accept the offer. While a recruiter can be very helpful as an intermediary at many stages in the process, there’s no reason not to deliver the good news of an offer acceptance personally. My advice may vary depending on the specifics of the situation, but generally you should:

- Let your recruiter know you plan to accept.
- Call the partner who called you with the oral offer, if applicable, and tell him or her you are enthusiastically accepting.
- Follow up immediately, returning the signed offer letter to HR, if required.
- Let your recruiter know you accepted so he or she can inform the firm’s Recruiting Coordinator. Or if you’ve established a friendly rapport with the Recruiting Coordinator already, you may choose to deliver the good new personally.
If you already have a vacation planned for around or soon after your likely start date, tell the firm at the offer acceptance stage. They will almost always be accommodating if they know upfront, even if you will not have technically accrued that vacation time yet. Do not wait to tell the firm once you start.

Background Checks & Conflicts

Week 8: Checks & Conflicts

After you accept your offer, the firm will conduct background and conflicts checks.

Conflicts Check

One of the most onerous, yet necessary, parts of the lateral process is the conflicts check. Each firm has a different process of checking conflicts and most firms’ processes are constantly evolving. The process can also be much more involved for partners and for litigators or patent attorneys. What do you need to know as the candidate? Keep very good records from Day 1 of all the matters you have worked on. I always encourage the most junior associates to maintain a deal sheet or representative matters sheet from the very start. (See my post on [Compiling a Deal Sheet](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/10-tips-for-compiling-a-deal-sheet/) for guidance.) It’s a great way of taking stock of your professional development, helpful — if not essential — to provide this list with your résumé for lateral moves, and also essential for the conflicts check. Even if it’s a matter not worthy of including on your “public” rep matters sheet, keep a fully inclusive list for yourself. If you do not have a deal sheet, you will need to go back through your diaries and/or all the documents you have worked on in your firm’s database to recreate the list. This can take a long time, so start before you have an offer in hand! If you have any questions at all about what needs to be disclosed, it is better to err on the side of asking the conflicts team at the new firm how to proceed.

Note that conflicts are rarely an issue for non-litigators, but they can be problematic or at the very least cause some delays for litigators or patent attorneys. If you are working on potentially problematic matters, you can ask the firm to check for those conflicts at the start of the process, so as not to waste everyone’s time and get your hopes up unnecessarily if there is going to be a conflict. On occasion, a firm will ask a candidate if he or she has been adverse to specific clients before agreeing to a first round interview.

Background Check

While background checks used to be fairly simple and limited to criminal background checks, some firms’ checks are now more involved. They may also include a review of your online presence and/or a credit check. These background checks are usually outsourced to third parties, because the firms lack the necessary resources but also because most firms attempt to separate the “checkers” from the “hirers” so as to avoid any conscious or unconscious discrimination in the hiring process. What do you need to know as the candidate?

- Complete the forms completely and as soon as possible.
- If you have no criminal record, you’re likely in the clear. But if you have anything that is more recent or somehow slipped through during your bar admission and first hire, discuss with your recruiter upfront, before applying to new positions, to determine how best to proceed.
- Even if you have no criminal record, be sure to do a scan of your online presence before you start the hiring process. Even if it’s not an official part of the process, you have to assume that your interviewers will Google you. It’s OK to have a personality, but take down anything that could paint you as unprofessional or disrespectful. Be cautious about vocalizing strong political opinions in the online public domain. While a firm will never outright reject you because of your political opinions, firms will often reject candidates for no stated reason at all.

CMS Law TikTok via Roll on Friday

Biglaw fights for every advantage in the war for talent. That’s why no matter what an enterprising first mover chooses to salary and bonuses converge into a singularity with the inevitability of Thanos. So firms find new frontiers to distinguish themselves: [thrilling summer programs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/vault-summer-associate-ranking-2024/), [tech stipends](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/actually-this-tech-stipend-blows-the-competition-out-of-the-water/), [killer offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/white-case-has-built-the-new-modern-law-firm-office-and-its-awesome/) (or in the alternative generous [work from anywhere policies](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/quinn-emanuel-will-allow-lawyers-to-work-remotely-indefinitely-from-anywhere-in-the-country/))… whatever it takes.

Firms would eventually seek out TikTok to reach young prospective lawyers. And the results are:

Or maybe not? There’s a slice of TikTok dedicated to awkward comedy. CMS may be leaning into that. Maybe?

[Roll on Friday has the story](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-hogan-lovells-and-cms-pioneer-lawkward-tiktoks) along with the necessary insights into these offices that only our UK-based friends can provide, but the gist of it is that CMS UK posted video of some young lawyers bragging about the Edinburgh office.

You can see the castle! You can drink soda! The firm has spent $10 bucks — or quid I suppose — on jelly beans!

STOP DRILLING YOU’VE STRUCK OIL!

As RoF notes:

The junior lawyers comandeered to star in the TikTok clips appear to be minting a new #lawkward genre by acting in an intentionally (ROF hopes) stiff manner.

Whether CMS knew they were creating cringe comedy or not, another firm’s effort seems more intentional. Sensing an opportunity to either dunk on or just out do a rival, the social media team at Hogan Lovells created their own “of course we have” video for the Birmingham office.

Alas no. Unless folks are way more creative with those ducks than I want to think about.

That mild-mannered lawyer down the hall? She might have poured vodka into her orange juice or tossed back a few wake-up pills this morning. I did everything right — got great grades, made the Law Review and succeeded in a big firm job. But my predisposition to addiction combined with the grueling and psychologically challenging life of a junior lawyer resulted in a brutal and damaging 10 years of substance abuse.

— [Lisa Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-smith-0900b6b), deputy executive director and director of client relations at [Patterson Belknap](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/patterson-belknap-webb-tyler/), [honestly detailing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/03/24/the-most-terrifying-part-of-my-drug-addiction-that-my-law-firm-would-find-out/) the way in which life at a Biglaw firm can walk hand and hand with addiction issues. Her memoir, [Girl Walks Out Of A Bar](http://amzn.to/22xUzLi) (affiliate link), will be released in June.

# Biglaw Firm Takes Big Steps To Focus On Attorney Mental Health And Wellness
## The firm wants to help attorneys and staff create 'lives of meaning and fulfillment.'

Attorneys in Biglaw continue to struggle with mental health and substance abuse issues, but one firm has moved to compassionately address these issues through meaningful programming focused on employee wellness.

Morgan Lewis is the latest firm to turn its attention to its employees’ well-being. As one of the first firms to commit to the [American Bar Association’s attorney wellness pledge](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/biglaw-firms-pledge-to-help-lawyers-struggling-with-substance-abuse-mental-health-issues/), today Morgan Lewis launched ML Well, a program designed to support the “intellectual, physical, emotional, and occupational health” of all of its employees through educational programming that will help them create “lives of meaning and fulfillment.” Patrick Krill, an expert on addiction and mental health, will also assist with the firm’s educational endeavors.

On top of this fantastic new initiative, Morgan Lewis has hired Krista Logelin, its first executive focused entirely on employee wellness issues. Logelin holds a master’s degree in Applied Positive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. Amanda Smith, the firm’s chief engagement officer, explained why Morgan Lewis hired someone to oversee the ML Well program: “We knew, especially given the size of the firm and the scope of the things we wanted to try to tackle, that we needed to make sure that it was properly supported within the firm, that it wasn’t one-quarter of somebody’s job. It’s going to help us sustain a well-being program out past launch or past a month or past a year.”

Morgan Lewis chair Jami McKeon had this to say about the firm’s focus on wellness:

The legal profession is as challenging as it is rewarding, and we must come together to create a supportive community. Well-being is a central focus of our culture at Morgan Lewis, and we are devoted to ensuring an environment that fosters our values. ML Well provides a vehicle to do even more in this arena.

Congratulations to Morgan Lewis on its commitment to supporting and improving the well-being of its attorneys and staff members. We hope that more Biglaw firms are willing to make the same pledge.

# Interview Horror Stories: Eating And Talking At The Same Time Can Be A Challenge
## It's like walking and chewing gum.

[Last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/all-the-things-that-can-go-wrong-during-on-campus-interviews/), we here at Above the Law asked readers for their Biglaw interview horror stories. After all, on-campus recruiting season is upon us and it is nearly spooky season. And the tales of terror are already pouring in.

This first one reminds wannabe attorneys that no matter how much you plan, sometimes things *still* go wrong. Especially with all the variables of lunch interviewing. Eating and interviewing are not two great tastes that taste great together.

This is not an on-campus, but actually a call-back interview.  I was a 1L at Michigan in the winter of 1993, and received a couple of call-back interviews to Chicago firms.  Unfortunately, I caught a horrible flu the day before the interviews, and could barely speak.

After my morning interviews, I was taken out to lunch at a French Bistro.  Minding old horror stories I heard from my elders, I thought hard about my entree – no spaghetti, no sandwiches, stay with knife and fork items.  I settled on pumpkin ravioli.  Yum, and safe.

I gesture with my hands even when I have a voice, but I had to do this even more, since at that point, the flu had reduced my voice to a literal pipsqueak.  After taking a bite of food and listening politely to questions, I began to tell my lunch companions about a funny story of my travels.  Fork and knife set demurely along each side of my slightly rounded plate.

Suddenly, my gesticulating right hand came too close to the plate.  The rest was experienced in slow motion.

HA – HA – HA  (hand hits table too close to plate)
HA – HA – HA (fork balanced on edge of plate is hit)
HA – HA – HA (ravioli on top of fork launches into air)
HA – H ——    (my attention is captured by launched ravioli)

[insert music from 6-Million-Dollar-Man TV show slow motion segment]

Ravioli travels across table, lands in Diet Pepsi glass of associate from Firm with an audible PLOP.

No, I didn’t get the job.

We previously covered the [tragic March 2021 death](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/promising-young-biglaw-associate-dies-after-using-cocaine-laced-with-fentanyl/) of 26-year-old Julia Ghahramani, a 2020 graduate of Columbia Law School who worked as a first-year associate at Akin Gump. Prosecutors now hope to sentence Billy Ortega — the drug dealer who sold the fentanyl-laced drugs that killed Ghahramani and two other professionals in New York City — to life in prison.

In January, Ortega was convicted on one count of narcotics conspiracy resulting in death, three counts of narcotics distribution resulting in death, and one count of use and carrying of a firearm in furtherance of the narcotics conspiracy. Ortega would like to serve no more than 25 years in prison for his crimes.

Sentencing in the case is scheduled for October 4.

Please be aware that fentanyl is being put into other drugs, increasing the likelihood for overdose and even death. Please click [here](https://harmreduction.org/issues/fentanyl/) to see a general resource for harm reduction for fentanyl. The two most popular and well-regarded manufacturers of fentanyl test strips are DanceSafe and BTNX (both of which were recommended by a Johns Hopkins study). Click [here](https://dancesafe.org/shop/) and [here](https://www.btnx.com/HarmReduction) for more information and to purchase these test strips. Fentanyl test strips are affordable, quick, and easy to use.

April Fools’ Day is just around the corner, but this Magic Circle firm isn’t fooling when it comes to its special bonuses. It looks like Clifford Chance will be matching the latest round of special bonuses.

The firm announced this morning that it would be matching the Davis Polk scale, and making payments on June 30 and December 30 (a bit late, but it’ll make for an especially magical new year). Here’s what the scale looks like at Clifford Chance (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/clifford-chance-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It doesn’t look like these bonuses are specifically tied to hours, but instead, will be “based upon an assessment of each associate’s overall performance, including quality of work, contribution to the Firm, teamwork and pro bono efforts.” Congratulations to everyone at Clifford Chance!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/clifford-chance-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Clifford Chance.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

# Some Law Firm Managing Partners Have More Power Than Others
## Sometimes managing partners have very little authority.

Most law firms have one or more managing partners that fulfills a number of administrative duties at a shop. Some managing partners just run a single office at a firm, and other managing partners have authority over a larger region in which the law firm operates. Certain law firms have managing partners at the top of the firm’s hierarchy who have jurisdiction over an entire firm and all of the offices run by a shop. Most people only interact with the managing partner for the office in which they work, and some of these managing partners have extensive power. However, sometimes managing partners have very little authority, and a variety of factors often determine the level of authority and power that is wielded by a given managing partner.

Perhaps the most powerful office managing partner I ever worked with was the office managing partner at a Biglaw shop toward the beginning of my career. We had over a hundred people in our office, and our office was a large revenue generator for the firm and was otherwise very important to the law firm as a whole. As a result, this managing partner had a lot of leeway from higher-up partners at the firm to manage the affairs at that office as the managing partner saw fit. I believe this partner was also a regional managing partner, so this managing partner had a lot of authority around the office and the firm.

The authority exercised by this managing partner yielded numerous benefits to people around the office. Since the partner had so much clout around the firm, I got the sense that he was able to guarantee generous bonuses to associates and staff in our office and approve more generous budgets for office operations than other parts of the firm might have received. Moreover, the partner was also able to convince many people at the firm to take on somewhat controversial matters, which kept people in our office occupied with work.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The managing partner’s power was so great that it actually got in the way of making improvements around the office. If people wanted to move offices within the office, they needed to get the approval of this powerful managing partner. Since this was not much of a priority, it sometimes took months for such requests to be approved even though there was no opposition to the move. Moreover, some of the problems faced by our office and the firm at large might not have occurred if other people had more of a voice in running the certain operations. The partner arguably made some mistakes when it came to prospective clients, real estate, personnel, and other matters, and it seemed that people were not really in a position to voice opposition to any ideas.

On the other side of the spectrum, there are some managing partners that are figureheads only. Most legal professionals know that the people who have the most clout in a firm are usually the rainmakers who originate the most business. If these people left a firm, the shop would be in serious trouble, but if partners who do not have much work leave a law firm, the impact might not be so significant. However, some rainmakers might not want to deal with the day-to-day administrative tasks of running a law firm like managing personnel, approving expenses, and other matters.

As a result, partners who have the most influence might approve another lawyer being the managing partner in an office. But people usually know who actually controls an office and who ultimately makes the decisions if there is a disagreement in operations of a shop. During my career, I worked at a law firm at which the office managing partner was likely given his job as a consolation rather than recognition for the influence that this partner had around the office. The managing partner did not even have the biggest office at the shop, which was a clear sign of who was actually in charge of the firm. However, the managing partner seemed to be content with the arrangement since he held the managing partner title for years and the firm operated successfully for a long time.

In sum, no two office managing partners are alike, and people should not assume that an office managing partner has the same level of authority as other managing partners they may have worked with at various times in their careers. Although some influential lawyers can become managing partners and use the title to consolidate their power, some managing partners are figureheads only who have little real influence over the happenings at a law firm.

# Am Law 100 Firm's Co-Founding Partner Dies

We have some incredibly unfortunate news to report out of California, where one of the founding partners of Am Law 100 firm Gordon & Rees recently passed away. [Donald W. Rees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-rees-ab82624/), 86, worked at the firm for nearly 50 years, and was able to watch it grow into one of the best firms in America.

Rees, a graduate of Stanford Law, co-founded the firm in October 1974 alongside his partner, Stuart Gordon. Rees and Gordon had worked together at legacy firm Fields Gordon & Rees before breaking away and starting anew. Their firm now has 74 U.S. offices (with at least one in each state), employs more than 1,100 attorneys, and ranks as the 24th largest firm in the country.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Here’s what Gordon had to say of his longtime partner and friend in the firm’s lovely memoriam to Donald Rees:

“It has made us so proud to realize how our dream has come true in so many ways. Don can rest in peace knowing we accomplished everything we hoped for, and even so much more, all the time steering the firm in the right direction. He will always be in my thoughts and in my heart for I was so lucky to have the experience to work with him for more than 52 years,” said founding partner, Stu Gordon.

Firmwide managing partner Dion Cominos offered compassionate words about Rees’s passing. “Don was one of the principal pillars upon which the foundation of the firm rested. He will always be remembered fondly for his warmth, good humor and encyclopedic knowledge of the law,” he said. “His respectful and collegial treatment of everyone established a professional standard that we all have aspired to follow closely over the past nearly 50 years of Gordon & Rees’[s] existence.”

The conclusion of the firm’s memoriam serves as a reminder of the kind of remarkable person Rees was during his life:

# Does The Cloud Offer More Security?
## While it may appear to a law firm that moving into the cloud means your data will have more potential for access and exposure, the opposite is often true.

[](https://info.abovethelaw.com/does-the-cloud-offer-more-security)While it may appear to a law firm that moving into the cloud means your data will have more potential for access and exposure, the opposite is often true.
[Cloud computing offers far more extensive security](https://info.abovethelaw.com/does-the-cloud-offer-more-security) than many law firms can provide on their own. Cloud databases lie within intricate, multitiered security networks that are constantly being upgraded and tested for potential weaknesses. There are backups within backups, all meant to protect a firm’s information in the event of a hack or a natural disaster.
Moving to the cloud means changing perspectives, especially as clients and business demands shift. Firms need to determine what data needs to be secured, the cost of doing so now and in the future, and if they are best equipped to be the ones securing the data.
Firms should be evaluating their data security based on five criteria, while comparing internal measures against cloud provider offerings:
- Physical security
- Digital security
- Intruder detection
- Disaster recovery
- Security processing

# Associate Turnover Is Harmful To Law Firms
## Partners should invest in their associates so they will stay at a law firm for as long as possible.

Most law firms fit into two distinct categories when it comes to how they view associates. Some shops believe associates are an integral part of their team, and partners try to mentor and support associates so that they will stay at the firm for a long time. These shops typically pay associates more money, invest in professional development, and allow associates to become involved with business development and other administrative efforts. However, other firms view associates as interchangeable cogs in a machine. These shops usually pay associates less money, and there is not much potential for associates to make partner at these firms. As a result, those associates usually leave for better opportunities after a few years, and there is accordingly a high associate turnover rate at these shops. Although firms may save money and other resources with this latter approach, associate turnover is very harmful for law firms. As a result, partners should invest in their associates so they will stay at a law firm for as long as possible.

Institutional Memory

Associate turnover can substantially impact the institutional memory of attorneys at a firm. For instance, it is not uncommon for litigation and some transactional matters to take a long time to reach resolution. It is not uncommon in one state in which I practice for lawsuits to take five or even 10 years to reach a resolution (I personally was involved in several 10-year lawsuits) and over the course of time, many nuances may develop about a file. However, each time someone leaves a firm, some of the understanding of the case is lost, and it is very difficult for other people to come up to speed on the file.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
For example, I once worked at a law firm that had a case which was filed when I was a freshman in high school. In my first week at the firm, I had to start preparing the summary judgment papers (the first summary judgment motion I had ever prepared by myself). I looked through the file and realized that four or more attorneys had handled the case before me. I tried to get up to speed on the case by reviewing exit memos drafted by departing attorneys, but it was extremely difficult to understand what was going on. In any case, if associate turnover is reduced, firms may be able to deliver better legal services to clients because more institutional memory about a file will be preserved.

Experience Gap

Attorney turnover can also lead to a smaller bench of experienced associates at a firm that can handle complex legal matters. It often takes months — even years — to properly train attorneys. Most of us understand how law school does not train individuals to practice law, and on-the-job training is critical to developing as an attorney. Before an associate is properly trained, they are more prone to making mistakes, and they cannot handle the same variety of tasks that an experienced lawyer can manage. Furthermore, even if an attorney has been practicing law for years, it can still take time for that lawyer to be experienced in a given area of the law. For instance, after I had worked at a few firms, I became an associate at another shop that specialized in a few mass torts matters. I had to learn a completely new set of rules in order to be effective in this role, and it took time.

In any case, constant turnover by attorneys means fewer trained attorneys at a firm. Moreover, it means that firms lose all of the investment they put into developing an associate. Of course, it takes time and effort to train attorneys, and not all of this work can be monetized. When associates leave a firm they take that experience with them, and their new shop will benefit from all of the investment that the first firm made in an associate.

Associate turnover is also really bad for a firm’s image. When associates at a firm leave constantly, it sends a bad message about the firm, because there must be a reason why so many people are departing so frequently. People are less likely to do business with a firm if they think that a shop is a bad place to work or doesn’t treat their associates well. Moreover, many in-house representatives understand the downsides of associate turnover. When someone in-house has to communicate with different people over the life of a matter, they can probably tell that newer folks are not as up-to-speed on a matter as the associates who initially worked on a matter. Moreover, it can be frustrating for in-house staff to lose contact with people at a firm with whom they have forged a connection during the life of a matter. Of course, associates communicate with clients to different degrees at varying shops, but associate turnover assuredly looks bad to clients and others.

In the end, some firms do not mind associate turnover, since it is an inevitable result of underpaying associates, subjecting them to a pressure-cooker environment, and other unpleasant conditions. However, associate turnover can be extremely harmful to firms, and more shops should take bona fide efforts to ensure their associates stay for the long haul.

Today’s topic: consumer financial regulatory practice.

1. What do you do in a typical day?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A typical day in the life of a consumer financial regulatory attorney might involve:

• Advising a client on the best way to roll out a new financial product or service.
• Preparing a client for an upcoming examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) – and maybe even conducting a “mock” examination for practice.
• Drafting a brief in support of a motion to dismiss a fair lending class action complaint against a client.
• Developing a defense strategy in a government agency investigation into potential redlining or predatory lending.
• Listening to recordings of telemarketing calls and reviewing telemarketing scripts to minimize risk of deceptive marketing practices.

2. Who do you work with?

Junior associates mostly work with senior associates and sometimes partners. These junior associates may be asked to research and identify the applicability of certain federal consumer financial laws to the client’s activities, and perhaps write a memo that a senior associate or partner may rely upon in crafting the final product for the client. As associates grow more senior, they are given more responsibilities, greater involvement in overall case strategy, and increased direct contact with clients and the opposite side. In a financial regulatory practice, clients may include banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders and credit card companies. Opponents may include plaintiffs’ lawyers, enforcement counsel of regulators, such as the CFPB, and often prosecutors from the DOJ.

3. What does a common career path look like?

It is common for financial regulatory attorneys to spend some time in private practice and then gain experience working for a government agency – or vice versa. Lawyers that gain “inside knowledge” at government agencies such as the CFPB, FTC, FDIC or OCC may then decide to return to private practice, often as counsel or partner, and use their expertise to market to and ultimately better represent their clients. Others may choose to make a career in the government. The most common government positions in the financial regulatory field are enforcement counsel at the bank regulatory agencies, though sometimes attorneys will end up in supervisory or rulemaking divisions.

Beside government, lawyers in this practice area often move to the financial institutions’ in-house regulatory, compliance or litigation teams. Financial regulatory lawyers are mostly based in Washington, D.C., as well as in major financial centers such as New York, Chicago or San Francisco.

4. If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?

The spiciness of this practice area is like a mild-to-medium poblano. Consumer regulatory matters can concern different topics, from compliance with technical disclosure rules to questions about consumer outreach and growth of the business. Sometimes this practice area will reach jalapeño or even ghost pepper-level spiciness if the lawyer is lucky enough to handle an investigation or lawsuit by the DOJ or multiple state attorneys general, or a class action litigation that ends up in the newspaper. These investigations or lawsuits may involve claims of lending discrimination, predatory lending, deceptive or abusive marketing or pricing practices, or widespread kickback schemes. To gather information that may help the lawyer in its defense of the client, the consumer financial regulatory lawyer may need to interview employees of the client and learn about the client’s computer systems and overall business. Sometimes the consumer financial regulatory lawyer will use this information to prepare a defense that may be presented in person or in writing to the opposing government agency in hopes of favorably resolving the investigation or litigation.

5. How much wear and tear?

The pace of the work may vary greatly. While regulatory matters may be less time-sensitive, government investigations and litigation often are faster-paced, with higher stakes such as large fines or settlements. Not surprisingly, these matters often will require more billable hours and sometimes an all-nighter. Because these matters move quickly, partners may not always be able to devote enough time to learning all of the facts and instead will rely on associates to supply the details. Because numerous financial consumer laws may apply to a particular matter, the associate must have a good understanding of the key provisions of these statutes and regulations. Occasionally, a senior associate, counsel or partner may be considered the “expert” on a particular law or statutory provision, and others may rely on this lawyer for help with interpreting the statute or putting it into the correct context.

6. Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?

Lawyers practicing in the consumer regulatory finance area generally enjoy the work and the practice overall. One thing that may get a little tiresome about this practice is being on the receiving end of client complaints regarding the extent of overregulation in this area and the burdens associated with compliance. However, to the extent that this is a “negative” about the practice, it is due mostly to the relative newness of many consumer finance regulations, and thus is likely to wane over time. Furthermore, this client frustration is usually much improved once you have been able to assist the client with their matter.

7. Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?

Most consumer financial regulatory lawyers enjoy being involved in cases with high stakes, often accompanied by media coverage and publicity, or in matters that present new, complex legal challenges or creative applications of the law. Some of the most exciting parts of the practice are conducting internal investigations to uncover potential wrongdoing, and working with a team of legal experts and statisticians to gather and analyze trends in the client’s lending and other business lines.

Another plus about being a consumer financial regulatory lawyer is that, whether working with colleagues or across the table from opposing counsel, you likely will be surrounded by smart attorneys that have acquired much institutional knowledge, including the ins-and-outs of their client’s business, the lingo commonly used among the financial industry, and the details of numerous types of financial products and services.

8. Are there common avenues out of this practice area?

Consumer financial regulatory lawyers who don’t want to continue private practice in this area often make a move to in-house counsel at a bank, mortgage lender or other financial institution. These lawyers may work in either litigation or compliance divisions at these companies.

9. What are some market trends that impact this practice area?

The housing crash and resulting credit crisis of 2008 led to a significant increase in federal regulations, as well as industry uncertainty regarding the CFPB’s broad supervisory authority. In general, the more regulatory activity and oversight, the more work for financial regulatory lawyers.

Recently, however, the markets have stabilized significantly. This, coupled with the change in the administration, may cause some legal matters to wind down. However, many practitioners think the next wave of work in the financial regulatory space may revolve around the numerous recent developments in financial technology (“fintech”).

10. If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?

Apart from a demonstrated interest in the work, a good candidate would be a quick learner with respect to the inner workings of the consumer financial industry, the multitude of products and services offered to consumers, and the various federal laws that may apply. In addition, the candidate should be detail-oriented and able to express herself effectively and clearly both orally and in writing. Strong statistics or math skills would be a plus, given that consumer financial regulatory matters sometimes require lawyers to collaborate with statisticians and interpret their findings.

On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr swapped out the legal team defending the Trump administration’s attempt to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. [No explanation for the line-change was given](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/us/politics/census-citizenship-question-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top+Stories&pgtype=Homepage&fbclid=IwAR1KTOgNr2zDW1vE94D7kl2dmKtfEx-22TFrCUlbFdH_-fkZwajf4yom2FQ), but to me, it sure looks like the Federal Programs lawyers at the Department of Justice have finally had enough of being humiliated in court in defense of Donald Trump’s lawless desires.

I don’t think Barr just woke up on Sunday and decided it was time for “fresh blood” on the Census. I think he woke up on Sunday confronted with the reality that the current team was done lying for him and his boss. To understand that contention, you have to understand what the lawyers were being asked to do. It’s not just that Chief Justice John Roberts ordered the Commerce Department to come up with a legitimate reason to add the citizenship question, a reason the administration doesn’t have so the lawyers were going to have to defend a different lie in open court. The lawyers probably would have done that, no problem.

The issue is that the lawyers were going to have to go back in front of a judge and admit they’d been lying to the court all along about the “expedited”/”emergency”/”THIS IS NOT A DRILL” timing over finalizing the Census questions.

Remember, the government’s case was expedited by the district court and [fast-tracked for Supreme Court review](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/supreme-court-census-citizenship-review/). This was done because, according to the Department of Justice’s lawyers, the questions on the upcoming Census had to be finalized by June 30th. According to Solicitor General Noel Francisco, that was a non-negotiable deadline.

On Balkinization, Marty Lederman [has the play-by-play](https://balkin.blogspot.com/2019/07/census-citizenship-question-re-do-part.html) of the DOJ’s timeline arguments:

[The ACLU motion opposing Justice’s attempt to move forward with the Citizenship Question after the Supreme Court ruling] cites chapter and verse–many chapters and many verses–of the ways in which DOJ has insisted to Judge Furman and to the Supreme Court (among others) that June 30 was a hard-and-fast deadline. The motion also explains that the courts and the parties relied upon those representations. DOJ’s assertion of a June deadline was the reason that Judge Furman himself, for instance, expedited discovery, trial, and briefing schedules. “[T]ime is of the essence,” he wrote, “because the Census Bureau needs to finalize the 2020 questionnaire by June of this year.” See also id. at page 191. The Solicitor General also invoked the June 30 deadline as the basis for his extraordinary request for the Supreme Court to grant certiorari “before judgment” (i.e., to take the case before the court of appeals could consider it). “[T]he Census Bureau must finalize the census forms by the end of June 2019 to print them on time for the 2020 decennial census,” the SG explained to the Court. Accord id. at 13–14 (“the government must finalize the decennial census questionnaire for printing by the end of June 2019”), id. at 16 (referring to “the June 2019 deadline for finalizing the census form”). Again in his motion for an expedited briefing and oral argument schedule, the SG told the Court that “the questions presented must be resolved before the end of June 2019, so that the decennial census questionnaires can be printed on time for the 2020 census” (emphasis added). The June 30 deadline was also an essential part of the grounds on which the government successfully urged the Supreme Court to add the Enumeration Clause question to the case well after cert. had been granted.

To argue that the citizenship question can still be added now — after the Commerce Department comes up with another (fake) reason, we have discovery and litigation into that reason, and we have a ruling and perhaps an appeal of that ruling — is to argue that the Justice Department was lying about the timeline before, and yet still needs the case to move forward quickly now.

That was a bridge too far for Federal Programs lawyers. The lawyers in the Federal Programs division are career DOJ lawyers. They defend the government’s policies, regardless of who is in control of the government. I believe their apolitical approach has led them astray during the Trump administration. A lawyer who defends a terrorist is a noble tool of the legal system and its commitment to due process. A lawyer who defends the state-sponsored terrorism promulgated by the Trump administration is merely a blunt object in the service of a corrupt regime, even if they don’t think of themselves like that. There will be an accounting, in this life or the next, of people who helped Trump or opposed Trump, and I think lawyers at Main Justice are on the wrong side.

However, and we’ve seen this time and again with “institutionalists” during the Trump era, these people are willing to sacrifice the country, but not their precious “reputations.” Here, Federal Programs lawyers, many of whom would like to have a job after Trump, would have had to go into court and be humiliated. They’d have had to lie, while admitting they were lying before, and they were informed that they’d have to do all this lying via tweet. There’s a great bit in Robert Graves’s I, Claudius, where Claudius prosecutes the Praetorians who killed Caligula. The assassins argue that Caligula was a bad man, and a danger to all of Roman society, which is true. But Claudius points out that Caligula had been a danger to all of Rome for most of his reign, and it was personal insults Caligula doled out to his bodyguards that turned them against him, not some greater love of Rome.

I think that’s what happened to the Census lawyers. They balked, not out of some deep love of country or deep concern about the rule of law. They bailed because Trump was about to embarrass them. Bill Barr couldn’t keep them in line anymore. So, to do Trump’s bidding, Barr is going to have to go to more political lawyers who want future federal judiciary appointments and are thus willing to say anything Trump wants them to say.

It’s just a theory. Normally, you need an explanation for switching out an entire trial team when the clock is ticking on filing motions and appeals. Of course, chaos is so common in the Trump White House, it could also be that Trump randomly decided that it was the lawyers’ “fault” for “losing” in front of the Supreme Court and stomped around saying “you’re fired” a lot as if that was a solution to his problems. My suggestion that anybody associated with Trump has anything approaching principles any more, or even normal self-preservation instincts, is probably wrong.

# Evolving Partnership Economics: The Equity And Non-Equity Models Are Starting To Blur
## In the current law firm landscape, the fact that a lawyer has been designated a partner often conveys very little about the economic arrangement between that lawyer and the firm.

The “partner” title holds undeniable cachet in law firms. Elevation to the partnership is treated as a key professional milestone. But in the current law firm landscape, the fact that a lawyer has been designated a partner often conveys very little about the economic arrangement between that lawyer and the firm. A few firms have a single tier of partnership, but the majority have at least two. In some firms, there are as many as four tiers, each with a different set of benefits and obligations.

The traditional equity model

In simpler times, partnership meant equity partnership. If you made partner, you received an ownership interest in your firm and the right to vote on firm governance matters. In exchange for that equity interest, you were required upon joining the partnership to contribute a lump sum of capital. The firm held onto your contribution for the duration of your partnership tenure, and upon your retirement from the partnership, you sold your interest back to the firm and reclaimed your capital. As for annual compensation, longer tenured partners typically took home a larger slice of the pie than the newly elevated, but no partner was paid a fixed salary. As the general fortunes of the firm rose or fell, all members of the partnership rode the wave together.

At a few major law firms the traditional model remains largely intact. Firms like Cravath and Debevoise are the purest examples: they continue to have only equity partners and to pay lockstep, seniority-based partner compensation. Firms such as Davis Polk have [done away with](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/davis-polk-confirms-that-were-in-the-twilight-of-the-lockstep-firm/) lockstep compensation but still feature an all-equity partnership. However, firms committed to awarding equity to every partner comprise a shrinking minority of the legal industry.

The non-equity alternative

As [early as the 1970s](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/20120/1_Richmond_Final.pdf;jsessionid=DC0A4FB423C36E64EC50893C490243BC?sequence=1), some law firms began to introduce a bifurcated partnership model: there were equity partners and non-equity partners (sometimes described as income partners or non-share partners). Non-equity partners did not become owners of the firm, did not have full voting rights, and were not expected to contribute capital. Instead, they effectively were paid a salary. Becoming a non-equity partner meant you received the “partner” title but not the partner economics.

In some firms, the non-equity partnership tier was pitched as a stepping stone to equity partnership. The intermediate non-equity tier was a conceit designed to lengthen the track to true partnership while providing some social capital in the interim. It enabled lawyers who were effectively still senior associates, as traditionally defined, to market themselves externally as “partners.” Delaying the elevation of some senior associates to equity partnership by a couple of years may have been helpful for firm economics in the short term, but there is always the next generation of associates rising through the ranks. So the notion of non-equity partnership as simply a way station on the track to the equity tier was never especially credible, and before long, non-equity partnership became a common terminal status for many lawyers.

Blending equity and non-equity

The distinction between equity and non-equity partnership has become increasingly blurred at many firms. For example, several firms in the Am Law 100 now require non-equity partners to contribute capital. This is sometimes sold as a means of giving non-equity partners “skin in the firm game.” But in a world where only a small proportion of non-equity partners are likely to ascend to the equity ranks, one can understand why non-equity partners would be unenthusiastic about the capital contribution trend. They are being required to bear a burden of equity partnership with no guarantee of receiving the corresponding benefit.

Some firms are creating multiple partnership tiers (sometimes called compensation bands), with each tier featuring its own combination of rights and obligations that may not neatly correspond to either the equity or non-equity models. Perkins Coie [has four tiers](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/john-devaney-mentioned-in-the-american-lawyer-the-growing-nonequity-tier-is-forcing-a-conversation-on-partnership.html). The lowest tier is similar to the standard non-equity model, in that partners in that tier are paid a straight salary. The higher tiers are differentiated both in the level of compensation offered and in the voting rights afforded to the partners in the tier.

As the economic models of partnership have grown increasingly complex and differentiated, so have the implications for current and potential partners. In our next installment, we will explain how non-equity partnership can be a superior option for lawyers in certain scenarios.

# More Biglaw Firms Will Require Employees To Be Vaccinated, Some Push Back Reopening Dates
## The Delta variant is making a lot of law firms change their plans when it comes to vaccination.

It seems that Biglaw firms have finally gotten in line with science and acknowledged that the best way to protect their personnel is to require vaccines against COVID-19. In light of the highly contagious Delta variant, this is more important than ever, and the list of firms that are now mandating vaccination before their employees can step foot in the office continues to grow.

Thus far, the firms that have made vaccination a requirement for those returning to the office include [Arent Fox](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/davis-polk-to-deactivate-building-id-cards-of-unvaccinated-lawyers-and-staff/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Dickinson Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Hanson Bridgett](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), [Schiff Hardin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), and [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/). Now, we can add another four firms to the list. Akin Gump, Crowell & Moring, Goodwin, and McDermott Will & Emery all added a vaccination mandate to their safety protocols.

Akin Gump is not only [limiting office access](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/akin-gump-crowell-shift-vaccine-policies-as-delta-spreads) to those who have been fully vaccinated (i.e., those who are two weeks past their final shot), but the firm has pushed back its reopening date to October 11 from September 13. Kim Koopersmith, Akin’s chair, said in a firmwide email, “I am hopeful that the advances in vaccines and knowledge of transmission will make this current wave short-lived and we will get through the current surge and begin to improve.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Crowell & Moring recently adjusted its thoughts on vaccination, and will now require vaccines for all employees upon its reopening on September 7, “[t]o safeguard the health of all in our community, including the families of our lawyers and staff.” Firm personnel must upload their vaccination cards as proof.

Goodwin emailed all employees earlier today concerning mandatory vaccinations for all, following the FDA’s approval of COVID-19 vaccines for regular use (which will likely occur “in the coming weeks”). Once approved, the firm’s offices will “only be open to those individuals (including all partners, employees, onsite vendors and visitors) who have been fully vaccinated.” Employees must provide proof of vaccination to the firm. Of importance here is the following caveat, so pay attention, folks: “Please note that once our offices reopen, non-vaccination status will not be considered a legitimate reason to support 100% remote work.”

McDermott is also pushing back its reopening date to October 12, and will also require all employees who intend to enter the office [to be vaccinated (with proof)](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/schiff-hardin-pushes-office-return-to-november-requires-vaccine), starting this Friday. “The overwhelming body of scientific data shows that vaccines are safe and broadly effective in our battle against COVID. We need everyone to step up and get vaccinated,” firm chair Ira Coleman said in a memo.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know. The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

# Why Should I Work For Your Firm? Why Should I Retain You?

You walk into a big firm. The partner sitting behind the desk starts to make his pitch: “You really must work for a large firm, such as Bigg & Mediocre, because only large firms have the resources to handle big matters. We can staff big cases. We handle transnational stuff. If you go to work for a small firm, you just don’t have the opportunity to work on matters that capture headlines.”

Then you walk into the big firm down the street. The partners there make exactly the same pitch. And then you walk into a firm halfway across the country. And hear the same pitch again.

Do these people really think they’re telling you something persuasive? Or creative? Or worth listening to?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
You stroll into the branch office of a big firm. The partner makes her pitch: “We’re absolutely unique! We combine the collegiality of a small firm with the practice of a big firm. The 25 of us in this branch office all know and like each other, but we get to work on cases attracted by the 300 lawyers in New York.  It’s the best of both worlds!”

You walk into a small firm: “We’re a great firm, so we attract great cases. But there are really two other reasons to work here. First, our size makes us collegial; we really know and like each other. Second, our size forces us to advance the careers of junior lawyers. We don’t staff cases with five lawyers, which causes the junior lawyer to carry the bags of the senior folks. You’ll be taking depositions from day one!”

And, of course, all of the partners at all of the firms shout in unison the real reason why you should work at their firms: “Our people are unique and great.  It’s the people that make us different!”

I’m not really knocking this. (I take that back; I am really knocking this.)  Maybe this is the best pitch for your firm. You say exactly the same stuff as the guy down the street, and you expect the law student to be convinced by it. But if there were really anything unique about your firm, or if you had an ounce of creativity, couldn’t you say something that I couldn’t satirize without even knowing who you are?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
So, too, when law firms pitch clients for new business: “We’re Bigg & Mediocre!  We have massive resources that we can bring to bear on your case. We permit one-stop shopping. If there are any tentacles of your case that must be explored, we’re guaranteed to have a specialist who knows that precise area of law. And we work together as a team. We assign the right lawyer to your case and, because we work together all the time, we save you time and money.”

Or a smaller firm: “We’re efficient! Unlike those other, or bigger, firms, we don’t send in the Fifth Fleet. We send in the Special Forces. By staffing leanly, we handle your cases efficiently and less expensively.”

Or everybody: “We use technology! By using cutting-edge technology, we reduce the use of lawyers and minimize the hours spent on your case.”

I don’t mind that you say this stuff. (I take that back; I really do mind.) But don’t think that you’re being creative, or thoughtful, or there’s any reason for people to listen when you spout this stuff. Understand that you’re saying exactly the same thing the listener has heard a hundred times before, and there’s a fair chance that, although you’re talking, no one’s listening.

# Cheeky Voicemail Costs Law Student Biglaw Opportunity
## Best not put your immaturity on display if you want to work in Biglaw.

Getting a Biglaw gig to start your legal career can be a great idea. Sure, the hours are long and the pressure intense, but the pay and forever having an elite law firm on your resume can be well worth it. But even if you have the grades to score an interview at an elite firm, there are many, many things that can go wrong before you get an actual offer. Above the Law has made a habit of cataloguing some of the worst Biglaw [interview horror stories](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/interview-horror-stories/), but in this story a prospective Biglaw attorney’s career path goes off the rails even *before* the interview.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/firm-cancels-students-interview-after-hearing-deez-nutz-voicemail) Roll on Friday, a law student took to Reddit to complain about a law firm that, while initially interested in the student, rescinded its interview offer. Why, you ask? Because of a wildly inappropriate voicemail message on the student’s phone. When the student missed a call from the firm it went to voicemail with the below message:

“I have a dumb voicemail on my phone that goes like, ‘Hey, I am sure that you are calling me with a question, but I have a question for you, I was just wondering what bofadeez is? Nevermind, I just remembered! Its bofadeez nutz bitch!!!!!!! get trolled nerd’”.

The firm was reportedly up front about the reason for their about face:

[The student] claimed that a couple of hours later, he received an email from the firm explaining that although it had intended to invite him to an interview, on further reflection his voicemail “has indicated to us that you do not have the level of maturity to be a trainee at X, nor did we think it was very funny”.

While some Redditors questioned a law firm that is so clear about the reasons for dinging an applicant, it is a useful reminder to all wannabe Biglaw lawyers. When applying for a job — especially a prestigious one — interviewers will consider everything about an applicant. And it’s a red flag when someone still thinks a “deez nutz” joke is funny.



Have a terrible tale to tell about an interview gone awry? Please send it our way [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Interview%20Stories), subject line “Interview Stories.”

(And remember, as we’ve previously [explained](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/interview-horror-stories-what-was-she-thinking-er-drinking/), “The ‘horror’ in ‘interview horror stories’ is loosely defined. Stories that are somewhat embarrassing or mildly amusing will suffice.”)

# Law Librarians Still Have Value
## The training offered by law librarians was critical for me in learning how to be more efficient with my time and find the best information possible for clients.

Decades ago, it was not uncommon for major law firms to have expansive libraries with trained staff that could refer to printed materials and assist lawyers in research projects. Indeed, if you watch movies like “The Firm” and other legal films from years ago, they often show the law libraries upon which attorneys relied in prior eras. With the expanded popularity of computerized legal research platforms, law firms usually do not maintain expansive law libraries anymore and there are not too many law firm librarians that still work at many of the major firms. However, law librarians still have value since they can make attorneys more efficient and increase the amount of billable hours a lawyer can log for a firm.

When I was a summer associate about a decade ago, I worked at a firm that had a decent law library and several trained law librarians to assist attorneys and staff with research projects. At the time, it could be expensive to perform computer research, so it was often more efficient and cost-effective to consult printed materials. Law librarians had a good handle on the printed offerings of a law firm and how attorneys can consult such resources to best serve their clients.

Even in the modern era in which research of printed materials is not that common, law librarians still have immense value. Everyone knows how to use computerized research platforms to search for cases and statutes, but not everyone is skilled at culling the more uncommon resources on such platforms. For instance, it may be difficult to search the treatises and other similar materials in legal research platforms that digest information so attorneys do not need to conduct a survey of a field themselves. In addition, not every lawyer may be able to search model jury instructions, form offerings, and other resources that are used less often by lawyers. Law librarians can help lawyers access these materials and get to relevant information and materials as quickly as possible so they can get back to billing the most billable hours.

At some firms, law librarians can also keep people apprised of new research tools and new methods of conducting research. This was especially important as legal research platforms made a shift away from terms and connectors and in favor of natural search terms over the past decade or so and in other contexts. It can be difficult for lawyers to be focused on performing legal work and keep an eye on all of the developments in legal research, and law librarians can assist in this critical function.

In many contexts, law librarians can also assist lawyers in getting trained on legal research platforms. When I was in Biglaw, we had the resources to have a training room with rows of desktop computers and a projector television screen that could display trainings performed by law librarians located at different offices operated by the firm. The training offered by law librarians was critical for me in learning how to be more efficient with my time and find the best information possible for clients. I still feel like a headnotes king due to the training provided to me by law librarians and this information has positively impacted my career and allowed me to better serve clients.

Moreover, law librarians can be a neutral resource who are more open to associates than other people who work at a law firm. It can be difficult for associates to ask more senior lawyers for help. Lawyers may not want to annoy the more senior with questions, even if they are legitimate inquiries since they may not wish to interrupt the workflow of others or upset managers. In addition, associates might think that if they ask more senior lawyers questions, they might be perceived as less effective at their jobs and less capable at performing the tasks that law firm associates need to complete.

Law librarians can be an approachable resource for associates that is outside the attorney chain of command and are more accessible than senior attorneys. During my time working in Biglaw, I would call law librarians frequently to work through legal research issues, and often, law librarians would point me in the right direction. In some instances, law librarians would perform some of the research for me. This let me focus on the job of billing hours and best serving clients with the best resources possible.

Not all firms have the resources necessary to hire law librarians, and there are many administrative professionals that might take precedence at a law firm over law librarians. Moreover, some major law firms might believe that law librarians are obsolete in the modern age with more accessible resources. Nevertheless, law librarians still have value since they can help lawyers be more efficient and stay focused on the task of billing hours and best serving clients.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Matches Salaries That Go Up To $415K
## Of course the firm is handing out Cravath cash!
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

The 2022 salary wars seem to be winding down, but there are still dozens of firms that have yet to make a move (that we know of) when it comes to compensation. The key phrase there was “that we know of” — if anonymous sources don’t reach out to us, it makes it difficult for us to report on and track how associates are doing financially at each firm.

In fact, it took one of our recent dives into the [firms that hadn’t raised salaries yet (to our knowledge)](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/money-matters-these-am-law-100-firms-havent-announced-raises-yet/) to get tipsters from one very highly ranked firm to reach out to us. This is just a little reminder for folks to get in touch with Above the Law as soon as your firm announces any kind of salary or bonus news. The more tips we receive, the merrier! And now, onto today’s salary news.

We thought it was a bit odd that Sullivan & Cromwell — a firm ranked at No. 18 on the most recent Am Law 100, with $1,555,441,000 gross revenue in 2020 — had yet to announce a Cravath match, but as it turns out, the firm matched about a month ago in mid-March.

SullCrom doesn’t put out a lockstep raise memo, but the recent tips we’ve gotten track the market. This is what the firm’s new salary scale looks like:

Class of 2021: $215,000
Class of 2020: $225,000
Class of 2019: $250,000
Class of 2018: $295,000
Class of 2017: $345,000
Class of 2016: $370,000
Class of 2015: $400,000
Class of 2014+: $415,000

The new salaries at the firm are retroactive to January 1. Congratulations to everyone at Sullivan & Cromwell!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

A new lawsuit filed yesterday in the Southern District of New York alleges a combination of age discrimination and COVID-19 financial pressures led to a Shearman & Sterling staffer being fired. Mark Kanyuk, 62, former global manager of facilities and audiovisual infrastructure at Shearman alleges in his lawsuit that the firm “chose to start the [COVID-19] layoffs with one of its oldest and most committed employees.”

According to the complaint, improper age bias is evidenced by Kanyuk’s supervisor repeatedly calling him “old man.” Additionally, the plaintiff alleges others made jokes about how long Kanyuk was at Shearman, which was over 25 years.

The complaint also takes aim at the firm’s claim Kanyuk was fired for cause (receiving kickbacks from vendors he worked with in the course of his employment):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Defendant informed Plaintiff on the day of his termination that he was accused of unethical behavior, taking kickbacks from vendors. Defendant Shearman & Sterling LLP did not bother to tell Plaintiff who made this accusation, let alone give him an opportunity to address it. To be sure, Plaintiff still does not know specifically what unethical conduct he is purported to have engaged in. His boss simply told him he was terminated and offered him two weeks of severance pay.

When reached for comment, a firm spokesperson disputed the allegations in the complaint and said the plaintiff was fired for cause:

We have not made any layoffs at the firm – whether in relation to COVID-19 or anything else. Mr Kanyuk was terminated for cause, on the basis of substantial evidence of inappropriate conduct in the performance of his job. The plaintiff’s allegations are completely without merit and the firm will contest them vigorously.

Read the full complaint below.

Lady Gaga (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)

Mr. [Steve] Ronsen and his lawyer are trying to make easy money off the back of a successful artist. It is shameful and wrong. I applaud Lady Gaga for having the courage and integrity to stand up on behalf of successful artists who find themselves on the receiving end of such [claims]. Should Mr. [Mark] Shirian proceed with this case, Lady Gaga will fight it vigorously and will prevail.

— [Orin Snyder](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/snyder-orin/) of Gibson Dunn, in remarks given in light of a [threatened copyright lawsuit](https://pagesix.com/2019/08/08/lady-gaga-accused-of-stealing-shallow-from-unknown-songwriter/) against Grammy-winning artist [Lady Gaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga), over the [hit song “Shallow.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo_efYhYU2A) Songwriter Steve Ronsen claims that a three-note progression (G-A-B) from Gaga’s song was swiped from his relatively unknown [2012 song “Almost.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yXIb0yNZfU) Calling this a “brazen shakedown,” Gaga’s legal team has helpfully pointed out that the three-note progression has been used for centuries.

# Stat Of The Week: Law Departments Feel The Squeeze

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a pernicious effect on law departments, whose organizations have seen shrinking revenue as new legal challenges have continued to arise, according to a new survey.  

[The Altman Weil Chief Legal Officer Survey](http://www.altmanweil.com/index.cfm/fa/r.resource_detail/oid/23577C55-E16F-4050-AAEF-A56645C3765F/resource/2020_Chief_Legal_Officer_Survey.cfm) notes that, in the fall of 2020, 66% of respondents said their organization’s revenue fell, while 77% said their law department’s workload increased. Employee layoffs occurred at 11% of the law departments surveyed. 

The report also reveals that more departments now have legal operations managers — 50% of respondents said they had a professional administrator in 2020, and 46% said they had one in 2019.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.

In an [interview with Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1329603), Altman Weil’s James Wilber said that there were no reported layoffs in legal operations positions that focus on cost savings: 

So, to me, that shows wisdom on behalf of the chief legal officers who realized that these people are more than paying for themselves, and they can help us find ways to remove waste, maybe get better value or more cost reduction out of outside counsel, better leverage of technology.”

While legal operations may be playing an increasing role in law departments, the field’s signature benchmarking study is set to be published in the coming weeks. 

[The Blickstein Group’s 2020 Law Department Operations Survey](https://info.abovethelaw.com/2020-ldo-virtual-summit) will be introduced Dec. 8 in a “virtual summit” that provides a sneak peek at its results.

# MoFo Files For Sanctions Against Firm, Plaintiff Suing Them For Gender Discrimination
## A legal battle against a Biglaw firm is bound to be tough.

The “mommy track” lawsuit filed against the Biglaw firm of Morrison & Foerster is heating up. As you may recall, MoFo was first hit with a [$100 million purported class action](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1), alleging gender discrimination as women who take maternity leave are placed on a “mommy track” which is a career dead end, in April of last year. And the plaintiffs just kept on piling on with [three more Jane Doe plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/more-plaintiffs-added-to-astonishing-pregnancy-and-gender-discrimination-case-against-mofo/?rf=1) added in January, and another [added last month for a total of seven plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit-against-mofo-spirals-and-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/) in the case.

Now the firm is making a pretty bold move in response: MoFo filed a motion for sanctions against Sanford Heisler Sharp, the firm representing the plaintiffs, and Jane Doe number 4, alleging the claims brought by Doe 4 are “knowingly baseless.” In the amended complaint, Doe 4 alleges she was informed she was being terminated by MoFo less than two months before she was scheduled to take maternity leave and that she was coerced into signing a release of claims against the firm in order to take her maternity break as planned. It is that release of claims that features prominently in MoFo’s motion for sanctions.

While Sanford Heisler is obviously arguing the release is unenforceable, negotiated when the pregnant Doe 4 was in a vulnerable position, MoFo, through their lawyers Gibson Dunn, are claiming the release should not only bar Doe 4’s claim, but bringing the claim with the knowledge the release exists is grounds for sanctions. Since Doe 4 was able to negotiate a higher severance package than initially offered — she ultimately received five months’ salary after her employment ended and almost six months of benefits — MoFo argues the release should be fully enforced.

From the sanctions motion:

“Morrison does not bring a motion for sanctions lightly, but sanctions are required under these extraordinary circumstances…. The terms of the release underscore what Jane Doe 4’s allegations make clear: Jane Doe 4, an attorney, negotiated for herself generous and substantial consideration in exchange for the release she executed.”

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/09/in-mommy-track-suit-morrison-foerster-seeks-sanctions-against-former-associate-and-sanford-heisler-405-34857/) Law.com, attorneys at Sanford Heisler take a different view. Co-lead counsel Deborah Marcuse calls the filing of the sanctions motion “itself sanctionable conduct by MoFo,” and says the release Doe 4 signed should not be enforced:

“It is regrettable that MoFo made the choice to terminate Jane Doe 4 when she was eight months pregnant, without prior notice. It is reprehensible that the Firm then demanded that Jane Doe 4 sign away her legal rights or give up the five months of paid maternity leave that she was counting on,” Marcuse said. “MoFo’s conduct toward Jane Doe 4 constituted duress and undue influence warranting recission of the agreement she signed.”

We’ll be watching as this legal battle plays out.

# First Am Law 25 Firm To Match Cravath Salary Scale Took Less Than An Hour To Announce
## Another Biglaw firm raises salaries.

As of this writing we’re less than an hour removed from Cravath announcing that it will [see Milbank’s new compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) scale [and raise them](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/), and we’ve already got news of a match.

Nestled within [American Lawyer’s post](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/28/cravath-exceeds-milbank-salary-scale-for-senior-associates/?kw=Cravath%20Exceeds%20Milbank%20Salary%20Scale%20for%20Senior%20Associates&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=newsroomupdate&utm_content=20231128&utm_term=tal&oly_enc_id=) echoing the news of Cravath’s announcement is this nugget from McDermott Will & Emery chair Ira Coleman announcing that MWE will match:

“Everyone knows how much we love our associates and we believe that their happiness and advancement are so good for our clients and the firm,” said Ira Coleman, chair of McDermott. “If you really want to be a true career accelerant, you need to pay top-of-market compensation (and do a bunch of other things that make up our secret sauce). It’s just one part of a larger equation.”

Presumably this will include matching the bonus scale which Cravath also just announced.

For those just catching up, Cravath’s new comp scale is:

Class of 2023: $225,000
Class of 2022: $235,000
Class of 2021: $260,000
Class of 2020: $310,000
Class of 2019: $365,000
Class of 2018: $390,000
Class of 2017: $420,000

And its bonus scale comes in at:

Class of 2023: $15,000
Class of 2022: $20,000
Class of 2021: $30,000
Class of 2020: $57,500
Class of 2019: $75,000
Class of 2018: $90,000
Class of 2017: $105,000

## This firm has bumped up its first-year salaries not once, but twice in the past nine months.

After associate base salaries were raised by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett on January 22, 2007, with starting salaries for entry-level associates increasing [from $145,000 to $160,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/), it took almost a decade of stagnant salaries for further action to be taken on behalf of associates.

This past summer, Cravath Swaine & Moore announced that it would raise base salaries for associates, with entry-level associates seeing their pay increased [from $160,000 to $180,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). Associates across the country rejoiced as many of their firms quickly fell in line with the new status quo.

While we still generally rely upon the New York market as the agent of change for associate salaries, there are other firms that have been paying associates well above the previous market rate of $160,000, and some that have been paying associates well above the new market rate of $180,000. Today, we look to the West Coast to find a firm that’s bumped up its first-year salaries not once, but twice in the past nine months.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Which firm could it be?

It’s none other than [Dovel & Luner](http://www.dovellaw.com/index.php), a California litigation boutique that specializes in plaintiff-side patent litigation on a contingency fee basis. The firm has nine lawyers (three of whom are associates), but if you look at [their bios](http://www.dovellaw.com/attorneys.php), you’ll see a glittering array of top law schools, elite clerkships, and leading Biglaw firms in their backgrounds.

The firm is tiny, but its salary structure sure is mighty. Check out the latest pay scale:

1st year: $200,000
2nd year: $210,000
3rd year: $230,000
4th year: $255,000
5th year: $280,000
6th year: $300,000

The firm’s bonuses are nothing to sneeze at, either. In 2016, like every year before it, Dovel & Luner’s bonuses exceeded the market scale. The firm’s first-year associate received a bonus of $70,000, its second-year associate received a bonus of $130,000, and its fourth-year associate received a bonus of $230,000.

Dovel & Luner’s first-year salary increase to $200K may not move the needle for Biglaw firms nationwide, but it may certainly have an impact on certain other firms that are either comparable to Dovel & Luner, are members of the $180K-Plus Club, or both. If you’re interested in making more money than your peers, here is a listing of those firms (please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=The%20180K-Plus%20Club) or text us (646-820-8477) if any of these numbers are outdated):

- [Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors](https://www.brewerattorneys.com/) (successor to Bickel & Brewer): First-year salary of [$185,000](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/brewer,-attorneys-counselors/company-overview.aspx)
- [Desmarais LLP](http://desmaraisllp.com/): First-year salary of $200,000
- [McKool Smith](http://www.mckoolsmith.com/): First-year compensation package of $192,500
- [Susman & Godfrey](http://www.susmangodfrey.com/): “First-year” salary of [$190,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prestigious-litigation-boutique-announces-nationwide-salary-raises-to-190k/) (all associates arrive with at least one year of clerkship experience)
- [Wachtell Lipton](http://www.wlrk.com/): First-year salary of $185,000
- [Williams & Connolly](http://www.wc.com/): First-year salary of [$200,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-who-pays-a-starting-salary-of-200000-williams-connolly/)
- [Kellogg Huber](http://www.khhte.com/): First-year salary of $225,000
We wish you the very best of luck if you try to land a job at one of these firms, since it will likely prove to be a very difficult endeavor given their exacting standards.

Congratulations to Dovel & Luner for raising its first-year salary to the vaunted number of $200,000. What an achievement! We hope to see more firms follow in its footsteps.

# Biglaw High-Yield Bond Practices Experiencing 'Painful Period' Thanks To Recessionary Market

From a practice standpoint, it is a painful period, but it is temporary. The last two years were abnormal and unsustainable, we are not looking to experience that again. But, we are past the point of a nice respite.

Companies may have had debt that was maturing over the next few years, but they saw those rates and said let’s push it up. Because of that, it will be a couple of years before that significant refinancing picks up again.

— [Jonathan Schaffzin](https://www.cahill.com/professionals/jonathan-schaffzin), corporate partner and executive committee member of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, commenting in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2022/10/25/a-painful-period-big-laws-high-yield-bond-leveraged-finance-practices-take-hit/), on current market conditions that appear to be hinting at an upcoming recession, which has caused firms that handle high-yield bond work to see a significant drop in business. “The majority of our lawyers are capable of working on both bank and bond deals. We have always been relatively leanly staffed because our lawyers can be flexible on what they work on,” Schaffzin said. “We aren’t sure exactly what the level of activity will be moving forward, but we have maintained our staffing numbers through various cycles of this nature.”

# Cooley Sees A Double-Digit Income Drop Amid Layoffs Due To 'Overcapacity'
## Not the best year at this firm.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It was a year of precipitous change. It wasn’t just that it was a markedly different market, it was the speed with which it happened.

As a cultural matter, we decided we’d be aggressive about hiring. And in the most competitive war for talent I’ve ever seen, we were winners in that. But viewed through a historical lens, that happened at the wrong time, and we ended up with an overcapacity problem.

It was important in making that very difficult decision to do [layoffs] in a way that moved the needle to rationalize the expense base against the given level of revenue, and meaningfully get associates engaged, bonus-eligible and developed.

— [Joe Conroy](https://www.cooley.com/people/joe-conroy), Cooley’s chairman and chief executive officer, in comments given to the [American Laywer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/23/in-a-year-of-precipitous-change-cooleys-profits-fell-nearly-17-as-revenue-surpassed-2b/) on the firm’s roller coaster of a year. In 2022, Cooley’s net income fell 16.8% to $806 million, with its profit margin dropped 9 percentage points as a result, while its revenue increased 1%, putting the firm past the $2 billion mark. In November, the firm [laid off 150 attorneys and staff members](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/), and Conroy said that severance costs were a “significant” expense item. “We would’ve liked to have done better,” he said. “But we are stronger than ever. We have the most talent we’ve ever had, better brand positioning, better penetration into our client base, and a stronger culture for what we’ve lived through.”

# Job Security And Social Media: Are These Oxymorons?
## There likely isn't anyone who doesn’t have some form of layoff anxiety.

Even if a recession is not a sure thing, some law firms act as if it’s already here. And in an annual report of the average hours attorneys billed last year, the number has freaked out some firms. The average of hours billed, which is [the lowest in 15 years](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/biglaw-billable-hours-down-15-year-low/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=244297762&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_0FePtyUOhfgcRsOIP0cAQf_RP_1pxUv8hJQJxC4xcSCp3THMyvWGzpGaRaB-PE03BH1lY94X9L5P3BzWxsAtRSLIxUg&utm_content=244297762&utm_source=hs_emailf), is under 1600.

[Lower demand](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/lawyer-productivity-demand-dropped-2022-wells-fargo-report-2023-01-31/#:~:text=Lawyers%20in%202022%20logged%20fewer,drop%20below%201%2C600%20hours%20before) creates less productivity. No surprise there.

So, [layoffs are out there](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/procopio-biglaw-layoffs/), in stealth mode or otherwise.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

Layoffs are no fun. I’ve had one. I don’t think there is anyone who doesn’t have some form of layoff anxiety. I did, as I had a sneaking suspicion that my layoff was in the cards due to an acquisition and subsequent management changes. Even the big rainmaker types feel it, for all it takes is one big client to give the relationship lawyer and the firm a shove out the door. [Signing bonuses for laterals](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/lawyers-can-officially-kiss-those-giant-signing-bonuses-goodbye/) have taken flight. Where many years of loyalty between client and firm was pretty much expected, that’s not the case anymore. Loyalty is now transactional. It’s now more of a “what have you done for me lately?” environment.

How to handle layoff anxiety? [Some tips](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-cope-with-layoff-anxiety-%201850097349?utm_source=lifehacker_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2023-02-13), courtesy of the website Lifehacker: have a backup plan (just like an emergency fund but only this is a job-related one), talk to a career coach or therapist (don’t bottle up all your feelings), learn some new skills as the more versatile you are, if a layoff does come,  you may well be able to land another job sooner rather than later.

Don’t think that you are the “only one”; you are not. If your client is acquired, the adage “a new broom sweeps clean” applies. A layoff for you may prompt rethinking priorities. You don’t want to continue lawyering, but want to transfer the legal knowledge and skills you have gained to use in different ways, in different fields, in different industries. There are many “recovering lawyers” who have found their purposes away from the drudgery that much of law practice entails. You would not be alone in making such a switch.

So, then it really shouldn’t be any surprise about [layoffs at Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/sorry-but-the-biglaw-layoffs-arent-quite-over-yet/), including associates. Now comes word that [one Biglaw firm is upping the RMH](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/perkins-coie-billable-hours-change/) (required minimum hours) amid its financial year. How do you preclude awarding a full bonus? By upping the RMH. Not only not nice, but not fair to impose this additional requirement retroactively to the start of the current fiscal year which, for this firm, began last October.

That retroactive requirement certainly does not do anything to mitigate stress levels but can only add to them. A recent study on stressed, lonely, and over-committed lawyers revealed that they can be predictors of suicide risk for our profession — not good news, but not surprising. The report says that [lawyers consider suicide](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/lawyers-who-are-highly-stressed-are-22-times-more-likely-to-consider-suicide/) (suicide ideation) at an exceedingly high rate.

I don’t think it’s just lawyers in Biglaw who are stressed to the max. Ask a small firm or solo and you may well get the sense that they are just as stressed, lonely, and over-committed, if not more so. While the kind of pressure may vary, pressure is pressure, and lawyers feel it immensely. The [report is worth reading](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/11/4/536), and then sharing with family, friends, and even a therapist. People who love and care about us should understand mental health issues that we face. We reveal client confidences at our peril, but we put ourselves in peril when we don’t have someone to talk to.

And while not upping the RMH (i.e., billables), one Biglaw firm is cutting back on the number of hours that can be applied to pro bono work. Now it’s [only a total of 100 hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/biglaw-pro-bono-cuts/) that can be applied to the 2000-hour billing requirements. Pro bono opportunities are often an enticement to join a Biglaw firm.

As a dinosaur, I don’t understand why peeps are so eager to overshare on social media. As a kid I was taught (probably along with everyone else of similar vintage) that you don’t discuss politics, sex, or religion. That lesson is in history’s dustbin. Oversharing, which is SOP (standard operating procedure) along with nastiness to the nth degree, is antithetical to any concept of personal privacy, which we don’t have anymore. So, I loved the story about clients looking up information on prospective lawyers on social media. We know that potential employers do, but now vetting of lawyers by potential clients includes checking up on prospective lawyers’ coming and goings on social media. Surprised? You shouldn’t be and if you are, that says something about you.

That drunken bachelor party in Cabo where you were too inebriated to stand up? Explain that. The over-the-top golf game that included too much fun at the 19th hole? What was that all about? Explain why those regrettable but unforgettable moments were captured for eternity and for all the world to see. Just like lawyers vetting prospective clients, [what goes around comes around](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/clients-sometimes-peruse-their-lawyers-personal-social-media-accounts/).

Stop and think about what you are showing.  Do you really want that personal stuff out in the world, especially if you have been laid off and are looking for another job? A trial judge told me many years ago that our reputations are all we have as lawyers and that they follow us for our entire careers. True then and probably even truer now.

# The Am Law 100 COVID-19 Furloughs Continue

It’s a new day, but outside the pandemic still rages. COVID-19 has brought radical changes to our day-to-day lives and uncertainty reigns supreme. Beyond the downright scary health implications the virus has brought, the financial impact has been severe. Unemployment has skyrocketed and Biglaw is not immune from the trend.

[We’ve been tracking](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/) exactly how the economic downturn is impacting the legal industry, and, unfortunately, we don’t expect the cost-cutting measures to end anytime soon. And yes, that means we have more to report.

Blank Rome is the latest firm on the furlough bandwagon. A firm spokesperson confirmed that, “Like many firms, in response to these unprecedented times we are looking at proactive measures to address the ongoing business and financial impact of COVID-19.” And as a result, the firm has “furloughed a small number of support staff.” But they clarify, “No attorneys have been furloughed.”

While that’s good news for attorneys at the firm, it must really suck for however many staff members are now shouldering the load of the firm’s COVID-19 austerity.

Why are law firms increasingly getting involved in geopolitics?

As [Joe Andrew](https://www.dentons.com/en/joe-andrew), the founding global chairman of [Dentons](https://www.dentons.com/en/) quipped in our recent sit down: “A good lawyer knows the law but a great lawyer knows the judge.”

One could interpret that adage as implying a personal relationship between the attorney and the judge that is somehow more deterministic than superb legal work. But to me it simply reflects the fact that context matters: If you don’t understand what you’re up against, you’re unlikely to be successful.

And in today’s world, the political context of everything matters.

I served as Global Deputy CEO of one of the top geopolitical advisory firms, and my experience historically was of political and legal advice being quite separate. The CEO or head of government affairs needed to stay abreast of all political changes but the legal department only deeply engaged if something very acute was happening with a clear political angle. So specialist advice was bought in from top flight forecasters like ourselves, none of whom traditionally sat within integrated legal offerings.

Law firms historically provided public policy and lobbying services. But when it came to “geostrategic” work — or forecasting of global events — they typically stuck to “loss leader” political content to prompt conversations. For instance, every law firm in the UK held seminar after seminar to launch paper after paper about BREXIT, but few were courageously forecasting outcomes. Most were producing unenergetic summaries of regulatory changes that were possible (not probable or improbable). Useful enough to hear once over a mediocre croissant, but not more.

This is all changing. A number of firms are placing big bets in the space. Dentons, the biggest law firm in the world by number of lawyers and number of active geographies [acquired top-flight global political strategy firm Albright-Stonebridge](https://www.dentons.com/en/about-dentons/news-events-and-awards/news/2021/june/dentons-launches-dentons-global-advisors-with-albright-stonebridge-group) and [EU-focused public affairs firm Interel](https://www.dentons.com/en/about-dentons/news-events-and-awards/news/2021/july/dentons-global-advisors-acquires-interel) last year as anchors for its new Dentons Global Advisors business.

On the other end of the size spectrum, [Avonhurst](https://www.avonhurst.com/), a London-based “new-fashioned law firm” where I’ve served as senior advisor, launched three years ago as an integrated legal, legislative, political risk advisory, and capital services firm with a roster of former top [White House](https://avonhurst.com/pippa-malmgren) and [British political](https://www.avonhurst.com/gavin-barwell) and [military](https://www.avonhurst.com/nick-houghton) advisors sitting alongside [White and Case’s former head of London Litigation](https://avonhurst.com/john-reynolds) and [Womble Bond Dickinson’s former head of white collar crime and investigations](https://www.avonhurst.com/audrey-koh).

Others, like [Arnold and Porter](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/), have stocked up on nonlawyer diplomats like [Ambassador Tom Shannon](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/s/shannon-thomas), who has served as acting U.S. secretary of state, for international troubleshooting. A host of other large firms are beefing up their public policy teams with nonlawyers who provide strategic advice, not just lobbying work.

Here are the four reasons this is happening now — and what in-house leaders need to know to make the most of it.

-
Complexity. Read the newspaper, and it’s obvious that political cross-currents are less predictable, and the speed of political shifts is increasing.  Fortune 500 companies are increasingly doing deals that span dozens of countries, and local knowledge about the political context in which such deals are getting done is increasingly valuable. Or, conversely, pursuing complex cross-jurisdictional matters without knowledge of the geopolitical landscape increases the chance of failure. “Every deal that’s more than $1bn crosses over a minimum of 12 countries — transactions are significantly more global every year… clients come to us because there’s a dispute in 104 locations and 70 countries” said Dentons’ Andrew, whose firm claims coverage of 209 locations.

At the same time, there is massive investment in emerging technologies where the law is being written at the same time that it is being practiced. Foresight — and the ability to shape outcomes — in that type of world matters. A lot.

Role of the general counsel. Rather than a world where politics is handled by the CEO and government affairs, more general counsels are finding themselves central to board-level decisions that have a political angle. Some of this has to do with the complexity outlined above crossing over into strategic responsibilities that fall under the GC’s purview. Some of this has to do with the evolution of the role of the GC, as Ben Heineman articulated in [Inside Counsel Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Counsel-Revolution-Resolving-Partner-Guardian/dp/1634252799). And some of it has to do with a sense that doing political work under privilege where possible is a good strategy. But the pandemic has also been a big accelerant too, as GCs found themselves sitting squarely in the center of so many ongoing business decisions. As a result, GCs need their own advisors in order to help guide the business.

The benefit of an integrated political and legal approach is that the teams are working together in lock-step, so theoretically can respond faster and with more precision to help the GC advise the board.

-
Evolving business models. Law firms are always looking for ways to expand their business and the unique role that lawyers play — with access to huge amounts of information and interconnected networks — is a unique opportunity to monetize what they know about political activity.

Being able to mobilize a team of in-house public affairs professionals as part of a coordinated strategy for winning a client’s issue or a case no doubt provides the law firm fielding that team the ability to add a host of new hourly fee earners to the bill. When those fee earners cost less than lawyers of equivalent stature, that can translate into mega-profits for the firm. So this seems attractive on the face of it.

But this can also be a problem if the law firm and customer incentives aren’t aligned. As [Matthew Oresman,](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/matthew-oresman.html) head of international public policy and partner at [Pillsbury, Winthrop, Shaw, Pittman](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/) tells me — “We need to be selective about the problems we’re solving. If you bring me a political question and I’m just going to have to put a bunch of first years on it and charge you a large amount to give you a report that’s fully desk research and not based on real political experience like you’d get at [Eurasia Group](https://www.eurasiagroup.net/) or [Rice Hadley Gates](https://www.rhgm.com/), that’s not good value for the customer.” [Jonathan Bloom](https://www.avonhurst.com/jonathan-bloom), chairman and CEO of Avonhurst, solves this problem by having eliminated the billable hour across the board at his firm. “In Biglaw you have lots of lawyers billing hours and not necessarily aligning interests with their clients. We are building teams aligned with the clients and getting paid as and when our clients are realizing value — not just because we spent time with them. That’s the only way to truly integrate political and legal work.”

-
Integrated outcomes. One-stop shopping is always more convenient, but only if you can get everything you need without compromising quality. Oresman is enlightening on this point:

Done right lawyer-lobbyists and lawyers giving geostrategic advice can do really well because they see so much industry, geography, transactional, and risk management work. So much of policy making and risk management has a legal or analytical angle, so lawyers have inherent skills to understand the problem and develop solutions. The trick is finding lawyers who offer holistic solutions — things that aren’t just law suits or regulatory petition but communications, lobbying, legal, grassroots — all the different elements of a solution. Think about driverless cars — you can hire a law firm to help you understand the regulation but what you really want is a lawyer that will sell you a comparative regulatory study to tell you where to do your project, help get the law changed to shift the regulatory environment by lobbying the lawmakers and regulators, and use grassroots to get a better environment for what you’re trying to achieve.

Now if that integrated strategy exists, it sounds a lot more likely to be effective — and more user-friendly — than cobbling together a host of independent providers.

So, this type of innovation in and around the legal space surely creates more options for general counsels and in-house teams to get legal advice integrated with political advice. And no doubt, such legal advice is better as a result. But there are a few trap doors to be aware of.

First, every firm has a bias — whether geographic, political, or through some other type of perspective. So while it’s tempting to rely on one set of political advice, it may be harder to nail down the actual source of that advice when it is coming from a big law firm alongside legal advice. It’s worth the effort to do so.

At [Hence Technologies](http://www.hence.ai), which I co-founded, our software helps companies select better lawyers and de-risks legal selection. So we spend a lot of time asking questions like: Who are the beneficial owners of a particular law firm? Did they generally come from one school of thinking — politically or even literally did they all go to the same school? When I’m receiving a piece of work from a large firm, do I know who actually performed the work and was it done in-house or was it outsourced to someone else with their own biases? When I uncover biases or work that falls short, can I keep track of that so I don’t make the same mistake again. This is absolutely critical with respect to integrated legal and political advice — particularly when the lawyers buying the work are not political experts themselves.

Second, realize that to get a political problem solved, you probably still have to pay for multiple advisors. Often there can be a sense that political advice is somehow less specialized than legal advice — that relying on the opinion of one expert or one firm is all you need. To be clear, the firms with the largest breadth of political coverage very well might be the only call you need to make to get to a quick temperature reading on a multijurisdictional issue. But if you’re really hunkering down into trying to shape your environment or win a major case, it’s important to have all bases covered. Thinking just about Russia-Ukraine, one might need political advice from an American, Western European, Eastern European, financial regulation/sanctions, and then sector-specific perspective just to get started to really understand the picture. Oh — and those are just the political advisors.

Third, recognize that the advantages lawyers have by “being in the mix” on policy-making can also be a constraint. If a lawyer learns something is politically likely to happen because of work they are currently doing, that would seem like an advantage. But not if they can’t tell you because it would create a conflict with their initial client. So advice can end up being diluted and less specific to manage these conflicts.

On the whole, the market is better off to be able to buy legal and political combo meals alongside the traditional need to order separately. However, it’s important not to lose sight that the whole reason this is possible is because politics is increasingly complex.

# Why These Global 100 Numbers Should Scare The Bejeezus Out Of You
## What do Dentons and Applebee's have in common?

This year’s Global 100 provided [a lot of lukewarm news](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/the-global-100-fractured-futures-at-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2017/). Firms aren’t really growing, with overall revenue limping ahead below the rate of inflation. That’s not really a groundbreaking revelation — we’ve known that [growth is dead](https://www.amazon.com/Growth-Dead-What-firms-brink/dp/1481896040/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506441529&sr=8-1&keywords=growth+is+dead) for years (affiliate link). We also already knew that slowing demand and client cost-cutting [are doing a number on law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/top-firms-build-bigger-gap-over-the-field-like-they-do-every-quarter/) in the United States. That the global climate isn’t much different is no surprise. Especially when you consider that firms based in the United States dominate the upper echelon of the Global 100,

What should worry everyone about these numbers is what’s just below the surface. Just like the U.S. market, these overall flat or declining stats obscure a rising gap between an elite cadre of firms and the rest of the pack. The Global 100 survey headlines focus on profits per equity partner declining for the first time ever for the list as a whole, but Cravath’s PPP jumped 18 percent! Kirkland’s grew 14 percent! The top firms had similarly positive revenue news as well. When viewed in this context, the fact that the top 100 firms in the world saw PPP decline and revenue sputter despite these gains highlights a growing gap between Biglaw haves and have-nots.

This isn’t sustainable. Firms lower on that list will get eaten by their larger brethren or just break apart under their own weight. We’re witnessing the Applebee-ification of the law. That seems a more apt term than drawing a McDonald’s analogy. After all, it’s not like these firms are offering substandard product, just… a chain product. As markets become increasingly global, firms want to see a familiar brand wherever they go. They’ll continue to eschew local experts until those locals find themselves under the Dentons umbrella — a casual, legal advice franchise.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Unfortunately, legal advice isn’t necessarily the service best suited to extreme consolidation. If the vectors of global legal advice continue to converge, only a handful of entities will drive how the law is interpreted around the world. And while the risk of this consolidation should scare the bulk of the Global 100 today, it should terrify the elite firms soon enough. The allure of “one-stop shopping” may drive revenues today, but it’s only a matter of time before PwC muscles its way into the business and clients start realizing that merging their accountants with their legal counsel is even more convenient.

Maybe this won’t come to pass. Maybe this is just a stage, a growing pain before a revolutionary shift in the delivery of legal services throws the whole order asunder. We know that technological innovation has opened doors for smaller firms to compete for business in the United States. Could these efficiencies spread across the globe and reinvigorate the rest of the Global 100?

Perhaps. Somehow it feels like the siren call of the familiar will win out though.

# Addressing The Elephant In The Room: Biglaw's Problem With Diversity
## Can anything be done to improve diversity?

Given that The Jabot podcast is designed to address issues that diverse people face in the legal industry, it’s a little surprising that it took until episode 17 until we on point dealt with Biglaw’s problem with diversity. In the latest episode, I talk with Merle Vaughn, Senior Lateral Partner Recruiter & Law Firm Diversity Practice Leader at Major, Lindsey & Africa.

Merle and I discuss what concrete steps law firms can take to move the diversity needle, the problem with income partners, the flawed assumptions about the diversity pipeline, and more.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Associate Bonus Watch: Bill More, Make More, At Fried Frank
## Fried Frank associates have known what their bonuses were going to be this year since at least 2015.

Fried Frank, a firm that does a great job of not being interesting enough for Above the Law to be all up in their business, released their version of a Cravath-match. Here are the highlights.

- It’s a 2,000 hour minimum to get the standard Cravath scale.
- At 2,200 hours your get Cravath-plus-15%.
- At 2,450 hours you get Cravath-plus-30%.
- You can include up to 425 pro-bono (and certain other non-billiable) hours towards your hours requirement.
If you’re new to bonus season, the Fried Frank plan seems, well, interesting. Few firms allow you to put so many pro-bono hours towards your bonus cut-offs. And at 2,450 hours you are getting significantly more than Cravath.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But… this is [exactly what they did last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-fried-after-a-long-week/), which was in accordance with a detailed bonus policy the firm laid out in 2015. So while I want to be all like “Fried Frank! Bonuses! [To The Strongest!](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great)” the more accurate take is “Fried Frank does what they promised to do, again.”

Don’t get me wrong. Congratulations Fried Frank associates. Clarity and reliability in your bonus structure is actually a very good thing and, really, what we should expect from all law firms.

It just doesn’t make a terribly interesting news story. Next year, I hope Fried Frank adds a wrinkle: 30% above market for 2,450 bills, but one 2,450 biller will be chosen at random to receive brand new Dodge Charger. Spice it the hell up!

And now for some boilerplate that I don’t think anybody is reading anyway:

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please email it to us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Associate Bonus Watch: Which Firm Is Offering Up To $50K For Associates To Stay Put?
## This Biglaw firm is throwing lots of money at a retention problem.

Say your firm has been repeatedly raided for months on end, and now that the fourth quarter has arrived, the number of partners who have left has reached double digits. You’re afraid that associates will soon follow those partners to their new firms. What do you do? What can you do?

Rather than forcefully shoving their heads in the sand and hoping the problem goes away, the management team at Ropes & Gray has decided to handle it in a très Biglaw way, by throwing money at it — lots and lots of money.

Following the departures of at least 22 partners, Ropes & Gray has offered retention bonuses of up to $50,000 to an untold number of associates in the United States, London, and Hong Kong. We understand that these bonuses are being paid in addition to the firm’s regular associate bonuses.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Legal Week](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202800346784/Ropes--Gray-Issues-Bonuses-to-Retain-Associates-Amid-Lateral-Raids?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1) has more information on those who are being paid to stay:

According to former partners, roughly five associates in London were offered payments of around £20,000 ($26,580), while other former partners claim that several associates in Hong Kong and the U.S. were offered up to $50,000 to stay at the firm.

Ropes & Gray made the counteroffers after a number of associates whose partners had moved on to other firms were approached to follow them. Sources have suggested to Legal Week that around 60 percent of Ropes & Gray’s counteroffers to associates had been accepted.

But why would associates want to hang around at a firm that’s leaking partners like a sieve? According to David Chapin, Ropes & Gray’s managing partner, associates needn’t worry; the firm has had a great year, and other firms are desperate to snatch up partners from Ropes because they’re so great: “We have really good partners that other firms want—if I wasn’t having my partners recruited I’d be worried about the kind of partners we had. We don’t get too hung up on short-term fluctuations.”

If you’re an associate who’s been paid a retention bonus to remain with the firm, we’d love to know how long the firm expects you to stay put. Get in touch with us [via email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “Ropes Retention Bonus”). In any event, congratulations to all Ropes & Gray associates who received a retention bonus! Bonuses on top of future bonuses which could be quite lucrative is certainly nothing to complain about.

And now, a brief word on Biglaw bonuses, generally. Bonus season is just a few weeks away, and while we love covering those announcements, we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks!

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish, and you’ll know where your firm stands.

# How To Do The Best Job In Law While In Quarantine
## Is actually working in the offices of the firm in question an inherent part of the situation?

There were certain things that were supposed to happen as the Spring 2020 law school semester drew to a close. 3Ls across the country were to be celebrating with friends and family the life-changing achievement of earning a J.D. 2Ls and 1Ls were to be preparing for their summer jobs, many of which would be Biglaw summer associate positions. And I was to watch the Kansas Jayhawks [romp their way through the NCAA Tournament](https://theathletic.com/1725254/2020/04/06/fan-fiction-ncaa-tournament-and-your-national-champion-is/) en route to the program’s third national title in my lifetime. COVID-19 changed all of that.  [Most tragically](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), so far 185,000 people have been killed by the disease, including nearly 48,000 Americans. But the impact has also had a ripple effect on law schools. Graduating 3Ls are celebrating by themselves or with family through social distancing methods such as Zoom — it has taken over the rest of the law school life, so why not graduation as well.  Summer associate programs have been [significantly altered](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/fuf8ki/tracking_summer_program_changes/), with a sizable number cutting their length, and a growing number going completely remote. And while least significant in the grand scheme of things, I was prevented from watching Devon Dotson and Marcus Garrett throw lobs to Udoka Azubuike all the way to Atlanta.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I have previously written in this space that I think being a summer associate is [the best job](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/being-a-summer-associate-is-the-best-job-youll-have-in-the-legal-industry/) that anyone can have in the legal industry, but inherent in that contention was the seemingly straightforward concept that as a summer associate you would actually be working in the offices of the firm in question.  2020 has presented society with a host of novel questions, including: “is there a limit on the amount of Netflix a person can consume in one day?” and “what percentage of the population are willing to gamble on mass death in an effort to restart the economy?” — the answers being, respectively, “I don’t know because I have four kids home from daycare” and “a surprisingly large number.” To that pile we can add one specifically focused on legal employment, “is being a summer associate still a great job if you are working remotely?” Having thought about it a decent amount, I believe the answer is yes, provided you take some additional steps.

Whenever I think, or talk with students, about summer associate programs, I typically divide them into two parts: professional and social. While not necessarily equally weighted — though I would contend the weighing is closer to even than some might think — both are important to a successful summer experience. Of these two, the professional portion of the experience is probably the one that is easier to replicate in a remote setting.

Technological advances have allowed students to conduct legal research as thoroughly from the comfort of a couch as they can from the bowels of the law library. Those same innovations allow summer associates to work on projects from their parents’ dining room table just as they would from a glass-walled office with a scenic view. Conducting legal research, drafting memoranda, composing legal briefs, and even reviewing prospectuses (I imagine), really only requires a laptop and a strong WiFi connection. In fact, as any former junior litigator (myself included) from the past couple of decades can attest, certain tasks, such as document review, are more tolerable and more efficiently completed at home than at work. With most firms using a web-based system for tracking summer assignments, a summer associate’s workflow should be uninterrupted, regardless of location.

This is not to say that, from a professional standpoint, a remote summer will be identical to the in-person variety. Some things, such as walking into a partner’s or associate’s office to get an assignment or have your questions answered, obviously cannot happen if you and the attorney in question are separated by thousands of miles rather than hundreds of steps. But, even here, some ways can make the remote experience similar, if not superior, to the in-person standard. A good rule of thumb to learn early in a summer is to never enter another office without a legal pad in hand. Failure to take notes when you get an assignment could have you coming back to the attorney with some embarrassingly obvious questions, or have you miss critical portions of the assignment. Remote summer programs will likely have something similar in the form of video conferencing or other ways of directly connecting with attorneys in a more personal manner than just an email or phone call. This might seem more simulacrum than sufficient substitute at first, but there is a potentially hidden benefit. You are still able to take notes on a Zoom call just as if you were sitting in a social distancing inappropriate manner, but even the best note takers can sometimes miss an important point and jot down something incorrectly. One of the benefits of modern technology is that a program such as Zoom lets you record an entire conversation, if you so choose. Now, rather than having to rely on imperfect notes, you can have the actual conversation at your fingertips to review at your leisure. An important caveat, if you go down this recording route, make sure you have the permission of everyone who is going to be on the video conference. Whether you live in a jurisdiction that allows one-party consent for recording is irrelevant since your summer goal is to land a post-graduation offer, not merely avoid prison. No one wants to be the next [Linda Tripp](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/linda-tripp-dead.html).

So if the professional portion of the summer associate program can seemingly be done with some aplomb remotely, what about the social provision? Some scoff when I talk about the social nature of summer programs. But remember that the goal of a summer associate program is to evaluate how a law student will fit in at the firm. A good portion of that fit is based on whether that student can do the legal work required of the position, but a significant portion is based on social or cultural fit. If the social element was completely unimportant, it is unlikely Biglaw firms would have a dedicated summer event budget that stretches to six or even seven figures. Why is the social aspect so important? The students you spend your summer with are, if all goes according to plan, the same people who will join you as first-year associates at the firm. You all will rise up through the ranks together and if everyone stays at the firm for several decades (unlikely) you will all be partners together, and thus intertwined both professionally and financially for the bulk of your adult lives. But more likely than not, people will start to leave the firm as time goes on. The strong bond between a summer class is important in this scenario as well. Say, for example, an attorney leaves and goes in-house somewhere. When that new employer needs to hire outside counsel, an ongoing relationship between former summer associates can ensure the firm where everyone started out is brought on as outside counsel. Law firms like to funnel departing associates into positions with existing, or prospective, clients for a reason. Business reasons aside, the depth of the summer experience means the friendships you make over the relatively short time of just a couple of months can last a lifetime. My family’s holiday card mailing list has more former Sidley summer associates than it does friends from high school, college, and even law school.

So how can these bonds be developed if everyone is scattered across the country? It will take a bit of work, but I think it can be done. Try to set up some face-to-face interactions about something other than case assignments. Students and faculty at Vanderbilt have utilized Zoom Happy Hours to try to bond in our isolated times. Something similar among summer associates can greatly improve camaraderie. Set up a Slack channel, group text thread, or whatever shared-media platform the kids are into today so that everyone can talk to each other — this serves as an alternative to whatever firm sponsored platform (e.g., Microsoft Teams) has been set up, as those channels should be limited to work conversations. Been making your way through various cookbooks during quarantine? Set up a recipe exchange with your fellow summers and if your culinary forte happens to be baking, think about sharing your wares via the U.S. Mail — cookies are easier to ship than Alison Roman’s [Baked Ziti.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeIuKdPzimM)  Just make sure your cooking skills are not [Sen. Mark Warner-esque](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/do-not-let-mark-warner-cook-for-you.html), and thus lead you to instant meme fame. A similar set up can be developed for a litany of hobbies from reading books, knitting, or even woodworking.



This summer class bonding does not merely have to be limited to activities outside of the office. Summer associates helping each other out with various assignments has long been a hallmark of any summer class. Much like remote summers are not going to be able to walk into a partner’s office, there will not be a chance to run into a fellow summer and get some advice on a tough admiralty question. But that does not mean remote summers are completely on their own. Use the technology available to loop in fellow summers on all sorts of work questions. Set up a lunchtime chat where you can share a meal and thoughts about various legal questions that have arisen over the course of the morning.

Obviously the summer of 2020 is going to be a strange one for pretty much everyone on Earth. While a significant change has befallen Biglaw summer associate programs, this does not mean the entire experience if for naught.  In fact, if you take certain steps, the experience can still bear close resemblance to the greatest job in the legal profession. As for me, I will be spending the summer watching the 2008 national championship game on a loop and wondering what could have been.

# Am Law 100 Firm Reverses Course On Salary Cuts Meant To Avoid Layoffs

The coronavirus crisis has thrown the legal profession into upheaval, but for some firms, the time has come to readjust and reassess the austerity measures that were put into place to prepare for the coming storm. Earlier this week, we reported on two firms — [Ogletree](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-100-firm-offers-special-bonuses-for-associates/) and [Baker Botts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/baker-botts-bonuses/) — that were prepared to offer bonuses to associates for their outstanding performance during these hard times (and Baker Botts even did a partial about face on its salary cuts).

We now have news that yet another Biglaw firm is reversing course on its salary cuts, and everyone at the firm is sure to be thrilled.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Earlier this week, Cadwalader announced that the firm would be returing to its original pay scale. If you recall, the firm was one of the [first to make major salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/), slashing associate compensation by 25 percent and staff compensation by 10 percent. On top of those cuts, partners and senior counsel made the most “significant financial sacrifice” of all, forgoing distributions entirely. Starting tomorrow, everyone at the firm will see their prior salaries restored.

In a firmwide letter, managing partner Patrick Quinn said that although some practices were faltering, others have been “even busier than we projected before we knew about the virus.” Here’s some additional detail from [Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1296330/cadwalader-baker-botts-walk-back-coronavirus-pay-cuts):

“We will continue to monitor the impact of the crisis, and make decisions in the weeks and months to come that are in the best interests of our firm, our people and our clients,” Quinn said in the letter. “As we said back in March, we will get through this together, caring about each other and taking care of each other.” …

When asked Wednesday morning if any layoffs have occurred, Quinn said they have not. The firm did offer voluntary retirement packages to legal secretaries though, he noted.

“Our goal continues to be to preserve jobs and preserve our ability to take advantage of the recovery,” he said.

Voluntary buyouts are certainly better than layoffs. Things are looking up for Cadwalader thanks to the proactive measures the firm took at the pandemic’s start.

# Rumored Merger Between Hogan Lovells And Shearman Scrapped
## The proposed mega firm won't be happening.

[Back in December, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/hogan-lovells-and-shearman-sterling-potential-merger-on-the-horizon/)we reported [Hogan Lovells](https://www.hoganlovells.com/) with its ~2500 attorneys and [Shearman](https://www.shearman.com/) with about 730 were considering merging. A rough sketch of the numbers seemed to make sense, the combined revenue was looking like they’d make the number 3 largest firm by revenue, and equity partner profits are roughly comparable between $2.5M and $3M. But alas, it is not to be.

Last night, the [two firms put out](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/02/shearman-and-hogan-lovells-call-off-merger-talks/) a joint statement, light on details, announcing they are not merging:

“As has been widely reported, our firms have been in preliminary and exploratory conversations regarding a possible combination. After careful consideration, we have mutually agreed that a combination at this time is not in the best interest of either firm. We have been deeply impressed with each other’s business, practices and people and wish each other continued success,” the statement said.

This feels like particularly bad news for Shearman — the firm recently announced [attorney and staff layoffs. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/)And a [number of partners](https://www.thelawyer.com/shearman-woes-mount-as-morgan-lewis-takes-entire-munich-team/) have [found homes](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/31/shearman-sterlings-decisions-over-partner-pay-practice-mix-and-office-strategy-fuel-firm-struggles/) at [new Biglaw ](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2023/02/28/cravath-set-for-shock-english-law-debut-with-shearman-double-partner-hire/)firms. Plus the [one-time Am Law Top 5](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/27/shearmans-long-road-from-wall-street-darling-to-merger-partner-405-116391/) firm’s recent financial performance can best be described as [sluggish](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/17/this-is-not-reactive-shearman-outlines-growth-strategy-accepting-some-partner-losses-405-117509/).

It’ll be interesting to see what’s next for Shearman (oh yeah, and Hogan Lovells).

While firms never want to be haled into the court of public opinion over something like this, the mark of a good firm is to suck it up and take on the matter directly. So when Paul Weiss found itself facing criticism [over its new partnership class](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/paul-weiss-press-release-captures-everything-broken-about-biglaw-in-one-image/) — or, perhaps more so, the way it advertised its new partnership class with a white-male dominated collage — the firm took swift action.

The firm scheduled a town hall meeting to discuss the issue and its broader diversity efforts on January 14. A meeting may not seem like a radical step, but in a world where Biglaw firms are quick to [ignore their problems and hope they go away](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/more-details-from-the-offensive-simpson-thacher-pregnant-email/), Paul Weiss is showing the right instinct to offer transparency and share the “concrete strategic initiatives” the firm has to get this right.

As an issue, this diversity stumble was always a bit out of character for Paul Weiss, notably [one of the firms in Microsoft’s diversity program](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2018/12/11/microsofts-legal-diversity-program-turns-10/) that offers bonuses for firms willing to demonstrate a concrete commitment to diversity. But it’s also a sign that unconscious biases are everywhere and the first step to combatting them is not to be afraid to admit that they exist. At an ABA meeting earlier this year, [I moderated an informative conversation on the subject](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/getting-ahead-of-implicit-bias-in-the-legal-profession/) and the experts all agreed that people need to be less paralyzed by shame — or, worse, denial — of these biases and more willing to accept that they exist through no conscious effort and then work to ameliorate them.

No one saw a problem with this collage when they should have. But that’s water under the bridge. What matters more is acknowledging it and doing something about it. This town hall is a good first step.

Paul Weiss Chair Brad Karp reached out to Above the Law to discuss the matter, but we haven’t been able to connect.

So that all sounds like the exactly the correct response to this, right? And it is! So why the awkward quotes around “addresses” in the headline? Well, because…

Oh… that’s an unfortunate misuse of scare quotes and we just have to tweak them on this. We get what he means and contextually this is a positive message. But, you know, maybe there’s still some work to be done in mastering how to talk about these subjects. In general, don’t put anything in quotation marks that you wouldn’t be willing to sarcastically put air quotes around in conversation. That’s my advice.

Still, if you are a “minority” or someone with a “vagina” then feel free to discuss these issues at the meeting.

# Biglaw Firm's Chair Compares Associates To 'Elite Athletes'

All elite athletes understand, you work hard and then you recover. That is part of high performance. We are conscious that our people are working hard, and that it is a tough, all-in kind of commitment. We want our people to have time to both recover and reflect.

— [Mitch Zuklie](https://www.orrick.com/en/People/8/5/E/Mitchell-Zuklie), chairman and chief executive officer of Orrick, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2023/03/09/quality-first-scale-second-orricks-recipe-to-revenue-profits-and-partnership-growth-in-2022/) concerning the firm’s performance last year, and why its associates and staff members are deserving of a break. “It was an excellent year for us, strategically and financially,” Zuklie said. “It was our second year of record-setting revenue. It was also a year of head count growth. We attracted a lateral class that was our strongest ever in terms of quality and fit.” Orrick also [merged with Buckley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/top-50-biglaw-firm-to-merge-with-prominent-boutique-creating-1150-lawyer-powerhouse/) in January, capping off a very successful year in 2022.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

From a systemic standpoint, what this says is Vinson & Elkins is really focused on developing talent and creating situations where our top people can be whole people. We really recognize that being a top-shelf lawyer and partner means that we need to pay attention to the whole person.

— [Hy Pomerance](https://www.velaw.com/people/hy-pomerance/), chief talent officer at Vinson & Elkins, in comments given to the [Texas Lawyer](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2024/03/22/oh-baby-6-of-7-newly-minted-partners-at-vinson-elkins-have-a-newborn/) on the number of newborn babies among the firm’s latest partnership class. Six out of seven new partners at V&E have newborns, and Pomerance says it happened for a reason. “We obviously have all sorts of scaffolding around our attorneys — as a lot of firms do — but we think about it from a holistic standpoint,” he said.

Today’s topic: antitrust law.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The practice of antitrust falls into several big categories: civil and criminal litigation, merger and transactional work, and counseling. Some antitrust lawyers specialize in one or two of these areas, while others maintain broad practices that cover all of them.

A typical day for an antitrust associate on a litigation matter could involve drafting a motion to dismiss antitrust claims in a price-fixing class action or working with an economist to prepare an expert report on antitrust damages claims. On a merger matter, an associate might spend the day analyzing market share information to evaluate the antitrust risk of a planned merger or drafting a white paper in favor of a merger to the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice. On the counseling side, a typical day could involve reviewing a client’s IP licenses for antitrust issues or preparing a presentation to train a client’s salespeople about avoiding antitrust violations.

And, let’s face it, antitrust involves a lot of documents. As a junior associate, some document review is inevitable. After several years, the role shifts to managing document collection and production.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A client training might involve one partner and one associate, while a significant merger investigation could involve several partners, senior and mid-level associates, and a small army of junior attorneys. Within the firm, antitrust attorneys collaborate most often with M&A attorneys and general litigators.

Mid-level and senior associates work frequently with external vendors on document productions, economic experts in litigation and merger investigations, and attorneys at other firms in joint defense groups. Contact with clients and government investigators increases with seniority.

Firms structure their antitrust practices in varying ways that can have an impact on the type of work a junior associate does. For example, some firms fold their antitrust attorneys into the litigation department, so that junior associates may be staffed to other types of matters as well. Some firms have dedicated attorneys to handle the somewhat specialized work of pre-merger antitrust filings while others do not.

- What does a common career path look like?
A combination of law firm and government experience is common, such as spending a few years at a law firm, followed by a stint at the DOJ or FTC, and then returning to a law firm. Antitrust attorneys who reach a management position or otherwise burnish their reputation at one of the agencies may return to a law firm as counsel or partner.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
That said, antitrust litigators – especially outside of Washington, D.C. – are less likely to have spent time working in government. Plenty of antitrust attorneys also spend their whole careers in government, including at state attorney general’s offices. And some antitrust attorneys land in-house positions, though only certain industries need in-house antitrust specialists, like pharmaceutical and tech companies.

- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?
Ghost pepper spicy. The work in private practice ranges from civil and criminal litigation to deal advice to compliance and day-to-day counseling. Government agencies offer additional opportunities to focus on policy and advocacy work, international relations, and appellate work, among other things.

Besides that, one of the best things about antitrust is that each new matter is an opportunity to learn an industry from top to bottom. Antitrust lawyers become experts in all kinds of surprising areas.

- How much wear and tear?
Transactional and merger work can be demanding because of tight deadlines and pressure to get a deal closed. Merger litigation, though uncommon, involves preliminary injunctions and moves at an intense pace. Class-action litigation tends to have a longer time horizon but can still involve time crunches around major milestones and, needless to say, becomes more fast-paced the closer it gets to trial. Many government antitrust lawyers work just as hard as their law firm counterparts, especially in litigation-heavy practice areas, but there are certainly government roles that offer a better balance.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
The documents. Collecting them. Reviewing them. Producing them. This is a little-loved part of any legal practice involving government investigations or commercial litigation. Because many parts of a company’s operations are relevant to an antitrust inquiry, the size of the document productions can be truly enormous.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
Antitrust lawyers are constantly learning and are proud of their versatility. They get to practice in an area of law that is always evolving and that touches on virtually every aspect of our economy. The strong public policy element of antitrust means there are always interesting debates to be had about how aggressive enforcement should be, what types of business conduct the antitrust laws should address, and which economic and legal tools should be applied. Antitrust is also growing and evolving globally as new countries adopt and refine antitrust regimes of their own, and a career in antitrust can involve many opportunities to work with colleagues abroad.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
There are no well-beaten paths away from antitrust altogether, given that it’s a fairly specialized area of law. Attorneys who gain strong litigation experience might move into other litigation areas, and those who develop particular expertise in an industry may also be positioned to move into non-legal business roles.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
Both M&A activity and antitrust enforcement have been on the upswing in the U.S. in recent years, keeping antitrust lawyers very busy – though federal enforcement activity may dial back under the Trump administration. Changes in our economy, including the rise of the tech giants and the advent of the sharing economy, are raising new challenges and generating interesting debates about what role antitrust has to play, if any, in policing business practices in a fast-changing landscape. The practice of antitrust is also ever more global, thanks to growing international operations and transactions, aggressive enforcers in Europe, and countries like China increasingly flexing antitrust enforcement muscle.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
A keen intellect and a strong sense of curiosity will ensure that a candidate continues to learn and enjoy practicing for many years. Good judgment is essential to be able to sort through the many gray areas that arise in antitrust and provide useful advice to clients. The candidate should also be comfortable with economics.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Raises Include An Extra Bump For Junior Associates

And with $444,400,000 in gross revenue last year, Cahill, Gordon & Reindel is showing they have the cash to keep up — and even do slightly better — than the prevailing Biglaw standard. (Plus the firm has previously signaled [they’ll do what it takes to keep valuable associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cahill-partners/) at the firm, rather than lose them to the lateral market.)

# Associate Bonus Watch: Solid Bonuses At A Solid Firm
## Associates seem happy with the transparency and predictability of their bonuses.

Better late than never. It’s true of associate bonuses, and it’s true of our coverage of associate bonuses.

Bonuses at [Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/akin-gump/) were announced back on February 9. We heard rumblings about the news, but we didn’t get the memo or hard information until now (after we specifically requested it in our [Covington bonus story](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/associate-bonus-watch-new-york-bonuses-go-to-washington/)). So that explains the delay. Please don’t assume that one of your colleagues will send in the memo; we’re all familiar with the story about four people named [Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody](http://www.corsinet.com/braincandy/hlife.html) (punchline: “Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done”).

The 2015 Akin Gump bonuses sound a lot like the [2014 Akin Gump bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/associate-bonus-watch-akin-gump-2/): “positive and straightforward, pleasing to associates but not disruptive to the market.” This is what one tipster told us:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Here’s the memo] we received from [David Botter](http://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/david-h-botter.html), the firmwide hiring partner, back on February 9. Bonuses got paid out February 12, and I think people were pleased overall (at least in [my office]). My hours were on the low side compared to past years, so I was pretty excited to get a nice merit bonus that put my overall bonus about 10-15% over market. It was a great year for the firm, so I don’t think any of us were surprised to see the firm give out New York market across all offices. I think we all appreciate the transparency and predictability.

If you flip to the memo on the next page, you’ll see it’s pretty similar to last year’s. Once again, Akin took the NYC market scale and used it as the benchmark for associates hitting the 1950-hour mark, and it also paid additional bonuses ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 to top performers.

Last year, 70 percent of associates got a bonus, with 72 percent of those getting a market bonus, 20 percent getting an additional merit bonus, and 8 percent getting a below-market bonus. This year, the numbers were even better: 74 percent got a bonus, with 74.5 percent of those getting a market bonus, 22.7 percent getting an additional merit bonus, and 2.8 percent getting a below-market bonus. In addition, this year associates who complied with the firm’s newly instituted time entry policy got an additional one-time bonus of $1,500.

Did we miss your firm’s bonus announcement? Please [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus%20News). We’ll write about it now, even if it’s weeks or months old. It’s important to have a repository for bonus news and memos, so associates can know what they’re worth and firms can know what their peers are paying. Thanks.

# Gibson Dunn Plays 'Too Big To Fail' Argument For Their Crypto Client

As Sam Bankman-Fried sits in a Bahamian jail awaiting the inevitable extradition request from the United States, the rest of the crypto industry scrambles to avoid following suit. While the rivals of Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire may not have been as reckless as to maintain [a group chat titled “Wirefraud”](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/ftx-s-inner-circle-had-a-secret-chat-group-called-wirefraud-20221213-p5c5sx) or publicly admit that it “wasn’t even trying” to manage risk, they’re legitimately concerned about the Department of Justice looking their way next.

Because the animating feature of the whole endeavor is a quasi- (or perhaps not-so-quasi-) Ponzi scheme where crypto holders sitting on speculative bubbles spend like mad to convince someone, anyone, to buy their hoards at inflated prices so the early investors wouldn’t be left holding the bag when the foundations crumbled. Spare all the talk about cutting greedy banks out of dominating the electronic funds transfer process… whatever noble uses crypto might have, that’s just not the industry that exists anymore.

Binance is already talking to the DOJ in an effort to get the government to step aside and let it continue on its merry way. And its lawyers from Gibson Dunn have reached into [a well-worn playbook](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-justice-dept-is-split-over-charging-binance-crypto-world-falters-sources-2022-12-12/).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Binance’s defense attorneys at U.S. law firm Gibson Dunn have held meetings in recent months with Justice Department officials, the four people said. Among Binance’s arguments: A criminal prosecution would wreak havoc on a crypto market already in a prolonged downturn. The discussions included potential plea deals, according to three of the sources.

It worked for everyone responsible for the Great Recession, so you can’t blame them for trying. But Bitcoin is not Citigroup. Letting the big banks skate in 2009 deeply damaged basic faith in the rule of law, but at least there was an argument that the banks had grown too embedded in the system to fail without pulling the economy under. Coupling that reprieve with harsh and necessary reforms to curtail the power of the banks and avoid future misconduct would’ve been nice, but that ship sailed.

In any event, crypto is not going to destroy the economy if the scheme collapses. Crypto is all in probably less than 5 percent of the global money supply (it was less than 3 percent a year ago). And given the speculation surrounding these things, it’s really much less. The failure of the crypto industry is a speedbump.

More to the point, the banking industry in 2009 argued that it should get a pass for its toxic behavior so it could keep doing its constructive work. What exactly is the equivalent here? Facilitating money laundering? Encouraging boiler rooms? [Paying Eric Adams](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/12/eric-adams-crypto-paychecks-new-york-city-bitcoin-ethereum.html)?

See? Three completely unjustified use cases.

The Reuters headline states that the DOJ is “split” over charging Binance, but that’s not really what the article backs up. Rather, the article cites four sources close to the investigation for the claim that the DOJ is divided between charging Binance and its executives now or waiting to further review evidence. Prosecutors tend not to talk themselves out of cases at this juncture — if anyone is urging caution, it’s most likely because they want to drive the nails even deeper in the coffin before acting.

And they’re certainly unlikely to say they just need to review more evidence because they’re worried crypto is too big to fail.

# How GCs Can Support CFOs In The Wake Of The Silicon Valley Bank Failure
## It takes preparation to successfully navigate choppy financial waters, and an existing company-specific crisis plan should form the basis of any GC’s action.

On a daily basis, the general counsel’s prime directive is always clear: take care of the company. But during a monumental crisis such as the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, GCs must change priorities and use their time to act while under extreme pressure.

In midsize-to-large organizations, crisis-response effectiveness almost always depends on the clear understanding of data (operational, risk allocation, and organizational) and speedy analysis. With access to technology that allows quick surveys of contracts and customer/supplier relationships and a GC’s keen understanding of the company’s exposure, you’ll be able to rapidly deliver quality decisions — and protect the company while helping the CFO steady the course.

It takes preparation to successfully navigate choppy financial waters, and an existing company-specific crisis plan should form the basis of any GC’s action. But in a crisis like SVB’s failure, you must also ask how it might affect cash flow — the oxygen your organization breathes. You’ve got to examine any contracts or obligations with direct ties to cash flow and work with the CFO and other internal and external colleagues to systematically address those issues.

In addition, GCs can employ some other boots-on-the-ground tactics to help companies avoid an SVB-like meltdown.

Prioritize Next Steps

In a cash-flow crunch, your first two responsibilities are increasing accounts receivable and reducing accounts payable. Hopefully, you’ve built positive, long-term relationships with suppliers, customers, regulators, and financial houses. Together with the CFO, you need to study existing contracts to figure out where those relationships can help the company maintain footing. Figure out where you can pay late or snare a discount with prepayment. Are there exclusivity or licensing issues that could be affected by emergency measures? What will affect reporting or other obligations?

Assess The Risks

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In addition to cash flow, you’ve got to assess reputational risk and potential exposure to security, regulatory, and litigation concerns. Will you lose top talent or suppliers that turn to other customers? Who do you need to communicate with?

Contracts tell a story; they’re a map to help your firm find its way to the port. Which payment obligations can be stopped with less risk and fewer consequences? Which aren’t material to the business? Which can be suspended because of permissive clauses or relationships? And which are at-will and can be terminated at any time?

Integrate Your Systems

Great decisions require speed and accuracy. Ensure your contract lifecycle management (CLM) systems work with your sales database, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for supply-chain management, accounting systems, and enterprise legal management (ELM) software.

Your ELM will give a more holistic view of relationships — including past co-promotions, points of contention, or even the likelihood of litigation. When integrated with ELM, CLM connects transactional contract data and provides insights into how each relationship works. Who got a discount and why? Can we negotiate pricing, discounts, or terms with our vendors? The technology pairing provides a quick data bridge that’s especially valuable during time-sensitive moments like the SVB response.

Delve Deeper

Once your CLM and ELM are integrated, you can use the data points to conduct in-depth due diligence and figure out who might be able to help. Is there someone who’s willing to work with revised contract terms for payment, or who’s still mad about that last negotiation?

Once a crisis passes, you’ll want to continue your deep dives to ensure you’re up to speed on your company’s details and ready for the next event. Revise your crisis plan, and run a stress test to determine your company’s resilience.

And remember, always be your CFO’s most valuable partner.

# What's More Important Than Matching Socks? Matching Salaries!

While it’s important to follow the money, sometimes the money comes to you.

At least that’s the case for associates at Stroock’s New York and DC offices. Which, after raking in $260,600,000 gross revenue in 2020, has a few ducats to spread around. Here’s the breakdown:



Gotta love it when the outcome is more income. I sure do wonder what pay the associates practicing in the Los Angeles and Miami offices are getting — maybe they could let us know at tips@abovethelaw.com? Either way, I’m sure they’ll be able to afford a few treats with the pay bumps.

(Turn to the next page to see the Stroock memo.)

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.
