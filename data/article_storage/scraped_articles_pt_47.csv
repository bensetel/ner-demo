# Best Summer Associate Event Contest (2016): The Winner!

When law students ask me if it’s okay to go to a firm or office with a small summer program, I’m often supportive. Smaller summer programs tend to have fewer and less lavish events, but what they lack in glitz they frequently make up for in terms of more substantive work and a greater ability to get to know the full-time lawyers.

And sometimes there is no trade-off between size and sizzle. This year was the first of Quinn Emanuel’s [scaled-back summer program](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/), but even with its sails trimmed, QE still blew away the competition in our summer associate event contest:

Which firm put on the best summer associate event of 2016?

- Quinn Emanuel - Iceland Trip (46%, 881 Votes)
- Freshfields - Hamilton (24%, 452 Votes)
- Kirkland and Ellis - New Orleans Trip (16%, 313 Votes)
- Stoel Rives - Portland Trip (12%, 224 Votes)
- Finn Dixon - Trampoline Dodgeball (2%, 31 Votes)
- Richards Layton - Billy Joel Concert (1%, 22 Votes)
Total Voters: 1,923

Quinn took its small group of summers to Iceland as part of the annual firm hike (which all QE lawyers are invited to join). And this resulted in Quinn taking about half the votes in our contest — not as huge a win as [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/best-summer-associate-event-contest-2015-the-winner/), when the firm hike took place in Italy, but still a decisive victory. And as the smart and tough litigators at Quinn Emanuel well know, a win is a win.

As a proud New Yorker and a devotee of musical theater, I cast my own ballot for Freshfields, which treated its summers to Hamilton (orchestra seats, no less). But I respect the will of the people, and I’m [satisfied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0EqxnWxlvY) with this outcome. Congratulations to Quinn Emanuel on winning our content for best summer associate event for the second year in a row!

# Associate Bonus Watch: Nationwide Market Bonuses With Lower Billable Hours Thanks To A Merger
## Partners decided to spread the wealth this year.

For Arnold & Porter, a D.C. powerhouse that [agreed to merge](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/two-new-york-and-d-c-powerhouses-arnold-porter-and-kaye-scholer-agree-to-merge/) with prominent New York firm Kaye Scholer earlier this quarter, it’s been a great year. The combined firm will officially be known as Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, effective January 1, 2017. Associates, however, were very nervous about what this would mean come bonus time, and rightfully so. As recently as last year, A&P paid [below-market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/associate-bonus-watch-firm-trolls-associates-with-generous-below-market-bonuses/) to offices outside of New York, and failed to disclose to associates that a negative monetary distinction would be made between those who had billed 2000 and 2200 hours. Here’s a representative tip we received from a source on associates’ anxiety in the lead-up to bonus time at the firm:

There’s a fear in the ranks that A&P will hold to its 2200 hour requirement for market bonuses. That wouldn’t have been unexpected in a normal year, but the merger with Kaye Scholer, a NY firm that pays market at 2000, will make things interesting. The firms are supposedly making independent bonus decisions this year. Imagine a scenario where A&P announces on Dec. 31 that associates will be paid market at 2200. Attorneys who billed 2000 will get 50% of market, which has been the standard for the last several years. Merger takes effect on Jan. 1. It likely won’t go over well when we receive half the amount our new colleagues are getting when bonuses are actually distributed in 2017.

Luckily for these nervous associates, Arnold & Porter decided to spread the wealth with market-matching bonuses across all of its offices for those who had at least 2000 hours (including up to 200 pro bono or business development hours). On top of standard bonuses, A&P will dole out higher bonuses of up to $120,000 to those who have “demonstrated excellence in the quality and nature of their work and an extraordinary level of productivity.” At Arnold & Porter, associates are considered extraordinarily productive at more than 2400 hours. Individual bonus memos will go out on January 3, and they will presumably be paid on the same day. Congrats to all A&P associates! It may have taken a merger to receive nationwide market bonuses, but you did it.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That’s our take on associate bonuses from Arnold & Porter. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

It’s no secret that many lawyers are miserable. Every day you can read about the high levels of dissatisfaction among attorneys and the seemingly ever-plummeting levels of morale at law firms. Yet so many lawyers continue to drag their burned-out selves into the office (or, these days, at least out of bed) every day to jobs they hate and find unrewarding.

I’ve got news for you – it doesn’t have to be that way. Yes, student loans, financial obligations, and outside pressures are all very real, but you’re allowed to find a way out. (Full disclosure: I’ve passionately [gone on the record](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/leaving-biglaw-to-try-to-be-happy/?rf=1) about the joys of leaving Biglaw in the past).

Still don’t think it’s possible? Meet [Julie Bonasso](https://juliebonasso.com/), a former Biglaw corporate attorney and recruiter who now [coaches lawyers](https://juliebonasso.com/for-lawyers) on leaving the law and pursuing a sustainable life that actually takes into account their own well-being. Julie’s personal story says it all:

“Back in ‘da day, I hated my life, I hated my job and I hated myself.”

If you can relate to any part of that sentiment, Julie’s [“Leave Law, Love Life” ](https://bit.ly/3k0R9wV)program just might be for you.

Leave Law, Love Life is a limited, one-on-one coaching offer that combines transformational coaching with strategic career advice for lawyers, especially women lawyers, who are looking to transition out of law.

If you’re feeling trapped and like there are no other career options for you, take heart – there is a way out. Read on to learn more about Julie, her coaching approach, and how she’s helping lawyers find happiness.

Why did you decide to start your own company devoted to helping female lawyers leave the law?

I’ve always been very entrepreneurial. The recruiting field was interesting to me, but most of the lawyers I spoke to were just looking to escape their current job in the hopes that the next one would be better. They were focusing on the symptom rather than the problem. What I often saw was that there were other issues going on that a new job simply would not cure. In my recruiting role, I began coaching attorneys on helping them achieve what they really desired in work and life. During this time, I began to see patterns emerge similar to what I had experienced, and what so many others were experiencing. I realized I was not alone and the themes of burnout, dissatisfaction, and stress were broad-based. It was then that I made it my mission to help other lawyers find another way of working, where they were thriving versus just surviving. Ultimately that led me to getting my coaching certification.

My intention with my work is to impact people in a profound, life-shifting way, and I wasn’t able to do that through recruiting or a traditional law career. My passion is to empower professionals, women in particular, to have a career that’s fueled by well-being versus stress. Many of my lawyer clients are stuck or feel trapped because of financial constraints. I wanted to show them a way of working that’s lucrative and fun.

What are some of the top concerns you hear from the lawyers you coach?

The top pain points I hear are: constant overwhelm, fatigue, brain fog, lack of choices, feeling trapped, and the list goes on. While there have been some strides in lawyer job satisfaction and morale since I graduated in 1995, the changes have been incredibly small and incremental. Today’s lawyers are still feeling overworked and burned out, just like they were two decades ago. We now know that it’s going to take a major systemic overhaul to fix the bigger issues.

One of the things I hear a lot is that lawyers feel shame admitting that they may want out. They are being told, “you just can’t cut it.” In reality, though, nobody can truly cut it, because current law firm demands are not a sustainable way of living. As we continue talking about these issues and normalizing them, change will become easier. For now, we need to find different ways to address the problem. That’s where my coaching comes in – impacting one lawyer at a time.

Tell us a little about your approach.

I start by asking my clients to define success for themselves. Too many of us have been living and working to meet someone else’s definition of success. There’s a lot of fear of judgment that leads young lawyers to focus on pleasing others rather than pleasing themselves. Starting with law school, there are all these hoops we’re trained to jump through that lead through clerkships and associate life and partnership, and then one day we stop and realize, “Wait, I don’t even want to do this!”

Some of my clients don’t even know where to begin in defining success for themselves. One way to craft what success looks like is to start with an exploration of values. We know that there’s a lot of evidence that when we’re living and working aligned with our values, this can have an impact on our mood, behavior, and even improve resilience. I help my clients uncover whether they are working aligned with their values; and, if not, how do we begin to close the gap? When we’re inauthentic and unmotivated, our productivity and confidence lag. When we’re working aligned with our values, we have a lot more energy and impact, which leads to more congruent choices, a deeper connection to the “flow state,” and even more money.

What is the “Leave Law, Love Life” program?

This is a special offer beyond my regular individual and small group coaching. It’s an exclusive opportunity for five lawyers to receive a year of one-on-one personal development coaching that incorporates a strategic career counseling component as well. I provide all of the tools I have developed over the years as a lawyer, coach, and recruiter. In this program, I’m a guide to help my clients develop a blueprint and action plan to achieve what they want, including the steps on how to get there.

This program is for lawyers who feel trapped, have had enough, and are ready for real change, not just looking for a Band-Aid approach. The Leave Law, Love Life program is about creating new habits, actions, and a shift in mindset that transform your life in incredible ways. We start with small micro-steps, curated just for you. These micro-steps are sustainable and enjoyable. You begin to gain courage, and then confidence in the choices you’re making. You’ll start to get a taste of what it would be like to have a different life and examine the beliefs that are holding you back from having that life.

Why is well-being so important?

The National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being released some pretty scary statistics in their 2017 report around substance use, suicide, suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, and mental health. It was a wake-up call for our industry to see that if we continue this way our profession will not be sustainable. Most states now have task forces or commissions dedicated to these issues and law schools are slowly starting to address them in their curricula. And while there are some progressive law firms incorporating well-being into their personal development programming (and even more since COVID), there are many more who are not.

But, even those initiatives don’t necessarily speak to the lawyers who are just plain miserable and burned out – people who are on the slow burn to anxiety, unhappiness, or chronic health issues, but not at a “crisis” level. I was one of those lawyers and many of my clients are too. These are the people who, if they continue on the current path, are likely to develop the more severe problems that can plague the quality of their work and the profession overall. While there’s been some effort to address it, it hasn’t been fast enough. It‘s still a challenge for law firms to accept the business case that a solid and powerful well-being program for lawyers can improve productivity, quality of work, and employee retention.

What advice do you have for someone who’s considering leaving the law altogether?

We’re in what I often call the “concrete jungle” as lawyers – we’re all acting the same way, saying the same things, dressing the same way, so it doesn’t appear that there’s a way out. We think it has to require long hours, grinding it out, and a general dissatisfaction with life. I believe it’s important for lawyers who feel trapped to know that there are ways to earn a great income while being intellectually challenged without staying in law in the traditional sense.

First, ask yourself, “what would it feel like to leave?” Sit quietly for five minutes and think big! You don’t have to worry about the how or take any steps right now. Simply notice how it feels in your body when you think about the possibility. Does your body feel relaxed or tense? What emotions are you experiencing? Fear, excitement, joy? What can you imagine your days would be like?

Next, talk to someone who has made the transition out of traditional law. Get their feedback on the process. What worked for them? What didn’t?

Then, write down a list of your top three values and ask yourself, “Am I taking actions on a daily basis aligned with my values?” If there’s a gap, then what is one tiny step you can take to start to close the gap? Is merely switching jobs enough to align with your values? Now write down three things that you’re naturally good at and three things you’re passionate about. Start to connect the dots across values, passions, and strengths. How can these be combined and translated into a job or a business? And would that new role bring greater meaning into your life, reduce your stress, or create more happiness?

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2KxFPa6) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Lateral Link. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

As salaries continue to rise across the country, and junior attorneys reap the benefits, we are seeing some skepticism about bill rates from corporate clients, who are sophisticated buyers of legal services and are sensitive to costs passing through to them. Firms are becoming ever more crafty with their bottom line and coming up with creative solutions to allay these concerns.

In 2014, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Lewis announced a joint secondment program, through which junior attorneys would join Chase’s in-house team for two years before joining Morgan Lewis as seasoned third-year associates. The program is a resounding win for all parties involved. Chase gets Morgan Lewis talent at a discounted rate, working exclusively on their matters. When the associate rejoins the firm later, they will continue to work on Chase matters under the auspices of Morgan Lewis, though now intimately versed and trained in the company’s affairs. The firm invests fewer resources in training and still retains the attorneys after two years, mitigating some of the pushback from client’s billing concerns. The attorney does sacrifice several thousand a year, but in return, they gain substantial experience usually limited to more seasoned attorneys.

In the current legal landscape, the real winners are the attorneys. With the logjam at partnership not relenting anytime soon, the race for these scarce partnership spots has become fierce. The extra experience afforded these junior attorneys can be substantial, potentially setting them on a path for partnership that would have otherwise been closed off.  Additionally, with attorneys being more cognizant of their exit plan from Biglaw than ever, this arrangement provides them with the opportunity to test the in-house waters and cultivate contacts, should they find themselves looking down the barrel of a non-partner track come their eighth year.

The experience also does not lock an attorney into any one firm. Chase’s matters are diffuse across many firms throughout the Am Law 200 — like most other large corporations — making a lateral move potentially even easier, as your expertise in one company’s matters allows your firm to potentially service even more work for them (or at the very least, seamlessly slot you in).

While secondments are unlikely to become the new standard for the legal industry, it is likely that firms will get more creative with similar programs or other alternative fee arrangements as they look to both cultivate their crop of junior attorneys and keep their clients happy.  Such an arrangement is one of the few times where every party involved benefits. While secondments are a familiar intracompany program, especially internationally, time will tell if the shifting legal market will push firms to establish more intercompany secondments.

In 2009, we launched our Bridge Year program during the height of the recession. The program was essentially a stop-gap secondment program. The attorneys who completed the program gained invaluable experience and many of them are now partners. If you have any questions about constructing a secondment program, feel free to contact us for help.

# March Madness Is A Fun Time At Many Law Firms
## More law firms should embrace the March Madness season.

Those who know me know that I am not really into sports. Even though I am 6’9’’, I was never really good at basketball (although every coach I ever had tried their best make me their project!). However, March Madness is upon us, and pretty much everyone gets in on the action when it is March Madness season. Many lawyers and law firms also participate in March Madness, and this can be a fun time for attorneys and staff to interact with one another in a nonlegal way. More law firms should embrace the March Madness season since this can improve morale around an office and present a fun distraction to the monotony that pervades many law firms.

Numerous law firms across the country have March Madness pools in which attorneys and staff fill out brackets and compete to see who can most accurately predict the results of the games. Of course, everyone should try to ensure that said March Madness pools are operated legally (as an attorney, I would be remiss if I did not mention this!). In addition, such pools should be open to everyone at firms and not just a select group. I have been at firms at which pools were either open to attorneys or staff and not both, and this is not good for the team mentality that should be present at law firms. However, with a few considerations in mind, law firm March Madness pools can be a fun activity for attorneys and staff.

The first time I ever became involved in a law firm March Madness pool was when I was a first-year Biglaw associate. At that shop, all of the first-years had to manage the pool, which was kind of a huge undertaking. Even though the March Madness pool was run through one of those online platforms, some of the attorneys and staff handwrote their picks on physical brackets.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

As a result, my colleagues and myself needed to input all of the handwritten brackets into the online system to ensure all of the scores were properly calculated. This was no easy task since some of the handwriting was really bad and no one wanted to input the wrong pick and have a partner angry at them for inadvertently making them lose the March Madness pool. In addition, some of the brackets only had a first name on them so we had to investigate who had submitted the bracket to us to be inputted, and this was a pretty good way to learn more about people at the firm. Also, the first-years had to be relatively well informed about basketball to answer questions from attorneys and staff about who was facing who in the tournament.

Over the years, attorneys and staff at firms at which I worked got into the March Madness spirit in ways beyond just participating in pools. A few of the March Madness games took place during ordinary business hours, and sometimes, attorneys and staff would be at firms later in the evenings when March Madness games were playing on TV. On a few occasions, employees at firms stopped what they were doing and everyone watched the March Madness games, off the clock of course. This was a fun experience for people in the office since it was pretty rare for individuals at that firm to get together socially, and watching March Madness games was the closest thing that many people in the office got to social interaction with one another.

Another fun aspect of March Madness was people at law firms supporting the colleges and law schools they attended who were in the March Madness tournament. Many lawyers have two alma maters, one for undergraduate and another for law school. My college did not have the best athletic program, and one testament to this fact was that I was a varsity athlete at my college! However, my law school alma mater (Georgetown) made the March Madness tournament a handful of times while I was working at various law firms, and it was fun to have a rooting interest in a team around the office.

There was an attorney I worked with who went to Villanova, and his team also made the tournament. I kept insisting that this attorney went to Villa”nofun” in order to convey the best trash talk I could around the office. Other attorneys with whom I worked represented their alma maters at work by wearing uniforms and other swag from their schools, and it was fun to see attorneys and staff expressing themselves in a more personal way.

In any event, from my own experiences, lawyers and law firms should embrace March Madness. Not only do March Madness festivities allow attorneys and staff to bond socially, but they also improve morale around an office.

# Not All Am Law 100 Firms Were Operating At Peak Performance In 2021
## Revenue might have been up for all firms, but it could have been even higher at some.

There is about 20% of the market that are not performing as well as they would like. That is more the case with the Second Hundred and the smaller firms, but there is a small group of Am Law 100 firms in there as well. The question for those firms is what is the path that makes the most sense for them.

— Kent Zimmermann, a legal consultant at Zeughauser Group, commenting on the [Biglaw firms that underperformed in 2021](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-am-law-100-caught-a-wave-in-2021-but-sustaining-the-ride-will-be-a-challenge/) compared to other firms in the Am Law 100, some of which set unprecedented financial records.

# The Customer Is Not Always Right, But Is Still The Client
## The typical sales adage of deferring to the customer’s judgment does not apply to us. But loyalty to the client’s needs remains our paramount concern.

Many older lawyers lament how our profession has turned into a business. Or at least most do — some of my more experienced colleagues think the profession was too limited and not enough of a business in the past. The cliche in business is that the customer is always right. If the customer says the chicken is overdone, he’s right and you, chef, are wrong. If the customer says the television does not work the way it should, she is right, and you, the electronic salesperson, are wrong.

It’s not like that with us lawyers. We’re supposed to be experts. Customers — clients — come to us all the time and can be woefully wrong. Indeed, sometimes the reason a client hires a [firm like ours](https://balestrierefariello.com/) is because they got into some dispute or some mess and, yes, when looking back, we can agree they did something wrong. Telling a client that they were right when, in fact, they did something wrong, can be exactly the wrong thing to do. We’re not here to stroke our clients’ egos or make them feel good about themselves (at least, trial lawyers like [my collegues and I](https://balestrierefariello.com/people/john-g-balestriere/) are not). We’re here to counsel and fight for them and hopefully do justice. And sometimes that means identifying exactly how the client was wrong so that we can try to make things right.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
However, while we are not salespeople, nor present simply to flatter a client’s ego, that does not mean that we are not in a service industry. While some litigators do forget this, we are, in fact, service professionals. Our cases can be cool and fun and all that. But there are clients behind every single cool case. And we must be supremely loyal to those clients. Loyalty does not mean telling the client she is right, just like good parenting does not mean telling our children they can get whatever they want (as much as clients paying us money want to be told that they are right, and goodness knows teenagers are certain in only the way the inexperienced can be that they are completely right about everything). Loyalty to a client, akin to good parenting, means setting aside the self to discern what we truly believe to be in the client’s best interests, counseling the client to see what is in her best interests, and then seeking those goals.

The lawyer-parent analogy of course breaks down here, in that while parents may be obligated to do exactly what their children state they do not want, we as lawyers cannot so do. We need client consent for our actions. But my view is that we need to obtain consent for what we believe to be in the client’s best interest. It may be hard, and maybe later on we even realize we are wrong. But I find we almost always get it right, and then loyalty means fighting like hell for the client.

We are different than salespeople in that it may well be our job to tell the client she is wrong. Unlike salespeople, we are not supposed to be loyal to the pitch, but to the client. Aside from maintaining our integrity, loyalty to the client is the supreme virtue of a trial lawyer.

Last week, furloughed (and later suspended) Biglaw associate Colinford Mattis and housing attorney Urooj Rahman, both charged for their [involvement with a Molotov cocktail attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-new-york-molotov-cocktail-attack/) on a police vehicle in Brooklyn, New York, were due to be [released on $250,000 bond](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-molotov-cocktail-attack-released-on-250k-bond/?rf=1). On Friday afternoon, that all changed thanks to a decision made by the Second Circuit.

Oral arguments were presented before a panel of Second Circuit judges on Friday morning, and by the end of the business day, both Mattis and Rahman were taken into custody by U.S. Marshals. Here’s more from the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2020/06/05/lawyers-accused-of-throwing-molotov-cocktail-in-brooklyn-protests-return-to-jail-as-2nd-circuit-grants-stay/):

U.S. Attorney David Kessler told the panel that Rahman and Mattis must be detained amid ongoing protests in Brooklyn, given that their alleged crime took place early in the morning of May 30 during widespread protests related to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

A witness also accused Rahman of offering a Molotov cocktail to people protesting in the area, according to prosecutors, and a completed incendiary device and materials to make more were allegedly found in Mattis’ van.

Rahman and Mattis’ attorneys emphasized that neither had ever been arrested before. Both Mattis, who has been suspended from his job as an associate at Pryor Cashman pending the resolution of the criminal proceeding, and Rahman, a tenants’ attorney in Bronx Housing Court, have stable lives and support from their families and friends, their lawyers said.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Kessler noted in his brief that “[e]ach defendant is a licensed attorney who has attended prestigious universities and law schools. As such, the defendants were well aware of the severity of their criminal conduct when they decided to hurl a Molotov cocktail at an NYPD vehicle and to incite others to do the same. They knew their acts endangered the NYPD officers and protesters on the street, as well as their own futures, and the defendants were undeterred.”

An expedited appeal schedule has been set up, with first briefs due to the Second Circuit on June 10.

# Carlos Ghosn Lashes Out At Latham & Watkins
## When in doubt, blame the lawyers.

If you went into a coma on Christmas day, and just woke up now, the story of Carlos Ghosn is probably the one you’d have the hardest time believing. Sure, Donald Trump ordering the drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani is certainly the scariest — and has taken the U.S. to the brink of war — but put a megalomaniac of questionable stability in charge of the world’s most powerful military, and these things just might happen. But the Ghosn story? That reads like the third act of a heist movie.
For those the somehow missed the story, Ghosn is the former Nissan chairman who was under house arrest in Japan, awaiting trail for financial wrongdoings. However, [in a daring escape](https://dealbreaker.com/2020/01/carlos-ghosn-escapes), the former auto boss reportedly absconded in a double-base case. That’s right, his wife organized a “concert” which saw ex-special forces soldiers pose as musicians bringing their “music equipment” by Japanese guards. Ghosn’s route to freedom included a stop in Turkey before landing in Lebanon, where he is a citizen.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Today Ghosn, who’s long protested his legal woes as part of a “rigged” justice system, held a press conference in Lebanon. There [he blasted the Biglaw firm](https://biglawbusiness.com/u-s-legal-firm-hired-by-nissan-becomes-target-of-ghosns-wrath) Latham & Watkins, blaming them, along with the government and Nissan, for his prosecution:

“It is the prosecutors aided and abetted by petty and vindictive individuals in the government and Nissan and the L&W [Latham & Watkins] law firm who are destroying Japan’s reputation on the global stage.”

Latham’s acted as Nissan’s outside counsel and conducted the company’s internal investigation into Ghosn’s dealings. This isn’t the first time that representation has come under fire:

Latham & Watkins previously was criticized by Nissan general counsel Ravinder Passi, who raised concerns that the company’s investigation into Ghosn was marred by conflicts of interest, the Wall Street Journal reported in September. Passi’s objections centered on the relationship between the firm and Hari Nada, a senior vice president at Nissan who reached a plea deal with prosecutors for his actions in the scandal, the newspaper said.

# Biglaw Firm Closing Texas Outpost

Akin Gump is leaving Bat City, I guess it was just too weird for the Biglaw giant.

The firm has confirmed it’ll be leaving Austin at the end of June, while maintaining its other Texas offices in Dallas, Houston, Fort Worth, Longview, and San Antonio. According to an Above the Law tipster, once two of the intellectual property partners in the state’s capital announced they were moving to Vinson & Elkins, the decision was made to vacate the premises.

Akin’s Austin presence has always been small, with only five attorneys stationed there. When reached for comment, a firm spokesperson responded:

Akin Gump has maintained a small presence in Austin to accommodate two partners in our IP practice who have now announced they are leaving the firm. With their departure there is no longer a need for us to remain in Austin. We will continue to maintain our thriving presence throughout Texas and a top tier firm wide IP practice, which includes more than 50 lawyers across the country. We wish our partners much success in their future endeavors.

In addition to Michael Simons and Fred Williams, the partners who already have their exit strategy worked out, we hope that things work out for the other attorneys and support staff impacted by the office’s closing.

# Is There An End In Sight For The Booming Legal Market?

We all realized that demand was up across the industry, but the magnitude of the 2021 spike is significant.

The Thomson Reuters Institute and the Georgetown University Law Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession released the [2022 Report on the State of the Legal Market](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/state-of-the-legal-market-2022/) today, and mostly confirmed that the state of the legal market is… pretty darn good.

You have to go back to 2007 — 14 years earlier — to find comparable demand growth. That year ended with the economy just about to teeter over the cliff into massive recession, so it wasn’t all good news back then. Still, as the market recovers from the aftermath of COVID (we are going to have an AFTERmath, right?), the market should enjoy healthy growth for a little bit longer than the December 31, 2007 market got to see.

Of course with great demand comes a great scramble for resources. The hot lateral market and booming compensation numbers followed:

The significant growth in lawyer headcount during 2021 offset the increase in demand to moderate any growth in productivity. As can be seen in Figure 8, on a YTD basis through November 2021, productivity improved as compared to 2020, but was only 0.3% above the average daily demand per lawyer in 2019. As can also be seen, Am Law 100 firms fared a bit better in this regard than other segments of the market.

This figure doesn’t seem all that troubling. Productivity had probably plateaued as a matter of reasonable demand on a human being’s time and energy already. Until new tools improve the amount a lawyer can accomplish in the same time period, it was too much to ask that lawyers would squeeze out more work. And, indeed, hours are still only slightly ahead of where they’ve been lately.

And while direct expenses were up 8.8 percent and overhead grew 5.1 percent, we needn’t rend our garments on behalf of the partnership just yet.



Though a prolonged talent war could leave some firms in the cold. High turnover is costly, and paying top dollar to add a few more marginal hours can hit a limit:

This data leads inevitably to the question of whether the approach to the talent war that is being taken by most firms is sustainable for the long term. In response to the fierce competition for talent, firms are spending huge amounts of money and putting their profits at increasing risk for fairly modest returns — at least if you consider the real costs of high levels of lawyer turnover.
The intriguing question thus becomes, whether refocusing recruitment strategies to emphasize factors other than (or in addition to) compensation might not prove more productive?

We’ve seen [talk about this before](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaws-choices-in-the-war-for-talent-more-flexibility-or-more-money/). I continue to be skeptical that the top of the market will pull back any time soon. If anything, these pressures seem likely to reset the pre-COVID status quo where the Biglaw elite continue to outpace other segments simply because they can afford it. At some point in the not so distant future, other segments will reach the limit when it comes to keeping up with the elite firms and have to find alternative incentives or admit defeat in the talent war. How well they navigate that juncture will define their next decade.

And maybe the bundle of preferences colloquially referred to as The Great Resignation will hold up. As the report notes:

Emerging from the pandemic, the attitudes of associates toward life and work have clearly changed, and the loyalty of associates to their law firms has waned. About 27% of the 3,700 associates from 77 Am Law 200 firms surveyed by The American Lawyer for its 2021 Midlevel Associates Survey, said they would leave their current law firm for higher compensation. More importantly, 60% of respondents said they would consider leaving their firm for a better work-life balance.

How sticky are those beliefs? Everyone talks about wanting a better work-life balance, but how many will cast that vote with their feet? I’d like to see how many of that 60 percent still haven’t left Biglaw by next year. Because there are opportunities for a better life right now…

Yet somehow Biglaw keeps adding headcount.

Many Biglaw firms are not as transparent as numerous similarly-sized companies.  As this website has detailed at length in a number of prior articles, partnership compensation is oftentimes a “black box” among top firms, and the machinations of many Biglaw shops are not thoroughly understood.  However, many Biglaw firms are far more transparent than numerous smaller shops, and smaller firms can actually learn some lessons about transparency from Biglaw firms.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, my firm kept associates in the dark about numerous matters.  However, much information about the firm was made public.  For instance, the profits per partner of the firm and other financial information was freely shared.  In addition, there was an associate-partner committee that ensured that associates were apprised of major developments at the firm.

My firm also hosted “State of the Firm” meetings twice a year, during which management would provide associates with vital information about the operations of the firm.  We were not allowed to take notes or record the information, but these meetings included many details about the firm.  At these gatherings, we were all told the revenue and expenses of our firm for the previous six months.  In addition, bonuses were announced at these meetings, and everyone knew how much money they would be paid based on their class year and the number of hours they billed.  Furthermore, these meetings often discussed plans that the firm had to expand or obtain new work.

However, when I worked at smaller shops, management almost never provided important information about the operations of the firm.  Indeed, people were paid vastly different sums of money for somewhat arbitrary reasons, and no one was transparent about compensation.  In addition, there were never any meetings about the finances of the firm or substantive discussions about where management hoped to take the firm in the coming years.

In fact, the only time I became aware of the finances of one of the smaller firms at which I worked was because I was involved in that firm’s application for malpractice insurance.  After reading materials needed to support our firm’s application for insurance, I was shocked to discover that only a few of the firm’s partners were equity partners.  I was also amazed at the amount of revenue that was generated by that shop, and other information that was contained in our application.

In addition, each of the smaller shops at which I worked never had a formalized mechanism through which associates and partners could talk about matters that were relevant to the firm.  Indeed, there was never an associate-partner committee at any of the smaller shops at which I worked.  The partners professed to have an “open door” policy inviting associates to talk about any issues they wanted.  However, it was apparent that partners did not appreciate associates seeking additional information or rocking the boat in any way.

One of the smaller firms at which I worked did decide to hold one “State of the Firm” meeting similar to the gatherings I had experienced at a larger shop.  However, this meeting was completely devoid of any of the “nuts and bolts” that had been told to us at such meetings in Biglaw.  Indeed, firm management just reiterated the same broad marketing slogans that could be found on our website or our firm’s strategic plan when detailing the path the firm expected to take in the coming years.  The joke at the meeting was that the only useful information we received was the name of the boss’s dog!  When someone tried to find out more information about changes to the transit reimbursement policy, she was met with hostility, even though this was a pretty minor issue.  Everyone knew that they should not ask substantive questions to obtain more information about the operations of the firm.

Smaller firms can realize a number of benefits if they are more transparent with associates like many Biglaw firms are with their attorneys.  Understanding more information about a firm can increase the amount of buy-in associates have towards a shop and can benefit morale immeasurably.  In addition, greater transparency can convince associates to go along with unpopular changes at a firm, since they have a better understanding of why those changes were made.

One time, when I worked at a smaller firm, I traveled with one of the senior partners by subway to pitch our firm to some contacts I had made.  During our subway ride, the partner told me about how hard it was to manage a firm, and that there were various financial risks to operating a shop.  He told me that his name was on the firm’s multimillion-dollar office lease, and that if there was ever any shortage in cash flow, they might have to rely on lines of credits to meet payroll.  This partner memorably told me that he was the last person at the firm to be paid, and if there wasn’t enough money, he might not receive any funds at all.  This conversation moved me, and I never complained about money at that firm again.  After learning this information, I understood the tribulations that the partners endured to operate that shop, and I appreciated being told these details.

In the end, although Biglaw firms still hide certain information, many Biglaw shops are more transparent than you think, especially compared to smaller firms.  And smaller law firms can realize a number of benefits from being more transparent to associates.

# Biglaw Associate's Ex-Boyfriend Sentenced For Trading On Insider Info Obtained While She Was Working From Home

Trading on insider information never, ever ends well for anyone — especially if you’re trading on [ill-begotten nonpublic information from your then-girlfriend](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/ex-boyfriend-of-biglaw-associate-arrested-for-insider-trading-wonder-where-he-allegedly-got-all-that-nonpublic-info/), who at the time just so happened to be a Biglaw associate working from home during the pandemic.

Seth Markin, a former FBI trainee, was arrested and charged with insider trading in July 2022, accused of “abus[ing] his relationship of trust and confidence” with his ex-girlfriend, a law firm associate, to make trades ahead of a major pharmaceutical M&A deal.

In December 2023, Markin pleaded guilty to the charges, and last week, he was sentenced to 15 months behind bars. According to prosecutors, Markin illicitly obtained information from his then-girlfriend on Merck & Co.’s pending $1.85 billion acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics. Markin, together with a friend, Brandon Wong, made $1.4 million in profits thanks to trading on that inside information.

Markin’s ex, an associate at Covington & Burling, the firm that represented Merck, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. How did Markin obtain the insider information? The [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2024/03/14/big-law-associates-ex-boyfriend-sentenced-to-15-months-for-trading-on-firms-deal-info/) has the details:

The DOJ’s indictment of Markin detailed that the associate, who was working from home due to the pandemic, “had to take confidential work calls from her apartment, sometimes on speakerphone, and also kept work documents such as binders, notes, and legal pads out in the open in her apartment.”

The associate … “trusted that [Markin] would not look through her confidential work materials” and gave him a key fob to access her building, the DOJ said.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams offered a statement on the matter, saying, “Seth Markin betrayed the trust of his then-girlfriend when he misappropriated confidential information, traded based on that information, and tipped several friends and family members.”

On top of being sentenced to spend time behind bars, Markin was ordered to forfeit more than $82,000 as well as serving three years of supervised release. The SEC has filed a related civil enforcement action against him.

According to 2019 financial data collected by ALM, which Biglaw firm’s gross revenue increased to $669.7 million in 2019, up 5.5 percent despite losing a group of environmental attorneys and a group of financial services attorneys and closing the firm’s Austin and Bay Area offices in 2019?

Hint: Firm leadership said, “The overriding and primary reason for that improvement has been executing a better plan to attract more deals and more good clients.” He continued, “We had a number of new private equity funds as well as a number of new family offices and sponsors last year. That grows the revenue, which improves [profits per equity partner and nonequity compensation].”

# How To Make It Big In Biglaw
## Five steps to getting the job you've always wanted in Biglaw.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/08/AdobeStock_356988154-scaled.jpeg)We at [Kinney Recruiting](http://bit.ly/2JrNyE4) know that making it big in Biglaw takes more than just experience and qualifications. Some of our most successful placements have been people who were less brainy and more people-skilled. Similarly, it seems like the differentiating factor between the people who progress through the Biglaw ranks and those who don’t isn’t always brainpower but rather self-confidence and unparalleled people skills. This got us thinking: What does our experience tell us about the best tips for getting and staying with the Biglaw elite? Here are our top five tips for making it big in Biglaw:

Step 1: Focus your College Career

Starting in undergrad and through law school, have an idea of what your goals are. If it’s getting into a top 10 law school or joining a top 10 firm, keep in mind that your grades and GPA are going to matter. Sure, everyone wants the typical college experience, but sometimes you have to think of the big picture. If you want to graduate at the top of your class, you’re going to need to spend some time (maybe a lot of time) in a quiet place, alone, working. And when you’re not studying, you should be thinking about what area of law you want to work in. While in law school, explore the type of law that interests you through your internships. Having a job offer before you graduate with your JD is key, so take the time to figure out exactly what direction to steer your career.

Step 2: Learn a Language

With so many firms going international, and remote positions becoming increasingly popular, being fluent in a second language is a huge advantage. It’s naive to think that big firms these days are only working with English-speakers. You will have the opportunity to use most languages in the course of your work, and if you are working in Asia for example, you will absolutely need to speak the local language to converse with clients. That’s why we recommend you learn a language. The truth is that native English speakers who have actually learned to speak a foreign language well enough to easily and fluently converse in the language are often more interesting, worldly, and self-confident than those who haven’t bothered. As such, they perform better in interviews. Better performance in interviews means more offers. Done.

Step 3: Network

Ah, yes. The age-old idea that “it’s all about who you know.” Well, try arguing that it’s not about who you know to a recruiter or any lawyer out there who has actually achieved a meaningful partnership (not service partner but REAL partner). In the legal industry, all deals are based on relationships. As recruiters, we have to form valuable relationships with firms so we know whether or not a candidate will be a good fit. My advice? Make every meeting worthwhile and stay in touch with the people you meet. If you are a candidate of ours or seeking to be one, and if you know people who might matter at organizations that are large consumers of legal services, tell us about those connections. We can decide together how much of that information to trot out for potential employers and when in the process to do that, if at all. Many factors will come into play during this process. When looking at laterals, some firms are spooked by associates who appear to have connections and a desire to develop business, while others welcome them.

Step 4: Perfect your Interview Skills & Be a Good Fit

How well you fit is everything. This comes down to one fundamental question: Does the interviewer see himself/herself in you? I don’t mean literally, but does he/she meet you and think, “This person appears to me like I would want to appear in his/her shoes.” A weak handshake, not recognizing social cues, and a never-ending story are all things that interviewers will remember in a negative way because they betray lack of confidence. We do what we can to prepare candidates so that bad things will not happen at the pivotal time. Our advice in a nutshell: remain professional while also being conversational; think about how you are being seen, and try to do just enough of the talking to keep the conversation moving, no more. Sound daunting? Here’s the solution: practice; be mindful of your tone of voice, how long you’re speaking, your body language, how you’re dressed. But not only do you need to practice, you also need to study. You should know the firm, but you should also know some background about the person you’re interviewing. When you know about someone’s history, you’ll be able to establish a connection, thus making you a more memorable candidate. And when you’re more memorable (in a good way), your chances of landing a job increase.

We believe in interview preparation. Some of us, to be honest, would not interview all that well ourselves without preparation. But many of us have worked in elite firms and we regularly interact with senior partners in law firms now. So we have figured it out. And we at Kinney are always willing to walk through questions with our candidates and provide constructive feedback on the basis of this experience. It’s better to make a mistake in a conversation with a recruiter or friend than one with a hiring manager.

Lastly, don’t forget to stay excited and remember to show it. As legal recruiters, we’ve seen perfect-on-paper candidates make no progress because they think the only thing that matters is experience, qualifications and skills. Showing enthusiasm during job interviews is not just about asking the right questions and sounding smart, it’s the first step in building a relationship with a potential employer and a glimpse into the mutual cultural fit.

Step 5: Don’t be Hasty

Yes, everyone would like to land their dream job right out of college and live happily ever after, but that’s rarely how it works. Just like every other industry, you have to work your way up to get where you want to be. The point I’m trying to make is: Don’t jump the gun too soon. Obviously, if you’re unhappy in the area of law you chose and there’s no room to change directions in your current firm, by all means, find a new firm. What I want to iterate is that when you’ve been in law school for three or four years, your first job in a firm can seem exhausting. And to be honest, the legal industry can be exhausting. But there’s also a transition period to get used to the work you’re doing. Try to stay where you are for the first few years because jumping around from firm to firm can be a resume-killer, and it could make you hard to place in the future. It’s usually best to stick it out and wait for the prize — the job at the firm where you’ve always wanted to work.

Overall, when it comes to Biglaw, fit and patience are key. To get invited to join a top law firm is a huge deal, and not easy by any means. It takes years of academic preparation, but it also usually takes a level of achievement in the social arena that is often overlooked by young candidates, especially if you are to move up to partner. But, if you take the time, you are not so smug that you can’t be trained, and you are focused on what you want to achieve, you just might make it happen with the right help!

Imagine running a law practice where technology blends seamlessly with your expertise, creating client experiences that no competitors can match.

A smartfirm does just that — strategically using software and automation to boost efficiency and streamline operations, allowing for a laser-focus on practicing law.

A “smartfirm” is a law firm that leverages technology, data, and innovative strategies to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and client service. They utilize cutting-edge technological tools and processes to streamline operations, manage information, and deliver legal services. Whether you’re a solo practitioner or work for a large firm, this playbook will give you the tools and strategies needed to thrive in today’s rapidly evolving legal landscape.

“A smartfirm is a law firm that is incredibly efficient and utilizes technology to run every possible aspect of their workflow to laser focus on client relationships and effectively practice law.” 

– Matt Spiegel, Co-Founder and CEO of Lawmatics

##Section 1: Selecting the Right Legal Tech Tools for Your Practice
Technology has enabled the legal industry to automate processes and operate more like the business sector. By embracing technology, law firms can eliminate the risk of human error and streamline manual workflows that traditionally dominated large parts of a lawyer’s day. When evaluating and choosing legal tech tools, firms must pinpoint inefficiencies, recognize problems, and understand that no tool will solve every challenge.

A smartfirm embraces technology—[legal client relationship management (CRM) software](https://bit.ly/3RP6XFN), practice management software, document automation tools, electronic billing systems, virtual collaboration platforms—and incorporates it into its day-to-day operations to improve workflow, communication, and document management.

###The Role of Technology in Modern Law Firms
Technology integration in modern law firms has resulted in significant changes, changing how legal professionals function, collaborate, and serve clients. From streamlining administrative tasks to improving research capabilities and enhancing client service, technology is an indispensable tool for legal professionals.

###CRM & Intake Software
A legal CRM helps firms manage client intake by attracting and retaining clients while lawyers focus on practicing law. The result: more repeat business, increased client referrals, and improved law firm revenue.

###Case Management
[Case management technology](https://bit.ly/3ZNt2qc) provides firms of all sizes with one central location to track and store appointment scheduling, client data, case notes, client communication, and billing information to manage their cases.

###Practice Management
Practice management platforms help attorneys perform many functions necessary to run their practices. Generally, this software will handle matter management, client management, task management, and more. 

“Running a smartfirm means working efficiently with technology to streamline processes and procedures.” 

– Erdal Turnacioglu, Owner, President and CEO, Erdal Employment Law

##Section 2: Client-Centered Vision
Growing law firms have a client-centered vision, meaning clients are at the center of the firm’s philosophy, operations, and ideas. Client-centered firms understand that clients are the primary reason for their existence, and therefore, they will do anything necessary to keep prospective, current, and past clients satisfied.

A smartfirm prioritizes the needs of its clients by offering [secure online portals](https://bit.ly/3QbRC0G) to access case updates, use client relationship management (CRM) systems to maintain better client relationships, and employ alternative fee arrangements or legal service packages to provide superior value.

###Understanding the Importance of Client-Centered Services
Exceptional client service is crucial because it elevates the firm from one that merely provides legal services to one that clients will recommend, positively review, and return to for future assistance.

###Building Strong Client Relationships Through Effective Communication
Effective communication is one of the best ways a law firm can build strong client relationships. Smartfirms use the following technology to boost client communication through automation:

- Email & SMS. [Short messaging service (SMS) software](https://bit.ly/3PRUi21) sends an immediate notification whenever a client emails, texts, or calls a law firm.
- Client portals. A client portal is a tool that gives legal clients access to messages, documents, forms, calendar events, tasks, and other information shared with them.
- Automated follow-ups. Legal CRMs use data to trigger automated follow-ups, ensuring that all clients receive prompt replies.
###Designing a Client-Centered Onboarding Process
A [client-centered onboarding process](https://bit.ly/3LQPY1N) will help establish a strong relationship, put them at ease, and increase retention. Here are some of the most critical steps:

- Marketing/messaging. Effective client onboarding ensures that marketing and messaging based on pre-set criteria are sent automatically at precisely the right time.
- Online self-service booking. When firms utilize a client-centered approach, clients can schedule meetings themselves to keep everyone on the same page—on time.
- Follow-ups. Workflow automation software allows firms to follow up with personalized messaging tailored to individual clients.
- Document sharing. A client-centered process allows legal teams to request documents and enables clients to upload them directly into the file.
###Customizing Legal Services to Meet Client Needs
Firms that customize legal services and fee arrangements according to client needs allow them to choose the level and scope of the representation desired and provide control over the cost of the services rendered. Here are some ways law firms can provide clients (and themselves) with increased payment predictability:

- Capped pricing. Cap hourly billings for a given case, project, or service. 
- Packages.  Provide a single, fixed price for bundled services. 
- Flat rate services. Offer flat-fee menus for select services. 
- Billing solutions. [Time and billing software for law firms](https://bit.ly/46LW1g7) automates each step of the billing process and delivers accurate invoices in one click.

# There's Now (Allegedly) Videotape In The Latest Biglaw Lawsuit Twist

The gender discrimination lawsuit filed against Chadbourne & Parke is getting crazy. We’ve documented the [allegations in the case](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/); partner Kerrie Campbell claims women partners are paid less than their male counterparts and there is a pattern of gender discrimination. Now Campbell has filed an amended complaint, which[ added a named plaintiff](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-pay-discrimination-case-adds-a-new-plaintiff/) — and contains a weird allegation.

Part of the amended complaint adds a slew of individual named defendants, including Chadbourne’s litigation head, Abbe Lowell. The paragraph in the complaint detailing Lowell’s alleged involvement dips into the bizarre — it features Nelson Mandela, petty vandalism, and videotape. You’ve just got to read it yourself:

After Campbell filed the Complaint, upon information and belief, Defendant Abbe Lowell, head of Chadbourne’s Litigation Department, tore down a postcard on Campbell’s office wall containing the words of Nelson Mandela: “It will forever remain an accusation and a challenge to all men and women of conscience that it took as long as it has before all of us stood up to say: ‘enough is enough.’” In its place, upon information and belief, Lowell affixed a large smiley face graphic on Campbell’s office wall. Subsequent to this juvenile and harassing action, Lowell was video recorded engaging in further retaliatory acts against Campbell. Thumbing his nose at Mandela’s call for equality, Lowell placed an 8.5 by 11 inch cartoon figure of a fat man wearing a bowler hat next to the smiley face graphic in an attempt to make a mockery of Mandela’s words. The message Lowell and Chadbourne conveyed to women at the Firm was clear—at this law firm, men run the show. Women at Chadbourne who refuse to smile in the face of gender inequality will suffer the same fate as Campbell.

That’s some weird, petty-ish right there (if true, natch). What purpose could this impromptu redecoration of Campbell’s office possibly serve? This is a law firm; let your briefs do the talking.

Here’s my takeaway: The complaint has so divided the firm you have pro- and anti-Campbell camps. I mean, someone allegedly shot a video when they thought something jacked up was going on. That isn’t someone who thinks everything is hunky-dory at the firm.

# Elon Musk Blames Hiring Biglaw Firm He Personally Hates On An 'Error' Because He Has No Idea What He's Doing

Never let it be said that Elon Musk doesn’t hold grudges. It was recently revealed that Perkins Coie entered an appearance on behalf of Musk’s personal plaything/social media network, Twitter. [This was news](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/twitter-hires-law-firm-denounced-by-ceo-elon-musk-2023-01-05/) because Musk doesn’t like Perkins Coie.

Back in December, Musk took aim at the Biglaw firm, and one of its partners [Michael Sussmann](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/michael-sussmann/). He ranted that he “isn’t using Perkins Coie” as outside counsel and urged others to join him in his boycott of the firm, saying, “No company should use them until they make amends for Sussmann’s attempt to corrupt a Presidential election.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
See, it’s acceptable free speech when *Musk* is encouraging a boycott of another business, but it somehow miraculously[ turns into free speech problem](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/world-cup-jonathan-turley-free-speech/) when others want to boycott Twitter. Got it.

Last May, Sussmann was predictably acquitted on charges he misled the FBI’s general counsel when talking to them about evidence linking the Trump Organization and a Russian-based bank, because he didn’t mention he also worked for the Clinton campaign. Of course, everyone in Washington knew Perkins Coie also represented the Clinton campaign. So, yeah, [the not-guilty verdict was anything but a shock](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/michael-sussmann-not-guilty-as-trumplands-great-stupid-hope-falls-predictably-flat/).

Perkins Coie has worked on cases on behalf of Twitter predating Musk’s ownership of the platform. But when confronted with the latest representation — on behalf of Twitter and former CEO Jack Dorsey in a case brought by a far-right activist banned from the site — Musk blamed his team, as [reported by](https://www.reuters.com/legal/elon-musk-says-twitter-staff-error-led-hiring-perkins-coie-law-firm-2023-01-06/) Reuters:

Musk’s email said hiring Perkins Coie was “an error on the part of a member of the Twitter team.”

“Perkins will not be representing Twitter on future cases,” he said.

It’s unclear whether Perkins Coie will continue their current representations or if Twitter will hire new counsel.

Musk has famously[ decimated the in-house legal team](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/if-only-he-were-as-good-at-maintaining-a-legal-department-as-he-was-at-racking-up-sec-charges/) at Twitter. Maybe if he cared as much about staffing his legal department as he does about personal vendettas, these sorts of “errors” wouldn’t happen.

# Paul Weiss Writes That Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar's Arguments Are A 'Hot Mess'

Far be it from Above the Law to discourage saucy legal writing. The profession can get pretty stuffy and could use a talented writer willing to inject a little fun into the proceedings. Why should judges [have all the fun](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/this-citation-by-justice-kagan-looks-a-little-bit-fishy/)? Or, more often, why should judges [try and fail](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/9th-circuit-judge-tries-to-be-funny-fails/) to have all the fun.

But even if an attorney is [showing off a lighter side](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/first-as-parody-then-as-free-speech-the-onion-goes-to-the-supreme-court-its-about-as-awesome-as-youd-suspect/), it’s still imperative that the writing remain professional and respectful. And it definitely needs to avoid careening into sexist tropes a mere four paragraphs in.

Unfortunately, Paul Weiss partner Kannon Shanmugam failed to cling to these rules.

Here’s our supplemental brief in Midwest ATC v. Badilla, on the immunity of military contractors, responding to the government’s brief (which was filed nearly a year after the Supreme Court’s invitation):[https://t.co/xYIIjh1bH3](https://t.co/xYIIjh1bH3)

— Kannon Shanmugam (@KannonShanmugam) [May 2, 2023](https://twitter.com/KannonShanmugam/status/1653446330365165568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

This gives all the appearance of a straightforward filing. But then you start reading the filing and…. Well, as Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern asked, “[Is this the first appearance of “hot mess” in a Supreme Court brief?](https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1653448163926196225?s=20)”



We’re going to go ahead and assume it is indeed the first. With any luck, it will also be the last. [UPDATE: We made that assumption because we did not have access to Westlaw, but in fact “hot mess” has appeared before at the Supreme Court, with Lisa Blatt’s cert reply in Romag Fasteners, Inc. v. Fossil, Inc., 140 S. Ct. 1492 (2020) (“At bottom, the pre-Lanham Act law is a hot mess.”). So laws have gotten the “hot mess” treatment. Perhaps this is just the first time someone has referred to the other party’s position — specifically the position of the Solicitor General of the United States — as a “hot mess” and let’s address whether or not this should be the last time that happens.]

Where to begin?

It’s disrespectful, sure. But it also projects weakness to try and poison the well before engaging directly with the substance of the brief. It’s also inviting the audience to approach the government’s brief with a sympathetic frame — the bar is set and if the original brief is even remotely reasonable, Shanmugam’s brief (and John Freedenberg of Goldberg Segalla is on this thing too) will reek of overreach.

Speaking of the audience… who is this even for? Justice Alito [loves some mean-spirited trolling](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/sam-alito-drops-prince-harry-diss-track-uses-b-side-to-champion-the-freedom-of-all-religions-to-worship-jesus-christ/), but somehow I don’t think he’s deep enough in the Project Runway canon to even understand what this reference is about. One suspects the clerks do, however. And they deeply appreciate [needlessly mean-spirited hijinks](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/law-school-students-just-saw-a-radical-shift-in-the-pathway-to-success/). It’s practically a right of passage.

But the most egregious aspect of this brief is its trafficking in sexist tropes. Would the brief be a “hot mess” — a term rooted in women’s fashion — if it weren’t written by a female solicitor general? Doubtless some Shanmugam defenders would say “yes,” but that puts a lot of strain on the reference. There’s a lot of work on the [gendered](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/love-is-blinds-jessica-and-the-gendered-history-of-the-hot-mess-jknlg6tt9) [roots](https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/real-hot-mess-sexist-branding-female-pop-stars/docview/1531890706/se-2) of “hot mess,” but without getting into the academic side of things, it just sounds wrong as a piece of modern American slang to apply this term in a masculine-coded setting. It’s as cringey as if someone tried to use “cojones” for a feminine-coded one.

Do you have any idea how easy it is to be insulting without being sexist? The brief could be “hot garbage” or a “tire fire” or “smooth trash” or “half-assed” or even “argle bargle.” There are just so many ways to get around this.

If this happened at oral argument, one could shrug it off as an in-the-moment failure to grasp the context of the phrase. But this is a brief. People edited this… repeatedly. Hours and hours of expensive hours were spent making sure no word appeared out of place. And presumably the lawyers devoted even more time to the decision to insert a slang insult into a Supreme Court brief to denigrate the Solicitor General of the United States. Even if you were inclined to grant some benefit of the doubt to the phrase “hot mess,” there’s not really any excuse to even approach the line of sexist language in a Supreme Court filing.

Unfortunately, this likely isn’t the last time this will come up. Lesser advocates than Shanmugam will feel emboldened to try their own hand at taking the highest profile female advocate in the country down a peg. Next time the government’s brief will be described as “shrill” or its arguments “hysterical.” Now that someone is successfully sneaking gendered insults in there, this is just going to get worse before it gets better.

# Will President Trump Be Hoisted With His Own Petard In Fighting The Media?

Floyd Abrams, delivering introductory remarks at Above the Law’s 2014 conference.

Sometimes President Donald Trump is his own worst enemy. Recall, for example, how “Muslim ban” comments from him and his advisers came back to haunt the Trump Administration when its travel ban got litigated in the courts. There’s a good argument that taking such comments into account when evaluating executive action [is improper](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/friday-night-fights-at-the-ninth-circuit/), but there’s no denying that this did, in fact, happen — that judges used Trump’s comments against him when reviewing his executive order on immigration.

Could a similar dynamic play out when it comes to President Trump’s ongoing war with the press? From the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/business/media/floyd-abrams-sees-trumps-anti-media-tweets-as-double-edged-swords.html?_r=0) (which far from [“failing,”](http://deadline.com/2017/03/donald-trump-twitter-tweet-new-york-times-fox-news-hillary-clinton-1202054647/) as Trump suggests, is actually flourishing in his administration):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Trump’s] Twitter trail could be a gift to lawyers for the news industry during leak investigations into articles that made the president mad enough to pick up his Android and tap, Tap, TAP!

It could provide great grist for legal arguments that the investigations are less about prosecuting damaging leaks than they are about punishing journalists.

That, at least, is the view of Floyd Abrams, the titan of free speech jurisprudence. He’s best known for successfully defending clients like The New York Times against the Nixon administration’s attempts to stop it from printing the Pentagon Papers, and the Brooklyn Museum of Art against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s move to cut city support because of an exhibition he called sacrilegious.

As president, Donald Trump is powerful — but as recent weeks have shown, he’s not omnipotent. His powers are checked by the other branches, by institutions, and by the Constitution — including but not limited to the First Amendment, the focus of Floyd Abrams’s new book, [The Soul of the First Amendment](http://amzn.to/2oosatC) (affiliate link).

The argument of the book, as explained by the Times, is that the United States leads the world when it comes to protecting freedom of speech. Because of this strong tradition, and because defamation law is a creature of state rather than federal law, Trump won’t find it easy to [“open up” libel laws](http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/donald-trump-libel-laws-219866), as he pledged on the campaign trail. (Indeed, as Floyd Abrams previously suggested, the libel laws could actually be [used by journalists](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/fierce-first-amendment-attorney-thinks-its-time-for-the-media-to-start-suing-donald-trump-for-libel/) against Trump.)

That said, President Trump can take some actions to make things harder for journalists (and not just by ruining their weekends through incendiary Saturday morning tweets):

“My concerns on the Trump level are more in two areas,” [Abrams] said. “One, the potential use of the Espionage Act against journalists reporting on national security-related matters, and the other is leak investigations in which the journalists are called to testify.”

Protecting national security while preserving freedom of speech is a delicate balancing act — as Abrams well knows, having successfully represented the Times in the Pentagon Papers case. For a deeper dive into that subject, check out [his book](http://amzn.to/2oosatC), which contains detailed discussion of this among many other subjects.

# The Biglaw Firms That In-House Counsel Recommend Most

Say you’re working in-house at a prominent, profitable company, and you’ve got a major legal problem on your hands. It’s a bet-the-company litigation matter, and you’re not quite sure which law firm to choose to handle the issue. You turn to a colleague for advice, and luckily enough, they’re ready to make a recommendation to you on the spot thanks to one firm’s superior client service.

Unprompted recommendations from legal decision makers in the corporate world are like liquid gold for law firms. Just one unprompted recommendation can lead to an attorney/client relationship that can last for decades, prompting more and more such recommendations, leading to more and more satisfied clients (not to mention more and more money for the recommended law firms).

But which law firms receive the most unprompted recommendations? Thanks to a [new study](http://www.bticonsulting.com/publications/bti-most-recommended-law-firms-2017) that was just released by BTI Consulting Group, we now know.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
According to BTI, not all recommendations are equal. Why’s that? Here’s some pertinet information from [BTI Consulting Group’s Mad Clientist](http://www.bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/the-most-recommended-law-firms-2017) blog:

Unprompted recommendations mean you earned this recommendation on your own merit rather than being asked specifically about your firm (BTI asked corporate counsel, “Which law firm do you recommend to your peers?” Most other researchers ask, “Do you recommend Firm ABC?”). The answer to the first question is a much higher and more reliable standard than the second.

Without any further ado, these are the 10 firms that have been the most recommended by corporate counsel for the past 15 years, consecutively:

- Baker McKenzie
- Foley & Lardner
- Holland & Knight
- Jones Day
- Latham & Watkins
- McGuireWoods
- Pillsbury
- Ropes & Gray
- Sidley
- Sullivan & Cromwell

According to BTI’s research, 64 percent of legal decision makers cited superior client service as the reason they were most likely to recommend their go-to firms. A dedication to superior client service has essentially been baked into the firm culture at the most recommended firms. In an interview with [Law360](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/954633/the-10-law-firms-clients-recommend-most) (sub. req.), BTI president Michael Rynowecer said, “You can’t perform at that level for 15 years without it being a part of the understanding of who you are as a firm. There’s an unspoken — or spoken — expectation that client service is paramount and comes first and will be on top of the list of things attorneys have to do.”

Congratulations to all of the firms that have been recommended by their corporate clients steadfastly for more than a decade. If you want your firm to someday be among those on this list, then it would be a good idea to encourage attorneys to intimately get to know your clients’ business, and then show them how deep your understanding of their business really is — after all, that’s all they really want from their attorneys. Try it out sometime and reap the rewards.

# The Reality Of Litigation Funding

A hallmark of an important professional development is when definitive statements proclaiming a new reality are made by serious sources. If anyone was unsure of whether the litigation finance phenomenon had reached that tipping point, they can now feel free to rid themselves of any uncertainty. No lesser a source than the New York City Bar Association Litigation Funding Working Group [has spoken](http://documents.nycbar.org/files/Report_to_the_President_by_Litigation_Funding_Working_Group.pdf), declaring that “the New York Rules of Professional Conduct should be modified to accommodate the reality of litigation funding.” Lest you think that this impactful statement is the product of unserious thinking, please understand that the members of this working group include prominent academics, practitioners, litigation funders, and former jurists. A group that collectively worked over a year to conduct a “comprehensive study and review of the issues and practices surrounding litigation funding” before issuing their report, while also soliciting input on numerous occasions “from a range of guest speakers, including practitioners, scholars, and experts in the fields of commercial and consumer finance.”

Their just-issued report on litigation finance represents serious effort, by a serious team, on perhaps the most serious issue confronting the legal profession today. One that comes just after the City Bar’s Committee on Professional Ethics’ notorious (at least in litigation finance circles) prior decision that “non-recourse financing agreement secured by legal fees in a matter — i.e., an arrangement in which it is contemplated that the lawyer will make future payments only if the lawyer recovers fees — constitutes an impermissible fee-sharing arrangement” in violation of ethics rules. While that decision did not seem to have much of a chilling effect on the spread of litigation finance nationwide (or even in New York,) it did stand out as the clearest statement of concern that litigation finance arrangements could constitute ethics violations. Not the greatest messaging for a burgeoning industry attracting immense investor interest — or for the lawyers and firms eagerly lining up for a shot of that sweet nonrecourse manna being doled out by flush funders in an effort to generate returns for those investors.

But as I referenced above, the new recommendation is that the ethical rules be modified, not that litigation funding be restricted. Bending to the new reality, if you will. While serious questions still remain about the impacts on (distortions of) the attorney-client relationship that are engendered by litigation finance arrangements, it seems clear for now that both the bar and funding industry are committed to working together to minimize the potential negatives so that the glorious positives can be realized. Is there self-interest on all sides motivating the relationship? Of course. But there must also be a committed response to what is actually going on in the legal industry in the US — one that takes into account both the historical record and treatment of third-party funding of lawyers and claims, as well as the lessons that can be learned from the development and deployment of litigation funding overseas.

To that end, the Working Group’s report is a major contribution. At minimum, it serves as a handy primer on the historical concerns surrounding the use of third-party funding as a driver of litigation, along with a useful overview of how litigation funding is being handled by other common law legal systems such as Australia. For that alone it is a must-read for anyone whose practice is impacted  by litigation finance — i.e. nearly every litigator practicing today, as well as an increasingly wide swath of nonlitigators, such as in-house counsel or those corporate types who serve the litigation finance industry, just to start. But the report’s main contribution, at least in my view, revolves around its competing proposals for amending the ethical rules in New York to allow for certain permissible litigation funding structures. A detailed analysis of those proposals will have to wait for a future column, especially as they relate to the reality of litigation funding in today’s IP industry. For now, however, I think it is very important to highlight a few critical observations about the nature of litigation finance underlying the need to amend the ethical rules at all.

First, the report provides confirmation that the very existence of litigation funding implicates ethical concerns. Indeed, those concerns primarily manifest themselves in the answers to a simple set of questions, such as: Could a funder “improperly influence the legal representation?”

“Of course” is the only rational answer, which is why both proposals make clear that the existence of a funding relationship should not influence the decision-making of the lawyer, or somehow vest the funder with decision-making authority on critical issues such as settlement or litigation strategy. Whether a funder can advise on those issues is addressed more permissively, but there remains a fundamental unease with the idea that a litigation funder can somehow displace the “client” and become the lawyer’s true client just because they are contributing to the cause financially. For now, at least, the Working Group is endorsing ethical rules that would allow some forms of what I term “passive” litigation funding, Where that leaves funders and investors in favor of more activist approaches is a very important question that will likely need addressing over time.

Second, the report is also a tacit acknowledgment of what has been said about the true aims of the litigation funding industry. Namely that it is effectively an elaborate workaround of the traditional ethical stricture around nonlawyer investment in law firms. In what I think is implicit recognition of that tension, it was not surprising to see a split between the two proposals on how litigation funding can be used. One proposal seeks to limit the use of litigation funding to only those expenditures incurred for the benefit of the client during the representation — and proposes limiting language to that effect. The second, however, suggests that a more expansive use of litigation funding be sanctioned, which would allow for law firms to make operational investments that more indirectly benefit the client’s interests. This is a critical issue, since we know that both funders and law firms are always looking for ways to diversify their exposure to the risks they each face, which has led to heightened interest in things like portfolio financing of a law firm’s entire contingency book of business, as just one example.

Ultimately, these are just preliminary thoughts based on an initial reading of the entire report. At the same time, just how important a contribution this report is to the vital discussion around the issue of litigation funding can’t be overstated. Those of us — particularly those of us in IP where litigation funding has already transformed the patent litigation landscape — have no choice but to become informed about all the contours of this career-defining issue. Because failure to accept the “reality of litigation funding” dooms uninformed lawyers — and their unfortunate clients — to both a difficult present and challenging future.

# Another Elite Boutique Surpasses Biglaw Year-End Bonuses
## Congrats on these mega bonuses!

It’s increasingly clear that if you’re looking for the biggest bonuses in the legal industry, you’d best start looking at elite boutiques. These small but mighty firms are throwing around bonuses that shake up everything you think you know about the top of the market.

Yesterday, Selendy Gay Elsberg announced their base bonuses for associates, and for the fifth year in a row, the firm is exceeding the prevailing market scale for Biglaw bonuses. Here’s the scale at the firm:

Class Year

SGE Year-End Base Bonus

2015+

$126,500

2016

$115,500

2017

$99,000

2018

$82,500

2019

$63,250

2020

$33,000

2021

$22,000

2022

$16,500

Yup, that’s 10% higher than the Biglaw numbers across the board. Plus, some associates will get even more, “based on a holistic assessment of performance and commitment to the firm.”

Bonuses will be paid on December 23rd. You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/selendy-bonus-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Facing Backlash, Mayer Brown Dumps Client
## But not everyone is happy.

[Last week, the Biglaw firm Mayer Brown](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaw-firms-bold-pro-oppression-stance/) came under fire for its most recent representation of the University of Hong Kong. The university is trying to get a work of art — the Pillar of Shame sculpture by Danish artist Jens Galschiøt designed to commemorate the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in Beijing — removed from its campus. The play is being called an “attack on art” and reportedly shows the firm is “complicit in the suppression of human rights.”

Not a good look for the firm. Particularly one that likes that like [to tout](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/capabilities/practices/litigation--dispute-resolution/white-collar-defense--compliance/business-human-rights?tab=overview) its human rights expertise.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So, maybe it really wasn’t a surprise that [the firm has backed away](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/mayer-brown-will-no-long-seek-removal-of-tiananmen-square-memorial-for-university-client) from its client in this particular representation:

“Going forward, Mayer Brown will not be representing its longtime client in this matter. We have no further comment,” the law firm said in a statement.

But proving you can’t please all the people all the time, there’s now backlash to the backlash. In a social media post, former Hong Kong chief executive Chun-ying Leung said Mayer Brown caved to political pressure in withdrawing its representation,[ calling for](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/mayer-brown-faces-boycot-call-after-dropping-hong-kong-client) a “China-wide boycott” and saying:

From here on, no client in Hong Kong or Mainland China, particularly those with Chinese government connections, will find Mayer Brown dependable.

Honey, can you hang up my coat?

The team is working on a process for that.

You’ll need to complete a form, and then we’ll be able to start work on your coat.

The closet’s over there in the hallway.

We have to socialize this idea. If anyone in senior management doesn’t know about the coat-hanging process, they’ll be very upset. We’re scheduling individual phone calls with everyone in senior management to let them know we’re starting this project.

Just take the damn coat.

It’s hard to schedule those calls. The folks in senior management are very busy; their calendars are back-to-back. And then there are all the different time zones.  It’s also vacation time of year. We’ll probably have socialized this with everyone by the end of the month. Then we’ll start actually designing the process. There’s no reason to start work on the project until we know that everyone approves of it.

How long will that take?

Probably a while. And, of course, we’ll have to beta test the process before we implement it on your coat.

Screw you.

I’m thinking we’ll be nearing completion in Q4 or Q1, assuming there aren’t any delays.

I want a divorce.

The team is drawing up a Gantt chart. Once the chart is ready, we’ll have a better sense of how long it will take to design the process. I’m just spitballing here, but I really think Q4 or Q1 is a good guess. Unless they cancel funding for the project.  If they cancel funding, then all bets are off.

What divorce lawyer will you use?

We have to level-set before we operationalize. Maybe we should hire a consultant.

I’ve packed your suitcase. I don’t want you in the house anymore.

I’m not leaving! You leave! Here — let me get your coat.

# 'Jury Duty' Is A Great Show For Lawyers And Legal Professionals
## 'Jury Duty' ridicules but also celebrates many parts of the legal profession, and it should definitely be on your watch list.

As many people already know, Amazon Freevee just released a TV series called “[Jury Duty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22074164/)” that is also available for watching on Amazon Prime. At first, I thought this show might be related to the 1995 [Paulie Shore movie of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_Duty_(film)), which I watched dozens of times as a kid. However, I later realized that this was a prank series in which actors play court officers, jurors, lawyers, and witnesses to convince one unsuspecting person that he is serving on a jury. The result is hilarious, as the producers put this unsuspecting juror through incredible hijinks, which I will not describe in too much detail here for fear of giving something away. For a variety of reasons, lawyers and other individuals within the legal profession should definitely check out “Jury Duty” since it is particularly entertaining to legal professionals.

I for one do not ordinarily enjoy watching legal shows or movies. I need to deal with legal issues on a daily basis, and I do not usually wish to have the law invade my personal time. One of the only legal shows I watched in the past several years was “[Better Call Saul](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/better-call-saul-is-the-most-accurate-legal-show-on-television/),” which I hope people will agree, is less about the law and more about the criminal underworld. I also watched [and wrote an article about](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/rake-should-be-on-every-lawyers-quarantine-watch-list/) the Australian legal show “Rake” a few years ago, but that show is so far removed from the experience of an American lawyer that it was enjoyable to me.

However, “Jury Duty” should definitely be on the watch lists of lawyers because it is so different from the ordinary life of a lawyer and yet it is more relatable to attorneys than others legal shows. This series has genuinely funny comedy against the backdrop of a legal setting that can be familiar and appealing to lawyers. Throughout the series, the show pokes fun at incompetent lawyers, clients doing stupid things, and court officers trying to keep decorum — all things that lawyers see in their work lives. However, the show effectively pokes fun at all of this in a way that can be cathartic for people who practice law and other professionals within the legal arena.

Another thing that lawyers can really appreciate about the show is a certain sense of realism and the quality of acting that is on display in the series. The judge on the show was a practicing lawyer for over 40 years, and he masterfully plays the part. That judge could have been any jurist I have practiced in front of during my career, and the fact that this actor was able to mesh his prior experiences in the law with his acting talents is truly masterful. Moreover, both the actors playing plaintiff’s counsel and defense counsel are or were practicing lawyers, and the actor who played the defense counsel claims that he has numerous real trials under his belt. It is so rare in legal movies and television shows to see actors and actresses who have actual legal training and experience. This definitely makes their performances more believable, which only adds to the comedy, since these performers elicit more significant reactions from the mark who thinks he is serving jury duty.

Some might say that the show makes fun of the legal profession and process, since the law is the backdrop of the prank. Of course, common tropes in legal settings like people wanting to get out of jury duty or jurors not paying attention are part of the hijinks in the series, and they make good fodder for comedy. However, the show also celebrates the legal process in a unique way.

The show’s protagonist takes his job very seriously and wants to render a just outcome notwithstanding all of the comedic circumstances surrounding him. Sure, this might have been because this person wanted to look good in front of the cameras, but it is also undeniable that this might be in small part due to the respect and solemnity people hold for the judicial process. Moreover, it is amazing to see all of the current and former lawyers playing an active role in the show. The legal profession is definitely a wide tent, and it is great to see some of our sisters and brothers of the bar using their talents (legal and nonlegal) to good effect in this comedy.

In addition, it is always good to laugh at some of the things we as lawyers see in our practices each day. Whether it be the bossy bailiff, the sometimes-odd interactions at courthouse security, or other situations, the show is relatable and especially comedic for people who are connected to the legal process.

All told, prank shows might not be everyone’s cup of tea, and they are a smaller genre of realty television that might only appeal to certain types of audiences. However, “Jury Duty” ridicules but also celebrates many parts of the legal profession, and it should definitely be on the watch lists of people who work in the legal industry.

Your first year as an associate is hard, and there is no question that being a new mom comes with sleepless nights and constant stress. But being a first-year associate, a new mom, and enduring the COVID-19 pandemic simultaneously was a trifecta I never anticipated.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
My 2020-2021 looked like this:

- March 2020 — I left law school for spring break and never physically returned to the building.
- June 2020 — I gave birth to my son.
- August 2020 — I started my final semester of law school.
- December 2020 — I “graduated” law school, with no actual graduation.
- February 2021 — I sat for the UBE Virtual Bar Exam.
- March 2021 — I started my job as a supervised associate.
- May 2021 — I was admitted to practice law.
After juggling law school, a baby, working part-time, and studying for the bar exam, I honestly believed that my life would get easier in 2021. I wasn’t prepared for just how hard being a new mom and being a new associate would be. I felt blindsided. Surely I had to be doing something wrong because no one else seemed to be struggling like I was.

We live in a society that communicates the facade of everyone having these perfect lives. The pressure to be a mom who has a clean home, full-time job, dinner made every night, never misses their child’s activity, and always has it together is real. The pressure doesn’t stop there either.

As a first-year associate, there is internal and professional pressure to prove your worth as an attorney. To “pay your dues” as a first-year associate you are supposed to be the first to arrive and the last to leave, work more hours than anyone else in the office, do all the legal research, and write every brief, oh, and seamlessly adjust to the practice of law during “COVID times.” I have been a licensed attorney for six months, and because of COVID I have yet to go to a single docket call. What I had anticipated my life as a new attorney would be is not the current reality.

I had set these standards for myself to be the mom who had it all together and the first-year associate that did it all. The impossible standards I had set for myself made me feel like a complete failure in all aspects of my life.

I have come to realize I will never be the “perfect” mom, and I will never be the “perfect” attorney. But I can be the perfect version of myself. I have started a journey of redefining what success truly is for myself and giving myself grace as I strive for success.

These are the five things that have helped me:

Find Your Battle Buddies

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One of the best things I have done on this journey is insisting on doing lunch with an opposing attorney. Through our work conversations, I learned that she was also a new attorney and a young mom. That one lunch date has turned into a friendship and support system. Having someone to be your “battle buddy” and go through the trenches with you helps put a reality check on your measures of success. You are not alone. Look for friends or acquaintances who can relate to your struggles. Invite them for lunch, coffee, or a play date. Share your struggles and be honest about your journey.

Ask for Help

You are not a failure for asking for help. I hate asking for help. In the midst of one of my many breakdowns, I finally came to terms with the fact that needing help is not a bad thing. Babies get sick and lawyers can’t always be flexible. It is okay to ask someone else to watch your sick child or take them to the doctor because you can’t get away. It is okay to ask another attorney to cover for you because something has come up at home. Asking for help does not make you weak, in fact, it gives you strength.

Be Kind To Yourself

Do not beat yourself up. On a regular basis my sink can be overflowing with dishes, my laundry piled up on the floor, toys are thrown across the house, and my son is eating Froot Loops for dinner. I wish more than anything that I could keep a perfect home and accomplish all of my work tasks, but instead of beating myself up, I try to be gracious for what I can accomplish. It is so easy to see the things you aren’t doing and not see all that you accomplish. Be gracious with yourself. Take the time to relax even if you have dishes to do. The list of to-dos never ends, but being deliberate in the way you care and think of yourself can prevent burnout or a breakdown. And if you do have a breakdown, that is okay too. Take the time you need to recover and keep striving for your measure of success going forward.

Set Your Boundaries

Saying no can be hard, especially when it is your new boss you have to say no to. We all know that work-life balance is important to reduce stress and prevent burnout, but finding that balance can be difficult. Honor your family commitments, and unplug from work when you are home. By respecting the time you have committed to your family and standing firm in the boundaries you have set, you are taking steps to achieve a better work-life balance.

Be A Cheerleader 

Encourage others. The only way we can make a difference and change societal views is by encouraging those around us to find their own measure of success. Being a mom and being an attorney is hard. It is okay that it is hard! Don’t downplay or discredit your experience. By sharing our struggles and encouraging others that they are not alone, we are working to change how society defines a “good mom” or a “great associate.” Struggles and failures don’t make you any less successful. Often, they make you a stronger person.

# This Top 20 Biglaw Firm Wants Associates In The Office 3-4 Days Each Week
## Perhaps some Milbank money would make this easier to swallow.

Now that the COVID-19 omicron variant seems to be tapering off, Biglaw firms are really looking forward to things getting back to normal — and in this case, that means heading back to the office. Yet again, we have a top law firm inviting associates back to the office without word on matching the new Milbank salary scale.

Earlier this week, Simpson Thacher & Barlett, a firm that’s in the top 20 of the Am Law 100 (No. 14, to be exact), notified associates that they’d be due back in the office on March 14. Associates are expected to spend three to four days each week in the office, on average, starting next month. Sources we’ve heard from didn’t exactly seem thrilled about this plan.

The firm, however, is focusing on the flexibility of its hybrid model, and will be offering several remote blocks throughout the year. Here’s an excerpt from the Simpson Thacher memo (available on the next page):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We want to reinforce our support for the ongoing need for flexibility by announcing we will be “Remote First” during certain periods this year including the month of August, the week of Thanksgiving and the last two weeks of the year. During that time our regular in-person schedule will be suspended. The office will remain open for those who prefer to work from there or for those whose client work requires it.

We certainly hope that by the time those remote weeks roll around, the firm will have adopted the soon-to-be prevailing Biglaw salary scale.

(Flip to the next page to read the Simpson Thacher memo in full.)

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

It has been eight long days since [Baker McKenzie announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/) their year-end bonuses, and associates at other firms have spent their time refreshing their email with little to show for it. The market was in a bit of a dry spell, with no other firms stepping up to match — or exceed (hey, a girl can dream) — the bonus scale set by Baker.

Until today.

This morning, Boies Schiller Flexner announced their bonus scale for associates (those who opt into the market compensation plan at the firm). They’ve matched the market scale set by Baker — with extraordinary and extra-extraordinary bumps for associates who billed a buttload this year.

At Boies Schiller, associates have the option of doing the market bonus system, which will get them the above scale, or [they can opt](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/despite-changes-to-their-compensation-system-associates-at-boies-schiller-can-still-take-home-huge-bonuses/) into the firm’s formula compensation system, which includes a revenue share component that affords associates a cut of the matters they work on, which for contingency work [can be massive](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/boies-schiller-makes-its-associates-very-happy-once-again-with-giant-bonus-checks/).

This is what the firm noted about their formula bonuses this year:

As a point of information, when we first offered associates the choice of the “market” system or our traditional formula compensation system two years ago, the majority of associates initially opted for the market system. Two years later, the vast majority of associates have opted to return to (or start on) formula compensation, presumably in recognition of the greater flexibility that it offers to associates at any workload level (since formula compensation scales directly as a function of creditable hours billed, as opposed to requiring associates to hit certain milestones); the credit that associates may receive for originating or running matters; and the participation in any premium from recoveries in our contingency or success-fee cases. As you know, we also made subtle changes to the formula this year that also generally run in favor of associates.

You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/bsf-bonus-22/2/)

Congratulations to associates on the generous bonuses!

“No one really knows how the parties get to yes / The pieces that are sacrificed in every game of chess / We just assume that it happens / But no one else is in the room where it happens.” — [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://genius.com/7883418), “The Room Where It Happens” (Hamilton)

Earlier this month, Mayer Brown [appointed Raj De](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/news/2019/06/raj-de-appointed-new-leader-of-mayer-browns-washington-dc-office) as the managing partner of its office in Washington, D.C. Before rejoining the firm in 2015, De held senior appointments in the White House and the Departments of Justice and Defense. Most recently, he served as General Counsel of the [U.S. National Security Agency](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/news/2019/04/mayer-brown-partner-raj-de-inducted-as-distinguished-fellow-of-the-institute-for-national-security-and-counterterrorism).

De was generous enough to spend some time with us this week and share some sage advice for up-and-coming attorneys. From his time in the White House to his current role, De has had quite a run. I learned quite a bit from our discussion and I believe you will as well. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): Congratulations on your recent appointment as the managing partner of Mayer Brown’s Washington, D.C. office. Are you excited about any particular activities or initiatives for the more than 200 attorneys that comprise your office? 

Raj De (RD): Thank you. I am thrilled about taking on this role. I’ve been with Mayer Brown Washington since 2006, having left for several years to serve in the government, and have worked here in a variety of roles from associate to partner to practice leader and now managing partner. So I’ve seen the office from a range of perspectives for well over the course of a decade. I am excited about continuing the strategic growth of the office, which has expanded dramatically in recent years. Our global clients increasingly rely upon the firm’s Washington office to help them navigate challenges ranging from congressional investigations and regulatory enforcement actions to trade disputes and high stakes litigation before the Supreme Court.

I am also particularly interested in strengthening the office’s diversity by redoubling our efforts in recruitment, mentoring, promotion, and retention. There can be no doubt that the diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences of our lawyers is essential to providing clients with excellent legal services. I am proud to be among the relatively few diverse managing partners of major law firms in the Washington DC area, and I invite clients who want to push our profession forward in this regard to consider Mayer Brown — and the Washington office, and me in particular — as a very willing partner in that endeavor.

RC: You had the opportunity to serve in the White House as Staff Secretary and Deputy Assistant to former President Barack Obama. What were these roles like?

Serving as Staff Secretary was a unique experience, and one that provided unparalleled exposure to all aspects of how a White House functions. The role is to manage all memoranda, executive orders, and other written materials that need to be reviewed or approved by the President. There is a small margin for error. I did not sleep much, but I gained valuable insight into presidential decision-making.

Every single day I served in the White House I was very cognizant of how remarkable it was for the son of Indian immigrants to walk into an office in the West Wing, board Air Force One to travel with the President around the world (literally!), or step into the Oval Office on a regular basis. But of course the real honor was to be part of a team of dedicated and talented professionals who shared one mission — to serve the American people.

RC: As someone who has served across all three branches of the United States government, do you have any insights you’d like to share that our readers may not be aware of when they think about how our government operates?

RD: First, some have the misperception that the federal government is a monolithic entity rather than a multitude of departments and agencies, each with its own focus, mission, and priorities. For our clients, a nuanced appreciation of the relevant government stakeholders for any legal issue, and the interplay among them, is critical.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Second, every arena has its own formal — and informal — rules of the road, and our clients depend upon us to have the relevant skills and experience, whether managing an executive branch enforcement action, a congressional inquiry, or litigation in court — and, perhaps most importantly, all of the above at the same time.

Third, contrary to what one might hear in the news, the vast majority of government employees continue to perform their day-to-day roles in a nonpartisan manner, regardless of who is in office.

RC: Currently, law students from across the nation are participating in summer programs at Biglaw firms throughout the country. Do you have any advice for these summer associates?

RD: I would advise any summer associate to use the opportunity in front of them to learn more about the kind of lawyer they want to be, what they want out of a professional experience, and what career trajectory they can envision. Building a career needs to be a proactive rather than a passive endeavor. Seek out lawyers whom you want to meet, ask them about their careers, and find out what resonates. Try different types of projects. And when faced with the choice of working hard or enjoying the moment, do both.

RC: What advice do you have for attorneys who want to begin a career in public service?

RD: This may sound strange coming from the managing partner of a major law firm office, but I would say go for it. When I was finishing law school, I had an offer to return to the firm where I had spent the previous summer. It was a great place, with interesting work and interesting people. But I had in my third year applied to the Attorney General’s Honor Program and was fortunate enough to have been offered a position at the Department of Justice. I was torn. I spoke to the managing partner of the Washington office of the firm, looking for his best advice but expecting him to twist my arm to come back to the firm. Instead, he inquired about my interests and about the DOJ position (it was in the Antitrust Division, a particularly active element of DOJ in the late 1990s), and said: “Follow your interest and go where the action is.”

I chose to go to DOJ right out of law school. Several years later I chose to leave private practice to serve as counsel to the 9/11 Commission, and then years later I again left law firm life to join the Obama Administration. I am proud of my public service, and it has undoubtedly made me a better lawyer. Every lawyer needs to carve their own path, and I would simply tell young lawyers that public service can be an important aspect of that journey.

RC: What was the most intense job you have had?

RD: I have learned over my career that you never know what you can handle until you are tested. I thought early on that working for the 9/11 Commission, under significant time pressure and with significant public scrutiny, was pretty intense. We had to produce a final report, and it had to provide the American people some sense of understanding about what had happened, and why. Then several years later I found myself in an intense role in the White House, in a job that can only be described as a grind. By that point in my life I had a family with two kids, so the strain was not insignificant.

I left the White House to serve as General Counsel for the National Security Agency thinking that my life might return to a bit of normalcy, but then the Snowden disclosures happened and the media, congressional, and global spotlight was more intense than anything that I had ever experienced. It just goes to show, you never know what is around the corner.

RC: Much of your career has been spent in D.C. From your perspective, what makes the D.C. legal market unique?

RD: Apart from clerking, all of my professional experience has been in the Washington, D.C. legal market — working in private practice, at the White House and Departments of Justice and Defense, as a Congressional staffer, and as counsel for independent bipartisan investigations such as the 9/11 Commission. Washington has been and remains the risk capital of the world from a legal, policy, and regulatory perspective. For clients, that risk can unfold by way of investigations, enforcement actions, regulations, litigation, trade disputes, sanctions compliance, or a host of other challenges.

Our job is often to assist our clients anticipate, identify, mitigate, or ultimately defend against such risk. And to do that well, legal skills matter, experience matters, and judgment matters. Not all lawyers have that combination of skill, experience, and judgment, but I would submit that the Washington legal market puts a premium on such lawyers. We certainly do at Mayer Brown.

RC: How do you think we can effectively advance diversity and inclusion efforts in today’s political climate?

RD: In my view, leadership is essential. Diversity and Inclusion are essential in a competitive market, and — at least in Biglaw — the needle will not move fast enough on its own without committed leadership, force of will, proactive effort, creativity, persistence, and education. We cannot sit idly by and expect such momentous change. Leaders of the profession have a responsibility to shape the profession. This has nothing to do with politics, but it does have everything to do with providing clients with the best legal services possible.

The Cybersecurity & Data Privacy practice that I lead is one of the most diverse practices at our firm, and likely across the market. That is not an accident. Such success can be accomplished on a broader scale in our profession. Mayer Brown stands for excellence, and in Washington I intend to draw the best of the best from the broadest pool of talent possible.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Raj De for sharing his experience and wisdom with our audience and wish him continued success in his career.

# Litigation Powerhouse Offers Up Super 'Kool' Bonuses, Salaries For Associates
## Everything is bigger in Texas, including the year-end bonuses. Congrats!

We love it when law firms keep it cool by matching the generous market bonus scale… or in this case, we suppose they’re keeping it “kool.”

Sources report that McKool Smith — the Texas-based complex trial firm that’s been handing out money to associates hand over fist for years — announced its year-end bonuses late last week, and it’s not surprising that the firm is matching the Cravath scale. (From what we know, there’s been no word on a Cravath match for salaries quite yet at the firm.)

Either way, a Cravath match means that this is what the bonus scale looks like at the firm:

- Class of 2023 – $15,000
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016+ – $115,000
UPDATE (12/19): McKool Smith rolled out salary updates today, and they seem to match the Cravath scale as well. Here’s what compensation will look like at the firm, effective January 1, 2024. Note that first- and second-year associates at the firm will be making $5,000 more than what’s being offered by other leading Biglaw firms.

- Class of 2023 – $230,000
- Class of 2022 – $240,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000

# Options For Law Clerks To Address Wrongful Conduct?
## It’s a short list.

This week, the federal Office of Judicial Integrity (OJI) and circuit Directors of Workplace Relations (DWRs) are holding a series of online information sessions about options for law clerks to address wrongful conduct in the judiciary. It could be a short meeting, because it’s a short list.

In 2018, following high-profile allegations against notorious harasser and former Ninth Circuit Judge [Alex Kozinski](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/federal-appeals-judge-announces-immediate-retirement-amid-investigation-prompted-by-accusations-of-sexual-misconduct/2017/12/18/6e38ada4-e3fd-11e7-a65d-1ac0fd7f097e_story.html), the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) created a national Workplace Conduct Working Group to “study” misconduct in the federal judiciary and make recommendations. Modest reforms have been implemented, including the creation of the OJI and the judicial integrity officer, and some reforms to the [Employee Dispute Resolution Plan (EDR)](https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/guide-vol12-ch02-appx2a_oji-2019-09-17-post-model-edr-plan.pdf).

There are three levels of review to address wrongful conduct: EDR coordinators within courthouses, circuit DWRs, and the national OJI. However, law clerks often tell me “no one with a U.S. Courts email address is impartial” and express skepticism that internal judiciary mechanisms can effectively address their concerns, comparing this to a private employer’s human resources department, which historically protects employers against liability rather than assists with employee grievances.

Law clerks who are mistreated have two options because [the judiciary is exempt from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/judges-who-interpret-title-vii-should-themselves-be-subject-to-it/), the anti-discrimination law that protects their counterparts throughout the legal profession: EDR and a formal judicial complaint under the [Judicial Conduct and Disability Act (JC&D)](https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-conduct-disability). There is, of course, a third option: suffer in silence and try to move on — an option [too many in the legal profession encourage clerks to choose](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/do-your-research-stick-it-out-and-other-things-law-schools-should-stop-telling-students-about-clerkships/). Both EDR and the JC&D are inadequate redress: they fail to recognize the enormous power disparity between judge and clerk and the substantial headwinds against reporting misconduct. However, as a new class of thousands of law clerks across the country start their clerkships this fall, it’s important to be transparent about the current state of workplace protections (or lack thereof) in the federal judiciary.

EDR is the federal judiciary’s internal dispute resolution process. Current law clerks (or other judiciary employees, including [federal public defenders](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU03/20220317/114503/HHRG-117-JU03-Wstate-StricklandC-20220317.pdf)) can seek limited redress — particularly  reassignment — if they are mistreated. Yet the plan is highly flawed: EDR is neither truly impartial nor confidential because the presiding judicial officer, a fellow judge in the courthouse where the complainant law clerk and respondent judge work, is tasked with leading the investigation, and fellow judges are notoriously unwilling to discipline their colleagues. Law clerks tell me presiding judicial officers have commented about their judiciary colleagues’ alleged misconduct: “He probably didn’t mean it” and “But he’s such a nice person.”

EDR offers three options: informal advice, assisted resolution, and filing a formal complaint. Clerks alleging abusive conduct must engage in dispute resolution before filing a complaint. There are several tight deadlines clerks must follow throughout the EDR process, including a 180-day filing deadline. Law clerks engaging in EDR often need to hire attorneys, especially if the process includes discovery and a hearing. But attorneys are notoriously unwilling to take on law clerk cases pro bono because they fear going up against judges in the jurisdiction where they represent paying clients and because monetary remedies are not available through EDR.

After the presiding judicial officer reviews the complaint, they determine whether to permit discovery, let alone a hearing. Importantly, each circuit runs the EDR process differently: there is no meaningful oversight over each circuit’s EDR proceedings. Employment attorneys who’ve represented law clerks described EDR as “a kangaroo court” where law clerks basically “had no rights” and that the multi-month process “lacked even the appearance of due process.”

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Engaging in EDR can overshadow the majority of the clerkship. At the end, the best a law clerk can hope for after potentially risking their reputation is reassignment to a different judge. This is challenging, since judges hire clerks far in advance and a chambers would need to make room for a new clerk, perhaps necessitating the law clerk move to another state. Not to mention, the mid-clerkship move might arouse suspicion in future job interviews. Troublingly, the judiciary has, in some instances where they reached a positive resolution through EDR, required the law clerk to sign a nondisclosure agreement, even though this is not delineated in the EDR. An NDA restricts the clerk’s ability to share their experience, which can have long-term psychological consequences, while potentially covering up a judge’s misconduct.

Not surprisingly, law clerks rarely engage in EDRs. They fear retaliation (and are not legally protected against it because the judiciary is exempt from Title VII), as well as reputational harm. Too often, law clerks suffer in silence and simply hope the judges who mistreat them during their clerkships do not also attempt [to derail their careers](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU03/20220317/114503/HHRG-117-JU03-20220317-SD005.pdf).

Clerks can also file formal complaints against judges under the JC&D, the process governing [the investigation into 96-year-old Federal Circuit Judge Pauline Newman](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/no-judge-should-serve-forever/). This is not a mode of redress for law clerks — although holding powerful people accountable when they engage in misconduct is empowering. Judges can potentially be disciplined under JC&D through sanction or suspension. They can only be removed from office through congressional impeachment, which is exceedingly rare.

The chief judge in the circuit where the complainant law clerk and respondent judge work — again, one of the respondent judge’s colleagues — reviews the JC&D complaint. Chief judges are empowered to investigate judges absent formal complaints. However, a fruitful investigation requires witnesses, and the same law clerk fears about retaliation often preclude them from participating.

Few law clerks file complaints under either [the JC&D](https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics/table/s-22/judicial-business/2022/09/30) or the EDR each year. EDR data is unknown: the judiciary doesn’t release this information because, I’ve been told, it would apparently risk violating complainants’ confidentiality. This argument is unpersuasive. First, JC&D data is released, separated by circuit, without violating confidentiality. Second, potential complainants must know how often clerks engage in EDR and the outcomes of those complaints in order to decide whether the process is right for them. Furthermore, by reviewing EDR data, those tasked with potentially exerting much-needed oversight over the judiciary could determine whether EDR requires further revisions, [or a complete overhaul](https://nyujlpp.org/quorum/shatzman-judiciary-accountability-act/).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I do not dissuade anyone from engaging in the EDR process or filing a JC&D complaint. In fact, law clerks should consider pursuing both options. These are the only existing options to support mistreated clerks and hold judges accountable right now. However, it’s imperative to highlight law clerks’ inadequate options, both so they enter their clerkships with a true understanding of the limited nature of their rights and resources, and so those who work within and outside the judiciary can understand the urgency of reform.

Mistreated clerks typically share the same standard fact pattern with me. A law clerk approaches either an EDR coordinator (in their courthouse) or a DWR (in their circuit) to confide in them and seek advice. The clerk’s most important questions are: (1) Will the process remain confidential? And, (2) Will I be protected against retaliation? Sadly, the answer to both questions is no. Some law clerks are counseled not to file complaints: they’re told that as the lone, or one of just a few, complainants against a judge, they will not be successful.

Of course, it’s nearly impossible for a law clerk to file a complaint anonymously. The respondent judge will have the opportunity to respond and confront the witness against them, particularly in EDR. Additionally, even if it were theoretically possible to anonymize complainants, a judge has a few clerks each year and would likely identify the complainant. But beyond being identifiable, there is no protection for clerks against retaliation.

Retaliation precludes law clerk reporting. Judges have enormous power over former clerks’ careers and reputations. Clerks depend on judges for recommendations and career advancement. Even a lukewarm — let alone a negative — reference can tank a clerk’s career prospects. Years after a clerkship, a prospective employer may call an applicant’s references, but they’ll likely contact their judge.

Retaliation can be an explicitly negative reference during the job application process that blackballs the applicant. But there’s also the more insidious gossip an unhappy judge can circulate around a courthouse or throughout the legal community, which is much harder to prove and prevent.

Until the judiciary takes meaningful steps to prevent judges from retaliating against clerks who come forward, we cannot truly address wrongful conduct. Here are some changes the AO should implement to meaningfully address clerks’ concerns:

- Support the [Judiciary Accountability Act (JAA),](https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr4827/BILLS-117hr4827ih.pdf) which would extend Title VII protections, including protection against retaliation, to judiciary employees. It would also revise the judicial complaint process, standardize EDRs, create several confidential reporting channels, and establish a process to connect law clerks with legal counsel.
- [Train judges on their role as managers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/not-every-good-jurist-is-a-good-manager/), as well as on EDR. These trainings should be annual and mandatory. If they’re optional, judges who treat their clerks with respect will participate, while those engaging in misconduct will evade training.
- Warn judges they’ll be disciplined for retaliating against clerks who report mistreatment. [Fear of retaliation](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/fear-of-retaliation-silences-law-clerks-employers-should-speak-up) is the main reason clerks do not report, yet the judiciary has taken no meaningful steps to prevent this.
- Create a point of contact in each circuit for former clerks to seek help in preventing retaliation. Former clerks who reported and now fear retaliation could reach out to alert this contact of upcoming job interviews: the contact could remind the judge that retaliation is prohibited, and they’ll be disciplined for doing so.
- Collect and publicly report annual data on employees’ use of EDR (in addition to the results of the [planned Workplace Culture Assessment](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/federal-judiciary-survey-employees-nationally-harassment-misconduct-2022-09-20/)). EDR data can be anonymized. Clerks need to know if the process works.
These are back-end solutions for law clerks experiencing mistreatment. The judiciary should take forceful steps to ensure that fewer judges mistreat their clerks, and those who do are swiftly disciplined.

Given federal clerks’ lack of rights, protections, and resources, it’s particularly important for clerkship applicants to identify positive working relationships with judges. This is not a critique of clerking: it’s a critique of clerkship hiring. Applicants must be mindful about who they clerk for: they cannot be right now, due to the lack of transparency in the clerkship application process. Increasing transparency by [empowering clerks to share information](https://www.legalaccountabilityproject.org/clerkships-database) about judges in a verified, anonymous platform would prevent more negative experiences.

The AO must implement meaningful protection against retaliation to improve judiciary workplace culture. They should take workplace misconduct more seriously — acknowledging the scope of these problems and their role in correcting them.

At this week’s OJI information sessions, law clerks should ask:

- Why does the AO oppose the JAA?
- How does the AO protect clerks against retaliation?
- How frequently is EDR used by clerks, and what are the range of outcomes?
- How prevalent is workplace misconduct in the judiciary, and why hasn’t there been meaningful data collection?
Law clerks — and prospective clerks — cannot wait another year for urgently needed reforms. The federal judiciary’s modest efforts over the past few years are tone-deaf to law clerks’ concerns, particularly about retaliation, suggesting a lack of understanding about the day-to-day experience of clerking. Through meaningful reform, we can ensure the federal judiciary is an exemplary workplace for clerks — the public servants supporting the daily functioning of our courts.

# Top Biglaw Firm Raises Associate Salaries Because Of Course They Do
## Elite firms are piling on this new compensation scale.

It’s been a long, challenging year+ with a pandemic that just wouldn’t quit and legal work that also just wouldn’t stop. But now the COVID vaccine is widely available and Biglaw has decided to reward associates for their hard work with cold, hard cash.

The raise party got started with Milbank, but then Davis Polk came over the top. Now it’s just a race to see how quickly the firms can match that scale.

The latest firm to make news for associate raises is Goodwin Procter. It’s not a huge surprise that a firm ranked 23rd on the latest Am Law rankings is able to match these salary numbers (especially when [the firm is already going out of its way to court laterals](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/)), but it’s sure nice to see. For associates, the new compensation scale for U.S.-based associates at the firm will be as follows, effective July 1:

As for folks outside the U.S., the firm said they will continue to pay market-based salaries there. And for non-associates, this is what Goodwin is doing:

We are evaluating the impact of the increase to the associate salary scale on our counsel and other professional track attorneys on a case-by-case basis and expect to communicate the impact individually. Any change to compensation for professional track attorneys will also be effective July 1, 2021.

# Am I Underpaid?
## How much should a major Am Law attorney expect to earn?

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.mainspringlegal.com/management-team/) is the CEO of Lateral Link, Chairman of the Executive Committee, and Co-Managing Principal/Founder at Lateral Link. Based in the Los Angeles office, he focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies.

Most lawyers at Am Law 200 firms don’t ask whether they are overpaid. Most of our candidates genuinely believe they are either underpaid, or at most, compensated at market. That begs the question: How much should a major Am Law attorney expect to earn? Here are a few essential questions you may want to ask to get a better sense about your compensation.

1. Lockstep. If your firm is lockstep, you don’t really have much wiggle room to negotiate. Your question is more related to the difference between the profitability of your firm as compared to the profitability of your practice. On the high end, firms like Quinn, Irell, and Wachtell operate at around a 60% profit margin. That means for every dollar billed, around $0.60 goes towards profits. Firms on the lower end operate at around a 20% profit margin. That means for every dollar billed, around $0.20 goes towards profits. The reasons are sometimes obvious – leverage, bill rates, contingency wins, and fixed compensation of associates and staff. You should ask yourself: What is your practice’s profit margin, and is it more or less than that of the firm? If more, then you are likely cross-subsidizing others. If less, then stop reading this article and be thankful because you are likely over compensated.

2. Rule of Thumb. Although at most Am Law 200 firms associate compensation is fairly transparent, partners are oftentimes kept in the dark. Maybe a partner knows what she earned, as well as what the other 150 equity partners at the firm earned, but that doesn’t answer the question of whether the compensation is fair. Firms differ in the ways they credit some partners for originations as opposed to others for servicing the work. Even one step further, how transactions and matters are chopped up for credit purposes is oftentimes not all that transparent. For these partners, the best rule of thumb is to determine a percentage based on your originations. For highly leveraged practices, the percentage should be less than practices where the partner originates and services her own work. The 33% number most partners expect is actually higher than what most deserve (and actually receive). An easier way to draw lines in the sand is based on book size. If you originate around $1 million, you should expect around 40% (assuming you are working your own matters and transactions). If your book is north of $5 million, the conversation gets complicated and you can’t rely on any rule of thumb.

3. Deadweight. If your firm has senior statesmen (or even young bucks) who are no longer bringing in the business but are compensated as legacy partners or pegged at certain profit shares that were previously required to attract and retain them, I’d dive into the effects on profitability. Some firms try to address this issue with mandatory retirement policies or annual profit share resets. We come across senior statesmen who are still the breadwinners but their firms are hesitant to make mandatory retirement exceptions. We also see that firms can’t effectively recruit profitable partners with wishy-washy commitments subject to year-end share resets based on a look-back period. The bottom line is that the more deadweight the firm keeps onboard, the less money in the kitty to distribute year-end to those who are generating a greater portion of it.

4. Lateral Move. The only way to realize more pay is to move to another law firm willing to pay you more because they place a higher value on your contribution. Have you approached your firm Chairman and asked for a 20% bump? Let me know how that goes over. Another firm may value your practice more than your current firm for real reasons. Maybe your practice fills a void for another firm and 1 + 1 = 3. Like with selling a business, if a company blends its revenue into another enterprise that generates a higher multiple. Maybe moving your practice to another firm with leaner costs and higher leverage would generate higher profit margins and therefore more compensation for your practice. There are myriad reasons why lateral moves lead to increased compensation for partners with portable business. One reason alone is that the acquiring firm knows they need to pay you more to move your practice. Your existing firm probably asks a different question – how much do I need to pay you to keep you happy enough not to leave. The delta between “happy enough” and “move your practice” is pretty significant, and you won’t realize the bump without putting yourself on the market.

I am happy to try to field your compensation questions, but even if I can’t schedule a time to discuss, my colleagues are also well versed in the dialogue. At Lateral Link we’ve placed thousands of attorneys, and through our experience, we have seen pretty much everything – both bad and good – so if you are considering a transition, don’t make the mistake of negotiating against yourself because you don’t have sufficient information. Even if you are down the line in conversations, we can help give you some advice that may really move the needle.

The Scene – A Boardroom at Amazon.com’s HQ2. The room is filled with Executives. Jeff Bezos stands at the head of the table.

BEZOS: They thought me mad when I planned to sell books online. “People will never trust their credit card to the internet,” they said! “People need the tactile sensation of picking up a book,” they said! We proved them wrong, team; we proved them wrong!

EXECUTIVES: Hear hear! Harrumph!

BEZOS: SILENCE!

Silence.

BEZOS: They thought us mad once, and I promise you today, they will think us mad again. Inspiration has struck me, team. The divine muse of business has lain a wreath of knowledge upon my brow. Too long has Amazon structured itself like a technology company. Starting next week, we adopt that most august of business models…

The Executives lean in.

BEZOS: The law firm!

The Executives initially roar with approval, but soon subside into quizzical looks and sounds. One Executive at the foot of the table meekly raises their hand.

TIMID EXECUTIVE: What exactly does that mean, sir?

BEZOS: It means that I am no longer the sole voice in charge of Amazon. Every person in this room now has a say in all of Amazon’s decisions.

Astonished, happy cries.

BEZOS: And every person in the room next to us. And the next three rooms over. In fact, about 50 percent of the people in this building now have a vote, and we’re going to need most of us to agree on something before we can do anything.

TIMID EXECUTIVE: You mean every idea anyone has comes up to a vote for the entire company?

BEZOS: Oh heavens no! That wouldn’t work at all. Only the ideas that make it out of committee. If you’ll all please reach underneath your chairs, you’ll find packets with the 10-to-12 different committees to which you’ve been assigned. You’ll all notice you’ve been assigned to the Ad Hoc Special Committee On the Designation of New Committees, which I think speaks for itself.

The Executives open their envelopes.

TIMID EXECUTIVE: I think there’s been a mistake. It says here that I’m chair of the marketing committee? I don’t know the first thing about marketing.

BEZOS: Don’t you want to demonstrate that you’re a team player? Everyone needs to show that they’re willing to chip in for the betterment of the overall company, and what better way to do that than arbitrarily assign you to teams with tasks you lack the training for and see how you fare? Don’t worry, you’re not expected to have any training or knowledge. You are, however, expected to quickly develop intense, immutable opinions. Whether you base those opinions on relevant facts I will leave to your discretion.

TIMID EXECUTIVE: But how are we expected to get anything done?

BEZOS: That’s an excellent question. The answer is, I don’t know, so let’s form an Exploratory Team to learn how the rest of the market gets things done. We’ll then propose it to the appropriate committees, adopt a watered-down version of the process and then watch the company slowly drift back to doing what it always did. Ooh, you’ll need these!

Bezos pulls out a bucket of water balloons.

BEZOS: Head down to the lobby and start chucking these at whoever comes by. Anyone you hit is on the Exploratory Team.

And we can handle our compensation the same way! Anyone hit by a balloon gets a pay cut.

The Executives start filing out of the room. Bezos is looking at the agenda and doesn’t notice.

BEZOS: Alright, for our next order of business, let’s spend five minutes talking changes to the retirement plan, then have a 90-minute debate over what type of art to hang in the lobby. Remember, we’re running like a law firm now, so let’s keep it personal and keep it nasty, people!

END SCENE

* * *

Obviously I exaggerate, but ask yourself, by how much? Across the industry, the traditional law firm partnership model doesn’t scale well, and it’s not a simple thing to manage an organization with hundreds of people and thousands of moving parts. We lawyers aren’t trained for this sort of management, yet we’re expected to somehow make it work. The end result is often a kludge of systems that work just well enough to get by on, but don’t set firms up to thrive.

Much of this is an artifact of the relative insulation from competition that law firms have enjoyed for the past decades. Yes, law firms compete against one another, but that’s a much smaller pool of competition than the broader business world, which doesn’t require a JD to enter into. There aren’t that many of us in the big picture, and since most in our profession have no idea what we’re doing running large operations, there has been plenty of room for lumbering, inefficient firms to get by.

Those days are coming to an end. Alternative legal service providers like Axiom, UnitedLex, and the Big Four accounting firms are eating away at our market share, and they aren’t weighed down by the institutional bloat so common to our industry. These companies can draw on talent pools that are broader, deeper, leaner, and far hungrier than our own. More importantly, they can identify opportunities and risks quickly, and respond at the speed of thought. They’re the cavemen figuring out how to sharpen rocks and attach them to sticks. We’re looking more and more like the wooly mammoths.

The firms that survive the next decade will be the ones to have adopted practices from the larger business world. They need to convince their attorneys to delegate administrative and marketing tasks to qualified professionals, even if it costs more than having a partner do the work on their own time. They need to centralize decision making, reduce meetings and committees, and make their firms agile. They need to train their attorneys on the concept of “Disagree and Commit” — you might not like the way the firm is going, but once the decision is made you need to do everything in your power to make it work.

So basically, we just need to convince thousands of lawyers to give up power, give up control, and admit that they’re not necessarily the smartest people in the room at all times.

This should be simple, right?

# Fashion Victims: Dupes Are A Serious Problem
## Dupe culture has resulted in more than just bad-quality products; it has also given rise to illegal activities.

Remember a time when people would purchase knockoffs in secrecy? Thanks to Gen Z and their TikTok and Instagram influencers, these knockoffs have been rebranded into the socially acceptable realm of “dupes.” Influencers brag about “not wanting to gatekeep the perfect dupe” for viral products like the Bottega Venetta drop earrings, the Skims bodysuits, the Restoration Hardware cloud couch, and the Lululemon align leggings. While dupes are generally harmless, the phenomenon has ignited a broader cultural shift, impacting small brands, stifling creativity, and even veering into the realm of illegal activities.

Short for “duplicate,” “dupe” refers to a product that emulates another company’s product without attempting to deceive consumers about its origin. Dupes are typically legal and do not violate the intellectual property rights of the original company because they do not claim to be the original product and usually lack identical branding. Skims dupes are the perfect example. Fans of Skims appreciate the comfort and flattering fit of its basic stretchy tees, bodysuits, and shapewear. Influencers are identifying collections of similarly composed basics from various brands like Zara, H&M, and numerous others on Amazon as Skims dupes. Since the designs of these basic pieces generally do not qualify for intellectual property protection, Skims dupes, which do not feature the Skims logo, can be sold without the fear of infringement.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Members of Gen Z actively search for dupes on platforms like TikTok, Amazon, DHGate, and Shein. They eagerly share their findings with the rest of the world and boast about how much money they have saved from purchasing the dupe over the real thing. According to a study done by Marketplace Pulse for [The Fashion Law](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/for-some-brands-searches-for-dupes-top-those-for-the-real-thing/), Amazon searches for Skims dupes have surpassed searches for authentic Skims products. Marketplace Pulse founder Jouzas Kaziukènas told [The Fashion Law](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/for-some-brands-searches-for-dupes-top-those-for-the-real-thing/) that the growing number of searches for “Skims Dupes” on Amazon suggests that “just like shoppers on Canal Street, [these] buyers on Amazon are not getting tricked into buying knockoff Skims products — they know and want cheaper lookalike copies.”

The TikTok algorithm plays a significant role in the spread of this dupe culture craze. After lingering a few seconds too long on a video of an influencer spilling her “favorite dupe” for the $40 Dior lip oil, my For You page on TikTok exploded with influencers claiming I can get the same glow on my lips for less than $5. Videos on TikTok with the #dupe tag have been viewed over 3.5 billion times. Leveraging features like TikTok shop, influencers can post commissionable links to these dupes directly in their TikTok videos. There are thousands of videos that look almost identical, all hyping the same dubious products.

While true dupes may be perceived as harmless due to their legality, they harm small brands and stifle creativity. The association of the original product with an inferior and prolific dupe may cheapen the perception of the genuine item. Moreover, the allure of significantly lower prices for dupes often makes consumers hesitant to invest in the original product. Many Gen Z shoppers prioritize achieving a desired aesthetic over considerations of product quality and sustainability.

Marcelo Gaia, founder and designer of a small brand called Mirror Palais, is only one of the many designers who have been vocal about their disappointment with the rise of dupe culture. Gaia condemned a comment on his TikTok page expressing hope that Shein will create a dupe of his $800 design, as “shameful” and “disgusting” when posted on a small business’ page. Gaia also discussed his concerns over the “exploitative labor” and “unethical practices,” including child labor, that are associated with Shein, asking the commenter, “How do you lack a sense of empathy?”

Gaia has even found himself in the position of having to demonstrate to his followers that fast fashion dupes simply do not measure up to the quality of his original designs. But first he had to give a disclaimer to his sensitive Gen Z followers, expressing that he does not intend to hurt the feelings of people who cannot afford his products. In his TikTok video, Gaia compared the “biodegradable” and “hypoallergenic” silk fabric used in his garments to the “synthetic” and “plastic-like” fake silk used in Shein’s dupes.

Gaia’s sentiment is widely shared. According to a survey of 3,000 Gen Z and millennial consumers conducted by Trustpilot, 30% to 49% of shoppers are disappointed with the dupes they purchased online. Dupe influencers are even facing criticism for sharing bad-quality dupes, which they often fail to purchase themselves before advertising to their substantial followings. One influencer warned her followers never to buy dupes from influencers who do not personally try on the product. When trying on a dupe of a viral dress from a brand called Area, she exclaimed, “Is this a joke? This is awful.”

Dupe culture has resulted in more than just bad-quality products; it has also given rise to illegal activities. Semantically, the definition of a dupe does not encompass products that violate the intellectual property rights of the original company. However, influencers are also promoting counterfeits under the guise of dupes.

Unlike dupes, counterfeits are illegal copies of products, which are intended to deceive consumers into believing they are purchasing the real product. Counterfeit products infringe on the intellectual property of the original product, including any trademarked, copyrighted, or patented design. While Skims T-shirts and Lululemon leggings do not reach the bar of intellectual property protection, Prada loafers and Loewe tank tops bearing brand logos do. Thus, exact replicas of these branded products constitute illegal counterfeits. Influencers are unboxing these counterfeits with their followers, normalizing them as being cool, trendy, and budget friendly. In reality, they are connecting their followers to criminals selling them illegal, poor quality, and potentially unsafe products.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to recreate a look for less. However, resorting to counterfeits and supporting unethical fast fashion companies is not the solution. Influencers must be educated as to the risks associated with promoting counterfeits. Many may not be aware of the illegality of their actions, such as the fact that the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 makes it a felony to intentionally traffic or attempt to traffic in goods and services and knowingly use a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services. Influencers should also be encouraged to guide their followers toward prioritizing quality over quantity. This not only ensures longer-lasting products and cost savings in the long run but also supports more ethical and sustainable production practices.

Such platforms as TikTok and Amazon, where the sale of dupes and counterfeits are prevalent, must also take action to curb the expansion of dupe culture. Although TikTok has established community guidelines that prohibit users from sharing any content that violates or infringes upon another party’s intellectual property rights, the enforcement seems lacking. There’s a need for more robust measures, such as blocking dupe-related hashtags and suspending accounts associated with dupe influencers.

Amazon has demonstrated a more proactive approach. In April, Amazon announced the Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange, an industry collaboration that allows participating retail stores to share information about sellers of counterfeits on their platforms. This initiative aims to create a database for identifying and stopping counterfeit perpetrators. In addition, Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit (CCU) conducted dozens of raids this year on counterfeit operations across the globe. Amazon also reported that it sued or referred for investigation more than 1,300 criminals in China, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and disposed of more than 6 million counterfeit products. Maria Boschetti, a spokesperson for Amazon, also shared that the company does not allow sellers to use words like “dupe” or “fake” when describing products on the site.

# In-House Lawyers Plan To INCREASE Spend on Outside Counsel: Lobster Dinners For Everyone!
## 2018 could be the first year to see an increase in spend since 2007.

For a decade now, the trend has been for in-house counsel to decrease their spend with outside attorneys while they bring more and more work in-house. It’s cheaper that way.

But Altman Weil’s annual in-house survey suggests that trend is going to finally start moving in the other direction. From Corporate Counsel:

The report said 40 percent of respondents plan to increase their outside counsel spend in 2018, while only 33 percent anticipate a decrease. While that hasn’t happened since before the financial crisis of 2008, the report said the gap between internal and outside counsel spend has been narrowing over the last three years.

“After years of belt-tightening, perhaps some of the [financial] pressure is easing,” said Rees Morrison, an Altman Weil principal and co-author of the report. “And perhaps some people are just being more honest. For years it’s been politically correct to say they were doing more with less every year.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This is good news for everybody. Seriously, EVERYBODY WINS.

* Biglaw attorneys get more money. They like money.

* In-house attorneys get less work they don’t want to do. They like working on things they should be working on, not on things that outside counsel are supposed to do.

There is one main reason to use outside counsel: manpower. Biglaw firms can just throw bodies at your problem. Using them for their raw hours power helps in-house lawyers. In-house departments are small (relative to a Biglaw firm) and you don’t want to tax the whole department on one or two special projects.

You also don’t want to tax them with “churn” stuff that is not particularly interesting or important, but just takes a lot of time. That’s the other thing outside counsel can be useful for. You’ve got something annoying that has to be done every six months, throw that to Biglaw. Then you can focus on the interesting parts of your job and getting home in time for dinner. Using outside counsel efficiently and effectively just makes your life better as an in-house attorney.

Biglaw is happy to do the work. They’ve got junior associates who need to be trained with your churn. They’ve got senior people who live for the special, novel issues of your business. Again, everybody wins.

And it’s not like large corporate clients can’t afford to ship out the work. The market is up, Cut Cut Cut Cut Cut Reform is happening. Trickle those breaks down to your outside counsel. What else are you going to do with it? You can tell the mouth breathers on television that tax reform will “inspire” capital investments, but we know better. The lawyers are going to taste those tax breaks long before the lower-middle class wage earner.

Of course, law firms are going to have to compete for the work:

Asked what percentage of outside counsel fees last year were for work that could have been done by many different law firms, the median response was 41 percent to 50 percent. This suggests “that law departments have considerable negotiating power,” the report added.

Morrison noted, “It may be that many law firms can do a fair portion of your work, but you still have to find them and get comfortable with them. It doesn’t mean we know who they are.”

The Knicks might not stink this year. I suggest that you Biglaw rainmakers get some tickets: looks like there will be some in-house lawyers who will need to be wined and dined in 2018.

# You Will Absolutely Believe James Ho's Financial Connection To Plaintiffs In The Abortion Pill Case
## Republican jurists may not think women deserve autonomy over their own bodies, but they sure can have their own bank accounts -- that just *happen* to accept money from right wing sources with business before the judges.

(via YouTube)

The dissent/concurrence in the abortion pill case penned by the Fifth Circuit’s James Ho is sure  [attention grabbing](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/james-ho-abortion-pill/). Ho would have gone even further to the right than the conservative majority and would have revoked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decades-old approval of mifepristone and recognize an “aesthetic injury” — pulled (and misapplied) from environmental law for doctors that have patients who have abortions.

Now The Lever has a [report](https://www.levernews.com/trump-judges-anti-abortion-ruling-followed-payments-from-group-leading-case/) on the financial entanglement between the judge and the Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the conservative [forces behind that exact abortion case](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/08/16/1194280392/ruling-deals-blow-to-access-to-abortion-pill-mifepristone-but-nothing-changes-ye#:~:text=The%20Alliance%20Defending%20Freedom%2C%20which,with%20the%20Alliance%20Defending%20Freedom.) (ADF is primary counsel in the mifepristone case).

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Which, come to think of it, [sounds eerily familiar. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/that-perfectly-innocent-way-one-funnels-money-to-the-spouse-of-a-supreme-court-justice-while-trying-to-avoid-a-paper-trail/)

It seems Ho’s wife, [Allyson Ho](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/ho-allyson-n/), a partner at Gibson Dunn, has repeatedly participated in events with — and accepted speaking fees from — you guessed it: the Alliance Defending Freedom. In fact, for every year between 2018 and 2021 she’s accepted honoraria from ADF (financial disclosures for 2022 are not yet available). The judiciary’s recusal rules leave quite a bit to be desired, so there’s not a clear violation of ethics, but as Gabe Roth of Fix the Court notes, it sure looks squiky:

“The bottom line is that any entity that is putting money in your spouse’s bank account raises a potential for impropriety if you sit on one of those cases,” said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a watchdog group that advocates for federal court reform. “The money was put there in the last couple of years, it’s not like that’s easily forgettable.”

And there are further overlaps between Allyson Ho’s advocacy work and ADF:

Court filings [show](https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/17-565-petition.pdf) Allyson Ho separately worked [alongside lawyers](https://adflegal.org/press-release/us-supreme-court-declines-resolve-confusion-freedom-pray-public-meetings) from the Alliance Defending Freedom on an unsuccessful petition to the Supreme Court arguing that justices should allow Christian county commissioners to begin hearings by requesting members of the public stand and join them in prayer.

Now, it’s completely likely Ho would have written the same decision if his family never got a penny from ADF. His jurisprudence has been reliably right wing and he seems eager to[ prove his conservative bona fides](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/trump-appointed-judge-james-ho-uses-dissent-to-peacock-his-love-of-country-in-case-trump-gets-elected/). But remember federal judges are supposed to avoid even the “appearance of impropriety,” and seeing counsel for the plaintiffs in a high profile case show up on a judge’s financial disclosure form without recusal gives off exactly that appearance.

James Ho responded to the controversy: “I consulted the judiciary’s ethics advisor prior to sitting in this case and was advised that there was no basis for recusal. In any event, Allyson’s practice is to donate honoraria to charity.”

Do we even want to know which charity? Because [ADF is a 501(c)(3)](https://adflegal.org/article/what-nonprofit) nonprofit…

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Use your common sense. We’re New Yorkers. It’s why we’re here.

If you do that, there will be a very swift not guilty verdict.

— Todd Blanche, attorney to Donald Trump, in an attempt to appeal to the jury while [wrapping up his opening statement](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-22-24/h_6a5542ec724f2399e79857461afc11e1) in the former president’s hush-money trial.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 11.29.18
## * Trump's talking about pardoning Manafort again. The power of the president to pardon people is clear, but the power of the president to tease a pardon to tamper with a witness is an interesting legal wrinkle. In a way, the pardon power is a Yoda conundrum: ""do or do not, there is no publicly Tweeting signals."" [[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/28/671497142/trump-steps-up-mueller-attacks-following-report-about-briefing-from-manafort-law)] * Speaking of Manafort, his attorneys claim their joint defense agreement covered his tipping off Trump on details of the Mueller investigation. Except... he pleaded guilty. That kind of ends the ""joint defense"" part. [[The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/418816-manafort-trump-talks-baffle-legal-community)] * Jeffrey Epstein's massive child sex ring allegations ended in a 13-month sentence and the prosecutor who bent over backward to protect him is now in Trump's cabinet. Oh, and somehow Cy Vance's obsequious starf**king ass shows up in this story because of course it does. [[Miami Herald](http://amp.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html)] * It's been a few days, so it's time to remind everyone that the Big 4 accounting firms are about to wreak havoc on Biglaw. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/11/29/big-laws-trojan-horse-are-the-big-four-preparing-an-invasion/)] * Stacey Abrams is suing over Georgia's voting laws, and Professor Hasen is here to explain how brilliant this suit is. [[Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/11/stacey-abrams-georgia-voting-rights-lawsuit.html)] * Uber ordered to pay more than $1 million in fines because they failed to notice the surge pricing on data breach liability. [[Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2018/11/28/uber-hit-with-more-than-1m-in-fines-over-2016-breach/)] * Attorney poised to become godparent to royal baby.

It's probably not confusing: they just want to kill it and lying about it is the easiest path.

# One Of World's Richest Biglaw Firms Finally Adopts New Salary Scale

Another day, another global firm that’s decided to increase salaries for attorneys across the board. This is a trend that associates will never get tired of hearing about; after all, the only thing that lawyers love more than rankings is money. Which firm is the latest to adopt the prevailing Davis Polk salary scale?

That would be the U.S. branch of Eversheds Sutherland, an international firm that was declared the 10th richest firm in the world in Am Law’s most recent Global 200 ranking. According to a memo sent earlier this week by U.S. CEO Mark Wasserman, compensation changes are on the way for associates:

To reflect our markets and our standing as a premier global firm, we are pleased to announce we will be adjusting our base associate compensation sale for all U.S. offices. Entry level rising to $205,000 with upward adjustments to all level ranges and the Level 3 upper range rising to $350,000.

These changes are effective September 1, 2021 and will be retroactive to July 1, 2021.

Associates will have to wait a few months to see the extra cash, but as we keep repeating when it comes firms that are late to enact these salary changes, better late than never. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Eversheds Sutherland.)

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Announcing Salary Cuts The Friday Afternoon Before A 3-Day Weekend Leads To Some ANGRY Associates
## Associates will see 20 percent cuts as of June 1.

Salary cuts are always shitty. I mean, hopefully, they spare folks’ jobs but they are never fun to deal with. And they’re extra annoying when announced the Friday afternoon before a three-day weekend. But I guess COVID-19 doesn’t take a break for the holiday, so neither do austerity measures. And that’s exactly what happened at Troutman Sanders — no wonder we’ve gotten so many angry emails.

So, what’s going on at the firm? Twenty percent pay cuts for associates and even more for partners. As a tipster explains:

We just learned that equity partners are receiving an annualized 18.5% pay cut, non-equity partners are receiving a 14% cut, and associates are receiving an 11.7% cut, but this equates into a minimum 30%, 25% and 20% cut, respectively, per paycheck going forward from June 1 through end of year.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Which considering their soon-to-be merger partner, Pepper Hamilton, [has already made similar cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/biglaw-firm-cuts-associate-salaries-as-it-continues-soldiering-on-with-merger/?rf=1), it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise. (Yes, the merger is still a go for July 1.) But that doesn’t mean folks at the firm aren’t pissed. Here’s a sampling of some of the reactions we’ve received about the pay cuts:

This is across the board, taking no consideration of whether a group is busy or not. I’m extremely upset as an associate in a group that has not slowed down, but is just as busy or busier than before— yet I’m expected to work that amount above expectations at 20% less pay? We keep being told our firm is healthy financially and better suited to weather the storm than others, yet we just got a cut that’s at the very top end of what other firms are doing. There is no insight into how they will compensate us for that, but we already know the Troutman bonus structure is already a total joke, so I’m not expecting that the right thing will be done then either and I’ll likely be making a move. Oh, and we are still merging with Pepper Hamilton in July 1…

TL;DR: everyone is pissed and management needs to take a course on how to deliver bad news to people.

Everyone is livid.

[T]he salary cuts are needed to subsidize and fund the Pepper merger which is what has everyone up in arms. Enough to where management has scheduled a follow up Q&A session next Wednesday. Leadership is so enthralled with becoming an AMLAW 50 firm that it’s making some very poor decisions. Why not just push the merger to January 1 at the very least

We reached out to the firm for comment, but have yet to hear back.

# Will This Firm's Bonuses Prove Troubling For Associate Taxes?

UPDATE (12/29 11:57 a.m.): After much going back and forth, it appears that Bryan Cave issued bonuses in December last year and the info we had suggesting they didn’t may have been a unique situation impacting only some associates. But the analysis it makes about the perils of payout dates and the tax bill are still important if any other firms do change dates, so we’re keeping it up.

Generally speaking, we approve of firms that pay their bonuses before the end of the calendar year — making them true holiday bonuses — as opposed to those who screw around and distribute bonuses in January or beyond. It’s not just a dick move because it robs associates of an influx of cash around the holidays, but it’s also deliberately designed to disrupt the lateral market, keeping some associates artificially tied to their old firms lest they forego thousands of dollars to make the leap.

But tipsters at Bryan Cave, which recently announced [bonuses that left a bit to be desired](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/firms-complex-bonus-structure-providing-most-associates-with-less-than-their-peers/), say the firm has also irked associates by agreeing to pay out bonuses this calendar year. What’s the complaint?

To add salt to the wound on BC bonuses — they were paid out today [December 22], but last year’s bonuses were paid out in January 2017. So two bonuses in one year.

UPDATE: Again, this doesn’t appear to apply to Bryan Cave as a whole, but consider this situation generally.

On the one hand, that’s just something associates have to suck up for the greater good. Any firm paying bonuses in the next calendar year that wanted to do right by associates would have to put their people through this once with a two-bonus transition year that people would have to report on their taxes. So if this is a permanent change designed to move the firm to awarding bonuses within the calendar year, then it’s worth it.

On the other hand, the timing is a bit… fishy. Just like those surprise AT&T bonuses. While the conservative media declared trickle-down economics definitively proven — and ignored that AT&T immediately followed these bonuses with [layoff announcements](http://www.newsweek.com/christmas-att-layoffs-midwest-bonuses-trump-758391) — astute tax lawyers and accountants noted that AT&T’s bonuses were [saving the company millions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/timing-is-vital-as-companies-set-bonuses-spending-before-new-tax-law-1513897083) because they were rammed through to give the company a bigger deduction before its tax rate goes down (and, by extension, decreases the impact of a deduction). Now partnerships don’t have the hefty corporate tax coming that AT&T does, but they are about to see their individual tax rates reduced, so there’s more than a little reason to suspect this move had less to with giving associates a happy holiday as it did with giving the partners a bigger deduction before the more regressive tax rates kick in. Meanwhile, the associates will face the higher 2017 tax rate on both bonuses.

Which may not be bad for everyone. If they’re working in one of the California offices, maybe they can use this bonus to [pre-pay their state and local taxes](http://ktla.com/2017/12/27/homeowners-in-high-tax-states-scramble-to-pre-pay-property-taxes/). For others, family status, AMTs, the risk — especially for more senior associates — of potentially landing in a higher bracket next year could all make this early bonus better for some. Tax impacts vary, but there’s probably at least one unfortunate associate out there who is about to be out of a bigger chunk of this bonus than they otherwise might be.

So, on balance, it’s all well and good for firms to move up previously late bonuses. But if taking advantage of this one-time deduction advantage is the only motivation for this decision, then there’s nothing stopping a firm from reverting to its later payout date to award 2018 bonuses in 2019 and leaving lawyers with no bonuses at all during the next tax year.

Something to keep our eyes on.

# Lawyers Can Be Sadistic Sometimes, Often To A Client's Detriment
## Most lawyers are regular people. ... Most.

There is a stereotype that lawyers are often aggressive professionals who will stop at nothing in order to obtain an advantage for a client. Some people might think that many attorneys do not extend courtesies and niceties in how they practice law so that they can be singularly focused on serving their client’s needs. Fortunately, many lawyers are not as mean as lawyers are stereotypically portrayed, but some attorneys go over the top in inflicting pain and stress on their adversaries. Often, lawyers seemingly have no purpose other than to obtain personal gratification at causing irritation to others since clients can frequently best be served if counsel have a solid working relationship with their counterparts. Although such sadistic lawyers are common in legal practice, clients and colleagues alike should curb the antics of lawyers who seem to have no other purpose than to infuriate and inflict pain on adversaries and third parties.

Let me first say at the onset that most lawyers are regular people who just do their jobs, make their arguments, and seemingly take no pleasure at stressing people out or pointlessly arguing small matters. Legal practice is stressful enough that adversaries do not need to make matters worse by contributing to a bad working relationship. I’d say about nine out of 10 of the adversaries I have worked with in my career fit this description, although I bet this proportion varies by practice area.

However, every so often I meet adversaries that seem to genuinely enjoy arguing everything, making threats, and doing whatever they can to make their adversaries’ lives miserable. The first time I ever saw this phenomenon was when I was a “baby lawyer” earlier in my career. The adversary I was dealing with argued everything, down to the most minuscule points in compliance conference orders. He would send me numerous emails threatening sanctions, and would often CC: his client, which only escalated matters. The adversary refused to engage in small talk over the phone or at conferences, and just seemed like a very unhappy person.

I got the sense that the adversary might have become a lawyer because of a desire to make people miserable and have an outlet for his sadistic tendencies. Of course, I did not know what this person was like in his private life, but the adversary never smiled, always seemed to have a red face, and did not have friends in court. I think this counterpart genuinely got a kick out of making everyone’s lives more miserable in an odd way.

At another time in my career, I dealt with an adversary who was an unusual pain to deal with. He refused to email anything, and he refused to accept service if anything was emailed to him. If something was not received by counsel, this adversary claimed it had been mailed, but of course, things would have been easier if he just emailed documents to counterparts like a normal person who practices law in the 21st century. This adversary made aggressive, over the top statements in emails, and routinely threatened to pursue sanctions, ethics grievances, and other consequences, even though the facts did not support such action. There seemed to be a certain kind of glee that this person had when he made a crazy argument or pursued an unusual strategy, and the adversary seemed to enjoy making his counterparts more miserable with his antics.

Sometimes, lawyers make their adversaries’ lives miserable in ways that do not help their clients. In certain instances, lawyers act aggressively and continue to litigate matters, even though their clients might be willing to settle things, and do not have the willingness to keep fighting over the details. One time, I was at a mediation, where a truly sadistic lawyer I had been dealing with kept going on and on about how his client had been royally wronged in the case and how they would not accept anything less than a given number. At one point, the client, to everyone’s shock, spoke up and said that he actually would consider resolving the matter for below this sum. This adversary’s desire to keep fighting and pontificating almost got in the way of serving the client by resolving a matter and following the client’s wishes.

Moreover, sadistic lawyers might get a bad reputation in the legal community, which can hurt them in future cases. The legal profession is much smaller than people might think, and attorneys and clients often ask around when they are seeking to retain counsel. If a lawyer is seen as particularly unpleasant to deal with, this can hurt the lawyer when it comes to resolving matters down the road and even with retaining clients.

All told, some lawyers seemingly join the legal profession as an outlet for their desire to argue and be annoying to adversaries and others. Such behavior is very counterintuitive and can make it difficult for the lawyer to serve their clients and earn a solid reputation in the legal profession.

# U.S. Export Controls And Sanctions: What We Know And Where We’re Headed
## In this rapidly changing political environment, do you have the knowledge you need to keep clients informed?

Companies and financial institutions rely on their counsel to stay on top of current and upcoming sanctions and export controls policies. In this rapidly changing political environment, do you have the knowledge you need to keep clients informed? 

In both business and finance, organizations must be aware of their compliance and disclosure obligations, enforcement trends and priorities, and emerging risks. And it’s not enough to simply know about them – in all industries, companies are expected to make compliance programs a priority, or risk steep penalties.  

The Trump administration has implemented numerous sanctions and export control measures. Under the incoming Biden administration, we are certain to see these policies evolve.  Here are some examples of the current landscape and what to anticipate in the years ahead:

In an attempt to limit Huawei’s access to products using U.S. semiconductor software and technology, the Trump administration’s Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) expanded and extended U.S. export controls jurisdiction to certain items when destined for Huawei or its affiliates that are designated on the BIS Entity List.

Additionally, BIS issued a final rule that significantly expands the restrictions in connection with transfers of certain items subject to the Export Administration Regulations for “military end use” and “military end users” in China, Russia, and Venezuela. 

Another Trump administration policy resulted in the passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (HKAA).  The HKAA represented changes to, and the tightening of, U.S. export control restrictions applicable to Hong Kong in an attempt to maintain the autonomy of Hong Kong. The HKAA expands the range of persons potentially subject to U.S. sanctions – those involved in compliance should stay on top of this.  

Finally, the Trump administration relied on economic tools of coercion to further foreign policy aims. U.S. sanctions against Iran have continued to escalate, resulting in multilateral tensions. Sanctions against Russia may increase if concerns are raised about attempted interference in the presidential election. Under a Biden administration, will we see alignment between the U.S., EU and Canada with respect to these sanctions? Stay tuned.   

Of course, with sanctions come countersanctions. Russia, the EU, and China, among others, have increased the use of countersanctions to push back against U.S. sanctions and to threaten economic harm against parties that choose to comply with U.S. requirements. Any such measures could influence the policies of the incoming administration.  

In the face of these complex, changing issues, anyone involved in compliance should make sure they understand where we’ve been, and where we’re going, in order to help clients develop best practices for trade controls and other activities. 

For over twenty years, Practising Law Institute (PLI) has offered the go-to program on trade control laws and regulations. At PLI’s December 10 live webcast, [Coping with U.S. Export Controls and Sanctions](https://bit.ly/2JcA7NT), high-level officials from the Departments of Commerce, State, Treasury, and Justice will provide an inside look at these topics. The program will include interactive discussions among key officials from the government agencies that regulate cross-border trade and investment, as well as experienced corporate executives and top lawyers in the field.

[](https://bit.ly/2IKiAfB)Practising Law Institute is a nonprofit learning organization dedicated to keeping attorneys and other professionals at the forefront of knowledge and expertise. PLI is chartered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York and was founded in 1933 by Harold P. Seligson. The organization provides the highest quality, accredited, continuing legal and professional education programs in a variety of formats which are delivered by more than 4,000 volunteer faculty including prominent lawyers, judges, investment bankers, accountants, corporate counsel, and U.S. and international government regulators. PLI publishes a comprehensive library of Treatises, Course Handbooks, Answer Books and Journals also available through the PLI PLUS online platform. The essence of PLI’s mission is its commitment to the pro bono community. View PLI’s upcoming live webcasts [here](https://bit.ly/2IKiAfB).

# Another Top 50 Biglaw Firm Shows It's At The Top Of The Associate Compensation Heap
## It's good to be at the top.

Lots of Biglaw firms like to wait until the end of the day to announce compensation news — I suppose the theory is it’s less distracting that way. Which ignores the obsessive refresh of Above the Law as associates’ jealousy mounts with each additional announcement from a peer firm, but I digress. It’s after 5 p.m. on the East Coast and we’ve seen a rush of raise announcements come in. The latest is from Debevoise.

Last year, Debevoise & Plimpton made $1,329,700,000 in gross revenue, making it No. 35 on the Am Law 100. So yeah, they’re just the sort of firm that is going to keep up with the very top of Biglaw when it comes to associate compensation. That means the below scale, which matches the standard set by Cravath, is the new salary grid at the firm.



Congratulations to associates at Debevoise on your raises!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# South Florida: A Destination For Associates To Call Home
## It is an exciting time to be in Miami. People are flocking here in droves from all corners of the world.

[](http://bit.ly/2X67jg4)South Florida has always been known as a destination for retirees and people who want a more laidback lifestyle. Even 13 years ago when I moved here, Miami felt like a second-rate city (especially in comparison to the cosmopolitan, world-class feel that the greater downtown Miami area possesses today). But over the past decade, law firms and businesses have been setting up shop throughout South Florida, with many organizations headquartering their Latin America operations here. 

Today, cities such as Miami and Ft. Lauderdale are attracting younger professionals from all over the country who have been looking for a better work/life balance and quality of life overall. If you are an associate attorney thinking about relocating, South Florida presents a multitude of opportunities for those looking to put down roots. 

The Law Firm Scene

Though many of the law firms in South Florida have been here for decades, over the past 10 years, many Am Law firms have decided to penetrate this market and open offices. Currently, South Florida is home to 39 Am Law 200 firms and counting. The ever-increasing investment into the area has led to a number of these firms adding a lot of top quality talent to their ranks, including a good number of associates who have relocated from other markets. In fact, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the market has grown by more than 4,700 lawyers over the past decade — that’s a growth of more than 30 percent, three times faster than the rest of the job market.

What Firms Are Looking For

Many come here lured by the beaches, perceived relaxed lifestyle and lack of state income tax, but those that find the most success in the area are associates who have a tie to the area and a plan to make a home in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and the surrounding cities. 

Considering the cost of hiring and training an attorney, law firms are most interested in those attorneys who are committed to making a career for themselves in the area and dedicating their career to this business community. There is a strong value on community, and in South Florida, you have to not only be relationship-focused but also work smart. 

The market is in rapid growth mode, so standing out is key. Firms typically want associates with three to six years of experience, top academic credentials and training from firms in the most sophisticated markets. However, being successful in another city does not always guarantee success here. Those from the East Coast tend to acclimate better than those from the West. As do those practicing in the most in demand areas: 

- General corporate (especially Mergers & Acquisitions and Private Equity) 
- General commercial litigation 
- International arbitration and dispute resolution 
- International tax 
- Commercial real estate 
- Land use 
- Insurance (mostly defense and coverage) 
- Labor and employment   
What Is Required to Practice 

If you are ready for the move and the commitment to the market, be aware that Florida does not offer reciprocity between other jurisdictions. Anyone who intends to practice law in the state must pass the Florida Bar. In order to sit for the Florida Bar exam, you must have graduated from a U.S.-accredited law school, which means foreign applicants will need more than an LL.M. 

This is often a huge shock to international associate attorneys who practice law in New York for a top-tier firm and possess an LL.M from a U.S.-accredited law school. Many, especially those from Latin America, think that the obvious next step in their career is relocation to Miami. This is just not possible even though Miami is becoming more and more of a hotbed for foreign investment.

While the Florida Bar is required, most firms are open to hiring candidates who are willing to sit for next Florida Bar exam — and willing to support them taking the time off to study for and take the exam. Many firms will also provide ample relocation packages to help cover moving expenses. 

Life in South Florida

South Florida is growing at rapid speeds, and Miami, in particular, is a city on the rise. Today, “Brickell” alone boasts Mary Brickell Village, which is filled with exclusive, high-end retail and restaurants. While Brickell City Center, a five-million square foot complex, spans more than five city blocks and contains high-end shops (Saks Fifth Avenue is their anchor store), office towers and a five-star hotel. Luxury high rise condominiums are continuously being built as more young professionals and foreign investors turn toward Miami as a place to live and/or invest. 

The Pérez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) and Frost Museum of Science are two great cultural additions to the “downtown” area of Miami’s business district. The annual Art Basel Festival, Miami Food & Wine Festival, and Miami Boat Show are just a few examples of the excellent cultural offerings that the city possesses. 

People are more attracted to South Florida for the temperate climates and lower cost of living than other major East Coast cities. 

Working with a Recruiter

Teaming up with a tenacious, relationship-focused legal recruiter is the best move an associate can make before relocating to any city. A recruiter who has lived and worked in a particular market for a long time and has the backing of a strong, progressive recruitment firm will be able to provide guidance that is tailored to your goals and experiences. They will know the ins and outs of the local law firms and have access to both local and national information. They will also be able to guide you through every step of the process from applying to the firm and setting up interviews to negotiating a relocation package.  

It is an exciting time to be in Miami. People are flocking here in droves from all corners of the world. Anyone who relocates here (including myself) and stays here really learns to love and appreciate this city. The best talent is in demand to help make this area one of the very best business centers in our country. If Miami is on your mind, reach out to a reputable legal recruiter. Together, we can help raise this city to its full potential.

[](https://amzn.to/2NgZq0T)For better or worse, Biglaw is [more of a business than it ever has been](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/what-do-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-partnership/). It’s no longer the case that you join a firm after law school, work hard and make partner, and remain at the firm until you retire or die. Instead, partners regularly [part ways with their longtime firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/major-lateral-moves-its-open-season-on-cleary-partners/), in search of better platforms — and bigger paychecks.

In this environment, it’s more important than ever for lawyers — and not just partners, but counsel and associates as well — to understand and excel at business development and marketing. If you want a [long and successful career](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/5-tips-for-having-a-long-and-successful-legal-career/) at a law firm, you need to be not just an excellent attorney, but also a talented marketer.

How can you become a Biglaw business-development whiz? It’s not easy; many [major rainmakers](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-business-development-7-tips-from-top-rainmakers/) will tell you that it took them years to master the art. But you can definitely give yourself a head start through reading and research.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
My recommendation: Start with [Best Practices in Law Firm Business Development and Marketing](https://amzn.to/2NgZq0T) by [Deborah Farone](https://deborahfarone.com/about/), published earlier this year by the Practising Law Institute (PLI). Farone, the founder of the [Farone Advisors](https://deborahfarone.com/) consultancy and former chief marketing officer at two of the nation’s finest firms, Cravath and Debevoise, interviewed numerous Biglaw business generators, as well as other industry experts, to learn the secrets of their success.

I recently spoke with Deborah Farone about her book and about Biglaw business development more generally. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

DL: What inspired you to write the book?

DF: I felt that there was a real need in the marketplace to study the best practices in business development. I knew there was keen interest in two related subjects: One was in learning what it was that certain law firms were doing to consistently drive profitability and foster a positive culture, and the other was the curiosity about the habits of great rainmakers.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Around this same time, as I was thinking about starting a consulting practice, I was approached by PLI to write a book on legal marketing. Although I knew a lot about the world of large law firms and their operations, I always wanted to learn about best practices and innovation in other sectors of the legal profession, including midsize firms and boutiques. Conducting the research with academics, technologists, and other thought leaders and writing a book was an ideal opportunity to do this.

DL: As I know from [my own experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/books/david-lats-supreme-ambitions-is-a-thriller-for-lawyers.html), writing a book is a challenging and demanding endeavor. What did you think of the process?

DF: I gave myself a year to write it and I finished within that year. I mapped out a series of deadlines and devoted every morning from 6 to 11 to work on the book, assuming I wasn’t traveling to a client’s office. I interviewed more than 60 people for the book, so it involved a lot of juggling of schedules. I had to attack it in a very organized and disciplined way to complete the project.

DL: Your book isn’t just a primer on business development, but it’s also a portrait of Biglaw over time. I love the opening, where you paint a vivid picture of what Debevoise was like back in 1989. What would you identify as the single biggest change in this world over the past three decades?

DF: One big change that reverberates throughout many parts of the profession is that general counsel are in the driver’s seat more than ever before. Compared to their predecessors, today’s GCs are very sophisticated consumers of legal services, command larger departments, and have more tools at their disposal. In the past, if the GC had a new legal problem, they’d immediately look to their outside law firm. Today, they might turn to hiring additional lawyers in-house at a lower cost or using an alternative legal services provider. They’ve also acquired technology to address reoccuring issues and, as we’ve seen by the rise in influence of CLOC, brainy experts in legal operations are also there to help protect the company and manage legal costs.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
DL: What ramifications does this have for legal marketing?

DF: When marketing their services, firms need to ask themselves: are we doing something that adds value? Are we providing a service that a GC can’t simply do in-house? This thinking requires law firms to be more strategic in their offerings and in their branding. It is why many more firms are developing strategic plans for key practices or for entire firms. They are working to identify the areas where they can provide exceptional value and differentiate themselves from the firm down the street.

DL: Have law firms risen to the challenge? Have they gotten better at business development and marketing?

DF: Some have. In the book, I focus on innovative firms — firms like Orrick and Gunderson Dettmer, to name a few — and what they’re doing to succeed in business development. Marketing has to be involved, of course, but so does management. The focus needs to be all hands on deck, focusing on the client.

DL: Based on your research, can you offer some advice on how Biglaw partners can work most effectively with their Chief Marketing Officers and marketing teams?

DF: Marketing can’t be a back-office department that works somewhere in the Ozarks. Marketing folks need to be involved in the strategic direction of the firm. For example, when a firm hires a lateral partner, the marketing department should have a hand in everything from helping to think about how the lateral will fit into the business, what services they will bring to clients, and what the firm can do to ensure there is support for the lateral to succeed in their practice. The CMOs I’ve met are incredibly talented, but at times they’re under-utilized by their firms when it comes to their strategic capability.

Firm leadership needs to be in regular communication with their marketing group to let them know not only the state of the firm and what is transpiring, but to communicate that their work is central to the operations of the firm. At Cravath, both Evan Chesler and Allen Parker met with my department regularly to let us know about new opportunities and their goals for the firm. This conveyed to the marketing department that they were an integral part of the firm and on the same team as the lawyers.

DL: You mentioned integrating lateral partners, a subject of [great interest to me](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/) these days. Have firms gotten better about this process?

DF: Again, some have, and some haven’t. Today, many have a well-run integration program set up well before the partner even accepts the offer. They are thinking: Which clients will potentially use this partner? To which clients should the new partner be introduced, and by whom? Firms shouldn’t just count on lateral partners spinning gold from their own contacts when they arrive. If firms truly collaborate with new partners, the new partners are much more likely to stick. Close to 50 percent of lateral partners end up leaving the firm after five years. It’s expensive to bring on a lateral, so it behooves the firms to think seriously about how the partner will fit into the firm culture and business.

DL: Speaking of law firm culture, how does it affect marketing and business development?

DF: Firm leaders are so busy that they don’t always have time to stop and think about culture as a vital factor in the firm’s success, but if you think about it, culture is often the reason that firms maintain clients and talent, and grow revenue. If you have a culture where partners genuinely like each other, collaborate on bringing in new matters and serving their clients, you’ll have a much more robust business.

Dr. Heidi Gardner of Harvard has demonstrated this in her research. She found that if a client is served by more than one practice, there’s more of a chance of what she calls “stickiness,” and the firm is much more likely to retain the client. This requires a culture where partners like working with each other and have a compensation system that rewards this type of behavior. If you don’t pay attention to culture and just “let things happen,” you lose an opportunity to develop a stronger firm.

DL: Turning to associates, I personally think it’s good for them to start thinking about and understanding, early in their careers, how the business of Biglaw works (and Above the Law aims to help on this front). Do you have any recommendations for associates on what they can do in terms of BD?

DF: I agree. It’s never too early to start thinking about how you’re going to develop a practice, whether you’re planning to stay at your current firm or head someplace else. And that means building relationships. Associates need to work within the paradigm and rules of their own firms, but there are steps most can take.

Foremost, associates should develop relationships amongst themselves — their officemate might be a GC someday — and outside of the firm as well. This might involve using LinkedIn to stay in touch with business contacts, getting involved in leadership roles within bar associations, or serving on the board of a nonprofit in which you have an interest. I was on the board of the Girl Scouts of Greater New York for many years and from that experience, I met a host of people in various areas of business and industries, including banking and pharmaceuticals, who I would not have necessarily met in my marketing role.

DL: And what can firms do to encourage and support their associates in these efforts?

DF: Many firms provide forums for their associates to get to know colleagues at their level at the client, whether through substantive legal work or social activities. Some give associates a budget to take the client to lunch or an event. This helps create a “zippering effect,” where the firm has contact with the client at all different levels, and it also allows the associate to develop their business development skill.

Firms often tell associates, “Your job is to learn to be a great lawyer.” I agree, but I don’t think this is mutually exclusive with teaching them client and business development skills. If you don’t give associates training and exposure in business development and client service, you end up with a class of partners that has never done it before. Then you are in a position of having to train folks to acquire new habits and break old ones. The new partners have also missed out on years of making valuable connections.

I have been to a number of firms to speak with partners and senior associates. They want to learn how to develop business and they are interested in knowing how others in the profession do this. Lawyers tend to look for precedent, and I think by providing examples of behavior that has worked elsewhere, they are able to think about and incorporate what will work for them,

DL: What about business development and diversity? How do these concerns relate to each other?

DF: Of course, business development isn’t just an issue for diverse lawyers, it’s an issue for everyone. Firms should give everyone they tools they need for business development. We need to be sure that we are reaching everyone and spend extra time with those who need it most, regardless of their background.

Marketers can play a role in the conversation in terms of making sure firms recruit diverse candidates and retain and develop diverse lawyers. Firms are starting to track to see that diverse lawyers are being given the same assignments as everyone else. Firms need to ensure that diverse lawyers have the skills and exposure they need to develop their practices.

DL: Looking to the future, how will technology and innovation affect marketing and business development?

DF: Today’s legal technology is amazing, and there are wonderful tools that streamline processes that used to take lawyers a lot of time. Firms can provide equal if not better service in a more cost-effective way. Marketers can spend less time putting together reports and regression analyses and more time involved in strategic projects.

But the relationship aspect of doing business is still so vital. People want to work with people they like and trust. If the client doesn’t trust you, the innovative George Jetson environment you’ve created doesn’t matter. Skills, reputation and relationships are really everything in business.

DL: So very true. Congratulations again on the book, Deborah, and thanks for taking the time to share your insights and advice!

We appreciate that students at all levels of their studies are concerned about the impact COVID-19 might have on how they might be assessed in the future. We wanted to move swiftly and put their minds at rest.

— [Allison Friend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonfriend/), chief human resources officer at Hogan Lovells, in a message assuring law students that [the firm looks at more than just grades](https://www.law.com/2020/03/24/ahead-of-the-curve-the-uplifting-we-hope-edition/) and is willing to work with prospective candidates during these difficult times. Hogan Lovells further noted that during interviews, students will have the opportunity to “tell … [their] story when the time comes.”

# Lawyers Need To Invest In Professional Development

I interview [Elise Holtzman](https://thelawyersedge.com/about-us/meet-elise-holtzman/), President of The Lawyer’s Edge, who shares her journey from pre-med to law and discusses challenges faced by lawyers. She highlights the pressure being overwhelming leading to visible stress, but advises breaking down goals into smaller achievable tasks. Elise also points out that self-doubts often block individuals from expressing their needs or setting boundaries, and stresses the need to ignore such doubts as they are not based on reality. She encourages lawyers to seek help when stuck and to realize that progress requires new skills and habits, even if changing these seems hard.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# From Biglaw Partner To Legal Recruiter
## The path to recruiting was ""hardly a straight path.""

Jon Kahn is a Principal at Lateral Link based in their New York office.

Jon has over 25 years of legal industry experience having been a partner at major AmLaw firms in New York prior to founding his own executive legal search firm, JEK Partners in 2009.  As a result, Jon has a unique understanding of lateral hiring having been involved on both sides and at all levels. He works closely with both law firms and candidates and brings extensive market knowledge, deep relationships and strategic thinking to the lateral search process where he has successfully placed partners, counsel and associates across practice areas with leading law firms and companies throughout the United States and in London. Jon focuses mainly on partner, senior level attorneys and group placements in the US and London. He also enjoys working with associates, particularly in the corporate and finance area.

Jon is a former capital markets partner with Morrison & Foerster and White & Case in New York and began his corporate legal career as an associate at Cahill, Gordon & Reindel where he specialized in high yield transactions.

Why did you become a lawyer and years later make a career change to become a legal recruiter?

It was hardly a straight path.

I found myself in a predicament shared and repeated by many undergraduates since; I was a history major with a political science minor at Emory University, and my career options pointed to the law. Once I took the LSAT, there was no stopping the forward momentum. I studied at Georgetown University Law Center, summered at Fried Frank and started my Biglaw career  in 1990 with the plan to become a corporate lawyer.

In 2009, when the financial crisis hit, deal flow had dried up, hours were scarce and the future was uncertain. Major investment banks were going under as were law firms and the sense was there was more to come. This backdrop gave me the motivation to leave practicing law, which I had been considering for awhile.

With the lateral market largely at a standstill, I launched my legal recruiting career. My wife gave me practical advice: “People dream of starting their own business, with your relationships and expertise this is an exciting opportunity to start your next chapter.” I started my own firm, but I felt that although I knew a great deal about recruiting from the law firm side, I needed to learn the legal recruiting business. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to partner up with an experienced recruiter I knew for many years and greatly respected. With this career change I had more control of my life (no more working all weekend turning documents) and much more time to share with my family. I was able to find a balance of working very hard to grow my business, but also finding time to coach travel sports and take my daughter to soccer practice. This was a very welcome change.

What Advice Would You Give Junior Attorneys? 

For starters, pick the right practice. What interests you? Where do you excel?

When I started at Fried Frank, my plan was to become a corporate lawyer. However, the economy was entering into a recession, and while history has characterized it as mild, it did not feel that way at the time. Across the city, litigation and bankruptcy departments were busy, corporate groups were slow, so I ended up in litigation, which was not the plan. I was less concerned about my career path than survival and lasted four years, before I was offered a second chance to become a corporate attorney.

Once the market recovered, I receive a call from a legal recruiter and jumped at the opportunity to retool my Biglaw career at Cahill as a corporate and high yield associate. I gave back two years seniority to get back on track and it worked out. I found a practice I really liked. The high yield market became a very hot practice and other firms wanted to get into the practice area.  As a result, associates from the top high yield firms like Cahill were in high demand. This eventually led me to becoming a partner at White & Case, a top bank firm that was looking to add high yield expertise. The takeaway here is not to settle, follow the career path you envisioned for yourself.

Many factors can influence an associate’s experience and success. Some in your control and others outside of it. Too often, lawyers keep their head down and just take on the next deal or case and do not pause to consider their personal and career goals because they are to busy. While self-reflection can be hard, it will help you take ownership of your career. Be proactive and make informed decisions – to stay at your firm, to change practice area, to try and make partner, to make a lateral move to another firm (and the type of firm) or to begin a new career. Find your passion and take control of your life.

What parallels do you see between your start in law and today?

The US and Global economy, economic policy, regulatory schemes and new technology to name a few all impact law firms and their clients. It seems that every decade a major event occurs that impacts law firms – the Recession in the early 90s that I stepped into, the bursting of the Dot Com Bubble and the fallout from Enron in the early 2000s and the Financial Crisis in 2008-2010. As a result, some practices become busier than others or are viewed as more strategically important. After the financial crisis Bank Regulatory, Broker Dealer and Bankruptcy were hot. Today it is, among others, Private Equity, Funds and Finance. Billable hours is a fundamental tenet of BigLaw life and when firms are busy, one tends to have more job security and choices; however when things get slow or come to a stop, then all bets are off. To differing degrees, these type of events impact everyone at BigLaw – how much work is there, which practice areas is busy, what are the lateral opportunities, job security, partnership prospects and firm economics.

What is your favorite aspect of legal recruiting? 

I enjoy advising candidates about the lateral market and helping them realize their market value. It is a great feeling helping them move to a firm that is a better platform and fit.

I also enjoy working with law firms to help them successfully navigate the lateral market and achieve their strategic goals. Firms recognize that the lateral market is competitive and have become more strategic in their efforts. They are focused on leveraging their strengths, making sure the right message about the firm is being delivered, the cultural fit and successful integration. Firms rely more than ever on and value experienced recruiters and are looking to partner with them. With 10 years of recruiting experience and almost 20 years in Biglaw as a partner and associate, I believe firms and candidates value my unique background.

# Davis Polk Won't Delay Its New York Office Reopening, But Adjusts Its Face-Time Expectations For Attorneys
## A specific number of days per week in the office will no longer be required.

When we last checked in with Davis Polk — the law firm responsible for both the new compensation scale and the special bonuses that have spread through Biglaw like wildfire — they were planning to [reopen the New York office on September 13](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/davis-polk-reopening/), with lawyers “generally” expected to be in the office three or four days each week. This plan was announced in mid-July, and since then, many firms have walked back their original plans, pushing back their reopening dates until later in the fall due to the spread of the Delta variant. What is Biglaw’s new compensation leader planning to do?

Davis Polk will stay the course with its planned September 13 reopening date for the New York office — but with a few adjustments. Of note now is the fact that DPW will no longer require lawyers to come to the office a specific number of days per week. Here’s an excerpt from a memo that was sent out yesterday morning by Neil Barr, the firm’s chair and managing partner (full memo available on the next page):

[W]e are mindful of the fact that you are as busy as you have ever been and that you have been so for a very long time. Given our exceedingly high activity levels, we recognize that flexibility is very important right now. To that end, for our initial trial period we ask that associates and counsel return to the office regularly, but we will not require a specific number of days in the office per week (as was previously contemplated in the July 12 email). For now, we will leave it to you, in your judgment, to arrange an in-office cadence that works for you in light of your client and personal obligations.

Barr goes on to mention that the firm reopening on schedule to provide professional development and career opportunities that are “simply not as effective in the remote environment” — opportunities like mentorship, training, and creating meaningful relationships. People form meaningful and lasting relationships remotely all the time, but we suppose this is a no-go at law firms with costly real estate footprints. “I trust that you will find the right balance between in-office and remote work during the initial trial period,” Barr noted. “We will be happy to work with you to provide guidance based on your particular circumstances.”

Davis Polk has also updated its some of its safety protocols for those will be working in the office. The firm has already [barred the unvaccinated from its offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/davis-polk-to-deactivate-building-id-cards-of-unvaccinated-lawyers-and-staff/), and come reopening time, those experiencing any COVID symptoms will not be permitted to enter the office. New standards for common-area masking will now be in effect, and masks will be required for any gathering of more than four people. On top of that, indoor meetings will be limited to no more than 15 people.

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Davis Polk.)

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

Bruce Stachenfeld

After about 50 years of associates trying to “make partner” in big law firms, this is still a mystery. I will do my best to unlock it.

I do note that my law firm, Duval & Stachenfeld, is a bad example for this article, because my firm makes partners based on whether associates are qualified without looking at profits-per-partner metrics (see [articles](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/09/reinventing-the-law-business-profits-per-partner-a-good-servant-but-a-bad-master/) I wrote a year or so ago).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
However, I spent many years trying – and failing – to make partner at major law firms, which gave me a good perspective I think. Full disclosure: I was never able to make partner at the major law firms I worked at, so I started my own law firm.

Let me do my best anyway and start with some background thoughts:

First – most law firms don’t have a central brain on this issue. It is not one person sitting there making a decision. It is a group of partners getting in a room and arguing about stuff until a decision is reached. Although you may have a suspicion as to how the internal politics work, you are not in the room, and all the information you get is secondhand, as people tell you what they think you might want to hear or what might be useful for you to hear. Therefore, there is an element of randomness here.

Second – economics are critical at most law firms. Instead of thinking whether you “should” be a partner, they are thinking whether they “need” another partner, i.e., often with reference to that annoying profits-per-partner number. Hence, another variable you cannot control.

Third – a partnership is much more likely to make you a partner if the partners think you will help them succeed in the future, as opposed to whether you benefited them in the past. In other words, perhaps sadly, perception of future upside will almost always trump gratitude for past work.

Fourth – the converse of this, but just as important – is the fear factor. Partners will almost always elect another partner if they fear that by not electing you a partner you will leave and take something of value away from them.

Here is what I advocate doing:

First – assess your chances realistically based on firm history in making partner and firm economics – both current and future expectations. If your chances of partnership are small, then just leave. Don’t wait around to get passed over. Leave when you are highly marketable. Don’t be afraid to take a modest pay cut for a future opportunity. Your shelf life and career bargaining power start to shrink dramatically as you become a passed-over partner – trust me, I know this from experience.

Second – position yourself so that you have value to clients and the firm. This does not mean just toiling away in the trenches on the work given to you. It means seeing what is important to clients – what is important to the firm – where the firm is making high profits – and trying everything possible to get that work. That is what clients are paying for – that is where the money is. And that is where you should be able to prove that you are likely to create wealth for the partnership in the future.

Third, along these lines, I urge you to create value in yourself as follows:

- Survey the industry you are in (hopefully the one in which you are working under the preceding paragraph “Second”).
- Pick a niche within that industry that is a much smaller subset.
- Read everything you can and learn everything you can about that niche.
- Make it your business to know everything possible about that niche.
- Make it your business to meet everyone possible in that niche.
- Make it clear to your colleagues – and to everyone who will listen – that you are making this niche (in this high-value area) the fulcrum of your practice.
If you do this properly, you will create a virtuous cycle. Partners at the firm will start thinking of you as the primary associate to be picked when there is an assignment in this niche area. You will get more of this specific work, and if you have picked the right work, you will become more and more valuable with each deal you do in that area. As the dust starts to clear, it will become evident to everyone that you are the star associate in this niche and you have something really valuable, and hopefully that the firm is not going to want to lose. Partners will think maybe: “what if a competitor got our star associate in our core – and most profitable – business area. If we don’t make her a partner, what will happen?”

Fourth – you need some pull. Pull is always better than push. This isn’t anything you likely don’t know, but you need someone in the partnership with power to “make it happen” in terms of internal politics, or it likely won’t in fact happen. And this is the biggest pitfall area, where the combination of wishful thinking and flat-out lying creates a witches’ brew of career failure. It goes as follows:

The power partner who is going to “make it happen” has a lot at stake in keeping you around as long as possible even if your partnership chances are weak. You are servicing her work. She needs you to not quit in the worst way. So she is incentivized to be as positive as possible about your chances of partnership. She won’t probably want to outright lie, but she will likely say something like “it is looking really good.” If you couple that with your wishful thinking that it will in fact happen, well, you can see the result.

As far as this goes, you have to assess the power of the partner who is pulling for you – how far your partner is willing to go to pull you upward – the economics – and everything else – as dispassionately as possible.

To conclude and sum up – my advice is, don’t be a schmuck. Do the math on the above metrics as honestly as possible. Get rid of the wishful thinking – assess your chances dispassionately. If things look good, then go for it, and hopefully the above will be of use to you. And if things don’t look good, then look for a new job early, before your bargaining power ebbs. Who knows, maybe when you really have that new job in hand, the firm you work for will actually make you a partner or give you a binding promise to do so in a defined period of time.

Good luck!

In a move that should be devastating (but probably won’t be) to President Donald Trump’s and Attorney General [Bill Barr’s repeated assertions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/bill-barr-stomps-off-in-a-snit/) that the Mueller report cleared the president of any wrongdoing, over 600 former federal prosecutors have [signed an open letter](https://medium.com/@dojalumni/statement-by-former-federal-prosecutors-8ab7691c2aa1) stating they believe that based on the information in the Mueller report, Donald Trump would be indicted for obstruction of justice if he were not the sitting president. And that’s not some spin — that’s pretty much exactly what they wrote:

Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report would, in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President, result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For any other administration, that would be damning.

The letter goes on to point out three specific areas where an obstruction charge would be justified:

The Mueller report describes several acts that satisfy all of the elements for an obstruction charge: conduct that obstructed or attempted to obstruct the truth-finding process, as to which the evidence of corrupt intent and connection to pending proceedings is overwhelming. These include:

· The President’s efforts to fire Mueller and to falsify evidence about that effort;

· The President’s efforts to limit the scope of Mueller’s investigation to exclude his conduct; and

· The President’s efforts to prevent witnesses from cooperating with investigators probing him and his campaign.

As you might imagine, with 650 signatories to date, there is a wide variety of lawyers who have signed onto the letter. On the list are former federal prosecutors who have served under both Republican and Democratic administrations, with years serving in the government ranging from 41 years at the high end to four on the low end. There are also a bunch of former prosecutors who have found their way to Biglaw. [Some of these folks include](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/05/06/multiple-felony-charges-ex-federal-prosecutors-call-out-trumps-conduct-389-67721/) Robert Weiner, partner at Arnold & Porter; Robin Linsenmayer, of counsel at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliff; Sean Coffey, partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel; Bradley Harsch, special counsel at Sullivan & Cromwell; Geoffrey Graber, partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll; and Daniel Shallman, partner at Covington & Burling.

Of course, these former prosecutors are not in a position to do anything about their opinions on obstruction charges but vote in the 2020 election.

# Law Potion #9
## Cloud-based firms take aim at Biglaw by touting massive paydays. Is it real?

While traditional Biglaw is [splashing cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/mo-money-mo-problems-2/) at its incoming associate classes, a new breed of cloud-based law firms is enticing Biglaw lawyers to jump ship and go digital with promises of a payday. One of my partners recently forwarded a lateral recruiting email to me that touted an Am Law 200 refugee whose compensation allegedly “more than doubled” when they joined a cloud-based firm. We’d all love to double our money, right? So what’s the catch?

Rethinking Compensation

I wrote in this space a few months back about [FisherBroyles](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/the-most-important-law-firm-youve-never-heard-of/), the law firm poised to crack the Am Law 200 despite most of its attorneys working out of their houses. FisherBroyles and others, such as Rimon Law, VLP Law Group, Culhane Meadows, and Taylor English are part of a growing trend of high-end legal service providers that, in whole or in part, forgo traditional office space in favor of letting attorneys work wherever they choose. Whatever you call these kinds of law firms, be it “distributed,” “cloud-based,” or virtual law firms, they’re an important driver in our generally stodgy industry. I’ve recently had the opportunity to chat with the managing partners at each of those firms, and I’ll be spending the next few columns teasing out innovations that they’re bringing to the table.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But for all the innovative technology these cloud-based firms utilize, there was one curious common thread that tied them together that has nothing to do with the digital revolution: every one of them relies on a purely objective compensation formula for its attorneys. There are no exceptions. Rimon Law, for example, lets potentially interested lateral partners [punch in the details](https://rimonlaw.com/lateral#comp-calculator) of their book and find out what they’d be bringing home if they moved their practice over.

So why are these next-generation firms, comprised of mostly former Biglaw lawyers, selling comp systems as the magic potion? Hasn’t this battle been fought already?

The potential advantages of objective compensation systems are obvious. First and foremost is efficiency. In subjective compensation systems, leadership can spend weeks or months setting up and defending a compensation scheme. When compensation is based on a formula, theoretically all management has to do is punch in the relevant numbers and cut a check — at least until the fights start up over who receives credit for a given client’s revenue or partners start arguing that the formula is flawed.

Why do a majority of brick-and-mortar Biglaw firms continue to use purely subjective compensation systems, then? Part of it is that it’s harder to implement purely objective systems at traditional firms than at virtual firms. Consider overhead. Allocating overhead is one of those things that can be done fairly, or simply, but arguably not both. Say a firm with 10 partners has $100,000 in annual expenses. The simple allocation is to charge every partner $10,000 a year in overhead. But that means the partner who keeps themselves busy with no support staff is paying the same as the partner with the bigger book, but who maintains three associates, two paralegals, a full-time legal admin, half of the copy room, much of the IT department’s time, and a dedicated file clerk. Incentives become perverse quickly. If I can have a legal administrative assistant or a litigation support clerk who work 90 percent for me, but I’m only paying 10 percent of their salary and benefits, I’ve come out ahead. Simple overhead allocation puts partners in competition with one another, leading to inefficient expenditures of time, money, and emotion.

Assume the partner with no support staff complains they’re subsidizing the other attorney who does. That other partner complains that their larger book of business is subsidizing the smaller partner’s practice by covering a larger percentage of fixed expenses. So, in the name of fairness, we start allocating support staff overhead on a per-attorney basis. This leads to infighting over who keeps what associate busy, and who manages what paralegal. Then the transactional partners complain that they shouldn’t be paying for the firm’s Westlaw subscription, since they don’t use it. The litigators say they don’t want to pay for the new document management system the transactional partners bought. The more granular and fair we try to get with allocating overhead, the messier and more time-consuming the process becomes. Many firms have to add in a subjective component to their compensation just to give management some leverage to use to resolve all these fights.

Virtual law firms get to dodge most of the problems inherent in overhead allocation. They take one of the biggest pieces of overhead, the office lease, off the table. Their attorneys and practice groups also tend to be highly compartmentalized, meaning there isn’t often any dispute over who support personnel work for, and there aren’t many shared expenses that need to be split up. Overhead becomes à la carte; pay for what you use and no more. Lawyers thus have the incentive to be efficient instead of grabbing as much of the common pie as possible.

The distributed law firm model inherently solves a big piece of the overhead allocation problem, which makes purely formula-based compensation that much easier to implement. When you know exactly what every attorney costs, it’s easy to plug that number in.

The Potential Downsides

The virtual firms’ objective systems are not without their weaknesses, though. For starters, a pure eat-what-you-kill system doesn’t include any inherent way to smooth out income for attorneys over time. An attorney that has a great year makes a ton of money. If that attorney’s biggest client dumps them, purely formula-based compensation systems generally don’t provide much of a safety net (though, as some managing partners pointed out, nothing says they can’t).

There’s also the problem with how to reward contributions to the firm that aren’t reflected on a balance sheet. Traditional, more subjective compensation models have the flexibility to compensate attorneys who aren’t necessarily as profitable as the next, but who make big non-monetary contributions such as client care, community outreach, pro bono cases, associate development, or others. These kinds of contributions aren’t just good for developing a firm’s PR image. They’re crucial to establishing [firm culture](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/dont-just-show-me-the-money/), that elusive, incredibly valuable resource to the firms that are able to cultivate it. If virtual firms don’t have systems in place to reward those who make the firm better, if not richer, then all they have to keep their attorneys around or to attract new ones is a good formula. And when better comp is your only lure, you’re inevitably going to lose out to someone else who’s willing to pay more.

Then again, maybe “firm culture” in the traditional sense doesn’t mean the same thing for a cloud-based firm as it does when you’ve got dozens or hundreds of attorneys sharing an office and needing to find a way to coexist. Maybe those attorneys already have all the culture they need, and are happy for the rest of the firm to leave them alone when they’re not sharing work with one another.

Will Biglaw Follow?

Time will tell if these purely formula-based compensation models used in the virtual law space remain the dominant strategy. If there’s a better model out there, or even just a profitable alternative, someone will probably find it and run with it. It’s built into the DNA of these legal startups; the market is young and hungry. Maybe someone starts a virtual firm with a more subjective comp system baked in, presenting itself as a culture-based, kinder virtual law firm that wants to reward loyalty, pro bono work, or whatever its partnership values in addition to cash.

The virtual firms will figure their comp systems out. The real question is whether the brick-and-mortar firms can overcome inertia and start experimenting using digital Biglaw’s playbook.

# Great Resignation Or Great Retirement?

It depends on your age. And retirement usually comes later in life, as opposed to the resignations that we see happen all around us now at earlier ages. The pandemic has prompted a reset for each of us in terms of expectations, values, dreams, desires, and whoever and whatever we hold dear. That’s a good thing. It makes us realize that no one is invincible, and that even if we think we are, someone or something is going to come along and knock us back on our heels. Especially in the early days of practice, although we have much to learn, we think that our trajectory is straight up. Au contraire. Detours and obstacles are all around us.

Not everyone has choices. As [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211028-what-were-getting-wrong-about-the-great-resignation?xtor=ES-213-%5BBBC%20Features%20Newsletter%5D-2021November5-%5Bbbcfeatures_worklifegreatresignationcouldwebewrong_worklife+%5D) points out, “we may only be seeing the Great Resignation through the eyes of those who have the privilege to quit, like top executives or financially secure workers. But the reality is that it’s hard to parse from the existing data which workers are quitting more and why, which can distort what’s really happening, and might encourage people to boldly quit and think everything will work out for them.” So, they may be right, but they could be wrong. Imagine a trapeze artist without a safety net.

[Paul Krugman believes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/opinion/great-resignation-quit-job.html?searchResultPosition=3) that the pandemic has, in his words, created a “Great Rethink.”  Lots of us are doing just that.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Where are we are as a profession in terms of staying or going? It’s no surprise that it depends upon age. [Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/exclusive-law-firms-with-youngest-partners-oldest-2021-11-03/) that only about 6.5% of the Biglaw lawyers earned their JDs in the 1970s. (Depending upon what part of that decade you are looking at, it’s 50 years or damn close to it. I am part of that cohort, and the idea of nudging up on practice of 50 years is scary. I will always remember that day I was sworn in way back when, along with 2,000 of my closest friends in downtown Los Angeles. Some days just always remain in your mind, and that one does in mine. Most of my law school classmates are now inactive, as are many of my colleagues over the years, and there are those who didn’t make it.)

Some firms view senior lawyers as assets, mentoring the next generation of lawyers and providing continuity to clients in terms of representation. It is succession planning, something that every law firm and corporate law department must do. Even if the client remains the same, the corporate culture may not. It’s important to have bench strength, both for law firms and in house. Don’t try to predict client loyalty. I’ve heard more than my share of stories from outside counsel who were dropped like yesterday’s news when there was a corporate change and the in-house department had to accommodate new outside counsel most favored by new management.

And while the pandemic, hopefully at some point in the not-too-distant future, becomes endemic, there doesn’t seem to be any dispute that WFH has helped lawyer productivity. [A recent survey](https://www.esquiresolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/eBooks%2C%20calendars%2C%20etc/COVID-ENFORCED%20VIRTUAL%20WORKING%20BOOSTS%20LITIGATORS'%20CONFIDENCE%20IN%20TECH%20SKILLS.pdf) so says. Almost all lawyers surveyed say that the technical proficiency needed during the pandemic has made them better lawyers. Two-thirds think that they are more productive.

The pandemic has taught us many things. We now know that there’s more than one way to practice law economically and efficiently. Some lawyers may now see some billable hours evaporate as the need to appear in person diminishes, but if the goal is to serve the client (at least that’s what I learned and that is the client’s expectation), then those billables should rightly disappear.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Not only have lawyers’ expectations about working in a brick-and-mortar environment changed. Clients are now [more than happy to collaborate](https://www.clio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-Legal-Trends-Report-Oct-26.pdf) with attorneys remotely.

To the great surprise of exactly no one, clients are happy campers using virtual technologies and techniques post pandemic. Sometimes clients look around the law firm offices and wonder how much of that they are paying for, and do they really care about that? Clients want advice and results, not law firm palaces, especially not when they are implicitly paying for them.

The results of [a Wilson Elser survey](https://www.wilsonelser.com/news_and_insights/press_releases/4376-wilson_elser_study_on_litigation_management) align with what most lawyers and clients think about legal life afterward, in other words, in the endemic stage, not the pandemic we still are in. Continuing in the virtual world is here to stay. Strategy sessions, settlement conferences, and mediations will continue in the virtual world. As a mediator, I’ve always thought that having the insurance adjuster schlep out to the other side of the country, or wherever, was a waste of time and money, money that could be used to help resolve the case. Maybe others are now seeing it that way.

And in some Biglaw firms, it’s now taking longer to make partner, and even then, it may be a nonequity partnership, which [may not be the worst thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/it-takes-longer-than-ever-to-make-it-to-biglaw-partner/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=181137563&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Xmt7g24rxJK3m2uOvmms5BfZYBOVQu_CMe9lWqfFrUSAfieH744ydc5qbJpdbvLzFCmZiFZN81I63cfwJHjn3PBT02g&utm_content=181137563&utm_source=hs_email) to happen, if trying to have some work life balance is critical.

So, whether you’re considering retirement or resignation in light of what’s happened over the past 20 months, it’s time for you to do a “great rethink.” What is important to you? What matters most? The same two words we always tell clients apply to us as well: “it depends.”

So this is… intriguing.

On the heels of the American Lawyer’s blockbuster story that [Allen & Overy and O’Melveny & Myers are “deep” in merger talks](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/04/06/two-big-firms-eye-a-potential-trans-atlantic-union/) — which we [covered here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/allen-overy-and-omelveny-are-considering-merger-please-name-it-allen-omelvery/) — a firm spokesperson reached out to Above the Law to state:

“We have no plans to merge and never have.”

Never? That’s a strong word. There were stories about [trying to merge with Willkie](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/sites/newyorklawjournal/2017/12/13/amid-law-firm-merger-boom-transformational-talks-on-the-rise/) not so long ago.

The American Lawyer story has received the above update, as well as this statement from Allen & Overy:

“While we have said for several years that we are open to considering a merger with the right partner in the U.S., we talk to many firms in many countries all of the time and we do not comment on market speculation and rumors regarding any particular firm,” the firm said.

See, that’s a much more equivocal statement.

What in the world (or at least the Anglo-American legal market) is going on?!?!? Well, it could be that this is the sort of fake news that [Sinclair Broadcasting warned us about](https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/how-americas-largest-local-tv-owner-turned-its-news-anc-1824233490). Or maybe this is the hand in the cookie jar phase of a major story. You know the “[I have the utmost confidence in [insert name]](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/spicer-confirms-president-stands-with-kasowitz-start-the-countdown-to-his-firing/)” statement that inevitably precedes a firing.

Interesting times we live in, here in the legal world.

Data breaches can result in tremendous financial and reputational costs to firms and individuals.

And while the need to understand and secure a law firm’s IT operations is clear, the path toward doing so can be less obvious. 

With that in mind, this white paper from our friends at Filevine describes the sophisticated security controls your firm should utilize to protect your clients’ information.

Read on to learn the top risks to your clients’ data, as well as steps you can take to address these threats today.

# Biglaw Partner Ordered To Take Driving Safety Course After Running Over, Killing Pedestrian
## This partner's 'careless driving' resulted in a woman's death.

We have some unfortunate news to report from overseas, where a practice leader at Magic Circle mainstay Slaughter and May was involved in a car accident last fall that resulted in the death of a pedestrian.

The partner in question, [Natalie Yeung](https://www.slaughterandmay.com/people/natalie-yeung/), heads up the firm’s competition practice in Asia. [RollOnFriday](https://rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-slaughter-and-may-partner-admits-careless-driving-after-deadly-accident) has the details:

A police investigation concluded that the Slaughter and May partner had not been drinking and that her view of the road, which has many narrow bends and is a notorious accident blackspot, was impaired by trees. Although she was allegedly found to have been speeding, she was charged with careless driving rather than the more serious offence of dangerous driving or manslaughter.

Yeung pleaded guilty and was sentenced last week in the South Eastern District Magistrates Court to a fine of HK$3500, equivalent to just under £375 [or about $450 US], and ordered to take a driving safety course within three months.

That’s a cheap fine for taking someone’s life, but we imagine the mental toll for Yeung must be costly. ROF reports that she will remain a partner at the firm.

# Diversity Initiatives Fail To Make Minority Partners: But Still Work Out Well For White Women
## The pattern of white women benefiting from affirmative-action, continues.

As we detail, often, despite minority lawyers being hired at law firms across the country, very few of them make partner.

But today, the [Washington Post is making the same point](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/27/the-legal-profession-is-diversifying-but-not-at-the-top/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-national%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.8a61f9f2e17b) so, let’s talk about it again:

Minority lawyers now make up 16 percent of law firms — a record high — but remain scarce at the top, where only 9 percent of law partners are people of color, according to new data collected by the Minority Corporate Counsel Association.

Put another way, nearly half of their white counterparts make partner, while the vast majority of minorities remain associates.

The disparity is also reflected in the corporate world, where only 11 percent of general counsels at Fortune 500 companies are black, Hispanic, Asian or Native American even though minorities make up a third of the legal profession as a whole.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Welcome to the party, Washington Post. There’s pie and punch in the back, along with all the black people.

The reasons for why minorities are not making partner are legion: there’s systemic racism, there’s implicit bias, there’s a retention problem, there’s a lack of mentors, there’s a lack of wealthy white clients willing to give their business to black or brown faces. Making partner is not a meritocracy, it’s a subjective invitation to an exclusive club. It’s not all that surprising that minorities continued to get shut out.

But diversity initiatives are helping one group of people:

Affirmative action and other diversity initiatives have helped one group noticeably: white women.

“White women have benefited greatly from all of the diversity initiatives,” Lee said.

General counsels at Fortune 500 firms are now 22 percent white women, 5 percent women of color, and 7 percent men of color. The rest, nearly 70 percent, are white men.

One of the ways we can explain the fact that 53% of white women voters voted for Donald Trump is that being white is simply MORE VALUABLE than being a woman is a hindrance to professional and social success. When looking at a candidate that’s going to advance the cause of white supremacy, white women benefit from that, even if they are greatly harmed by endemic sexual harassment and predation.

This seems like a good time to mention that tipsters report Sullivan and Cromwell announced new partners today. Six men, one woman.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/the-legal-tech-non-event/crm-for-law-firms/)Most attorneys think of social media as either a distraction or simply a marketing tool. But there’s more to it than that. 

Social media platforms are actually phenomenal resources for gathering business intelligence. I’ve heard that “the more you know, the more you’ll grow” — and if you use the power of social media to access new sources of business intelligence … well, you can become a business development and management superduperstar.

In this episode of the Non-Eventcast podcast, we invited [Betsy Munnell](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ehmunnelllawyercareercoach/) of [EHMunnell](http://ehmunnell.com/) onto the show to talk about leveraging social media for business intelligence.

We also hit on some other various and sundry technology topics. 

Host Jared Correia kicks things off by talking with Betsy about how she transitioned from being a lawyer herself (3:53) to coaching attorneys on business development (6:52). 

Next, Betsy talked about how she is able to get lawyers to engage in social media (11:39), including how she instructs them on using those tools to gather business intelligence related to their practices (16:14). 

After that, Betsy talked about how Twitter (well, X — I guess), is now the breaking news service (21:40) — while LinkedIn is a great place to meet and connect with other professionals (24:22). 

Finally, Betsy addressed the value of customer relationship management (CRM) tools for law firms (28:21), before winding up with her thoughts on the future of AI in legal (31:30).

If you’re not getting the most out of your social media platform, maybe it’s time to expand how you’ve traditionally used it. Listen to this refreshing podcast episode, to get started.

# Everything Is Connected: Understanding The Internet Of Things
## If all this connectivity — and its legal implications — feels overwhelming, you’re not alone.

While lawyers have a reputation for being tech-averse, there are some emerging issues the industry can’t afford to ignore. 

These days, we’re looking into the implications of [using the metaverse for work](https://www.pli.edu/programs/misconduct-in-the-metaverse--can-your-avatars-actions-get-you-arrested?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2). The pandemic era has also ushered in changes in business practices that have [brought technology to the forefront](https://www.pli.edu/programs/techlaw-institute?t=ondemand&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) of even the slowest-changing firms.

When it comes to business risk, however, few areas present the complex challenges raised by the Internet of Things (IoT) — the interconnected system of computing devices incorporated into an ever-increasing number of everyday products. 

Items as varied as pacemakers, cars, and refrigerators connected to the Internet allow for massive-scale data collection and processing — creating security and privacy risks for both businesses and individuals. 

If all this connectivity — and its legal implications — feels overwhelming, you’re not alone. Lawyers today are required to learn and navigate, and sometimes even create, a whole new legal framework when it comes to dealing with the IoT.  

To help you understand these novel legal issues, PLI is offering a one-day program entitled [Internet of Things 2022: Everything Is Connected](https://www.pli.edu/programs/internet-of-things?t=live&p=336184&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2). 

This program will cover some of the hottest topics and technologies related to the IoT today, including:

- Autonomous vehicles and how they’re navigating both the road and cyberspace
- Open source software and why using it needs to be well thought out
- Best practices from regulated healthcare devices on and under the skin
- How small IoT devices can create huge risks given their complex cybersecurity and privacy implications
- How to avoid litigation, liability, and insurance loss from using the IoT
Whether you’re a general practitioner or a tech lawyer, a security professional or  a privacy officer, it’s critical to stay on top of the IoT’s constantly evolving legal and technological landscape. [Register today](https://www.pli.edu/programs/internet-of-things?t=live&p=336184&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) to learn more.

# Why Is The 'Cravath Scale' Still A Thing When There Are New Compensation Leaders In Town?
## All hail Cravath, no matter who leads the pack.

I have a few theories as to why the “Cravath scale” lives on.

First, it’s become industry shorthand. Well-known terms make life easier. It’s like referring to Tiger as the GOAT (greatest of all time). We all know what I’m saying.

Second, who is complaining? Some Big Law leaders may have an actionable claim—particularly those who have actually set the pace in salaries and bonuses lately. But they can’t come out against the Cravath term. This whole “debate” is petty and beneath them!

And the rest of the firms are pleased to brag that their pay scale matches that of Cravath, the industry’s well-worn touchstone for prestige. It would be like if your local municipal golf course was able to say: “We’ve got Augusta greens.”

Third, blame Google. We live in a time where publishers are rewarded for indulging lazy shorthand—I mean, search terms that attract eyeballs. “Cravath scale” has been searched on Google nearly 10 times more than “Davis Polk bonus” over the past year, according to Google Trends. That’s despite Davis Polk setting the pace for two new rounds of Big Law bonuses during that span.

— Roy Strom, a reporter for Bloomberg’s Big Law Business, explaining [why the term “Cravath scale” is here to stay](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/should-we-still-say-cravath-scale-if-other-firms-pay-more), despite the fact that other firms like Milbank and Davis Polk have raised salaries and bonuses to new heights over the past two years.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

Two weeks ago, Morgan Lewis & Bockius announced a formal remote-working program for associates that will allow its third-year and more-senior attorneys to [telecommute for up to two days](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/another-biglaw-firm-jumps-on-the-telecommuting-bandwagon/?rf=1) each week. Not only has the program been hailed as a coup for work/life balance and positive client engagement, but it also assists people who had previously been adversely affected by facetime obligations at the firm — people like women and attorneys with families. Other Biglaw firms have taken notice, and have announced similar programs in the days since Morgan Lewis unveiled its new plan.

Which firms have jumped on the telecommuting bandwagon, and what are the details of their programs?

On March 13, Jackson Lewis rolled out a similar plan that will allow associates and of counsel to [work remotely on an “as needed” basis](http://www.jacksonlewis.com/news/jackson-lewis-launches-flexible-workplace-program), so long as they’re productive. Calling it a “win-win for all parties,” [Vincent Cino](http://www.jacksonlewis.com/people/vincent-cino), the firm’s chairman, said the policy was enacted in order for the firm to “continue to attract and retain elite-level team members, and ensure both our attorneys and clients are satisfied with the Jackson Lewis experience.” On its face, this program seems a little more generous than that of Morgan Lewis, but one wonders how far the firm will go to allow its attorneys to work remotely. What if, for example, an attorney wanted or needed to work remotely for weeks or months at a time? Would the firm support that decision?

The minutiae on the Jackson Lewis plan that have been released to the public are slim. If you work at the firm and have any additional details, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jackson%20Lewis%20Telecommuting).

According to reports from the Am Law Daily, after conducting a firmwide survey, Baker McKenzie has also announced a telecommuting program, but the firm is offering remote working scenarios for all of its employees, not just lawyers. At Baker McKenzie, the telecommuting plan is meant to assist all employees with flexible working arrangements, not just those of a certain gender or age group. Here’s more from [Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202781555470/Two-More-Big-Firms-Prepare-to-Get-Flexible?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=2):

“The millennials want flexible working for a set of reasons, but frankly, so do people who have been working for 20 years,” [chief talent officer [Peter] May](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petermay/) said. “If you’re in your late 40s and 50s, you can be caught between all sorts of different responsibilities,” said May, adding that oftentimes this age group finds themselves sandwiched between caring for their parents and raising children.

According to May, if a firm “actually create[s] an environment that is flexible, that enables people to be at their best no matter where they happen to be, you’re going to have much more engaged employees.” To that end, “[i]f they’re more engaged they’re going to be more productive, and if they’re more productive, that’s going to have huge organizational implications.” May’s assertion couldn’t possibly be more correct.

Congratulations to Jackson Lewis and Baker McKenzie for joining the future of law practice. With all the demands placed upon those working in Biglaw, giving your employees the ability to work remotely is a much-needed — and much appreciated — perk.

What are your firm’s policies with regard to working remotely? Will your firm be the next to hop onto the telecommuting bandwagon? If and when your firm adopts a formal telecommuting policy, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Telecommuting) (subject line: “Telecommuting”). This is one trend that we’ll be more than happy to cover.

Partners at some of the most successful Biglaw firms in the world have decided to do their part to support relief efforts in Israel in the wake of the deadly Hamas terror attack that killed more than 1,200 Israelis.

Kirkland & Ellis, the world’s wealthiest firm, is leading the pack in donations, with partners having pledged more than $1.5 million. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/13/big-law-partners-start-fundraising-drive-for-israel-relief/) has additional details:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Collectively, we can really do some good,” the statement said, which was forwarded to equity partners in New York to generate more donations. “There is absolutely no pressure to donate, and we recognize that many of you may have already donated to separate charities. If you decide to make a donation, any amount that you feel comfortable with is great.”

Once partners determine the aggregate amount of pledged money, they will allocate the funds “across a few charities we are currently evaluating,” the email said. Organizations that will receive the financial support focus on providing “emergency medical care, post-trauma mental health support, emergency equipment and supplies and sanitation and hygiene solutions.”

Other Biglaw firms have also joined the cause to support Israel, with important charitable donations being made to support on-the-ground aid. Partners at Quinn Emanuel, for example, have pledged $300,000 to “organizations that support Israeli hospitals, ambulances, paramedics and search and rescue operations, and that provide food and other support.” As noted in an email circulated at the firm, those who donate funds “are sending a clear signal that we stand united against terror.”

Last, but certainly not least, Paul Weiss has made a “significant donation” to the UJA Emergency Fund, “among other relief organizations.” Just hours after the attack, chairman Brad Karp asked colleagues firmwide to donate to relief efforts in Israel — to United Hatzalah (the country’s nonprofit volunteer EMS) and American Friends of Magen David Adom (which supports Israeli first responders), in particular — noting that the firm would match up to $1,500 annually. Am Law has a snippet of the touching email Karp sent to the firm while encouraging donations:

“For now, while we watch the horror unfolding from afar, our thoughts are with the State and people of Israel and we pray that our support of these organizations will make a difference on the ground,” Karp wrote. “And, as with past humanitarian and traumatic crises, we intend to do everything we possibly can to provide relief to those desperately in need.”

As the year draws to a close, we sense that lawyers have already begun the annual ritual of nervously analyzing their careers: Whether they should switch firms, move in-house, or stop practicing entirely. And with law quickly transforming into an industry driven by capital and technology, lawyers have never had more choice. For many people, this might feel like opportunity; for a lawyer, this may feel like a dangerous amount of freedom.

We symbolize this new age of lawyer. Since graduating from law school in the early ‘90s, our careers have run the gamut. Between the two of us, we’ve spent time at law firms, a Big 4 accounting firm, and in-house legal departments; we’ve become legal entrepreneurs by founding Pangea3; and now, Sanjay continues to work at the nexus of law and tech while David works at the largest legal financier in the world. Our experiences are by no means the norm for lawyers, but they’ve given us novel frames of reference –standards and benchmarks by which we measure and evaluate the industry around us. In the spirit of lawyers re-evaluating their careers, we offer some insights.

The frame of reference for a law firm lawyer is relatively narrow. As a wise man once said: “If you’ve seen one law firm… you’ve seen one law firm.” A race among several firms to innovate with technology and new business models including legal-tech funds and incubators is creating even more avenues for differentiation.

Despite their idiosyncrasies, law firms possess certain ubiquitous features — they’re collegial, intellectual and collaborative. They’re also intense. A lot of the intensity owes to the law firm ownership structure. From an aggregate firm perspective, partners don’t just make business decisions, they also make cultural decisions. But often, partners operate in a decentralized construct. So even within a firm, the experience of one associate is likely to be different than that of another.

The grand unifier within a law firm is its hierarchical structure. At law firms, the world is divided into partners, lawyers, and “non-lawyers” — a term we hate, but which remains sadly in wide use. Lawyers focus on their partners and cases; partners focus on their clients and new business. Within such narrow bands of focus, perfection is essential, detail is critical, and competition is omnipresent. At a law firm, associates will become specialists, but if they aren’t on track to make partner or follow some of the newer entrepreneurial (business within a firm) focused law firm tracks, it raises the question: What will they do with their highly-specialized knowledge? Often, they’ll take that knowledge in-house.

If the law firm lawyer’s frame of reference is one or even two dimensional, the in-house lawyer’s frame of reference is 3D. The difference is stark. At a law firm, lawyers’ experiences are governed by their partners — the people with whom they interact and are influenced by. In a business, a lawyer’s experience is governed by many more people inside the company (CEO, CFO, marketers, salespeople, product specialists, et al.) and by the industry of their company — a force they will be unable to influence. Although in-house lawyers must answer to their CEO and board, companies are usually less monolithic than law firms, especially given that many different departments are working toward a common goal that is defined, in large part, by the industry itself. This means that in-house lawyers must understand their industry just as well as they understand their company’s business and its legal work.

Moreover, fundamentally, in-house lawyers have a different mandate than outside counsel: They must make decisions that balance time, risk, and cost in accordance with their company’s goals. There is simply too much work for in-house lawyers to do for them to aim for perfection in the way they would at law firms. Moreover, they are not penalized for imperfection or failure. They are rewarded for exercising sound judgment in making tradeoffs between those three: time, risk, and cost. And ultimately, the market is the judge, jury, and executioner (even if it’s a c-level executive delivering the verdict).

Alternative legal services provider (ALSP)

At their core, ALSPs are just companies that happen to work in the legal sector — their cultural frames of reference are hybrids influenced by law and business. Like law firms, ALSPs have clients to which they’re beholden; like traditional companies, their approach to dealing with those clients is uniform, and not influenced by specific partners. This makes for a much more consistent culture and one that is often shaped by the founders or leaders of the company. And because ALSPs are companies, they tend to embrace risk and value progression, rather than harping on perfection.

The name of the game for an ALSP is doing something better than a legacy provider has previously been able to do it. This necessarily means doing things differently than law firms have ever done them. Moreover, lawyers have more avenues of opportunity to grow within ALSPs — more ways to leverage their skills and knowledge — and their frames of reference are often somewhat wider than they would be at in-house legal departments. Examples include managing functional teams, managing client-specific teams, and becoming subject matter experts in specific business process areas, to name just a few.

Legal financier

Of all the industries in which we’ve worked, legal finance is arguably the most dynamic: A legal capital provider is structured like a company, but it straddles the worlds of finance and law, so its cultural frames of reference necessarily include elements of both industries. Legal finance is client-facing, and like ALSPs, providers of legal capital (rather than individuals) own the relationships with those clients, reducing the influence of individual stakeholders and allowing for a more consistent culture, the hallmark of which is teamwork and inter-departmental problem-solving.

Despite the differences in structure between law firms and legal capital providers, perfection is still expected when making investments. The difference is, at a legal capital provider, the farther one gets from case selection and underwriting, the more the company emphasizes progression over perfection. In business units like marketing and business development, there is significant room for lawyers to exercise creativity, with the implied mandate of balancing risk, cost, and time. In short, legal capital providers bear many of the attributes of law firms, corporate legal departments, and ALSPs, and they do so from the frames of reference of finance and law.

Ultimately, for however much the legal industry changes, it will remain one of lawyers. And lawyers (let’s face it) tend to share certain traits and characteristics. Still, lawyers have more career options than ever before. While law firm incubators, corporate legal departments, ALSPs, and legal financiers aren’t right for everyone, the reality is, lawyers should take comfort in the range of options and work cultures out there for them. If we are evidence of anything, it’s that what it means to be a lawyer is becoming broader by the day — and we think that’s a great thing. And with that, we wish our readers a happy new year and the best of luck with their 2019 career choices.

Biglaw firms are still trying to cobble together ideas on how to safely get their attorneys and staff back into the office, and one of the most prestigious firms in the country has announced a reopening plan that will have everyone back at their desks just two weeks after summer’s official start date.

According to our sources, Sullivan & Cromwell — a firm that brought in gross revenue of $1,555,441,000 in 2020, placing it at No. 18 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — is requiring all employees to return to the office in person on July 6. The news of the full reopening of the firm’s U.S. offices was announced earlier this month during a call with all lawyers. No email has been sent out on the matter.

Please note the UPDATE below.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Suffice it to say that the numerous associates we’ve heard from are far from happy with the situation. Why’s that? Because the firm has reportedly not made any mention of the possibility of remote, work-from-home arrangements going forward.

Here are some of the more detailed accounts of the firm’s reopening plans:

Sullivan and Cromwell is targeting a mandatory back to office by July 6, including summer associates, for all U.S. offices. No memo but this has been stated on multiple occasions, including the annual firm update and on weekly all lawyers zoom meetings. There has not been any mention of allowing anyone to do a partial work from home arrangement post-July 6. My understanding is this is one of the earliest among New York law firms. Associates are generally unhappy with the very early target date.

Wow S&C is taking a very different approach from [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/davis-polk-sets-up-optional-back-to-office-days-for-lawyers-to-reacquaint-themselves-with-office-life/). Everyone will be brought back in early July and summers will be there in person in June. We were told this is what people want and have been asking for. But we were never surveyed and I don’t actually know lawyers or staff who want a mandatory 100% return to the office the day after July 4 weekend. No memo or email, probably to prevent coverage. On the same call where leadership announced this, they would not commit to any hybrid flexibility in the future and said that we would all have to see how things go.

Above the Law reached out to Sullivan & Cromwell’s media relations team as well as the firm’s executive director with a request for comment but did not hear back before publication. If and when we do, we will provide an update here.

UPDATE (05/06/21): Joseph Shenker, the firm’s chair, gave comments to the [American Lawyer](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/sullivan-cromwells-july-6-reopening-plan-is-allegedly-not-mandatory/) on the firm’s reopening plan, stating, “We’ve been very clear to all the partners and to all the associates that no one should feel pressured to come in.” Shenker said a full return was “encourag[ed],” but not mandatory. Since Am Law’s coverage, additional sources have reached out to us, stating their displeasure with the firm’s plans. Here’s one of the detailed accounts:

Another young associate from Sullcrom here: Echoing your coverage on the July 5th return to the office — “far from happy” is right. Everyone is angry and frustrated. We think it’s absurd and completely unmindful of our safety and need for flexibility as we still deal with pandemic related constraints, and especially as we’ve all worked so hard through the pandemic. And just so surprising how they just issued the edict from on high (and the only firm to do so) and expect us to all just somehow make it work.

Are any other firms planning to reopen their offices before Labor Day and without any remote work options? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

It seems that COVID-19 austerity measures are the new normal for Biglaw firms of all stripes. From salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs, some of the nation’s most prominent law firms are doing what they can to protect their businesses from the economic fallout that’s been caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

The latest firm to make cost-cutting moves may be one of the wealthiest, but it’s still tightening its belt to weather the financial storm to come.

Numerous sources tell us that McDermott Will & Emery, currently in 30th place in the latest Am Law 100 rankings with $1,172,114,000 gross revenue in 2019, has been conducting layoffs. Both staff and associate positions have been eliminated, and Above the Law tipsters say entire departments have been gutted. We’ve been told that the latest cuts included associates, administrative assistants, paralegals, and long-term contract attorneys. In addition to the layoffs, some staff members have also been furloughed to a tentative July 2020 date.

We reached out several times to McDermott for comment, but have yet to hear back.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

If you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Layoff Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the layoff alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each layoff, salary cut, or furlough announcement that we publish.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Summer Associate Offer Rates (2017): Make Way For More Record Hiring!
## Offer rates have soared this summer. Congratulations!

Fall recruiting season is upon us at law schools across the country, and from what we hear, students are pretty confident that they’ll be able to land a job considering the fact that Biglaw hiring is up for the second year in a row. In fact, the biggest of Biglaw firms recently extended more offers of permanent employment to prospective law school graduates than at any point in time since the recession (and we’ll have more on this news later today). Offer rates have soared this summer, and it seems like we’re in for another year of record Biglaw hiring.

How many happy-go-lucky incoming associates will soon be bopping around your firms with visions of $180K annual salaries dancing in their heads?

Following up on [Monday’s post](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/summer-associate-offer-rates-2017-which-firms-had-100-percent-offer-rates/) on Biglaw offer rates, here are some additional firms that have given offers to all of their summer associates:

- Brown Rudnick (Boston)
- Proskauer Rose (Boston)
- Greenberg Traurig (Chicago)
- Baker Botts (Houston)
- Kirkland & Ellis (Houston; one was allegedly a “soft” offer)
- Manatt (Los Angeles)
- Milbank (Los Angeles)
- Baker Botts (New York)
- Greenberg Traurig (New York)
- Hogan Lovells (New York)
- Norton Rose Fulbright (New York)
- Gibson Dunn (San Francisco)
- Paul Hastings (firmwide)
We’d like to extend a big congratulations to everyone on their offers. Doesn’t it feel great to know that you’ve got a very lucrative job before graduation?

If you have offer rate additions to this list to share or if you have corrections to the list — e.g., an office listed above that does NOT belong on the 100 percent list — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer Associate Offer Rates”), or text us (646-820-8477). We keep our tipsters anonymous. If and when we receive enough information, we’ll do another follow-up.

Right now, it’s more newsworthy if a firm does NOT have a 100 percent offer rate than if it does. On that note, please let us hear about firms that are NOT issuing offers to all their summer associates. If you know of a firm or an office with an unusually low offer rate — which we will arbitrarily define here as something under 66 percent, or two-thirds — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Low%20Offer%20Rate) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Low Offer Rate”). If we hear about any firms with particularly low offer rates, we will investigate and perhaps write a story.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# The Biglaw Attorneys On Trump's DOJ Transition Team
## Biglaw attorneys will play a key role in this jacked-up circle of life.

The bleak reality of a Trump administration has begun to take hold. Amid the leftist teeth gnashing are some serious questions, like who will be forced to navigate the transition of the Department of Justice from under the leadership of the first African-American woman, Loretta Lynch, to a man once dinged as a federal judge for being [too racist](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/i-survived-john-ashcroft-ill-probably-survive-jeff-sessions/?rf=1).

Biglaw attorneys will play a key role in this jacked-up circle of life. Partners (and one associate) from five Biglaw firms are on the DOJ transition team and have been called into service to midwife the Trump Department of Justice.

The lucky(?) firms with this honor: McGuireWoods; Morgan, Lewis & Bockius; Morrison & Foerster; Kirkland & Ellis; and Jones Day. As the National Law Journal [reports](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202772931072):

The Trump camp continues to draw DOJ transition officials from the nation’s largest law firms. The newest members are McGuireWoods partner J. Patrick Rowan, the former head of the National Security Division; Morgan, Lewis & Bockius partner Ronald Tenpas, the former head of the Environment and Natural Resources Division; and Morrison & Foerster partner Jessie Liu, who served as a top official in the National Security and Civil Rights divisions.

The first five members of the DOJ team were announced on Friday, a list that included Kirkland & Ellis partner Brian Benczkowski, who previously worked for Trump’s U.S. attorney general pick Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, on the Senate Judiciary Committee; Jones Day partner Gregory Katsas, the former head of the Civil Division; and Jones Day associate James Burnham.

There’s a lot of experience on this team, which is a comfort — cold though it may be — to those worried about potential disruptions to the day-to-day operations of the Department, supercharged after the Trump team seemed flatfooted on the transition, not contacting the DOJ until [nine days](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/17/trump-transition-team-makes-first-contact-with-jus/) after the election.

For those of us who follow the intricacies of Biglaw, it’s a look into the people who make up the monolith. And just might make for some interesting summer associate callback interview questions.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# References Are Pretty Important If You Want To Snag A Clerkship

So… you all seem to like clerkship content.  Last week’s column resulted in a good amount of positive feedback, including a link in the D.C. Bar Daily Legal Brief, which granted, isn’t [a](http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/all-in/2018-03-26) [recurring](http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/all-in/2018-03-20) [role](http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/all-in/2018-04-04) on [All in with Chris Hayes](http://www.msnbc.com/all) like some of the other voices you will find here on [Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/author/elie-mystal/), but we all have to start somewhere.  And if the person/bot who drafts the D.C. Bar email is reading this, I just paid my yearly dues, so calm down with the reminder emails.

To follow up on the clerkship talk from last week, this week’s column is going to be dedicated to *checks notes* references.

While this might seem like a disconnect, I assure you that it is not.  Whether applying for a clerkship or an attorney position in private practice, in-house, public service, or even the government, at some point you will need others to speak on your behalf about your abilities.  For clerkships in particular, applicants will need longer letters of recommendation, but the thought process in picking recommenders is similar to that of picking references.  Here are some things to consider when thinking about references.

The first question you want to tackle is how many references you need.  The answer is that you want to provide a couple, with my experience being that the magic number is three.  Listing a single reference makes you seem like a creepy loner who has literally one friend and likes to fly kites at night.



Conversely, listing a dozen references makes it seem as if you lack the wherewithal to actually edit your life down and discern between people able to speak honestly about your ability and those who just happen to know you.  Three references provides you with the opportunity to have a mix of both personal and professional while limiting your list to those best positioned to speak on your behalf.

And yes, references should include personal references as well as professional ones.  While all employers want to know that a candidate can do the legal work that is required in the position, that still leaves a large number of qualified candidates.  Most Biglaw firms could pluck a student at random from the top 25 or so law schools and that individual would be a competent junior associate.  What employers want in addition to legal acumen, is a colleague they will actually like, or at the very least not loath.  Having someone who can speak about you as a person, in a professional manner — this is not the place to list your mom — can truly help you stand out.  As an example, my personal reference is a former graduate school classmate who is now a minister.  Top that.

When it comes to selecting professional references, the obvious answer is former co-workers or supervisors.  But not everyone has a robust professional career from which to draw references.  For those of you reading this who are still in law school, your professors can serve as professional references, but there are a few things of which you need to be careful.  First, make sure the professor whom you are asking to serve as a reference actually knows you.  If you are a 3L sending out applications and your first-year Civil Procedure professor is listed, despite the fact you spoke only twice in class and never since, even if you got an A in the class, that recommendation is doomed to be limited at best.  Instead, if you think you might want a professor to serve as a reference, go drop into office hours and develop some sort of a relationship.  Consider working as a research assistant.  Do anything that will allow this professor to say something more about you than your grade in the class and that you seemed to understand International Shoe.

Second, and this goes for all references, ask for permission before listing someone as a reference.  Do not assume that just because you got the highest grade in the class, your professor is going to be willing to serve as a reference; because while it is entirely likely that they will be willing to, the fact that you made such an assumption and did not provide them with the courtesy of seeking their permission can turn a positive reference into a negative one in a moment.

Third, use full titles for everyone, but especially your professors.  Yes, some members of the legal academy have titles that sound more like the name of a mid-December college football bowl game than something befitting a tenured faculty member — you cannot tell me the [Beef O’Brady’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasparilla_Bowl) Chair in Hospitality Law sounds so ludicrous that, without looking it up, you would be able to say there is not at least a 5 percent chance it exists — but they have worked remarkably hard for their accomplishments and to lump them all together as “professor” undermines their life’s work.

I will mention here as well that just because you use one set of professors (or other professional references) for a particular application does not mean you are bound to use that same list for all other job opportunities for the rest of your career.  If you have a professor willing to serve as a reference who clerked for the particular judge to whom you are applying or used to work at the same firm where you want to practice, you should definitely list them.  Whether that means expanding your reference list to four or replacing your weakest reference is up to you.

Once you have established who to list as a reference and how to list them, the final step is where to list them.  Earlier on in this column’s run, when [discussing résumés](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/dont-ever-lie-and-other-useful-resume-tips/?rf=1), I said that “[r]eferences can probably be on a separate page, but if you are a 1L looking to fill up space, go ahead and include it on the main document,” and that advice remains true.  For the most part (again, clerkships are a separate situation), an employer is not going to be interested in your references until you well into the hiring process.  The reason is simply because references can be hard to get a hold of and an employer would rather have to do that for one or two candidates, as opposed to 25.  So while you should always have a list of references ready to go, do not feel obligated to include it in every application packet.  And no, you do not need to say “reference available upon request,” because that’s implicit in every application.  It is not as if an employer is going to ask you for reference and your response is going to be…

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

If outside counsel is responsible for going into battle, in-house counsel is responsible for preventing future battles.

Outside counsel can solve immediate problems by resolving litigation, but in-house counsel can eliminate future problems by evaluating the root causes of that litigation and sharing potential ways to avoid the litigation in the future.

As an in-house counsel, you are uniquely qualified to help eliminate future problems if you work closely with outside counsel as they defend those lawsuits brought against your organization. There is so much you can learn about the problems in your organization if you just take the time to look.  You can help answer discovery, attend depositions, review pleadings/motions, and attend trial as the organization’s representative. By participating in the process in this way, you will have the chance to do something your outside counsel doesn’t do. You can identify causes to root problems and help your organization find ways to help prevent similar future problems.

How do you do that? You can start by doing these things.

Ask Questions

While working with outside counsel, help outside counsel by gathering the facts necessary to defend the case. Talk to people inside and outside your organization. Find out what happen, when it happened, and why it happened.

Look At Your Policies And Your Procedures

As you are gathering facts, also take the time to review your policies and your procedures. Think about whether there are any policies and procedures at issue given the facts of your case. If there are policies and procedures at issue, were they known by the parties involved? Were they clear? Were they followed? If you don’t have policies and procedures, ask yourself whether your organization needs to create some moving forward.

Consider The Employees Involved

Did the employees do the jobs they were hired to do? If the employees did not do their jobs, ask the question why.

Also ask whether the employees at issue have the capacity to do their jobs. If they do not currently, ask if they have the potential to grow with the right mentoring and training or is the problem that they were not suited for the job at all.

Consider Your Management

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What about the manager’s role in the problem? Is there something your manager could have done differently that would have resulted in a different outcome? Are your managers prepared to do their jobs? Could they benefit from training?

Consider Training

Think about whether training would help prevent the problem in the future. Is the problem that the organization’s employees don’t know or understand internal policies and procedures, or is it that they don’t know or understand local, state, or federal law? Could your managers benefit from management training?

Examine Communication And Culture

Make sure you look at how employees within your organization communicate from the top levels of the leadership to the employees at the ground level and across divisions. Some problems can be addressed simply by improving communication.

Don’t overlook the message itself. If there is adequate communication, think about whether the organization is communicating the right message. What is communicated from the top can significantly contribute to the corporate culture, which in turn can impact how people behave.

Gather Resources

See if you can find resources that might help the organization address the problems that caused the litigation. If you cannot find anything that exists, think about whether there is something you can create and share with your leadership that would help prevent the problem in the future.

When you take the time to analyze what the organization’s employees do or do not do with respect to the problem, you can help your organization develop a plan to ensure that things are done differently to prevent future problems.

Desmond Tutu said it best: “There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they’re falling in.”

When you find root causes to problems and you take steps to help your organization eliminate them going forward, you are doing your organization a significant service. You are potentially preventing future problems. When you prevent future problems,  you give your leadership the chance to focus on the organization’s primary missions, goals, and objectives rather than having to focus on lawsuits.

# Davis Polk Weighs In On Associate Bonuses
## Getting in on the bonus game.

After the first Biglaw bonuses were announced earlier this week by compensation leader Cravath, the firms that consider themselves top tier have been lining up to announce their own 2017 bonuses… which coincidentally line up with Cravath’s. Now comes word that Davis Polk & Wardwell have come out with their bonus structure.

And it is exact what you’d expect.

In line with the other big players in the legal market, Davis Polk will offer bonuses based on class year according to the below schedule:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 and senior — $100,000

Associates will get paid their bonuses on December 22nd.

So, Davis Polk associates, how do these dollars stack up? It might be what you were expecting, but the bonus stagnation over the years has certainly left [others at big firms frustrated.](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-match-is-here/)

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

# Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firm Kills Its COVID Salary Cuts
## Plus, bonuses are still on the horizon for 'extraordinary' performance.

Just because some Biglaw firms are handing out COVID-19 bonus money hand over fist, we mustn’t forget there are still some firms that are dealing with COVID-19 austerity measures, from slashed salary to furloughs to layoffs. Today, those cuts end at one of America’s most profitable firms.

The latest firm to completely roll back its salary reductions is K&L Gates, another member of the billion-dollar club that placed 39th in the Am Law 100, with $1,026,626,000 in 2019 gross revenue.

Back in April, the firm [reduced salaries across the board](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/k-l-gates-cuts/), with equity partners seeing a 20 percent reduction in scheduled advances, and firm leaders taking even larger reductions. Income partners, associates, and allied professionals and staff were subject to a 15 percent reduction in their salary provided their income didn’t fall below a $75,000 floor. In late August, the firm walked back those reductions, with equity partners due to see a 15 percent cut to their advances at the end of September, while all other employees would sustain a 10 percent pay cut starting at the beginning of September (with the income floor shifting to $100,000 for no pay cuts).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Now, thanks to further review of its austerity measures, K&L Gates will be doing away with its salary cuts entirely. Here’s a relevant excerpt from a memo (available in full on the next page) sent by [Jim Segerdahl](https://www.klgates.com/James-R-Segerdahl), the firm’s global managing partner:

We are pleased to confirm on behalf of the Management Committee that it is now time to discontinue the Covid-19 salary reduction initiative entirely on a going forward basis, and that we are doing so for all affected allied professionals, associates and income partners effective October 16th (there may be some timing variations in certain markets).  Thus, salaries that were reduced as a result of the special Covid-19 initiative will return to pre-reduction levels on a going forward basis at that point in time.  The special Covid-19 related reductions in the provisional advances made to equity partners will cease on a going forward basis with the advances scheduled for the end of October.

In this memo, Segerdahl once again reminded everyone that K&L Gates is holding open the door for bonuses for those who have made “extraordinary contributions” during the pandemic. (Alas, the firm made no mention of fall appreciation bonuses.)

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Websites usually run through year-end lists of their most read stories, and we’re doing that here and there. But today, each of your Above the Law editors wanted to share their favorite stories they wrote this year, traffic be damned.

For me, 2018 was filled with stories about [clown lawyer Michael Cohen](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/clown-lawyer-michael-cohen-gonna-learn-today/), and [Brett Kavanaugh’s multiple moral failings](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/did-brett-kavanaugh-know-about-alex-kozinski/).

But my favorite story was, oddly, when I took the time to respond to all the readers who send me hate mail. Understand, I get a lot of hate mail generally, but 2018 was kind of a banner year for assholes popping up in my inbox. It would be exhausting to even notice all of it, much less respond to it. After one story in particular [drove white people crazy](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/you-realize-arming-teachers-is-going-to-lead-to-black-students-getting-murdered-by-their-teacher-right/), I did a [full hate mail dump](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/wherein-white-people-prove-my-point-and-send-me-hate-mail/).

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The concept of being able to proudly say what you really think is foreign to him, because what he probably “really thinks” is so disgusting that he can’t get away with saying it anywhere other than his own alt-right enclave. It’s why these people think “political correctness” is such a scourge. Because when these people crawl out from under their rocks, decent people are horrified. And these guys mistake that horror for hyper-sensitivity.

It was actually really satisfying. I think once a year I will indulge the racist people who email me… and respond.

This year, she also did some great postings about [Lawyer Moms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/lawyer-moms-of-america-to-protest-children-being-separated-from-their-parents-at-the-border/) and their organizing to protest the administration’s child separation policy.

But her top choice was exposing how firms were forcing summer associates into mandatory arbitration agreements, thus subtly silencing their sexual harassment claims.

Thanks to social media, no employees at Munger Tolles — from summers to staffers to associates to partners — will be forced to arbitrate sexual harassment claims. But what about those at the firm who previously signed agreements like this? Time may be up, but those who did will still be bound to the firm’s ways of the past.

How many other Biglaw firms are forcing law students to sign agreements like this, sending disputes into private tribunals beyond the prying eyes of the media or courts?

That story about summers indirectly led to prospective full-time associates from top law schools to [take a stand against these agreements](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/t14-law-school-groups-taking-a-stand-against-biglaw-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/).

But Joe’s favorite was bringing the “walking disgrace” that is Aaron Schlossberg to light. Joe did the initial post where Schlossberg was caught [threatening to call ICE](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/jerk-videotaped-threatening-to-call-ice-on-two-women-speaking-spanish-to-each-other-obviously-hes-a-lawyer/) on two women speaking Spanish to each other. And then he did the follow-up detailing that “very bad day” Schlossberg had once video of his rant went viral:

Walking disgrace Aaron Schlossberg unleashed his racist stylings on the world yesterday, publicly berating and threatening employees of a Manhattan eatery for speaking Spanish. Today, the world received a much-needed reminder that karma is real, with Schlossberg suffering for his actions in every possible way. Professionally, personally, seriously, frivolously… it’s coming from all directions and it’s entirely deserved.

Kathryn Rubino racked up the most pageviews this year (congratulations, your steak knives are in the mail), so she had a lot of popular stories to choose from. I assumed she’d pick one of her stories about Biglaw men still treating women like they’re trapped in the 1950s. And I was kind of right. I just got the firm wrong. I’m always up for more news about how [retrograde Jones Day is](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-hit-with-explosive-gender-discrimination-case/). But Kathryn went with men whining about not getting enough “credit” at Paul Hastings:

When talking about the role of women at your firm, maybe we don’t put a spotlight on the men. Paul Hastings seems to think men at the firm need a pat on the back for “including [women] in client work” and other basic stuff they should be doing anyway. Pro tip: If you’re trying to promote diversity, giving (mostly) white men center stage is doing the very, very least you can do.

# More Biglaw Firms Mandate Vaccines For Lawyers And Staff
## Welcome to the new normal.

Much progress has been made in America’s many battles against COVID-19, but thanks to the Delta variant, we’ve not yet won the war. In a world where the pandemic rages on vaccination seems to be our only defense, and more and more law firms are now mandating vaccines for employees to return to the office.

Thus far, the firms that have made vaccination a requirement for those returning to the office include [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Dickinson Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hanson Bridgett](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), and [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/). Now, we can add another five two firms to the list. Arent Fox, Davis Polk, Fried Frank, Reed Smith, and Schiff Hardin all recently added a vaccination mandate to their safety protocols.

As reported in the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/07/30/davis-polk-arent-fox-and-hogan-lovells-plan-vaccine-mandates-but-many-others-stay-silent/), while many firms declined to comment on their vaccination policies, and some said they were “monitoring the situation,” a few have spoken out about their new requirements.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Last Thursday, Davis Polk said that it would be mandating vaccination for lawyers and staff members. Considering the new mandate, COVID-19 testing will no longer be required for unvaccinated employees — as the hope, apparently, is that there will no longer be unvaccinated employees at the firm.

Arent Fox said this past Friday that “due to the clear and present danger of the delta variant for both unvaccinated and vaccinated people,” the firm will now require all employees to be fully vaccinated by September 6. All attorneys and staff must provide proof of vaccination.

UPDATE: Fried Frank and Reed Smith solidified their vaccination plans, and all employees are expected to be fully vaccinated by September 13. “With the prevalence of the Delta variant and the contagious nature of that strain, we have concluded that to best protect our people, it now makes sense to require that Reed Smith personnel who come into our offices be vaccinated,” said Doug Cameron, Reed Smith’s Managing Partner for the Americas. “Our top priority is the health and safety of our people,” Fried Frank noted in a statement. Joe Krasovec, managing partner of Schiff Hardin, announced today that not only would the firm be delaying its return to office until November 4, but that effective August 9, all employees and anyone entering the firm’s offices would be expected to be fully vaccinated. Effective immediately at the firm, anyone in the office must be masked and socially distanced.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know. The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

# Law School Is The Most Expensive Way To Figure Out What You Want To Do With Your Life
## Paying $150,000 up front or through loans -- in addition to the three-year commitment -- is a steep price to pay to resolve indecisiveness.

There are two universal truths when it comes to law school. The cost of attendance increases every year, and there is always a group of people who want to go because they don’t know what they want to do with their lives.

While every person’s story is unique, I found that most of these people tend to see being a lawyer as a temporary or fallback job compared to their dream job. They want to work as a lawyer to earn enough money and learn a few things before starting their own business or transitioning to another job outside of law. Others think that their law degree will make them eligible for well paying nonlawyer positions and if things don’t work out, they can at least work as a lawyer.

For the first group, switching jobs is not as easy as you think, especially if you are living paycheck to paycheck and if your dream job requires a pay cut. So you may want to hold off on the expensive luxury apartment and the $2,000 per month sports car lease until your dream job allows you to pay for those things. Also, you may have to explain to employers and recruiters why you want to leave the prestigious legal profession.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For the latter group, finding a job as a lawyer after a stint doing something else may be challenging. They will have to explain the employment gap and convince potential employers that the skills (or mistakes) they learned during that time will benefit the firm’s bottom line and will be a good culture fit. And in most cases, they will have to start at the bottom both in seniority and salary.

Let’s look at costs using my alma mater as an example. Looking at comparable schools, if Whitter Law School were still around today, tuition, and fees would likely be around $50,000 per year. A reasonable one-bedroom apartment near campus would go for about $2,500 per month (with utilities) which amounts to $30,000 per year. Also, the cost of food and gas has risen considerably in the past few years. Unless you plan to eat [inflation stew on a budget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaaI9mquljg) and use public transportation for the next three years, you will probably need to budget at least $1,500 per month or $18,000 per year for personal expenses. And if you have student loans, there is accruing interest to consider unless President Joe Biden plans to freeze interest indefinitely when his student loan forgiveness plan is struck down by the Supreme Court.

So some members of the 2026 graduation class of Whittier Law School will leave with $300,000 in student loan debt on top of their existing college debt. Others will have less debt because of discounts or because they live at home rent free.

If you think that is high, most of the top law schools charge on average at least $65,000 per year according to [biglawinvestor.com](https://www.biglawinvestor.com/t14-law-schools/) and since most of these schools are located in major cities, living expenses are likely to be higher as well. Except for those who come from wealth or scored major scholarships in exchange for giving up their admission seat to whatever law school U.S. News and World Reports ranks No. 1 this year, $300,000 will be the minimum debt load for these graduates although most will pay them off within a reasonable time.

Despite the above scenarios, surveys show that the average law school graduation debt is about $150,000. Personally, I am skeptical of this number because I suspect these surveys have a high likelihood of survivorship bias. In other words, the people with less debt are more likely to participate in these surveys.

But assuming the average is true, paying $150,000 up front or through loans — in addition to the three-year commitment — is a steep price to pay to resolve indecisiveness.

Before you make that long, expensive, and possibly stressful commitment, it would be best to spend the next few months figuring out what you really want to do and how to get there cheaper and faster.

It may mean working a year doing drudge work for slave wages which in some ways sounds like the first year of law school and your summer internship. But if it gets you experience and connections, it may be worth it.

You may have to reach out to random people for help and guidance, and honestly, most of them will ignore you or give you empty platitudes. In some ways, this sounds like what you will do if you are not chosen to be interviewed at your law school’s OCI session. But you need to connect with only a few people who will genuinely mentor you and guide you to the right people.

And lastly, you will have to be patient but spend the down time doing something productive instead of venting on social media. Sometimes it takes a while before the opportunity arises. In some ways, this sounds like almost every young attorney for the first five years after graduation.

Since the world is constantly changing, it’s okay to want to consider a wide variety of career options. But there are better ways to contemplate your life’s purpose instead of paying at least $150,000 and three years of your life for law school. Especially if you consider being a lawyer as a temporary or fallback position.

# Summer Associates Happy With Paychecks, Unhappy With Biglaw's Diversity
## Which law firms did the best in this year's rankings?

A summer celebrates his Cravath match.

We knew that when it came time for summer associates to rank satisfaction with this year’s programs, their reviews would be absolutely, positively glowing. After all, the vast majority of them received substantial pay raises after Cravath bumped up its salary scale so that first-year associates would earn $180,000 per year (as opposed to a mere $160,000). Average pay for summer associates increased to $3,289 per week this year, from $3,030 last year, with 85 percent of summers expecting to leave the firms with a job offer in hand. A sudden influx of cash coupled with the majority of Biglaw firms’ [decadent summer social events](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/best-summer-associate-event-contest-2016-the-winner/?rf=1) made for incredibly happy summer associates.

The overall average pay for summer associates increased to $3,289 a week, from $3,030 last year. Summer associates were optimistic about their future job prospects. About 85 percent expected to receive a job offer from their firm, and 64.4 percent predicted that they’d still be at the firm in five years, roughly the same figures as last year. They rated their overall level of worry about job opportunities 3.95 out of 5, with 5 meaning not worried at all. That figure was up from 3.84 last year and 2.76 in 2009.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
These were the conclusions drawn from the American Lawyer’s 2015 Summer Associate Survey. Am Law polled 4,200 law students at the nation’s largest firms about their summer experiences and used the results to rank 93 programs.

Once again, this summer’s overall rankings were overwhelmingly positive, with their overall level of worry about job opportunities coming in at a 3.95 out of 5 (with 5 meaning not worried at all). This was up from last year’s results (3.84), and significantly up from 2009, when jobs were figments of summer associates’ imaginations (2.76). Perhaps their swelling confidence is because money does make the grass look greener.

If you’re a law student trying to figure out where to spend your summer, you’re probably asking: which law firms came out with the highest scores?

Here are the top 10 summer programs of 2016, as ranked by American Lawyer:

There was a major shake-up in the rankings this year, and some firms that were in the top 10 last year sank (some like stones). Silly summers, we thought you loved your firms!

Nonetheless, congrats are in order for both Choate Hall & Stewart and Kaye Scholer for receiving perfect scores from their summers. This is Choate’s third year in the summer spotlight, and Kaye Scholer joins the firm at No. 1 for the second year in a row. In fact, all of the firms in the top 10 deserve to be praised for their near-perfect scores, especially the ones that soared in this year’s rankings, like Crowell & Moring and Hughes Hubbard. You can see how all 93 summer programs ranked at the [American Lawyer](http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/tal/SS-National-Charts.pdf).

Here are some additional details on [how these Biglaw firms stacked up](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202767578248/Choate-Hall-Kaye-Scholer-Again-Top-Summer-Associate-Rankings?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

A total of 13 firms earned a 5 out of 5 on the overall place to work category, including the top 10 performers on our list. Along with the two tied for first, they are Crowell & Moring, O’Melveny & Myers, Paul Hastings, Duane Morris, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, Schulte Roth & Zabel and Hughes Hubbard & Reed.

The summer associates who responded to our survey gave their firms an average score of 4.847 out of 5, with the lowest-scoring firm, Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart, earning a still-respectable 4.4.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
What was the biggest complaint summer associates had this year? A lack of diversity at their firms. Am Law reports that about 100 survey respondents mentioned diversity as an area that needed improvement. Here’s just [one of those complaints](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202767578248/Choate-Hall-Kaye-Scholer-Again-Top-Summer-Associate-Rankings?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

“It seems like the leaders of the firm rest on certain good points without thinking about what to do better,” wrote one Davis Polk summer associate. “While it’s amazing that 57 percent of the summer associates are women, that doesn’t explain what we’re doing to make sure women are on the path to partnership and are supported along the way. It’s great to have affinity groups for every underrepresented group, but what are we doing beyond affinity groups to ensure that diverse attorneys are getting client interaction and substantive work to ensure they are promoted?”

Biglaw firms’ incoming associates truly care about social issues, diversity being only one of them, and regardless of how much money they make, they’re still going to want to be employed at a firm that pays attention to what they want and need. Millennial lawyers are the wave of the future in Biglaw firms, so it’s time to stop paying lip service to things like gender equality, diversity, and work/life balance, and actually put those thoughts into action. Your associates will thank you when they arrive at the firm in a few years.

[](http://bit.ly/2EUI9X1)Earlier this month, we released our [Outside Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2019/) rankings, a look at the Biglaw firms most trusted by corporate legal departments. Today, we look at the firms that were rated highest by in-house attorneys based on the industries in which they work.

Drawing on input from GCs and in-house counsel from a range of business categories, we’ve compiled rankings for six different industries: Consumer Products, Energy, Media/Entertainment, Life Sciences/Health Care, Finance, and Technology.

Thirteen firms appear on more than one of our industry lists; these four firms below show up on three (!) or more:

- Davis Polk
- Gibson Dunn
- Latham & Watkins
- Weil Gotshal
Congratulations to all the firms represented. It’s no small thing to have the respect of the in-house attorneys you work with.

Take a look at the rankings here:
