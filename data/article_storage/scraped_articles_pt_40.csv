# Biglaw Firm Disappoints With Convoluted Bonus Formula With High Billable-Hour Requirement
## But even the highest billers might not make market bonuses.

One of the benefits of the lockstep nature of Biglaw bonuses (and compensation, generally for that matter), is that what associates are going to make is pretty clear. And if there are conditions (usually billable hours-based) it tends to be obvious and known well in advance. But that’s not always the case.

On Friday, Hogan Lovells announced year-end bonuses. The scale matches the market bonuses, subject to the firm’s usual 2,000-hour requirement, which can include up to 150 pro bono hours until associates meet a 1,850 billable-hour threshold, after which there’s no limit on pro bono hours.

The firm’s also giving out special bonuses ([full email available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/holove-bonuses/2/)):

We are also pleased to announce that this year we will pay a special bonus to associates in good standing.  The special bonus will be paid to all first and second year associates, and to those third year and more senior associates who have achieved at least 1,900 billable hours.  Amounts up to $40,000 will be awarded and will vary by class and level of achievement.  Our senior associates at the top of the scale have the potential to receive a total bonus amount of $160,000.

Hmmm, not the easy-to-digest chart most firms are going for, but perhaps associates at the firm will make out okay. And initial reactions from tipsters seemed to agree most associates would be fine:

This is exactly as expected…No confirmation on the exact year scales for the special bonuses, but given the range up to $40,000, everyone assumes it is the industry standard scale.

But today, there was a town hall with Americas Managing Partner Richard Lorenzo and a different methodology entirely was introduced. For associates 3rd-year and higher (there’s no minimum for 1st or 2nd years to get market special bonuses), the following formula will be used:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
-1900-1999 hours = 5% of base;
-2000-2099 hours = 15% of base;
-2100-2199 hours = 25% of base;
-2200+ hours = 40% of base.

So, for third-year associates that hit the previously stated billable target of 2,000, they’ll get full year-end bonuses but only a $7,500 special bonus. They’d have to bill 2,200 hours to get a full market special bonus of $20,000. And it gets worse — fourth- through sixth-year associates who even bill over this new 2,200-hour target will see smaller bonuses than their peers at other firms. (For example, a class of 2014 associate at HoLove with 2,200+ hours will get a $36,000 bonus, compared with the market rate of $37,000.) Senior associates that bill their butts off will have an opportunity to make market special bonuses of $40,000.

Let’s check in with HoLove tipsters and see how they’re doing (spoiler alert, they’re not okay):

It feels like an “F You” to the associates who have had a dip in their billable hours through no fault of their own. Folks like me have been doing everything in our power to help the firm in other ways, including BD, and this is a real stupid way for the firm to show its thanks. The tying to billable hours plus the face that the firm is giving it to first and second years without regard to hours means that this is hitting their profits as little as possible. They pretend to match the market while effectively giving close to nothing to most of their associates.

[Supplemental] bonuses, however, are based on a completely different scale than normal bonuses. Accordingly, this will result in below market bonuses, even for super high billers.

The firm is modifying the hour goal posts post-hoc (the firm has constantly repeated that they “match the market” at 2000 hours), and people are, understandably, upset.

….

First and second years have no hour requirements, which creates a situation where a second year who billed 10 total hours will get a bigger bonus than a seventh year who billed 1999, raising questions of fairness…

Speaking of fair, the craziest line of the town hall was when someone asked how this was fair and Richard said, “fair can be defined in many different ways”.

When associates started asking the tough questions, management quickly ended the town hall even though many associates asked to keep the line open so they could hear Richard explain these bonuses and respond to questions… not very transparent.

Not sure if you have heard, but Hogan Lovells just put a 2200 hour requirement on supplemental bonuses (and they are using a convoluted percentage based calculation for the amounts). Basically they are being vague and paying below market bonuses. People are not happy and the presenters ended the call when people started asking tougher questions.

Oof, it stinks to have the rug pulled out from under you like that.

# Biglaw Firms Scrap Return-To-Office Plans Yet Again Due To Latest COVID Variant

A new year is upon us, but COVID-19 is still making Biglaw firms to adjust their return-to-office plans in our “post”-pandemic world. The omicron variant remains a disruptive force across the country. Many law firms were once hopeful that January 2022 would be when they’d finally be able to get their workforces back to the office. Those plans — like most plans related to returning to our pre-corona lives — have been foiled yet again.

Quite a few US firms have already revised their return-to-office plans (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/litigation-boutique-revises-its-hybrid-return-to-office-plan-due-to-omicron-variant/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/goodwin-rto-march-2022/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/sidley-bans-the-unvaccinated-from-the-office/), and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-firms-delay-reopenings-due-to-omicron-variant-setting-returns-for-april-and-beyond/)). The latest firms to announce changes to their office return plans are just going with the viral flow, and will reconsider their efforts if and when they can.

Morrison & Foerster and Paul Weiss were hoping to make their grand returns to the office in January and February, and those plans are now being rescheduled (again). [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/omicron-still-vexes-large-law-firms-more-office-returns-delayed-2022-01-28/) has the details:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Morrison & Foerster, which previously set an office return date of Feb. 14, will keep attendance voluntary until at least March 1, a firm representative confirmed on Friday. …

San Francisco-founded Morrison & Foerster is requiring COVID-19 vaccinations, and “strongly” encouraging boosters, for those going into its U.S. offices, the representative said.

As for Paul Weiss, the firm is now extending its work-from-home orders to February 14. Employees were previously told they could work remotely until January 24. Once everyone is back to the office, they’ll be expected to work there at least three days each week. Paul Weiss is requiring everyone to be boosted before entering the office.

Other firms still, like Sheppard Mullin, are adopting indefinite delays for their RTO plans.

The Los Angeles-founded firm pushed its office return from Feb. 7 to a date to be determined, firm chair Lucantonio Salvi said in an internal memo dated Jan. 14.

Vaccinated employees are free to work in Sheppard Mullin’s offices if they prefer, Salvi said. The firm will give 30 days’ notice before setting a new return date, after which employees will have to work in the office at least three days per week, the memo said.

What has your firm announced as far as a revised reopening plan due to the omicron variant? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a new market standard for a return.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Biglaw Lawyers Come To the Defense Of Justice Clarence Thomas

Justice Clarence Thomas

Later this month, on October 23, Justice Clarence Thomas will celebrate his [25th anniversary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas) as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. During his quarter-century of service on the Court, he has proven himself to be an eloquent advocate of originalism and a strong critic of stare decisis (one of several points of disagreement between him and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, contrary to the [widespread misconception](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/supreme-court-2016-clarence-thomas-legacy-214319) that Thomas was just a Scalia clone).

Even people who disagree with Justice Thomas’s views have acknowledged his distinctive and powerful jurisprudence. As prominent liberal legal commentator Ian Millhiser wrote over at [Think Progress](https://thinkprogress.org/beware-clarence-thomas-is-one-of-americas-top-legal-minds-718abf17a851#.r8t2cpdus), “Clarence Thomas is not a lightweight. He is one of the more intelligent members of the Supreme Court. And he is one of the most dangerous men in America. Progressives dismiss his intellect at their peril.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Despite his distinguished tenure on SCOTUS, Justice Thomas [can’t get no respect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield) from some quarters. For example, despite being only the second African-American to serve on the Court, Justice Thomas “is [practically absent](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/clarence-thomas-and-all-the-other-heroes-unfairly-excluded-from-the-african-american-history-museum/) from the new National Museum of African American History and Culture” — while Anita Hill, who famously accused Thomas of sexual harassment, “is given prominent billing.”

But Justice Thomas does have his defenders — in the halls of Biglaw, interestingly enough. Large law firms tend to be [rather liberal](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-mostly-liberal-political-ideologies-of-american-lawyers-law-schools-and-firms/), so it’s somewhat surprising to find staunch supporters of CT among the ranks of Biglaw partners and counsel.

Here’s a complaint we recently received from a source at Sidley Austin in D.C.:

Email from a partner at Sidley D.C. [last Thursday] morning announcing that the firm had seats at its table for the National Women’s Law Center annual dinner, and that she was “proud to share” that Anita Hill (among others) would be part of the program. So far, nothing unusual.

But the response from another partner — co-chair of the D.C. hiring committee — and sent to all D.C. office lawyers (see screenshot) really horrified a lot of the associates…. Hard to imagine how any woman, especially women of color, would want to keep working with this guy.

So what was the supposedly “horrif[ying]” email? Here’s the message in question, from litigation partner [Jonathan F. Cohn](http://www.sidley.com/people/cohn_jonathan):

For anyone who is not “proud” to hear from Anita Hill, I am happy to buy drinks at the St. Regis for anyone that evening (10/18) at 6 pm. My treat.

Snarky? Sure. Politically incorrect? Perhaps. But I wouldn’t call it “horrif[ying],” and I don’t think it should give any woman lawyer pause over working with Cohn. (Disclosure: Jon Cohn and I clerked for the same Ninth Circuit judge and are friendly, although I haven’t seen or spoken to him in a while.)

An important piece of context: Jon Cohn clerked for Justice Thomas. So it shouldn’t surprise or upset anyone to see him coming to the defense of his former boss, who enjoys great loyalty, respect, and affection from his former clerks, many of them women (such as U.S. Senate candidate Wendy Long, who [calls Thomas](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/meet-a-former-supreme-court-clerk-and-wife-of-a-biglaw-partner-who-vocally-supports-donald-trump/) “the greatest living American”). Justice Thomas has consistently maintained his innocence of the charges against him, and it would not be reasonable to expect someone as close to him as a former law clerk to believe the charges simply because HBO made a movie about them.

Which brings us to the second Biglaw attorney speaking up in CT’s defense lately. [Mark Paoletta](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/p/paoletta-mark-r/), of counsel in the D.C. office of DLA Piper, has [made](http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/04/25/mark-paoletta-hbos-biased-clarence-thomas-movie-is-rebooting-this-bogus-war-on-women-to-help-hillary-clinton/) [headlines](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/hbo-hit-with-liberal-bias-charge-over-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-film/article/2583684) with his vocal criticism of Confirmation, HBO’s ([disappointing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/standard-of-review-confirming-that-you-dont-need-to-watch-confirmation/)) dramatization of Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearings. Paoletta, who worked on the Thomas nomination while in the White House Counsel’s Office, has set up a website, [ConfirmationBiased.com](http://confirmationbiased.com/), to identify the inaccuracies and biases that he perceives in the film.

I doubt we will ever know for certain, so many years later, exactly what transpired between Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill (and query whether even the two of them have perfect memories of what occurred). I’ll leave you with the words of Harvard law professor [Jeannie Suk Gersen](http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10869/SukGersen/) — a former law clerk to Justice David Souter, and far from a card-carrying member of the Federalist Society — who [wrote](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215112285456854), “One need not be soft on sexual harassment to realize… that our country put Clarence Thomas through hell on the basis of accusations that don’t approach the sexual allegations that we have rightly allowed to recede into the background of Bill Clinton’s distinguished career. The high-tech lynching didn’t keep Justice Thomas off the Court, but it did plenty of damage that, on closer scrutiny today, doesn’t look fair by our own standards.”

# Gresham’s Law And The Practice Of Law
## The bad always tends to drive out the good.

One of the foundational concepts of monetary theory is Gresham’s Law. Named after the Tudor-era financier who founded the Royal Exchange — who didn’t actually formulate it but gets the credit — it states that bad money drives good money out of circulation. If you have copper and zinc pennies in circulation, both nominally worth one cent, but the value of copper is higher, you create an arbitrage opportunity and gradually the copper coins will be taken out of circulation by [enterprising individuals](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/laws-change-penny-hoarders-cash-thousands-dollars/story?id=15076522).

But the bad tends to drive out the good everywhere. Bad habits overpower good habits. Bad people push away good people. Bad procedures make good procedures irrelevant.

Keep An Eye On Your Bad Habits

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So keep an eye on your bad habits. If you’re not careful, they’ll quickly overpower your good ones. No matter how carefully researched and thoughtfully drafted your brief is, a few typos will completely ruin the effect and turn the brief into a mess. One badly argued section will burn your credibility for the rest of the brief and probably the rest of the case.

This certainly doesn’t mean that you should be afraid of taking risks — in fact, timidity almost always reflects badly upon its practitioner — but you should always keep in mind that the importance of carefulness is almost always even more than you expect. Carelessness compounds, and a sloppy mistake is almost always going to draw attention. That’s in large part because you’re expected by all parties — clients, judges, and other lawyers — to be careful and present things clearly and correctly. No one will give you extra credit for doing the basic aspects of your job, nor should you expect them to.

Keep On Task And On Message

It’s likewise important to keep things on task, on message, and on a consistent theme. An otherwise clear, persuasive argument is ruined once you start rambling about some confusing or unrelated topic that the judge doesn’t follow, or start misstating an authority.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Instead, always remember to stay organized and focused, looking to shave off any areas of weakness or distraction that you can find. There are always areas to improve in any argument, and time spent on improvement is rarely wasted. When I prepare for an argument, I typically go over it in my head and type up notes, then go over the notes again and again to tighten it, find weak points to emphasize and see anywhere where I can improve. Briefs should go the same way: it never hurts to go over everything another time — including the old trick about reading it backward — to look for weaknesses and areas of improvement. And pulling in someone else never hurts. It’s sometimes shocking how, after you look too long at something, you end up missing something that is obvious when reading it the first time.

Always Keep Focused On Continual Improvement

Perhaps the best way to avoid the slow rot of Gresham’s inevitable and misattributed warning of atrophy is to focus singularly on continually improving whatever is before you. By keeping your eye on all of your potential weak spots, you can more easily find where the weaknesses actually are. So start today, and make it your goal to keep the bad from driving out the good.

* Let’s get ready to rumble! Not wanting to be left out of the party, Oklahoma has also asked the Supreme Court to take a look at its same-sex marriage statute which was recently slapped down by the Tenth Circuit. [National Law Journal]

* Dewey know what financial restructuring adviser Joff Mitchell of Zolfo Cooper said to this failing firm’s partners right before it flopped for good? “Look, there is no way here to save this firm.” Ouch. That had to have sucked. [Forbes]

* The examiner who was appointed to monitor law firm billing for the City of Detroit’s bankruptcy is now questioning Dentons’ fees of up to $27K per month to talk to the press. Whoa there… [Detroit Free Press]

* Utah is appealing its gay marriage case directly to the Supreme Court, presumably because the state’s attorney general doesn’t even want to bother with an en banc hearing before the Tenth Circuit. This should be good. [Salt Lake Tribune]

* Perkins Coie recently appointed its first ever Washington, D.C.-based managing partner in its 102-year history. Congrats to John Devaney, who will lead a “true national firm” beginning in January 2015. [Capital Business / Washington Post]

* When your career goes awry in Biglaw through no one’s fault but your own, you can end up living your life in shame or in jail. We’re going venture a guess and say the former is nicer than the latter. [Am Law Daily]

* For all of you gearing up for the bar exam, take heart that failure isn’t the end of the world. At least if you fail with a last name like “Roosevelt” or “Kennedy.” [Buzzfeed] * Hobby Lobby may be behind us, but there are still anti-ACA cases on the horizon. [The Advisory Board Company] * Morning Docket noted Neal Katyal’s op-ed suggesting the Supreme Court was less divided these days. Consider this a detailed response. [mitchellepner] * Thoughts on Kitchen v. Herbert. [Pollvogtarian] * The great unpaid internship revolt is on. And based on Harris, we should expect the working stiff’s got a great chance here. [Capital New York] * Some right-wing college paper is bent out of shape that a full law professor teaching one class (and running a clinic) is paid over $200,000. That salary actually doesn’t sound all that shocking. Now what would be interesting (though these folks probably wouldn’t care) is how that salary stacks up to his female colleagues’ pay.

* “Just about everyone he came in contact with, he managed to corrupt.” Paul Daugerdas, formerly of Jenkins & Gilchrist, was sentenced to 15 years for his role in an $8B fraud scheme. [Businessweek]

* Despite what you may have been led to believe, not all patent awards are as high as those you see in media headlines. Fewer than 2% of infringement cases even result in damages. [National Law Journal]

* When is it okay to turn down a Biglaw offer and head to a plaintiffs firm? Probably when you’re planning to file a massive class-action suit against the MLB on behalf of minor leaguers. [St. Louis Post-Dispatch]

* William Mitchell Law’s new J.D. program is the first of its kind to be approved by the ABA. It’s half online, half on-site (does 9 times count as half?), and we see more like this coming down the line. [U.S. News]

* Dewey know which D&L defendants did the perp walk of shame before their arraignment yesterday? Three of the ex-executives! Even Steve Davis, who quit his job as in-house counsel to Ras al Ghul Khaimah of the UAE last week. [Am Law Daily]

* It’s about half and half when it comes to states that have filed briefs with the Tenth Circuit in support of or against the rulings striking down gay marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma. Sadly, not everyone can be as fabulous as we’d like. [National Law Journal]

* Abortion clinics are closing their doors in Texas thanks to new legislation, and the total number of clinics in the state come September will be six. Let the Mexican medical tourism commence. [New York Times]

* Illegal immigrants can’t practice law in Florida, says the state’s Supreme Court, but they can in California. Good thing there’s eleventy billion law schools there to accommodate them. [Miami Herald]

* Webster Lucas, the fellow suing McDonald’s over an alleged race-based napkin denial that’s since prevented him from working, has sued fast food joints before. He’s a “vexatious litigant.” [NBC Los Angeles]

* There will be filibusters: Victoria Nourse, a Georgetown Law professor whose nomination to the Seventh Circuit was blocked, thinks the political move will remain intact for future SCOTUS nominees. [Legal Times]

* The Tenth Circuit politely pwned Roberta Kaplan. Her bid to intervene in the Utah same-sex marriage case before the court was rejected. Guess she’ll have settle for writing an amicus brief. [Salt Lake Tribune]

* Are laterals killing your firm? It happened to Dewey, and it could happen to you. Only you can prevent lateral fires. Take the pledge and show your commitment to lateral fire prevention. [American Lawyer]

* Lawyers are worried about what’s been going down at the storied Canadian firm of Heenan Blaikie. A third of its partners did the dip over the weekend amid financial troubles. Sounds familiar… [Ottawa Citizen]

* Women are slowly but surely working to close the gender gap in the law — well, at least they are in South Florida. It seems to be working, though, so feel free to follow their lead. [Daily Business Review]

* Roberta Kaplan, the lawyer who brought DOMA down to its knees, is repping clients who want to intervene in the gay marriage case before the Tenth Circuit. Looks like somebody wants to be 2013 and 2014 Lawyer of the Year. [BuzzFeed]

RBG was there most of the time, except for nap time. [Legal Times] * You’re doin’ fine, Oklahoma! Oklahoma O.K.! The Tenth Circuit announced it’s going to fast-track Oklahoma’s same-sex marriage appeal, and it’ll be heard by the same panel of judges presiding over a very similar appeal from Utah. [News OK] * The American Legal Institute just named Ricky Revesz, the former dean of NYU Law School, as its new director. He’ll be “clarifying, modernizing and improving the law,” just like he kind of / sort of did with NYU’s 3L curriculum, but not really. [National Law Journal] * Law students, say hello to the Immigrant Justice Corps, a job opportunity brought to you by Chief Justice Robert Katzmann of the Second Circuit. Hey, the pay is pretty decent for public interest. [New York Times] * The results of the latest Law School Survey of Student Engagement reveal to us 1Ls are morons. Seventy percent of them are thrilled with career services, but only 45% of 3Ls feel the same way. [WSJ Law Blog] * She’s no George Zimmerman: Jodi Arias has a racked up a legal tab of more than $2 million, but because her artwork isn’t as hot as she is, the bill will be footed by Arizona taxpayers.

* Barack Obama is trailing George W. Bush when it comes to leaving his mark on the federal courts, but that’s probably because Senate Democrats didn’t go nuclear quickly enough. [Blog of Legal Times]

* When it comes to 2013, one thing’s for sure: it wasn’t boring. Many of this year’s movers and shakers hailed from top Am Law 100 law firms — like Ted Cruz (formerly of Morgan Lewis). [American Lawyer]

* John Ray III isn’t going to sit back and allow a jury to shut down his discrimination and retaliation case against Ropes & Gray. He filed a notice of appeal last week, and he’s pissed off. [National Law Journal]

* Utah has until the end of January to figure out how it’s going to go about defending its same-sex marriage ban before the Tenth Circuit. Just a thought: the “it’s still gay, even if the balls don’t touch” theory of law isn’t going to cut it. [Deseret News]

* A lawyer for the Texas judge accused of strangling his girlfriend is offering media outlets a superb defense story on behalf of his client. He wasn’t trying to kill her, he was trying to save her! [New York Daily News]

* The Tenth Circuit will not be blocking same-sex marriages from occurring in Utah, so the next stop will be Supreme Court intervention. Sorry, but we have a feeling that Justice Sonia Sotomayor isn’t going to be too helpful with that. [MSNBC]

* Winston & Strawn, if you’re overbilling on pro bono motions and you want fees, you might want to be more descriptive. Please tell this judge what “preparation for filing” even means, and why you spent more than four hours doing it. [New York Law Journal]

* This judge felt she was “being played with,” so she took a man’s kid away from him during Christmas. Now a judicial ethics commission is showing her that it’s not one to be played with. [Texas Lawyer]

* Yay, happy news! Chapman Law’s associate dean for student affairs really takes her job responsibilities to heart. She’s performed several wedding ceremonies for both students and alumni. [National Law Journal]

* The Indian diplomat who got strip-searched was arrested over a silly mistake, says her lawyer. It’s too bad that a lack of reading comprehension can result in having to bend over and spread ‘em. [Bloomberg]

* Law firm Halloween party advice. I disagree with some of this — my “Sexy John Marshall” costume was always a hit. [Greedy Associates / FindLaw] * The Supreme Court is expected to review a 10th Circuit decision holding that corporations are people and can exercise religious rights. Hopefully the Supreme Court stops this madness before my cable company has the right to bear arms. [Constitutional Accountability Center] * Governor Chris Christie has dropped his appeal of the New Jersey court decision authorizing same-sex marriage. He finally worked out that his own homophobia wasn’t worth being on the wrong side of 61 percent of Jersey voters. [Politico] * Let’s go get some Molly! [Law and More] * California is tightening up its Workers’ Comp rules for former professional athletes. From now on, injured ex-jocks need to prove a more significant tie to the state to collect compensation. This presents a problem for a lot of former football players who now have to admit they played for the Raiders. [The Legal Blitz] * Judge Smith of the New York Court of Appeals gets a scathing open letter. It’s fun when lawyers go “Flame On!” toward judges they might eventually be in front of. [New York Personal Injury Law Blog] * Governor Rick Snyder is asking a judge to drop her request to see unredacted copies of internal emails about the search for the Detroit emergency manager. Because nothing seemed sketchy about employing a law that had been specifically repealed by Michigan voters to overturn the democratically elected leadership of a major metropolis to install a partner from a firm that just so happens to get chosen as bankruptcy counsel, earning a ton of fees from the whole affair. Nothing at all. [Detroit News] * Guy sues Apple because he hates iOS 7. Not the dumbest suit ever brought against Apple. [BGR] * Entertainment lawyer Harry M. Brittenham moonlights as the author of graphic novels. A lawyer writing comic books may sound like a guy living in his mom’s basement, but he’s actually married to Heather Thomas from The Fall Guy.

* Our own Elie Mystal isn’t the only one who’s capable of fanning the flames of race baiting — it seems that Supreme Court justices can do it, too! We’ll probably have more on Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s benchslap later today. [The Two-Way / NPR]

* Patience is obviously one of this judge’s virtues, because this took a looooong time. After waiting more than a year for people to put their petty political pandering aside, the Senate confirmed Robert Bacharach to the Tenth Circuit. [Blog of Legal Times]

* Mary Jo White, the nominee to lead the SEC, will probably face her confirmation hearing in March. Her legal wranglings at Debevoise may be of interest to some, but really, who cares? She’s so cute and tiny! [Reuters]

* Mayer Brown and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year: gross revenue is up overall at most Biglaw firms, but not this one. In 2012, Mayer Brown’s revenue dipped 3.7 percent for a six-year low. [Am Law Daily]

* Kirkland & Ellis, now the fifth-largest Biglaw firm in the nation, is leading the market in terms of top dollar merger-and-acquisition deals. Now, if only the firm could get some bananas. [Crain’s Chicago Business]

* Orderly liquidation authority may be a legitimate exercise of power under the Bankruptcy Clause, but as far as these states are concerned, it’s just another reason to hate the Dodd-Frank Act. [DealBook / New York Times]

* Remember Peggy Ableman, the judge who ordered lawyers to attend a course on remedial civility in their “jammies”? She’s now at McCarter & English, so mind your manners. [Thomson Reuters News & Insight]

* An “astronomically stupid” legal loophole? Unpossible! Gun trusts are seeing the limelight because Chris Dorner claims he used one to purchase his paraphernalia without a background check. [New York Times]

* Harvard Law graduate Barack Obama is being feted as CNN’s “Most Intriguing Person of 2012,” but he’s currently trailing in fourth place in the most important year-end poll of all: Above the Law’s Lawyer of the Year competition. Get out there and vote! [CNN]

* Federal district court judges aren’t being confirmed as quickly as they once were, and it’s partly because our president isn’t submitting nominees as quickly as those who came before him. [WSJ Law Blog (sub. req.)]

* But even if the president nominated judges more quickly, he’d continue to face harsh opposition from the NRA, which matters because the gun group has an entire party in its pocket. [Opinionator / New York Times]

* A legal problem and a journalism problem wrapped up in a little pretty bow: David Gregory of NBC’s “Meet the Press” is being investigated for displaying an alleged 30-round magazine on the air. [Washington Post]

* One of New York’s most prestigious private schools agreed to settle the sex abuse suit brought against it by former students. Simpson Thacher partner Phil Culhane must be doing a victory dance. [New York Daily News]

* You got a fast car, and now this case will pay all our bills. Toyota settled a class action suit over unintended acceleration, and it’s touted as one of the largest product-liability settlements in history. [New York Times]

* Ay dios mio! You know that you’re never going to enjoy another vacation when you catch a hotel employee spreading his seed all over your clothes. But what did you expect? It’s Mexico. [Courthouse News Service]

* Only 44% of Americans approve of how the Supreme Court is doing its job, but that’s probably because the other 56% wouldn’t know what the Supreme Court was unless the justices were contestants on a reality show. [New York Times]

* Having nothing to do with the outcome of this Tenth Circuit appeal, apparently a juror in the underlying case had no idea when the First Amendment was adopted. As Bush II would say, is our children learning? [U.S. Tenth Circuit / FindLaw]

* Who’s going to win the “Super Bowl” of Android patent trials? Nobody. Judge Richard Posner has issued a “tentative” order which noted that both sides of the Apple/Google case ought to be dismissed. [Reuters]

* You should’ve “known better”: in case we didn’t make it abundantly clear when we spoke about NALP’s data for the class of 2011, the job market for new law grads is being classified as “brutal.” [National Law Journal]

* U. Chicago Law revolutionized the field of law and economics, but much to their school’s, everyone else copied them. Now they’re thinking up new ways to do the same things. Gunners gotta gun. [Businessweek]

* Say hello to Mary Lu Bilek, the woman who’s been appointed as the new dean of UMass Law. Hopefully she’s not keen on using school credit cards for personal spending like the last dean. [Wall Street Journal]

* Occupy Wall Street protesters can’t sue NYC, its mayor, or its police commissioner, but they can sue the police. And with that news, “F**k tha Police” was sung in drum circles across the tri-state area. [Bloomberg]

Look how quickly firms are willing to match the market when Davis Polk comes around. We can’t wait until Cravath gives this salary scale its seal of approval, because then the match madness will happen at an even more frenzied pace.

The latest firm to increase associate salaries is Dechert, which came in at No. 37 in the most recent Am Law 100 after taking home $1,071,163,000 gross revenue in 2020. Here’s what associates can expect their compensation to look like at the firm, beginning in March (and retroactive to January):



Much like Bruno, we don’t talk about Counsel, no, no, no — and neither does Dechert. Counsel at the firm will receive raises on a case-by-case basis. How is your firm handling salary increases for counsel? Please let us know so these attorneys aren’t kept in the dark.

Congratulations to everyone at Dechert!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Dechert.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

From day one, I wanted to create a safe space where I could integrate my passion for social justice with the job. The balancing act for me has come in the last 36 hours or so. I obviously have billable work I need to get to, calls today that I need to plan for. The difference right now is that we are under work-from-home and stay-at-home orders. With that comes more autonomy over your schedule and the ability to shift your responsibilities around. Working from home, I can multitask in a way that I could not in the office.

I want to be as optimistic as possible and am heartened by what has been demonstrated in the last few days. [But] my concern is that once the city starts to open up, when bars and restaurants are open, people will find other ways to spend their time when they have to start doing the 9-5 again.

# Biglaw Firms In Rumored Tie-Up Talks Refuse To Comment On Would-Be Merger
## Is there a combination in the works here?

Has your firm experienced declining revenue and drops in headcount thanks to lateral departures? Did you have to take out a $5.3 million PPP loan during the pandemic? Were layoffs and salary cuts part of your coronavirus crisis survival plans? After a financially successful finish in 2020, are you looking ahead to the future but unsure about next steps? You may be experiencing the urge to merge.

This is reportedly what’s happening at Chicago-based Schiff Hardin, and the firm is supposedly in talks with D.C.-based Arent Fox, which has been [larding itself up with lateral hires](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/30/ahead-of-a-possible-merger-arent-fox-bulks-up-with-lateral-hires/) in recent weeks. The firms seem to be well matched in terms of finances: last year, Schiff had a revenue per lawyer of $827,000 and $1.07 million in profits per equity partner, while Arent had a revenue per lawyer of $866,000 and $1.11 million in profits per equity partner. But not so fast, matchmakers….

According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/29/schiff-hardin-seeking-merger-partner-eyes-arent-fox/), neither firm would confirm the tie-up talks.

“Schiff Hardin is committed to a vision of growth that best positions the firm to serve our clients’ needs. Our focus is on earning the trust of our clients every day and maintaining our culture of quality and professional excellence. To advance our goals, from time to time we evaluate potential strategic combinations to expand our service offerings to our clients, but we do not comment on rumor or speculation,” the Chicago firm said.

For its part, Arent Fox also said the firm doesn’t comment on specific rumors. The firm added in a statement: “We are always looking for opportunities to expand into high-growth markets in a way that responds to client demand while protecting Arent Fox’s collegiality and culture. Our priority is typically to focus on shared strengths in terms of industries and practices.”

Will they or won’t they? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see.

# When Did Biglaw Associates Become Such Bootlickers?

Seriously, was it when compensation crossed the $200K threshold? Because honestly, if firms knew that was all it took to buy this level of obsequious devotion, they’d have made that investment years ago. It’s a cheap outlay for this kind of loyalty.

Let’s take a step back.

No one’s suggesting associates can’t have a certain esprit de corps when it comes to the firm. I always liked my firms. But I didn’t fool myself into believing that this profession as a whole isn’t riddled with screamers and nightmare bosses. There’s a line between hard work and navigating stressful tasks and getting abused. Associates generally recognize that line.

Which brings us to a recent exchange on Reddit, where you’d expect all the most satisfied and happy-go-lucky lawyers to congregate. A Bloomberg Law reporter recently braved the trek to r/biglaw to ask for some help on an upcoming story.



On the one hand, this is an entirely reasonable ask of a community of Biglaw lawyers sharing their experiences. On the other hand, it’s a reasonable request of the Internet, so…

Horror stories abound, and we hear more of them than we can ever possibly write up. But associates are also leery of handing them out for publication because the specific details almost always give away their identity. Happy associate stories are all alike; every unhappy associate story is horrifyingly tragic in its own way.

That’s why you can’t really go fishing for those sorts of stories in this industry, you just have to wait for them to come to you. It’s worth noting that this is the same Bloomberg team that breathlessly reported that Sidley had jacked up associate salaries by misreading the firm’s class year promotion memo, an error that [other outlets](https://twitter.com/AmericanLawyer/status/1470502512881020940) immediately piled onto while [we at Above the Law screamed from the sidelines](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/1470503449229987846?s=20) that [none of this was actually happening](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/no-sidley-has-not-increased-their-compensation-scale/), so there are some nuances of how this industry works that they still need to get a handle on.

So it seems like asking the curmudgeons at Reddit for help is a good idea though one unlikely to turn up much but crickets.

Still, as they say on the ole internets, “you won’t believe what happened next”:

I honestly did not have “Redditors talk about how much they love their bosses” on my bingo card. Do your bosses have surveillance software installed or something? If you can’t speak freely say, “Frankly, I don’t think law schools charge enough.”

On the other hand, perhaps this was the most Redditor of all responses. A reporter asked in good faith for some assistance and the community dropped everything to be as obstinately contrarian as possible.

You know how we know these folks are the exception and not the rule? The massively active lateral market.

Temper the insular self-absorption. Just because you’re a gunner who thinks “I get paid well enough to excuse anything” doesn’t mean you’re the norm. If this request doesn’t apply to you, just get out of the way.

Calling these stories “sensationalist”? How do these people think websites make money?



Yep, it’s all about those pageviews that keep us swimming in all the whale oil that keeps the lights on! Shockingly, getting a couple bucks per 1,000 views is lovely but it isn’t getting the job done in journalism.

Horror stories aren’t about shock value, but sharing a (hopefully appreciated) big picture perspective on an industry that too often cloisters itself. Stories like these help firms realize that the screamers aren’t all “gone” and senior lawyers realize how their behavior unintentionally comes across. And for the rare instance of a firm that really has built a perfect working environment, these stories give them an opportunity to pat themselves on the back.

If the practice of law is more humane today, a good part of that progress stems from sites shining a light on these stories. As for positive stories, it’s true that “no one yelled at me today” isn’t a publishable story. But there are [positive law firm stories](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-firm-to-pick-up-the-tab-for-your-next-vacay/) that journalists highlight when those stories help others in the industry make the practice of law better.

The legal industry is bigger than your experience. If you don’t have horror stories, then good for you. That doesn’t mean they aren’t out there and a lot more valuable than your “my job is ACCEPTABLE!” takes.

Though it may be worth exploring the tip about how happy you are to be working 9 to 7 in Biglaw. That would actually generate some pageviews since it’s a fucking fairy tale.

# DOJ Nixed Walmart Pill Mill Prosecution Because 'We Are All Capitalists Here'

What would American corporations do without Jones Day to put in a good word with the higher ups at the Justice Department? It would be pandemonium if those pesky U.S. Attorneys were allowed to just prosecute every Fortune 500 company that broke the law, right? Thank goodness we have such a well-connected firm to perform the valuable public service of protecting shareholder bottom lines. Why, it’s almost like pro bono work!

Take a break from your COVID-19 panic attack to read ProPublica’s wild [piece](https://www.propublica.org/article/walmart-was-almost-charged-criminally-over-opioids-trump-appointees-killed-the-indictment) on the Eastern District of Texas’s two-year-long effort to hold Walmart accountable for dispensing millions of opioids, despite clear evidence that they were being illegally prescribed and likely diverted for resale. It features an especially unflattering cameo by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who, when advised that a civil fine would be meaningless to a company like Walmart with unlimited cash, quipped, “Not that there’s anything wrong with that, we are all capitalists here.”

LOL.

Then he told them to lay off corporate, and see if they could indict some poor schlub in middle management. But when the Texas USAs tried to prosecute a “mid-level Walmart manager,” political appointees at Main Justice blocked that, too,

“You have a whopper of a civil case,” said former Kirkland and Ellis partner Brian Benczkowski, who has never actually tried a case in court, but is somehow the head of the DOJ’s Criminal Division. But after Jones Day’s intercession, the civil case was eighty-sixed, as well. It’s good to have friends in high places!

The case started back December 2016, when the DEA raided a Walmart in McKinney, Texas pursuant to an investigation of two pain management doctors, Howard Diamond and Randall Wade, for drug trafficking.

Walmart pharmacists had been sounding the alarm about Diamond for more than a year.

“We are all concerned about our jobs and about filling for a pill mill doctor. I’m in my 29th year with Walmart and have never had a situation this bad with a doctor,” one pharmacist wrote to corporate in Febraury, 2015. “Other chains are refusing to fill for him which makes our burden even greater. Please help us.”

That same month, another wrote, “Doctor Diamond is a problem and a liability on us… Filling for him is a risk that keeps me up at night. This is a serious situation.”

Indeed, Kroger, CVS, Walgreens, Target, and RiteAid had all blocked his patients from filling prescriptions at their stores. But Walmart continued to insist that there could be no blanket ban on individual prescribers, and pharmacists had to take twenty minutes to fill out a form rejecting individual prescriptions on a case by case basis. So Walmart didn’t ban Wade until November 2016, a month after he was indicted, and held off on banning Diamond until March of 2017. By then, Walmart had dispensed 2.2 million doses of controlled substances, averaging 21 prescriptions per day for the two doctors together, between 2011 and 2016.

All of which took place under the pendency of a secret [Memorandum of Agreement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6818269-Walmart-MOA-03-17-2011-Final.html), with the DEA, reached after a Walmart in California “dispensed controlled substances to individuals that [the pharmacy] knew or should have known were diverting the controlled substances.”

In the spring of 2018, the Eastern District of Texas informed Walmart that it intended to bring a criminal action, and Jones Day swung into action. It was ugly from the jump.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to two people familiar with the prosecution, [AUSA Heather] Rattan told the Walmart side that the company should feel embarrassed by its conduct. Walmart would portray it differently, claiming that Rattan said her goal was “to embarrass Walmart” with a criminal indictment. (Walmart’s account is captured in a letter of complaint [Jones Day partner Karen] Hewitt sent the next month to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.)

Walmart’s attorneys accused the DOJ of using the threat of criminal prosecution to extort a huge civil fine. And Jones Day wasn’t above working the refs, either, sending a[ letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6818268-Letter-From-K-Hewitt-to-B-Benczkowski-Aug-10.html) to Benczkowski in August complaining that prosecuting Walmart, a company which took in $514 billion in 2019, was somehow an attack on the poor and elderly.

The letter argued that a conviction could harm “millions of low-income and elderly citizens” who rely on federal programs for food and medicine. A convicted corporation might not be permitted to participate in those programs any longer. She outlined what she said were Walmart’s “remedial” measures to become “an industry leader in the Nation’s fight against the opioid crisis.”

Soon after, an official in the deputy attorney general’s office called Brown and told him to halt the Texas office’s criminal investigation, according to five people familiar with the investigation.

The company made similar work of the civil claims. Three guesses which company’s name is behind that black redaction bar in this excerpt from the [resignation letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6818267-Russ-Resignation-Letter-Final.html) of EDTX’s civil division head Josh Russ.



The whole article is bonkers, and if you need to spend 20 minutes not thinking about coronavirus — and you know you do! — you should read it.

# At Least This Biglaw Firm Isn't Saying 'No' To Associate Raises....

When you were a kid there was little filled with more promise than when your mom said “maybe” to a request. Infinitely better than a flat-out “no”; at least you had a chance with a maybe. That’s probably exactly how associates at Baker & McKenzie feel right now.

A few hours ago, we received this complaint from a Baker & McKenzie tipster:

No indications that the powers that be at Baker & McKenzie have given raises any thought. Associates … have been chattering amongst themselves … You have to wonder if one of the largest firms on the planet wants to go into OCI season $20k below market.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The opacity of Biglaw compensation is a frequent complaint, firms aren’t regulated in the same way as publicly traded companies, and these decisions take place behind closed doors. It can be hard to tell if the firm is even aware of the market changes happening hour by hour.

At least associates at Baker & McKenzie know the powers that be are paying attention to the changing market conditions, even if they aren’t handing out raises today. Here’s the memo from North America managing partner [Rick Hammett](http://www.bakermckenzie.com/RichardHammett/):



So, that’s a definite “Maybe,” “We’ll see,” or “Go ask your father.” Still better than an outright rejection. Keep the faith, Baker & McKenzie associates — hopefully you’ll see your payday soon.

# Ire Grows At Mid-Market Firms Failing To Match Their Peers
## After peers offer raises, what's a firm to do?

Forget $180K! Some associates at mid-market firms are just hoping to see modest raises to reflect changing times.

When we reported on [Husch Blackwell’s raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/salary-movement-trickles-down-to-midwest-mainstay/), it got some firms in the same neck of the woods wondering, “What about us?”

Sitting in an annual associates meeting now at Kansas City-based Shook, Hardy & Bacon. The elephant in the room is awkward. No acknowledgment or discussion whatsoever as to salary increases. Interesting that Husch Blackwell raised salaries (albeit modestly) today in many mid-market cities. Polsinelli already has. These have always been considered key competitors and are in relatively equal financial positions. Frustration building.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Whichever partner decided to run an associate meeting right now without talking about compensation deserves hazard pay.

Again, it’s not about trying to match Cravath; as we [mentioned earlier this month](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-summer-associate-programs-both-for-fun-times-and-for-training/) in discussing Shook Hardy, “it’s not reasonable to expect the Kansas City-based firm to adopt the full Cravath scale.” And it’s not about knee-jerk decisions to fling money around. It’s about keeping a firm in line with the market, and when the peer firms make changes, a firm has to join them — or recognize that they might not be the peer they thought they were.

Now we officially set the clock on Shook Hardy. Your move.

Keep us apprised of the compensation wars. When your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Law Firms Should Skip Attorney Reviews This Year
## In this extraordinary -- yes, let's go with that adjective -- year, such reviews may do more damage than good.

One of the perks about having my own practice is that I do not need to complete many of the purely administrative tasks that attorneys at numerous law firms need to perform. For instance, I do not typically need to log my business development or pro bono hours, I just complete the work, and it doesn’t normally matter if those hours are counted. In addition, [my two-attorney law firm](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com) run by my brother and me does not have an attorney review process (although it would be interesting for the two of us to talk about our performance, maybe like an “[airing of the grievances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8Eag9CAFk)”!). Since it is almost the end of the year, many firms across the country are about to begin or are currently undergoing their annual attorney review process. I have already discussed in a prior article how [attorney reviews are often a waste of time](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/associate-job-reviews-are-usually-a-big-waste-of-time/), and in this extraordinary year, such reviews may do more damage than good. For a variety of reasons, law firms should skip attorney reviews this year.

As many attorneys know from first-hand experience, attorney reviews can often be time consuming. Attorneys usually need to complete a questionnaire on their performance to kick off the review process, and this is often reviewed by managers, who must also write their own comments. People are extremely busy and distracted this year, for obvious reasons. Attorneys need to be flexible when managing childcare, overseeing schooling, and completing other tasks as many people work from home. Attorneys do not need to have one more, entirely administrative task to complete, and firms can give attorneys a huge morale boost if they are empathetic to their employees during this trying time.

Attorney reviews can also be extremely stressful on many lawyers. Lawyers often feel that they are being scrutinized during reviews, and if they do not justify how they deserve to stay at a firm, they may end up on the chopping block. This can lead them to spend an inordinate amount of time on completing self-evaluations and other steps related to the review process. Normally, attorneys do not need to feel too much stress related to the review process, since their jobs are typically secure unless they truly fall below expectations.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, the economy is extremely unstable, and the unemployment rate is at its highest in recent memory due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Firms have cut salaries and conducted layoffs throughout the year in order to deal with economic conditions. Even if attorney jobs are secure (and some firms have publicly acknowledged as much), there is still a justifiable fear that the attorney review process may decide a lawyer’s fate at a firm, even if this is not the case. Firms can eliminate this fear altogether if they simply skip the attorney review process.

Moreover, it is unfair in many attorney reviews to hold associates responsible to the same expectations that would be normal for other times. For instance, many law firms have an established billable hour requirement, mandating that attorneys log a set number of hours over the course of a calendar year. However, numerous attorneys had difficulty meeting billable hour requirements this year due to issues caused by the pandemic. As I can somewhat attest to [from personal experience](https://abovethelaw.com/small-firm-center/2020/05/should-covid-19-status-be-a-protected-classification/), falling ill from COVID-19 can make it difficult to bill hours and fulfill other work responsibilities, especially if you have more serious health impacts from the virus. In addition, many attorneys were impacted by the loss of loved ones, and this could make it difficult to satisfy firm expectations. Moreover, the challenges of working from home, as well as juggling schooling and other responsibilities, can make it difficult to meet billable hours and other expectations. Firms should have compassion for their attorneys in this environment. Sparing them from justifying shortfalls in an attorney review may be the right thing to do.

Of course, firms often make decisions about raises and bonuses through the attorney review process, and firms may have a more difficult time evaluating associates without a review. However, firms can always adopt a lockstep model when determining raises and bonus, so that everyone that has satisfactorily performed during a year can earn a raise or a bonus. Indeed, many firms adopt a lockstep model for determining raises and bonuses under normal circumstances. [As discussed in a prior article](https://abovethelaw.com/small-firm-center/2019/02/associates-should-share-salary-information-with-each-other/), paying attorneys uniformly on an objective basis also helps eliminate the possibility that attorneys are paid different salaries based on subjective or even objectionable grounds. Firms can always return to holistic determinations about salaries and bonuses when the pandemic subsides if they so choose.

All told, attorneys (and just about everyone else) have faced unprecedented challenges this year, and many people are feeling stressed as the year comes to a close. As a result, law firms should consider skipping their traditional attorney review process to eliminate a source of stress and be more equitable in this difficult time.

“Fit to Be Tied: When Appellate Courts Are Evenly Divided.” Yesterday’s edition of The Legal Intelligencer, Philadelphia’s daily newspaper for lawyers, contained [this month’s installment](https://t.co/yQimWxPz8Z) of my “Upon Further Review” column.

Here’s a fun fact on the occasion of this blog’s 15th birthday, recently celebrated. I originally came up with “How Appealing” as a possible name for my monthly Legal Intelligencer column, which started way back in December 2000. The publication’s then-editor in chief chose a different title, leaving “How Appealing” available to serve as this blog’s title since May 6, 2002.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Decides One Round Of Raises Isn't Enough
## Gotta keep up with the Cravaths of the world.

Why settle for one round of raises in 2022, when you can issue two?

That’s what Sidley Austin — a firm that took in $2,462,935,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it number 6 on the Am Law 100 — is doing. Less than a week ago, the firm issued associate raises, but then [Cravath went ahead and upended](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) the emerging compensation consensus. Accordingly, Sidley’s latest round of raises will match the Cravath standard and put the firm back at the top of the salary heap.

# 70 Percent Of New Partners Are Dissatisfied With Their Job
## Despite the promotion, new partners can find themselves hurting financially.

Biglaw partnership is often viewed as the promised land — after working through the years-long gauntlet of associateship, when a hardworking attorney finally makes it to partner, it seems to all the world that they’ve finally “made it.” But as with many a long-sought-after goals, the reality falls short of the dream.

According to ALM’s [New Partner Survey](https://legalcompass.intelligence.alm.com/#/surveydetail/62/methodology) of 425 attorneys recently elevated to partnership, over [70 percent said they were dissatisfied](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/11/19/some-new-partners-are-troubled-by-perceived-bias-in-the-workplace/) with at least some part of their new position. But what exactly do they have to complain about?

Well, a lot of things, as it turns out. A lot of these newly minted partners said bias was a source of concern, with 9.6 percent saying gender bias was causing dissatisfaction with their job. Another 10.1 percent cited with cronyism as an issue; 1.4 percent said racial bias was a problem; less than 1 percent pointed to sexual orientation bias; and 3.1 percent said age bias was the cause of dissatisfaction.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But the areas that cause the greatest consternation for new partners — over 10 percent responded they were “not at all satisfied” in each of these areas — were work-life balance, compensation, and training of partnership. As one survey respondent said:

“It was like they said, ‘Congratulations! The rules just changed, but we are not going to tell you what they are,’” one respondent, a third-year partner, said.

The real jaw-dropping number was the [71 percent who are disappointed with compensation](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/11/19/new-partners-dont-know-what-to-expect-after-promotion-survey-shows/). Far from being a huge payday, some new partners actually found themselves seeing a cut in their compensation:

One respondent said they were disappointed to be “treated as a glorified associate for purposes of compensation and bonus (and, thanks to the midyear associate raises, I’ll make less than most senior associates this year).”

All of a sudden, despite the promotion, these attorneys can find themselves hurting financially:

Another said that buying shares, along with lower-than-expected pay and an end to performance bonuses, had placed a strain on finances. “It’s really depressing and demoralizing to get a promotion and then to have to put your family on a strict monthly budget,” that respondent said.

Getting that brass ring isn’t as great as it seems.

# 5 Issues On The Minds Of Managing Partners

“Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,” in the [famous words](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/uneasy-lies-the-head-that-wears-the-crown.html) of Shakespeare. Applied to the world of law firms, it could be translated as follows: “It’s not easy being a managing partner.”

Managing partners have a lot on their minds these days. And last Thursday, at a lively panel at the annual meeting of the New York State Bar Association (NYSBA), five law firm leaders let us into their world.

Skillfully moderated by my colleague [Craig Brown](https://www.laterallink.com/team/craig-brown/), Managing Principal of Bridgeline Solutions (Lateral Link’s temporary staffing arm), the panel featured [Daniel Connolly](https://bracewell.com/people/daniel-s-connolly), Managing Partner of the New York office of Bracewell; [Louis DiLorenzo](https://www.bsk.com/people/louis-p-dilorenzo), Managing Member of the New York office of Bond, Schoeneck & King; [Ronald Shechtman](https://www.pryorcashman.com/lawyers/ronald-h-shechtman.html), Managing Partner of Pryor Cashman; [Marc Landis](https://www.phillipsnizer.com/marc-landis), Managing Partner of Phillips Nizer; and [Richard Scarola](http://szslaw.com/attorney-profiles/#scarola), Managing Member of Scarola Zubatov Schaffzin. The featured firms run the gamut in terms of size from Bracewell, a Biglaw firm with [400 or so lawyers](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=38&name=Bracewell-LLP); Pryor Cashman, a midsize firm with [just under 200 attorneys](https://www.pryorcashman.com/about-us/pryor-cashman-llp-about-us.html); and Scarola Zubatov Schaffzin, a boutique with [a dozen lawyers](http://szslaw.com/attorney-profiles/).

What did the panelists discuss? Here are some highlights (with thanks to Jack Newsham of Law.com for his [excellent write-up](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/01/30/from-succession-planning-to-office-space-law-firm-leaders-discuss-industry-concerns/)).

1. Managing millennials.

Like it or not, in less than a decade, millennials will make up [about 75 percent of law firm staff](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/millennials-are-a-dominant-force). So managing partners need to know how to manage millennials (and it won’t be long before millennials themselves are managing partners of major firms, since the oldest millennials are approaching 40).

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
According to Daniel Connolly of Bracewell, there is some truth to the view that millennials value work-life balance more than their predecessors. Sabbaticals, family time, and flexible-work arrangements all appeal to millennials — and, to be honest, who can blame them? But in a client service business, this does have implications for the business aspects of law firms — a topic the panel also tackled.

2. Developing business.

It’s harder and harder to be a “service partner” in this day and age. Ronald Shechtman said that at Pryor Cashman, 40 percent of partners originate $1 million or more in business, and two-thirds of partners originate $500,000 or more. While the need for a $4 million or $5 million book of business [may be exaggerated](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/28/how-much-business-do-you-really-need-to-make-a-lateral-move/), firms definitely want partners who can at least “pay for themselves.”

3. Keeping up the culture.

In the words of Shechtman, “The greatest management challenge for our firm is to maintain the culture that we have.” And I suspect that many managing partners would agree with him.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Of course, “culture” will vary from firm to firm (although every firm will claim to be “collegial”). At Pryor Cashman, for example, collaboration is key — which translates into a culture that values presence in the office. The firm also has low leverage, a partner to nonpartner ratio of about 1:1, which Shechtman credits for the firm’s strong retention.

But other firms have very different cultures, and they also manage to succeed. For example, an increasing number of Biglaw firms accommodate [working remotely](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/biglaw_remote_flexible_workplace_telecommute), which can help firms attract and retain talent (e.g., lawyers with significant family responsibilities).

4. Planning for the future.

Law firms are, to their credit, increasingly focused on succession planning. So it should come as no surprise that the topic came up at the managing partner panel.

Some firms have a mandatory retirement age, which they believe helps encourage (or even forces) older lawyers to transition business to the next generation. At the same time, in an age where people are living longer and healthier lives, some older lawyers can and want to remain very active.

Bracewell balances these considerations by having what Daniel Connolly described as a “mandatory but discretionary” retirement age — which encourages lawyers to make way for the next generation, but allows for some exceptions. All older partners must develop a plan for handing off business to their younger colleagues, however, regardless of when they plan to retire.

5. Advancing diversity.

The lack of diversity on the panel did not go unnoticed. As Marc Landis of Phillips Nizer put it, “You’re looking at five white men.”

But how — and how quickly — will law firms change on this front? Alas, that is the subject for another, much longer discussion.

# MoFo Revamps Its Partnership: The Number Of Equity Partners Drops 25 Percent As The Firm's Nonequity Ranks Soar
## The (equity) partnership is shrinking.

Partnership at Morrison & Foerster doesn’t mean what it used to. In a statement to ALM about the firm’s 2018 financial performance, MoFo revealed that they’ve made some big changes to the way partners at the firm get compensated:

“Morrison & Foerster modified its partnership compensation structure at the start of 2018,” said the firm’s statement. “The modifications followed a year of consultation with our partners and was made to ensure that the compensation model further advances the strategic needs of the firm.”

And, as [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/03/25/partner-compensation-changes-at-morrison-foerster-lead-to-equity-partner-drop-pep-surge/), this has led to a shift in which partners count as equity partners (defined as partners who get more than 50 percent of their total compensation from profit draws):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As a result of the compensation modifications, the firm’s equity partner count fell to 167 from 224—a 25 percent decline. Meanwhile, the firm’s nonequity partner ranks swelled 50 percent to 129 from 86. The firm’s total partner count, including equity and nonequity partners, fell 4.5 percent.

And that means that even as revenue dropped in 2018 — down 1.9 percent to $1.04 billion — their profits per equity partner (PEP) are up to just under $2 million, compared with $1.74 million the year before. That’s some fancy math-ing to keep your numbers looking pretty.

Despite what seems like some pretty straightforward de-equitization, Larren Nashelsky, chair of the firm, has a different take:

Despite the drop in equity partnership, Larren Nashelsky, Morrison & Foerster’s New York-based chairman, said in an interview the firm had not “de-equitized” partners as part of the compensation review. “There has been no radical change in our partnership,” Nashelsky said. “It is really, over the last few years, strengthening and improving the performance of the partnership and our leverage and profitability.”

And yet, for the last six years in a row, the equity partnership headcount has declined.

Nashelsky said the firm isn’t looking to compete with other Biglaw firms:

“We are not in an economic arms race with other firms,” Nashelsky said. “We have a special place at Morrison & Foerster. We take stock of a lot of things when we think about the kind of firm we want to be. Financial performance is one of them. So is giving back. So is excellence in lawyering. So is diversity and inclusion, and so is representing the world’s leading companies.”

But the firm had its best PEP performance in 2018.

[Lake Whillans](http://lakewhillans.com/), a leader in the field of litigation finance, supports innovative entrepreneurs and businesses across the country. Over the past year, Lake Whillans has brought us a series of handy primers on some of the most dynamic and innovative legal markets in the country, including [Silicon Valley](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-white-sandal-elite-the-go-to-law-firms-of-silicon-valley/), [Boston](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/rt-128-elite-the-go-to-law-firms-of-boston/), and the “[Wild West](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/the-wild-west-elite-the-go-to-law-firms-of-texas-colorado-and-utah/).” Today, we turn to Chicago, the cultural and economic capital of the Midwest.

Chicago boasts an incredibly diversified economy. The Second City serves as headquarters for a multitude of Fortune 1000 companies, particularly in agribusiness, manufacturing, insurance, logistics, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals. Of course, Chicago is also a vital center for financial markets, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange being the largest futures exchange in the world. Meanwhile, the city has also quietly become a hub for fast-growing private companies in the tech sector. All this economic vibrancy drives the nation’s third-largest legal market, a multi-layered ecosystem with the home and satellite offices of the best Biglaw firms, regional powerhouses, specialist boutiques, and smaller firms with deep local roots and thriving practices.

The Go-To Law Firms of Chicago can not only handle every transactional need, they do anything from construction litigation to patent prosecution. Engaging these firms can help companies of all sizes — from tech startups to multi-nationals — avoid or contain problems. However, in the event of litigation, Lake Whillans can step in as a source of capital to fund legal expenses as well as for corporate purposes.

# The Money Is Really Moneying At This Biglaw Firm!

Nothing brightens the first of the month quite like more money in your pocket.

Latham & Watkins, which grossed a whopping $4,333,763,000 gross revenue in 2020, continues its trend of money moves by matching Cravath’s freshly released salary scale. (But that’s not all — check out the cash that 9th years will be receiving… $425K!)



The raises will be retroactive to January 1 and will hit bank accounts in March. While they may in second place on the American Lawyer’s 2021 Am Law 100 ranking, this type of money is second to none. Who is next to follow (law) suit?

(Turn to the next page to see the Latham & Watkins memo.)

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

UPDATE: Some of the timeline below is a bit off — after you finish this story, [check out this update](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/more-details-from-the-offensive-simpson-thacher-pregnant-email/).

Corporate deals can get chippy, but what this dustup between associates at Simpson Thacher and Freshfields really makes you wonder if transactional attorneys need to be taking fewer cues from the investment bankers on how to conduct themselves in polite society.

This exchange takes place in the Chinese market, and while one might think there are cultural differences at play, both associates involved attended U.S. law schools and the one who comes out of the gate also went to undergrad in the U.S., so they should both have a good sense of the standards of professionalism their firms expect.

Standards that, for example, don’t include emailing everyone on the deal something like this — from the Simpson associate to the Freshfields associate:



Both associates involved are women and, among friends, women are inclined to joke about “pregnancy brain.” But “among friends” carries a lot of water in that sentence. It’s not something to be blasted to everyone working a deal to undermine a rival associate.

We’re not publishing the associates’ names because we don’t know if there’s an innocent explanation for these emails — a friendly tweaking gone wrong perhaps. That said, “Don’t let your pride get in the way of this deal” certainly doesn’t sound friendly.

For her part, the Freshfields associate responds (and we think this is a direct response — the timeline on the emails is a little hard to follow):



Well, that’s a lot better than “You shut your goddamned mouth before I come down there and fuckstart your head” which is the response I’d have expected from most of my female colleagues over the years if someone had pulled this. Still, this would have been a good time to can the snark and respond with more shocked indignance. This associate hasn’t done anything wrong, but certainly by taking the bait, she’s escalated the fight.

And, since she didn’t slam the brakes on this, here’s what she gets back from Simpson:

The emails cut off here, probably because the Simpson associate got slapped unconscious by a pregnant lady.

Thankfully, at the end of this chain, a Freshfields partner steps into the situation to put a stop to it.



With so many people on this chain, it’s encouraging that someone took the helm here before it got any worse. Sometimes associates aren’t in the best position to stand up for themselves — they have limited authority and a real concern that they could undermine the deals they’re working on. That’s why addressing discrimination has to be everyone’s job.

Everyone is more forgiving about background noise on conference calls. I used to have a quick trigger finger for the mute button, and that seems a lot less necessary now. Clients have been tremendously patient about hearing my 2-year-old in the background.

—  [Michael Williams](https://www.kirkland.com/lawyers/w/williams-michael-f-pc), a litigation partner at Kirkland & Ellis, commenting on his [unique work-from-home situation](https://www.law.com/2020/03/20/how-does-he-do-it-kirkland-partner-at-home-with-11-kids/) during the coronavirus outbreak. Williams has 11 children, ages 2 to 20, and they all do work together around the same dining room table. “The silver lining of the COVID-19 shutdown is that we eat three meals a day together now,” he says.

# LOCKED UP! Former Dewey CFO Jailed Because He Can't Pay Fine
## The judge found he 'willfully failed to pay his fine.'

When former Dewey & LeBoeuf chief financial officer [Joel Sanders was sentenced](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/no-jail-time-for-convicted-dewey-cfo/) to a million-dollar fine and 750 hours of community service rather than jail time for [his conviction](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/holy-crap-dewey-know-who-was-convicted-of-felony-charges/) on two felony fraud charges and a misdemeanor count of conspiracy, you probably thought he got off easy, at least compared with the jail time the prosecution was seeking. But today, Sanders was taken into custody when he couldn’t make the payment on his first installment on the fine.

New York State Supreme Court Justice Robert Stolz found that Sanders “willfully failed to pay his fine.” Sanders had argued he was unable to make his first of three yearly payments on the fine without dire financial consequences for his family. However the judge rejected this argument, saying, “I find the claimed inability to pay here not credible.” In support of his decision, Justice Stolz cited some of the assets Sanders has, as reported by Law.com:

But at a hearing on Thursday, Stolz noted that Sanders owns, outright, a house in Long Island worth at least $650,000, and has about $850,000 in equity on an oceanfront condominium in Miami Beach, Florida that’s worth around $1 million. The judge also pointed out that Sanders and his wife have leases on “two high-end cars”—one an Audi and the other a Mercedes-Benz.

Sanders can be incarcerated for up to a year until he pays the full $1 million fine. Sanders’s attorney, DLA Piper partner Christopher Oprison, expressed displeasure at the decision, “It’s a travesty. I think it’s completely unjust. This is the last person you want to put away and send away in prison, and I think it’s really unfortunate it came to this.”

But Oprison still noted they’re going to try to pay the fine.

# Davis Polk Associates Better Get Their Butts To The Office If They Want Their Full Bonus
## Want your money? Get to the office.

The end of the first quarter is around the corner, and Biglaw firms will no longer tolerate associates not abiding by their mandatory office attendance policies. We’ve recently learned that another elite Biglaw firm — a compensation leader, in fact — will be considering office attendance in their bonus decisions for 2023.

If Davis Polk associates in New York want their full bonus this year, they’ll have to go to the office three days a week, per their revised policy.

Davis Polk first instituted their mandatory Tuesday-Thursday [attendance policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/top-biglaw-firm-returns-to-the-office-with-mandatory-tuesday-thursday-attendance/) about one year ago, but due to recent events, we’re wondering how well that’s been working out.

Sources tell us that the firm revised the in-office attendance segment of its handbook as of March 6, 2023, to reflect the fact that associate bonuses may be impacted by inconsistent and infrequent office attendance. Specifically, “[f]ailure by any lawyer to comply with the operative in-office attendance policy may adversely affect the lawyer’s performance evaluation and result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to the withholding or reduction of a discretionary bonus (emphasis added), in accordance with applicable law.” A screenshot of DPW’s new policy can be seen below:



We’ve heard that members of the firm’s professional development team have been calling associates with poor office attendance to tell them about the new bonus policy. A tipster at the firm tells us, “DPW of course does totally lockstep bonuses without even an hours minimum but apparently is threatening to dock bonuses of big billers if they choose to do that billing at home.” Sheesh!

The new normal for associates is starting to look a whole lot like the old normal for associates, with their firms in complete control. If they want their full bonuses — and if they want to avoid being seen as a candidate for stealth layoffs — it’s officially time to head on back to the office.

Now that Davis Polk has implemented this new policy, will other Biglaw firms follow? If your firm is linking bonuses to office attendance let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Attendance) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks for your help.

# Biglaw Firm Shunned Office Attendance Mandates... Now 'Expecting' Two Days A Week
## There was a dream that was home.

The KattenFlex program planted a stake in the legal landscape, bucking the trend of “mandatory office creep,” by adopting a policy that elevated flexibility allowing practice groups and individual professionals the freedom to figure out a hybrid path that works for them. As the firm declared at the time “[it ‘doesn’t feel right’ to mandate that everyone must come into the office a set number of days](https://katten.com/american-lawyer-features-kattenflex-workplace-return-program).”

So… Katten just informed attorneys that they need to come in twice a week.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Today, we announce an update to KattenFlex: beginning May 1, the firm expects attorneys to work from a Katten office a minimum of two days per week. Additionally, the firm continues to expect that regardless of where you are working, all professionals are generally available during regular business hours and as needed to meet client demands after hours.

It’s understandable to see this as a retreat from the firm’s earlier laissez-faire policy because it is, in fact, a retreat. Every time a firm blasts out a new revision to bring people back to the office, it will rankle attorneys who thought they were going to be treated as true professionals. But in an industry marching toward [four-day attendance policies](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/simpson-thacher-4-days-in-office/) and [paranoid surveillance](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firms-three-day-office-workweek-descending-into-paranoid-surveillance/), let’s focus on what Katten is still getting right.

Katten stresses that the expectation is not a mandate or requirement, but an effort to set some consistency. The program amendment is a mere two days, offering attorneys more freedom from commuting than peer firms. And the mandate does not set specific days to come in, continuing to give groups and their attorneys the flexibility to choose. Ultimately that’s more important than the number of days required. Attorneys want to be able to say, “I can come in, but, for me, I need to be home on Wednesdays because that’s the day I have to handle school car pool” or whatever it is.

The announcement even stresses “we are keeping the ‘flex’ in KattenFlex, a key component of Katten’s supportive workplace environment.”

That said, the announcement might be too loosey-goosey.

However, select legal departments or practice groups may choose to require or designate specific days for in-office attendance or for a specific number of days per week. Your legal department or practice group will provide additional guidance.

This is the sort of exception that risks swallowing the rule. Katten’s memo suggests that leadership intends to work with practice groups to prevent groups from invalidating the spirit of the rule, but it still extends an awful lot of latitude to partners itching to bring everyone back in.

Fully remote work was never going to take hold across Biglaw. The stakes are too high, the importance of providing practical training to young associates too engrained, and the partner egos too brittle. But firms that protect attorney flexibility will earn themselves a consistent advantage in recruitment and retention.

Katten’s new policy walked back some of core features while claiming to preserve others. How much of a retreat this turns out to be is now up to the implementation.

# The Raises Just Keep On Coming For The Best Of The Biglaw Elite
## Another big player is on board with the new associate compensation scale.

Good news for associates at Fried Frank — the firm has announced that they are increasing associate salaries in the New York, D.C., and London offices (only leaving out the firm’s very small and very senior Frankfort office). The salary increases, ranging from $10,000 – $25,000, depending on class year, will also be accompanied by special summer bonuses, which range from $5,000 to $25,000, based on seniority.

This summer has been a fascinating one for associate compensation. It started with Milbank — Thrillbank, if you will — shocking the Biglaw world with new raises. This was matched by Simpson Thacher, which went over the top with special bonuses. Cravath finally came to play, slightly increasing salaries from the Milbank scale for senior associates. All of which resulted in the franken-[Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale, which Fried Frank (and any firm that fancies itself at the top of the Biglaw heap) has now met.

The numbers for your viewing pleasure:

Tasha Schwikert-Warren

Olympic Bronze medalist and current Biglaw associate, Tasha Schwikert-Warren, along with her sister, former U.S. gymnast Jordan Cobbs, filed a pair of lawsuits against USA Gymnastics and officials of the organization for fraud and racketeering earlier this week. The allegations stem from USA Gymnastics’ employment of convicted sexual predator Larry Nassar. Nassar, [as you’ll recall](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/in-an-utterly-unsurprising-move-judge-throws-the-book-at-larry-nassar/?rf=1), was sentenced to 40 – 125 years in prison for taking advantage of his position as U.S. national gymnastics team doctor by sexually abusing over 100 women and girls. In handing down the hefty sentence, the judge did not want Nassar to be a free man ever again, saying, “I’ve just signed your death warrant,” and, “You do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again.”

Schwikert-Warren is [an associate](https://www.hollandhart.com/tschwikert-warren) in the real estate and construction practice group at Holland & Hart. She previously completed a clerkship in the Eighth Judicial District Court in Nevada for Judge Joanna S. Kishner and Judge Mark R. Denton. Schwikert-Warren came forward with her story of the abuse she suffered at the hands of Nassar last month, [telling ABC News ](http://abcnews.go.com/US/olympian-tasha-schwikert-abused-larry-nassar-manipulated-supporting/story?id=58592690)that she was abused more than 100 times between 2000 and 2005.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[As reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/10/31/big-law-associate-sues-usa-gymnastics-over-sex-abuse-scandal/) Law.com, part of the motivation for the lawsuit was legal action being taken against former USA Gymnastics officials:

On Oct. 29, Schwikert-Warren and Cobbs filed a pair of fraud and racketeering complaints against USA Gymnastics in Los Angeles Superior Court. In a press conference that same day, both women said they were motivated to tell their stories as a result of the recent arrest in Tennessee of former USA Gymnastics president Stephen Penny Jr. A Texas grand jury has indicted Penny on charges of evidence tampering in an investigation into Nassar.

The complaint alleges USA Gymnastics failed to provide a “culture of accountability and transparency” that could have stopped the reign of Nassar’s abuse.

“I am outraged at watching what’s been happening at USA Gymnastics,” Schwikert-Warren told reporters this week at a press conference in Los Angeles. “It’s like watching a perpetual circus of horribles.”

# This Biglaw Firm Won't Require Attorneys To Work A Set Number Of Office Days

After Labor Day, we will not—as a matter of ordinary course—require a particular number of days in the office. Instead, we will continue to trust everyone to work with their practice group leaders and managers to determine the best workplace balance for providing exceptional service to our clients, strengthening our cultural glue and ensuring all members of our teams are trained, integrated and positioned for continued growth and success.

— An excerpt from a memo sent by Katten CEO Noah Heller and firm chairman Roger Furey, regarding [the firm’s plans for a return to the office](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/21/katten-wont-mandate-a-set-number-of-days-in-office/) in the wake of the pandemic. Heller and Furey noted that the firm’s policy will provide associates with “the flexibility to continue to balance the demands of [their] professional and personal lives, and it will help us retain and attract the best talent in the industry and position our firm for even more success.”

# The UK Top 50: The Wealthiest Biglaw Firms Across The Pond
## Biglaw means big money in the UK.

We all know that Biglaw firms in America did well — really, really well — in 2021, but what about their Biglaw counterparts across the pond in the United Kingdom? How did they fare when it came to their financial metrics? Thankfully, the latest edition of the UK Top 50 is out, which measures gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per equity partner, just like the Am Law 100.

Collectively, as noted by [Law.com International’s](https://www.law.com/2022/09/12/uk-top-50-ranked-by-revenue-fee-income-surges-despite-headwinds-292-128665/) Hannah Walker in her summary of the data, the UK Top 50 achieved their strongest increase in total revenue since the Great Recession, up by 10.9% (compare this with 2020’s numbers, where average total revenue was up 5.9%); a 2.8% increase in average revenue per lawyer (£406,100); and a 7.7% increase in profits per equity partner (£939,600). Here are more details on the positive results from the UK:

Almost half—19 firms—posted double digit revenue increases, compared with 11 in the previous year. Only four firms posted a fall in revenue, compared with 10 in the previous year.

However the U.K. firms’ growth lags that of their U.S. counterparts, with the [Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-report/) recording a collective revenue growth of 14.8% for 2021, led by Kirkland & Ellis and Latham & Watkins.

The turnover increase did not translate into such a significant rise in average profit per equity partner across the firms, as they grappled to keep costs under control amid a rampant pay war for junior talent.

Looks like Willkie Farr & Gallagher is going to give West Coast living — or at least lawyering — a try. The Biglaw firm, headquartered in New York City since 1888, has announced they’re opening an office in Silicon Valley. They’ve tapped two new lateral hires, partners Tiffany Lee and Matthew Berger, formerly of Paul Hastings, to lead the new office which will also be staffed with Willkie attorneys relocating from New York.

Lee will be the managing partner in Silicon Valley. Her practice mainly focuses on M&A, private equity financing, and intellectual property which she does for clients primarily in the tech industry. Berger was formerly the global chairman of the technology transactions practice at his old firm, Paul Hastings.

In a statement, Lee said she was excited about the opportunities at Willkie:

“With Willkie’s Silicon Valley arrival and the natural synergies between our broad technology transactions experience and highly regarded corporate, M&A and private equity capabilities, we are excited for a greater and more value-added collaboration with current and prospective clients, local, domestic and abroad,” Lee said in a statement.

For their part, Willkie is jazzed about the chance to extend their brand into Cali:

“We are very excited that [Lee] and [Berger] have decided to join our expanding technology-focused corporate, M&A and private equity platforms and are bringing their extensive and highly regarded technology transactional expertise to our newest office,” Willkie co-chairman Gordon Caplan said in a statement.

“Willkie goes where the highest quality talent and energy is located [and] we have a longstanding and extensive client base in Palo Alto, and California more generally,” he added.

Congratulations to Lee and Berger on their latest career move.

The trend of Biglaw firms updating their [parental leave policy](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/) to be gender neutral and more generous continues. Along those lines, Fried Frank recently announced exciting new changes to their leave policies.

Last year Fried Frank renamed their policy to reflect the gender-neutral nature of the program, as “maternity leave” as a term is rapidly becoming antiquated. Now, in order to better reflect the gender-neutral nature of the policy, the firm is also removing the primary caregiver requirement for participation, meaning all new parents — whether they are new parents via birth, adoption, or fostering of a child — are able to enjoy the same paid time off. They’ve also expanded the amount of time off to 12 weeks (it was previously 10 weeks for primary caregivers, five for everyone else) and the policy applies to all attorneys and business services professionals.

As part of the policy, and this was true in the previous iteration as well, birthing mothers are also eligible for disability leave in addition to their parental leave. Parents can split their leave in two blocks of time within the first 12 months, and any accrued time off can be used to supplement their leave.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
All of this is in addition to the firm’s existing benefits designed to assist their employees including a breast milk delivery service for breastfeeding employees traveling for work, back up childcare, nursing rooms in each office, reduced work schedules for associates who are new parents for up to six months, and access to a 24/7 wellness program. All of which help make the challenging balancing act of a new family member with life in Biglaw just a little bit easier.

Kudos to the firm on the expansion of their leave policy. Let’s hope more firms get on board with the trend.

# Stroock Is Talking To Another Am Law 100 Firm About Merging — But It’s Not ‘Exclusive’
## They’re both keeping their options open… but what if this is Stroock’s only option to make it through the year?

Stroock has been leaking lawyers like a sieve ever since it broke up with Nixon Peabody, but it finally got rid of its baggage (i.e., its pension problems), and just like that, the firm has matched up with another eligible bachelor on the merger market.

According to a report from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/21/pillsbury-becomes-latest-firm-to-begin-merger-dance-with-stroock/), Stroock’s latest law firm hookup is Pillsbury Winthrop, and the pair have signed a non-exclusive letter of intent to merge. Pillsbury brought in $751,491,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 65 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, and if the proposed tie-up is successful, it will bring an international presence to Stroock. Here’s more from [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/21/pillsbury-becomes-latest-firm-to-begin-merger-dance-with-stroock/):

“We consider all growth opportunities presented to us, including potential lateral groups and combinations. We are currently evaluating opportunities with Stroock,” the firm said in a statement. “We signed a non-exclusive LOI to help frame the discussion. The process is ongoing.”

A spokesperson for Stroock confirmed the talks with Pillsbury but declined to comment on the LOI. “We continue to explore various opportunities,” the spokesperson said. “We can confirm that we are talking with Pillsbury about potential synergies.”

While both firms are keeping their options open, hopefully those “synergies” work out, because industry insiders and even former Stroock employees are unsure if the firm will be able to survive through the end of the year without merging with another firm.

Best of luck to both firms — and especially to Stroock — as they embark upon this possible merger journey.

# DLA Piper Plans To Dump Tons Of Bonus Cash On Associates
## Associates are *so happy* about this!

This time last year, Biglaw firms were still figuring out how to adapt to remote working environments thanks to the pandemic, but now, Biglaw firms are figuring out when (or whether) they’ll announce additional rounds of special bonuses to reward all of their attorneys’ hard work over the course of the past 12 months. Top-ranked firms have been announcing [Davis Polk bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) matches left and right. Which one is it this time?

DLA Piper — a firm that came in at No. 3 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, with $3,112,130,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — thrilled associates with its special bonus announcement today. The firm has fully matched the bonus scale announced by Davis Polk. In case you’ve forgotten what that looks like, DLA’s bonus scale can be seen below (the full memo is available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/dla-piper-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here are some instant reactions from associates at the firm, who are all quite happy:

You love to see it. Associates are thrilled and feel like the firm has redeemed itself. DLA stepped up after just one week of special bonus mania and even before Cravath. Couple this with the recent standardization of market salaries across all US offices, and we really are competitive again.

DLA FULL MATCH!!!!! Very happy they moved fast on this after how they botched 2020 special bonuses. This news, coming on the same day I received my first paycheck at Cravath scale (because I’m in a secondary market), kiboshes my current efforts to lateral.

Bonuses at DLA Piper will be paid half in May and half in September to all associates in good standing. Congratulations to all!

# Norton Rose Fulbright Lays Off Associates, Cuts Salaries Amid COVID-19 Upheaval
## A billion dollars in revenue doesn't stop COVID-19 layoffs.

This is big. After all, only 10 firms in the entire country are bigger than Norton Rose Fulbright; they had $1,969,315,000 in 2018 gross revenue, making them number 11 on the Am Law 100 ranking. But despite that size and might, the firm still finds themselves in need of cost-cutting measures because of COVID-19. And not just salary cuts, which many firms see as a prudent move to help with cash flow as opposed to a permanent change in compensation, but we understand layoffs are also part of their austerity plan.

So, let’s get to the details we know. Above the Law tipsters report Norton Rose Fulbright announced a 15 percent salary cut in the U.S. The compensation cut applies to all salaried non-partner attorneys and staff, except those making under $50,000. As of now, the pay cuts will start April 30 and are expected to last through September 30. As a tipster noted, “However, they’ve not cut their summer program nor ceased hiring new attorneys. There is no reduction in required billable hours or change in bonus metrics.”

We’ve also received information from multiple sources that the austerity measures at the firm have included layoffs — characterized by one tipster as “the WORST PART.” According to those at the firm, both staff and attorneys were impacted by these layoffs, but exactly how many folks find themselves out of work was something Norton Rose refused to disclose.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The firm is already in the process of [implementing four-day work week](https://www.law360.com/articles/1263817/norton-rose-greenlights-four-day-week-for-select-staff), on a temporary basis, for some of its eligible staff in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Jeff Cody, Norton Rose Fulbright’s US Managing Partner, made the following statement about the cost-cutting measures:

“As we all know, the coronavirus is having an unprecedented effect on markets and businesses around the world and in the US. The extent of the virus’ impact on the legal industry is unclear at this time, but the road ahead appears challenging. In light of these conditions, US leadership believes it is prudent to take steps to address this uncertainty and ensure that our law firm emerges healthy and strong. Although difficult, we have asked our attorneys and staff to accept a temporary reduction in compensation. We will work aggressively throughout the balance of the year in the hope that we can lessen the impact of these salary reductions. We also have made discrete reductions in our US work force as part of our plan to safeguard the future of our more than 1,600 lawyers and staff.”

Best of luck to those who find themselves out of work in the middle of a pandemic.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), a recruiter with Major, Lindsey & Africa, commenting during an interview with Reuters on the [white-hot lateral market for associates and partners that broke out in 2021](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/legal-talent-war-that-broke-out-2021-shows-no-sign-slowing-down-2021-12-30/) after the first year of the pandemic. In response, Biglaw firms across the country have raised salaries and handed out bonuses of all kinds to either entice lawyers to stay put or join their firms. “It’s hard to leave a firm when there is a bunch of money on the table,” Sheikh said.

# Clifford Chance Lassos Latham Partners As It Expands Into Texas

Hot on the heels of the [megamerger announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/) made between Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling, yet another Magic Circle firm is trying to stake a larger claim here in America.

Clifford Chance — a firm that came in at No. 2 in the 2021 UK 100 ranking with $2,711,508,000 gross revenue — currently offices in New York and Washington, D.C., but will soon be opening its third U.S. firm in Houston, Texas.

[Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/clifford-chance-to-launch-houston-office-with-10-partner-team) has additional details on the firm’s plans:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The move to Houston is aimed at bolstering the firm’s 400-lawyer global energy and infrastructure practice—with an eye on the transition to renewable energy sources—and fueling US growth, a key long-term strategy. …

“We are seeing around the world so much going on with the energy transition,” Sharis Arnold Pozen, regional managing partner for the Americas, said in an interview. “In Houston, that’s the hub for energy work and the energy transition.”

The firm has hired Latham & Watkins partners Jonathan Castelan and Trevor Lavelle for its Houston office, and several Clifford Chance partners will be relocating from New York and Paris to join their colleagues there.

“Expanding our global energy offering in Houston, the world’s leading energy hub, reflects our strategy to build out our capability in geographies and sectors critical to our clients’ future growth,” Global Managing Partner Charles Adams noted in a press release. “Energy transition is a priority for our clients and our depth of knowledge across technologies and jurisdictions in this sector positions Clifford Chance to add real value to businesses pursuing a sustainable path.”

Congratulations to Clifford Chance as the firm heads to Texas to conquer the growing energy industry.

# Thanks To COVID-19, Biglaw Summer Associates Are Very Concerned About Job Security, Money
## What matters most to summer associates? Here's some insight.

The summer of 2020 was pretty strange for summer associates. Thanks to the coronavirus crisis, law students who normally would have been wined and dined by their Biglaw firms all summer long instead found themselves at home, anxiously experiencing law firm life through their computer screens. But for all that was unusual about this past summer, law students made the most of it. According to a new survey from the American Lawyer, this year’s crop of summer associates were generally satisfied with their virtual experiences in Biglaw. One summer associate at an Am Law 50 firm perfectly summarized law students’ experience in this sentence: “It was the best you could do in this situation.”

So, which Biglaw firms were on top during COVID-19’s summer of sadness? Unfortunately, the summer associate program rankings are yet another thing that the novel coronavirus has taken from us. Although there is no formal ranking this year, the following firms stood out above the rest in the minds of summer associates:

- Proskauer Rose
- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
- Shearman & Sterling
- Dorsey & Whitney
- Clifford Chance

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So, what were this year’s summers most concerned about, all things COVID considered? It’s all about the money, honey (and mental health, too). After having witnessed their programs be shortened and austerity measures rolled out across the Biglaw landscape, about half (48.4 percent) of the 2,500 summers polled by Am Law said job security was their top concern. (Last year, summers cared the most about work-life balance. It’s nice to remember when things were so simple, isn’t it?)

Some summers were properly peeved that their paychecks were discounted based on their shortened programs because they were “counting on being paid” for the full length of the program — after all, other firms did paid full freight, despite cutting weeks from their summers’ schedules.

“This probably saved them some money (and maybe they needed it), but after talking with the other summers, I think most of us were really financially hurt by this. Overall, I am not sure that move was worth it because it really hurt the summers financially and it hurt their confidence in the firm,” the associate continued.

That sentiment played out in respondents’ assessments of their firms’ finances. Most of those assessments were glowing. But summers who faced pay cuts had a gloomier perspective. Some saw the reduced compensation as a reflection of their firm’s ability to weather a storm—or, in this case, a pandemic.

On top of pay issues, summer associates were having trouble staying busy. Not only were their hours down — they worked 42 hours a week and billed 20 hours on average, compared to last year, when they worked 43 hours a week and billed 24 hours on average — but the quality of the work just wasn’t up to snuff. Summers were not only working virtually, but they were doing simulated work on fake deals. Why’s that? To protect associate hours. Eeek.

Next up, we’ve got mental health, which is an understandable concern for people who were working alone and feeling isolated during a pandemic. Around 48 percent of respondents said they were concerned about their mental health, up from 39 percent last year. Thankfully, summer associates say their firms have taken their mental health seriously and given it proper focus during these tough times. Seventy-one percent said that mental health seemed like a priority at their firms during the pandemic (up from 63 percent last year).

What do these Biglaw firms have in store for their 2020 summers — most of whom have already received offers of permanent employment — in the future? COVID-19 isn’t quite done with the legal profession yet, so we’ll have to wait and see. In the meantime, congratulations to all of the firms that earned the respect and appreciation of their summer associates.

# Top Biglaw Firm's Chair Beseeches Lawyers, Staff To Get Vaccinated
## This Biglaw firm deeply cares about its employees and wants to keep them as safe as possible.

For those of you who have yet to receive a vaccine, we implore you to re-consider. For some, we realize that you have a bona fide medical issue or a sincerely held religious belief that prevents you from being vaccinated. Others may have concerns grounded in uncertainty about the risks of the vaccine or its benefits. For those members of our community, we urge you to seek the advice of a medical professional, a spiritual guide or a trusted advisor with whom you can explore this very important decision in depth, with this virulent and aggressively contagious strain of COVID-19 in mind. We are deeply committed to your safety and it’s not an understatement to say that your life, and the lives of others, may depend on your decision.

— An excerpt from a memo sent by [Julie Jones](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/biographies/j/julie-h-jones), chair of Ropes & Gray, concerning the firm’s new vaccination mandate, effective August 9. From that date on, only fully vaccinated individuals may enter any of the firm’s U.S. offices or attend any of the firm’s events and gatherings, no matter their location. Ropes will disable the IDs of unvaccinated employees so they will be unable to gain access to the office, making it the second firm to take such an action. Jones states that 98 percent of the firm’s lawyers and 90 percent of the firm’s business support team have already been vaccinated. Flip to the next page to read the firm’s memo, in full.

# Welp, It Doesn't Look Like This Biglaw Firm Will Be Matching Spring Special Bonuses
## Don't hold your breath for special bonuses at this firm.

Special bonus season is upon us. That means that the top of the Biglaw heap is busy showering its associates with extra cash to say thank you. But when [special bonuses swept](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) the industry in the Fall of 2020, there was a segment of firms that [went out of their way](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) to be clear that bonuses (at least in autumn) were not in the offing. Now that there are more bonuses afoot, firms that aren’t ready to dole out bonuses are also being clear with associates.

The following email was sent to U.S. associates at Magic Circle firm Clifford Chance. A recent video message noted that bonuses were coming, but a follow-up message made clear, that because[ U.S. associates got the fall special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/magic-circle-firm-hands-out-bonuses-to-make-thanksgiving-truly-magical/), they will not be getting special bonuses in 2021.


Of course, they could always come back and say (particularly as market pressure increases with even more firms deciding to match this new spring bonus scale), JK! Here are more associate bonuses. But given the tone of this email, well, it doesn’t seem likely. UPDATE: Other tipsters at Clifford Chance have reached out to Above the Law to say they’re still hopeful that the firm may make a move to match the market, particularly since the email predates the special bonus momentum. Either way, we’ll be watching to see what happens.

It’s another day in the world of the coronapocalypse, and law firms continue to do whatever they can to cut costs so they can survive when all of this is over. Over the past few months, we’ve seen some of the largest law firms in the world conducting salary cuts, furloughs, and even layoffs — and we don’t think this is going to stop anytime soon.

Littler, the largest employment firm in the world, came in 66th place in the 2020 Am Law 100 rankings with $590,038,000 gross revenue in 2019, but that’s not stopping the firm from slashing salaries across the board.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Equity partners at the firm (“participating shareholders” in Littler lingo) and corporate management will have their salaries reduced by 20 percent as of May 8, while highly compensated nonequity partners (“non-participating shareholders”) and non-attorney senior-level administrative employees with compensation of more than $300,000 will have their salaries reduced by 15 percent on the same date. (These cuts will occur in Mexico and Canada on May 15.)

The rest of the firm will have their salaries reduced by an average of 10 percent on June 5. These are the tiers by which all other non-equity partners, principals, other attorneys, paralegals, and office and corporate administrative employees will have their salaries slashed in about a month from now (Littler’s memo on the next page):

- Up to $50K: 4 percent
- >$50-$75K: 6.5 percent
- >$75-$100K: 9 percent
- >$100-$200K: 11 percent
- >$200-$300K: 13 percent
All other employees who are unable to work remotely due to their job responsibilities will see their pay reduced by 50 percent on June 5, but they’ll be able to tap into their paid time-off balances to make up for the difference.

# Women Without Support Networks Will Likely Leave Their Law Firms

To me, as a female associate at a large law firm, the solution is simple: women need to help other women. If you know another woman has your back, you stay. If you don’t have that support, you leave. Also, giving back to other women when you can is important.

— [Rachel Gezerseh](http://www.jonesday.com/rgezerseh/), an associate at [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jones-day/), explaining some of the ways she thinks law firms, especially Biglaw firms, can solve their problems having to do with the retention of female attorneys, in an op-ed published at [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/perspective-in-law-women-need-to-help-other-women/).

# As Summer Draws To A Close, Another Biglaw Firm Announces Summer Bonuses
## It may not be enough to call a trend, but there's at least another firm with a summer bonus out there.

Way back in May, the legal world got its first taste of the 2019 round of summer bonuses when [Gunderson stepped up](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/gunderson-announces-summer-bonuses-your-move-am-law-100/) and offered associates a little taste of bonus cash. After a summer pay extravaganza last year that saw associate salaries spike and summer bonuses to boot making for a very, very fine year for attorneys. No one expected a repeat of 2018, but Gunderson’s move seemed to kick off another season of small but appreciated bonuses.

And then… [nothing](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/where-in-the-world-are-your-summer-bonuses/). The legal industry went on radio silence. [Revenue is up](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/law-firm-revenue-is-up-because-were-just-making-people-pay-more-for-less/), yet firms seem much more cautious this year. Whether that stems form honest recessionary fears or the knowledge that they can plausibly write-off their thrift as a response to recessionary fears is less clear.

But with summer dying down, Patterson Belknap has decided it’s able to share some of the wealth with its associates. Perhaps more exciting, in a nod to the mostly bygone era where associates were treated as professional colleagues rather than revenue vectors, the bonus will be offered without any hourly requirement and every associate will get the full amount for their class year (with provisions for newcomer pro-rating and those on part-time schedules).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s what the good folks of Patterson are looking at:

Class of 2019 $7500
Class of 2018 $7500
Class of 2017 $7500
Class of 2016 $10000
Class of 2015 $10000
Class of 2014 $12500
Class of 2013 $15000
Class of 2012 $30000
Class of 2011+ $40000

The firm’s memo notes that they aren’t in a position to make summer bonuses are annual tradition, but that they respect that exceptional financial performance — like the firm’s turned in over the first half of 2019 — calls for some remunerative celebration.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm. Hopefully some more firms will join the party.

# Best Practices In Law Firm Business Development And Marketing
## It’s more important than ever for lawyers -- and not just partners, but counsel and associates as well -- to understand and excel at business development and marketing.

For better or worse, Biglaw is [more of a business than it ever has been](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/what-do-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-partnership/). It’s no longer the case that you join a firm after law school, work hard and make partner, and remain at the firm until you retire or die. Instead, partners regularly [part ways with their longtime firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/major-lateral-moves-its-open-season-on-cleary-partners/), in search of better platforms — and bigger paychecks.

In this environment, it’s more important than ever for lawyers — and not just partners, but counsel and associates as well — to understand and excel at business development and marketing. If you want a [long and successful career](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/5-tips-for-having-a-long-and-successful-legal-career/) at a law firm, you need to be not just an excellent attorney but also a talented marketer.

How can you become a Biglaw business-development whiz? It’s not easy; many [major rainmakers](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-business-development-7-tips-from-top-rainmakers/) will tell you that it took them years to master the art. But you can definitely give yourself a head start through reading and research.

My recommendation: Start with [Best Practices in Law Firm Business Development and Marketing](https://amzn.to/2NgZq0T) by [Deborah Farone](https://deborahfarone.com/about/), published earlier this year by the Practising Law Institute (PLI). Farone, the founder of the [Farone Advisors](https://deborahfarone.com/) consultancy and former chief marketing officer at two of the nation’s finest firms, Cravath and Debevoise, interviewed numerous Biglaw business generators, as well as other industry experts, to learn the secrets of their success.

I recently spoke with Deborah Farone about her book and about Biglaw business development more generally. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

What inspired you to write the book?

I felt that there was a real need in the marketplace to study the best practices in business development. I knew there was keen interest in two related subjects: One was in learning what it was that certain law firms were doing to consistently drive profitability and foster a positive culture, and the other was the curiosity about the habits of great rainmakers.

Around this same time, as I was thinking about starting a consulting practice, I was approached by PLI to write a book on legal marketing. Although I knew a lot about the world of large law firms and their operations, I always wanted to learn about best practices and innovation in other sectors of the legal profession, including midsize firms and boutiques. Conducting the research with academics, technologists, and other thought leaders, and writing a book was an ideal opportunity to do this.

As I know from [my own experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/books/david-lats-supreme-ambitions-is-a-thriller-for-lawyers.html), writing a book is a challenging and demanding endeavor. What did you think of the process?

I gave myself a year to write it, and I finished within that year. I mapped out a series of deadlines and devoted every morning from 6 to 11 to work on the book, assuming I wasn’t traveling to a client’s office. I interviewed more than 60 people for the book, so it involved a lot of juggling of schedules. I had to attack it in a very organized and disciplined way to complete the project.

Your book isn’t just a primer on business development, it’s also a portrait of Biglaw over time. I love the opening, where you paint a vivid picture of what Debevoise was like back in 1989. What would you identify as the single biggest change in this world over the past three decades?

One big change that reverberates throughout many parts of the profession is that general counsel are in the driver’s seat more than ever before. Compared to their predecessors, today’s GCs are very sophisticated consumers of legal services, command larger departments, and have more tools at their disposal. In the past, if the GC had a new legal problem, they’d immediately look to their outside law firm. Today, they might turn to hiring additional lawyers in-house at a lower cost or using an alternative legal services provider. They’ve also acquired technology to address recurring issues and, as we’ve seen by the rise in influence of CLOC, brainy experts in legal operations are also there to help protect the company and manage legal costs.

What ramifications does this have for legal marketing?

When marketing their services, firms need to ask themselves: Are we doing something that adds value? Are we providing a service that a GC can’t simply do in-house? This thinking requires law firms to be more strategic in their offerings and in their branding. It is why many more firms are developing strategic plans for key practices or for entire firms. They are working to identify the areas where they can provide exceptional value and differentiate themselves from the firm down the street.

Have law firms risen to the challenge? Have they gotten better at business development and marketing?

Some have. In the book, I focus on innovative firms — firms like Orrick and Gunderson Dettmer, to name a few — and what they’re doing to succeed in business development. Marketing has to be involved, of course, but so does management. The focus needs to be all hands on deck, focusing on the client.

Based on your research, can you offer some advice on how Biglaw partners can work most effectively with their Chief Marketing Officers and marketing teams?

Marketing can’t be a back-office department that works somewhere in the Ozarks. Marketing folks need to be involved in the strategic direction of the firm. For example, when a firm hires a lateral partner, the marketing department should have a hand in everything from helping to think about how the lateral will fit into the business, what services they will bring to clients, and what the firm can do to ensure there is support for the lateral to succeed in their practice. The CMOs I’ve met are incredibly talented, but at times they’re underutilized by their firms when it comes to their strategic capability.

Firm leadership needs to be in regular communication with their marketing group to let them know not only the state of the firm and what is transpiring, but to communicate that their work is central to the operations of the firm. At Cravath, both Evan Chesler and Allen Parker met with my department regularly to let us know about new opportunities and their goals for the firm. This conveyed to the marketing department that they were an integral part of the firm and on the same team as the lawyers.

You mentioned integrating lateral partners, a subject of [great interest to me](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/) these days. Have firms gotten better about this process?

Again, some have, and some haven’t. Today, many have a well-run integration program set up well before the partner even accepts the offer. They are thinking: Which clients will potentially use this partner? To which clients should the new partner be introduced, and by whom? Firms shouldn’t just count on lateral partners spinning gold from their own contacts when they arrive. If firms truly collaborate with new partners, the new partners are much more likely to stick. Close to 50 percent of lateral partners end up leaving the firm after five years. It’s expensive to bring on a lateral, so it behooves the firms to think seriously about how the partner will fit into the firm culture and business.

Speaking of law firm culture, how does it affect marketing and business development?

Firm leaders are so busy that they don’t always have time to stop and think about culture as a vital factor in the firm’s success, but if you think about it, culture is often the reason that firms maintain clients and talent, and grow revenue. If you have a culture where partners genuinely like each other, collaborate on bringing in new matters and serving their clients, you’ll have a much more robust business.

Dr. Heidi Gardner of Harvard has demonstrated this in her research. She found that if a client is served by more than one practice, there’s more of a chance of what she calls “stickiness,” and the firm is much more likely to retain the client. This requires a culture where partners like working with each other and have a compensation system that rewards this type of behavior. If you don’t pay attention to culture and just “let things happen,” you lose an opportunity to develop a stronger firm.

Turning to associates, I personally think it’s good for them to start thinking about and understanding, early in their careers, how the business of Biglaw works (and Above the Law aims to help on this front). Do you have any recommendations for associates on what they can do in terms of BD?

I agree. It’s never too early to start thinking about how you’re going to develop a practice, whether you’re planning to stay at your current firm or head someplace else. And that means building relationships. Associates need to work within the paradigm and rules of their own firms, but there are steps most can take.

Foremost, associates should develop relationships among themselves — their officemate might be a GC someday — and outside of the firm as well. This might involve using LinkedIn to stay in touch with business contacts, getting involved in leadership roles within bar associations, or serving on the board of a nonprofit in which you have an interest. I was on the board of the Girl Scouts of Greater New York for many years and, from that experience, I met a host of people in various areas of business and industries, including banking and pharmaceuticals, who I would not have necessarily met in my marketing role.

And what can firms do to encourage and support their associates in these efforts?

Many firms provide forums for their associates to get to know colleagues at their level at the client, whether through substantive legal work or social activities. Some give associates a budget to take the client to lunch or an event. This helps create a “zippering effect,” where the firm has contact with the client at all different levels, and it also allows the associate to develop their business development skill.

Firms often tell associates, “Your job is to learn to be a great lawyer.” I agree, but I don’t think this is mutually exclusive with teaching them client and business development skills. If you don’t give associates training and exposure in business development and client service, you end up with a class of partners that has never done it before. Then you are in a position of having to train folks to acquire new habits and break old ones. The new partners have also missed out on years of making valuable connections.

I have been to a number of firms to speak with partners and senior associates. They want to learn how to develop business, and they are interested in knowing how others in the profession do this. Lawyers tend to look for precedent, and I think by providing examples of behavior that has worked elsewhere, they are able to think about and incorporate what will work for them,

What about business development and diversity? How do these concerns relate to each other?

Of course, business development isn’t just an issue for diverse lawyers, it’s an issue for everyone. Firms should give everyone they tools they need for business development. We need to be sure that we are reaching everyone and spend extra time with those who need it most, regardless of their background.

Marketers can play a role in the conversation in terms of making sure firms recruit diverse candidates and retain and develop diverse lawyers. Firms are starting to track to see that diverse lawyers are being given the same assignments as everyone else. Firms need to ensure that diverse lawyers have the skills and exposure they need to develop their practices.

Looking to the future, how will technology and innovation affect marketing and business development?

Today’s legal technology is amazing, and there are wonderful tools that streamline processes that used to take lawyers a lot of time. Firms can provide equal if not better service in a more cost-effective way. Marketers can spend less time putting together reports and regression analyses and more time involved in strategic projects.

But the relationship aspect of doing business is still so vital. People want to work with people they like and trust. If the client doesn’t trust you, the innovative George Jetson environment you’ve created doesn’t matter. Skills, reputation, and relationships are really everything in business.

So very true. Congratulations again on the book, Deborah, and thanks for taking the time to share your insights and advice!

# Yale Deeply Concerned That (People Noticed) Its Law Firm Subpoenaed Murdered Kids
## Day Pitney's mounting controversy in Sandy Hook case raises questions for another high-profile client.

What is it with Yale these days? Whenever controversy arrives at their doorstep, the school seems prepared to slough it off in the most mealy mouthed, bureaucratically vapid manner possible. Still reeling from their attempt to bury a racist FedSoc event with a [boilerplate apology to “do better”](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/yale-law-shows-commitment-to-diversity-with-boilerplate-apology-to-minorities/) — which is quickly becoming the “thoughts and prayers” of racism — the school has decided to bring its unique brand of being “deeply concerned” to the Sandy Hook murders. Achievement unlocked!

Day Pitney, representing arms manufacturer Remington, recently subpoenaed the families of Sandy Hook victims for school attendance records to figure out [exactly how responsible a bunch of first-graders were for their own deaths](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/biglaw-partner-wants-to-know-how-responsible-sandy-hook-first-grader-is-for-his-own-murder/). The subpoenas flabbergasted opposing counsel who said there was “no explanation” for Day Pitney’s request. The most generous interpretation of the move would be that the firm is setting up to argue that a 6-year-old’s future earnings were suspect because he was out with strep throat too often, but aside from this being tenuous to the point of laughable, the toxic cultural setting of the Sandy Hook killings is replete with allegations that the victims weren’t even at school that morning or even real. This makes the document requests much more disturbing as the firm leaned into the fever dreams of the most reprehensible conspiracy theorists.

It wasn’t even the first time the firm faced questions over its tactics in the case. Back in July, the firm sent [thousands of cartoons](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/09/1014369108/sandy-hook-remington-cartoons-lawsuit) in response to a targeted document request from the plaintiffs. “Unwilling to have this case decided by a jury on the merits with a full record, Remington has sought delay and obfuscation at every turn,” the plaintiffs said in a filing.

One of Day Pitney’s highest profile clients is Yale University, and some think the powerful client needs to take some responsibility for its business relationships.

In [an open letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hTWLGquUSBNiHjioxmhPacuJfrRw9_MyIJ-IMwRuzZU/edit), Yale faculty, students, and student organizations have called upon the school to conduct “a review of whether an ongoing business relationship is appropriate or acceptable.” Which is actually a bit of a checked swing when talking about one of the most prominent institutions of higher learning in the world. Yale could walk down the street and grab another top-notch law firm in a minute, so it’s not one of those situations where the client is in too deep to realistically make a change — go ahead and ask them to fire Day Pitney outright for associating the school — which is in Connecticut — with the firm’s increasingly unhinged legal shenanigans surrounding the most significant tragedy to ever happen in the state.

So far the school’s response has tracked what we’d expect based on the recent FedSoc debacle:

[Vice President for Communications Nathaniel] Nickerson said that “when Yale learned of this action on Sunday, [University General Counsel Alexander] Dreier expressed his views to the management of Day Pitney in the strongest terms.”

“Yale is waiting to hear what Day Pitney intends to do to address this situation while we consider Yale’s ongoing relationship with the firm,” Nickerson said.

Superficially this tracks the request from the open letter: the school is considering its relationship. But “superficial” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. “Learned of this action on Sunday [October 10]” means “learned that people were upset about it” on Sunday. The fact that Day Pitney asked for attendance records for murdered children was news since the beginning of September. And even if Yale’s in-house lawyers aren’t reading Above the Law closely enough to see our September 3 story — and they really should be — the [Washington Post was on this by September 9](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/09/remington-arms-sandy-hook-children-school-records-new-low/). Yale can’t plausibly claim that they were in the dark for a month.

And we could use a lot more color as to what “strongest terms” even means. Because to me, “strongest terms” would be “withdraw that motion and apologize or you leave us no choice but to seek new outside counsel,” and yet I’m not optimistic that this would describe the exchange.

Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending the [launch of TrialWatch](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/top-law-school-enters-into-partnership-with-amal-clooney/), the global initiative by the Clooney Foundation for Justice, partnered with Columbia Law School, the American Bar Association, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Microsoft. TrialWatch is designed to monitor and bring transparency to trials around the world that are at risk for human rights violations — with a particular focus on “trials involving journalists, LGBTQ persons, women and girls, religious minorities, and human rights defenders.” As Amal Clooney noted in her opening remarks, “we monitor the fairness of elections, but not trials.” This project aims to change all that.

In their remarks, the Clooneys described how problematic regimes use courts to give their actions the veneer of legitimacy. George[ provided the audience](https://cfj.org/news_posts/statement-by-george-and-amal-clooney-at-the-launch-of-trialwatch-in-new-york-25-april-2019/) a laundry list of all the terrible things that happen — legally— in El Salvador, Iran, Brunei to name just a few. I won’t lie, the list is awful. Amal picked up the thread of “sinister prosecutions” and, without naming the Biglaw firm, [slammed Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/federal-prosecutors-are-thinking-about-going-after-skadden/) for their work on a report justifying the prosecution of former Russian-aligned Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s political rivals.

Working with their partner, Microsoft, TrialWatch developed an app for trained monitors to document what happens in noteworthy trials. (Of interest, President of Microsoft Brad Smith said that he’s been in product reviews with Bill Gates and it is nothing compared to being in a product review with Amal Clooney.) TrialWatch’s [release](https://cfj.org/news_posts/statement-by-george-and-amal-clooney-at-the-launch-of-trialwatch-in-new-york-25-april-2019/) on the launch describes how they are using technology to increase transparency:

Our monitors do not need to be lawyers, as long as they have completed the training [program](http://www.trialwatchtraining.org/) that we have developed with the [United Nations](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx), based on international human rights standards. And in court they will use a custom app developed with Microsoft to enable them to capture all relevant data – including photographs, audio clips, notes and official documents – in one place. Once we have gathered this data, a legal expert will grade the trial, and whenever possible the report will be shared with legislators, diplomats, journalists and NGOs.

The goal is to then take the data and convert it into an index that grades the performance of courts in countries around the world:

Ranking states’ performance on an index can help incentivize those with a low ranking to change their behaviour, and it can put pressure on governments to stop supporting those who are falling short. Grading trials and indexing the results can also help to expose the corrupt individuals who should be subjected to human-rights-sanctions under ‘Magnitsky laws’ or similar regimes. The EU has, in the past, [imposed](https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-extends-sanctions-on-iran-over-rights-violations/29161095.html) sanctions on judges and prosecutors who have presided over unfair trials in places like Belarus and Iran, and the US recently [sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm453) senior Turkish officials for the unfair detention of an American. But this should be happening in many more places.

When Kristof asked George how the project’s index can be used to shame bad actors, George came back to a theme that he hit multiple times during the event, that those that do business with these governments are complicit in their acts and public pressure can be used to stop the flow of money into those countries. “You can shame banks,” George said. (I guess he hasn’t watched the [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80118100) documentary on [HSBC](https://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/dirty-money-behind-the-scenes-of-netflixs-cartel-bank/).)

Carlson noted that the program has “unequivocally” had an impact already. And Smith said that TrialWatch will be a success when we don’t need it anymore, when the abuses stop happening.

# A&O Shearman Moves Closer To Reality As Partnership Vote Approaches
## The vote is expected to begin next week.

Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling are poised to [create a Biglaw behemoth](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/), A&O Shearman, if their proposed merger is approved by the partnership of both firms. Once combined, the firm will have 3,900 lawyers with approximately 800 partners, spread across 49 offices. A&O Shearman’s combined revenue will total $3.4 billion.

The global fanfare over this planned merger began in May, and after several months of A&O and Shearman senior partners Wim Dejonghe and Adam Hakki glad-handing with partners across continents, a vote on the combination is nearly upon us.

As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/18/ao-shearman-partners-to-begin-merger-vote-later-this-month-405-128776/), a two-week partnership voting window is expected to start on September 28, and will last through October 13.  Here are some additional details:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The firms have announced that they have completed financial and operational due diligence, the filing of requests for antitrust clearances (with the waiting period expired in the United States), as well as the completion of approval for all modifications to retirement and pension programs.

Arrangements over [pensions](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/18/ao-shearman-leaders-face-pension-and-management-questions-amid-merger-roadshow/) were thought to be one of the last significant hurdles in the talks between the two firms.

Dejonghe had this to say about the upcoming vote: “Preparations for the proposed merger are going well and we have received great feedback from clients and colleagues. Over the past few months, partners and teams from both firms have been meeting and building relationships, and the excitement about the opportunities for the merged firm is palpable.”

For the tie-up to be approved, 75% of each firm’s partnership must vote in favor of the merger. Best of luck to the firms as this process moves ahead to its conclusion. Maybe soon we’ll see a new top Am Law firm!

# Managing Without Fear: 6 Key Attributes Of A Fearless Managing Partner
## There are a handful of crucial attributes that make successful managing partners stand out from the crowd.

While law firms are unique in the business world in that they’ve historically avoided knighting their leadership with executive titles, managing partners are the exception to the rule. They’re functionally the chief executive officers of their firms, responsible for the firm’s overall management. They run the business, manage the culture, and ensure that the firm’s goals and visions stay on track. The managing partner is also the face of firm, charged with selling the firm’s brand to the outside world.

Keeping a law firm on course is no easy task. Business success means moving beyond business as usual. Managing partners must be fearless and bold in the face of a challenging legal market — rare qualities that can’t be taught in law school. Experience and intelligence are undoubtedly important, but there are a handful of crucial attributes that make successful managing partners stand out from the crowd.

Strategic Vision
Like all businesses, law firms must always be looking forward. A managing partner must focus on the firm’s future, while still making sure that the firm’s day-to-day operations are keeping up with today’s urgent demands. Adopting a strategy that adapts to a changing market is critical to success, and having the conviction to stick to it requires you to be fearless in the face of struggles. As one visionary managing partner said, “Strategic planning isn’t just a business catch-phrase, it’s a disciplined, analytical, realistic examination of the firm’s future, including possible threats to its existence. Without it, the ship doesn’t have a rudder, and could end up on the rocks if you aren’t careful.”

Bold Practicality
There’s a fine line to walk when it comes to balancing the need to keep your employees and clients happy while still pushing the envelope and allowing the firm to move forward. Change can be scary for your constituents, but a willingness to change is necessary for success. While it’s tempting to rest on your laurels when times are good, a fearless managing partner understands that stagnation can kill a firm, and that sometimes the status quo needs to be challenged in order to achieve greatness. A perfect example is moving away from the billable hour. It’s been the bread and butter of firms for decades, but clients are increasingly pushing back against it. Finding practical alternatives is the only way to keep clients happy. After all, without clients, there’s no firm. So, while eliminating the billable hour is a bold move, sometimes bold moves are the right answer.

Forward Thinking and Thought Leadership
Remaining competitive means keeping an eye on the market and finding ways to stand out from the competition. Successful managing partners are the ones you see at leadership conferences, educating themselves on how the industry is evolving. Fearless leaders set long-term goals, but are willing to change those goals when the landscape shifts. They also have the courage to seize new growth opportunities, rather than being satisfied with current successes. In the words of one successful practice head, “A lot of it is just keeping your antennae up, talking to colleagues, and making an effort to be aware of what’s going on.”

Business Acumen
Great lawyers don’t always make great businesspeople, and successful leaders need to show that they have what it takes to make a firm succeed. To be taken seriously as a managing partner, you need not just knowledge, but also a willingness to learn the things you don’t already know. The best leaders embrace the business side of things. Understanding the intricacies of balance sheets and firm finances may be daunting, but the fearless managing partner dives in and accepts the challenge in the interest of firm success.

People Skills
At the end of the day, it’s the people that make or break a law firm. Every practice is made up of a diverse set of personalities, talents, and priorities, and a successful managing partner needs to meld them all into one functioning unit. As the firm’s leader, you’re responsible for fostering a culture that motivates employees at every level and upholds a firm standard that your people want to work for. As one managing partner put it, “For the whole machine to work, everyone has to be invested in the firm’s mission and do their part.” It takes a fearless captain to take a disparate group of individuals and make them work as a cohesive team.

Client Insight
To be able to truly serve your clients, you must know their business and their needs inside and out. The fearless managing partner takes the time to educate herself or himself about a client’s inner workings, and admits that there’s always more to learn. Knowing your clients not only allows you to offer them the best possible representation, but also open doors to possible new avenues of business development. We may live in a digital world, but there’s simply no substitute for personal interactions and strong relationships when it comes to taking the bold steps necessary to keep clients happy. After all, happy clients make for happy firms.

Successful managing partners are made in the real business world, not in law school. Part of being a fearless leader is knowing where to look for help and answers when you need them.

Daniel Michael Dixon, formerly counsel at the Biglaw firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, [has been suspended ](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/ex-morgan-lewis-lawyer-who-wrongly-thought-he-could-power-through-depression-gets-suspension)from the practice of law by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for a year and a day after a number of ethical lapses.

As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/ex-morgan-lewis-lawyer-who-wrongly-thought-he-could-power-through-depression-gets-suspension) the ABA Journal, Dixon failed to tell his client CSI International about an adverse ruling. He then missed the appeal deadline, and piled on the false statements to try and undo the damage.

According to the report, Dixon failed to disclose the June 2017 adverse ruling to the client and failed to meet a September 2017 deadline for appeal. For a period after the adverse decision, Dixon “on multiple occasions failed to reply to his client’s inquiries about the status of its case.” When he did reply in “purported updates,” he made misrepresentations.

Dixon falsely said he was “pulling together some materials” to “fast-track resolution of the appeal,” that the secretary of the body that hears appeals conceded the lien was in error and was “going to touch base with the appropriate folks,” that a successful resolution would be forthcoming, and that the appellate body “threw us a curveball” when it denied relief.

Dixon filed two false affidavits—one that he signed and one that he prepared for his assistant—to support his false claim that he didn’t receive the decision when it was issued, and he should be allowed to appeal.

Dixon never respond to the ethics allegations, which deemed them admitted. But he did testify at a hearing after the ethics committee found violations.

Dixon testified that he suffered from anxiety and depression following a breakup with his wife. That was compounded because he was “in no way prepared” to handle working at Morgan Lewis and he “testified that he ‘oversold’ his ability to be a practice group leader in the state and local tax area and was not prepared to come into the firm and build a team.”

In hindsight, Dixon thought that he should have taken more time off to address his mental health issues before accepting the position at Morgan Lewis.

“At the time,” the report said, Dixon “thought that his mental health issues were a weakness he could ‘power through.’ He recognizes now that his issues were not a problem he could handle on his own.”

Dixon had expressed remorse for his conduct and “described his actions as dishonest, inappropriate and a mistake,” according to the disciplinary board report. He has practiced law since 2006 and has no prior record of discipline.

Dixon worked at a small firm at the time of the disciplinary hearing, and says that better suits his needs. He’s also in therapy and has reconciled with his wife. He says he’s disappointed by the court’s decision:

Christopher A. Wray (via King & Spalding)

Christopher Wray, the man Donald Trump has selected to head the Bureau Of Locking Her Up [FBI](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/president-trump-selects-doj-veteran-christopher-wray-as-f-b-i-director/), will face the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow. The media is [currently buzzing](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/fbi-pick-christopher-wray-made-92-million-at-law-firm/article/2628153) over Wray’s [financial disclosures](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/king-spalding-pays-christopher-wray-9-2-million-a-year/2/) (available on the next page), which reveal that he makes $9.2 million as a partner at King & Spalding.

It’s your regularly scheduled reminder that normal people are shocked by Biglaw salaries. Not to say making over $800K a month isn’t an extravagant haul in a country where the median annual income is $51,939 a year, but it shouldn’t bring the presses to a screeching halt to learn that a Biglaw partner is taking home a multimillion-dollar draw. This is what lawyers do. When you’re filling the proverbial swamp, you need a whole bunch of wealthy professionals. And, sure, it involves an ethically discomfiting revolving door — Wray himself is a former assistant attorney general who took the last 12 years to amass a small fortune before going back on the government payroll to investigate many of the companies he just defended — but we knew all that already.

Of more interest is just how much more he’s making than his colleagues. King & Spalding profits per partner clock in at a little over $2.5 million, so Wray is lapping the average PPP three times over. I don’t know how transparent the King & Spalding partnership is, but I’d like to think there’s a King & Spalding partner toiling for a million five out there who opened the newspaper today and went, “The f**k?”

One thing we know for sure is that, once confirmed, Wray will have to pack up and move to antiquated digs in the Hoover building after [today’s announcement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2017/07/10/e25c1080-65af-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f_story.html/) that the FBI is giving up on its dream of moving to a new office.

It’s too bad. If only there were a real estate developer in the government capable of negotiating a better deal.

# Getting A Raise Is The Best Way To Start The Day
## Why torture associates by making them wait?

We often overlook the timing of a raise (or bonus for that matter) announcement, but there’s some real thought at work here. Announcements aren’t fired off within minutes of a managing partner adjourning a meeting, there’s time taken to craft the appropriate email and coordinate with all the behind-the-scenes parties that make a raise happen. And with that time, firms have to decide when they’ll drop their big news.

A lot of firms wait until the late afternoon. It makes some sense from the firm’s perspective — associates will likely be distracted once they get the news, so wait until the business day is almost over and most of the billables are logged. On the other hand, spending another entire day waiting on news is torture for the associates and, more importantly, the Above the Law staff who have to write these up.

Which is why we appreciate Dechert’s decision to start the workday fresh with a salary announcement. All U.S. associates in good standing will be adopting the prevailing salary scale all the way up the line and offering matching summer bonuses. The firm is following the developing trend of requiring associates to meet 50 percent of their 1950 hour annual billing requirement to receive the bonus at this time, but recognizing that an associate who may be light at mid-year but meets the 1950 threshold by year’s end will get this bonus tacked onto any other holiday bonus.

With cyberattacks at an all-time high and 95 percent of all cybersecurity issues traceable to human error, the risk to law firms of all sizes is real and growing.

Amid these threats, law firms must maintain a high level of security across all sensitive content, preserving data integrity and protecting client information without affecting workplace flexibility — wherever or however employees access information.

iManage partnered with Above the Law (ATL) to better understand these concerns, what steps law firms are taking to mitigate them, and what challenges firms are still working through to achieve operational efficiency.

Biglaw merger mania is on the rise and some firms are thirsty for a dance partner. According to a[ report](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/10/24/reed-smith-nears-abs-conversion-and-eyes-us-merger-405-25310/) from Law.com, partners at Reed Smith recently got the memo that the firm is looking for a possible merger partner, should the opportunity arise.

During a partner conference earlier this year, partners walked away with the distinct impression that a merger could be in the firm’s future:

One London Reed Smith partner said they felt the firm was “trying to gear us up for a possible merger” at the firm’s partner conference held in Orlando earlier this year. The partner said that while nothing specific was discussed, partners were given “soft messaging” about opportunities.

But the firm’s official stance is more reserved, noting that they’re open to the possibility, but don’t have a specific target in mind. One firm executive, Tamara Box, who is the managing parter of Europe & Middle East, noted that the Houston, Miami, and New York were offices where the firm was particularly eager to add talent:

“Were the right merger partner to come along that happened to fill strategic needs, we would look at that,” Box said. “While we don’t have anything on the horizon presently, we are not afraid of those opportunities.

“We are still focused on strategic hiring in the U.S.—there are some places where we have skills gaps in our coverage or areas we want to continue growing,” she added, explaining that the firm’s Houston, Miami and New York bases are areas of priority for the firm “to add stellar talent in.”

Amid a hopping lateral and merger environment, it’ll be interesting to see exactly what Reed Smith winds up doing.

In the vast digital landscape, LinkedIn stands as a pivotal platform for legal professionals seeking not just to highlight their expertise but to significantly enhance their career trajectory.

Through strategic engagement, thoughtful content creation, and a commitment to professional growth, attorneys can leverage LinkedIn to develop a compelling digital presence that attracts clients, fosters meaningful collaborations, and establishes their thought leadership.

A Stellar Presence

A dynamic LinkedIn profile acts as your digital handshake, making a strong first impression on potential clients and peers.

It’s a space where your professional identity is not just presented but celebrated, allowing you to stand out in a crowded legal marketplace.

To enhance your presence:

- Share insights and opinions on legal developments to showcase your knowledge and engage your audience.
- Initiate and participate in discussions to demonstrate thought leadership and build professional relationships.
- Highlight successes and milestones to illustrate the impact and breadth of your legal career.
The Hashtag Cosmos

Mastering the art of hashtags can exponentially increase your visibility on LinkedIn, ensuring your content reaches the right audience.

It’s a strategic approach to digital networking that can open doors to new opportunities and collaborations.

Hashtags act like beacons, shining a light on your work.

- Use targeted hashtags to connect your content with specific legal topics or trends.
- Research and apply trending legal hashtags to enhance the discoverability of your posts.
The Art of Engagement

Engagement on LinkedIn goes beyond networking; it’s about building a community around your expertise.

Active participation not only elevates your profile but also enriches your professional experience with diverse perspectives and opportunities.

To ignite this engagement:

- Share your expertise through articles and posts to contribute to the legal discourse.
- Utilize visual aids to make complex information more accessible and engaging.
The Guiding Light of Personal Connection

Video content offers a unique opportunity to humanize your professional persona and directly connect with your audience.

It’s a medium through which your expertise and dedication are vividly conveyed, setting you apart from your peers:

- Create concise explainer videos on legal topics to demonstrate your expertise.
- Share personal insights and experiences to foster a deeper connection with your audience.
The Center of Your Professional Universe

Regular engagement with your LinkedIn network cultivates a vibrant professional community around your brand.

This ongoing interaction not only boosts your visibility but also provides valuable insights into the needs and interests of your potential clients.

A commitment to professionalism and inclusivity on LinkedIn enhances your personal brand, reflecting your dedication to ethical practice and social responsibility — a trait greatly admired in the legal field:

- Interact with other posts by commenting and sharing to build relationships and show your active participation in the legal community.
- Monitor engagement metrics to understand the impact of your content and refine your strategy.
A Call to Action

Taking proactive steps to enhance your LinkedIn presence is crucial for career advancement.

A well-maintained profile and consistent engagement can distinguish you as a leader in your field, attracting more opportunities and recognition.

This consistent engagement not only increases your visibility but also offers insights into your audience’s needs and interests:

- Regularly update your profile with new achievements and insights.
- Maintain an active content calendar to ensure consistent engagement with your network.
Advanced Features

Developing a strong personal brand and utilizing LinkedIn’s advanced features can significantly enhance your career by positioning you as a go-to expert in your legal niche.

It enables direct communication with potential clients and partners, bypassing traditional barriers.

Keeping your profile updated and engaging consistently with your network marks you as a prominent figure, attracting greater opportunities and recognition:

- Focus on articulating your unique value proposition through your content and interactions.
- Explore LinkedIn Premium for deeper insights and more direct networking options.
Regular Profile Maintenance

Keeping your LinkedIn profile updated and actively engaging with your network ensures that your digital presence remains vibrant, relevant and doesn’t dim.

This consistency is key to building and maintaining professional relationships that can lead to career growth and opportunities.

This direct line to potential clients and partners can be a game-changer.

- Schedule regular check-ins to update your profile and engage with new content.
- Stay active by regularly posting, sharing, and commenting to keep your network engaged.
As you embark on this journey of LinkedIn mastery, remember that your profile is more than just a digital footprint; it’s a living, evolving representation of your legal career.

By actively engaging with the platform, continuously refining your approach, and embracing the vast community it offers, you unlock new horizons of professional growth and opportunity.

May this guide serve as your compass, leading you to forge deeper connections, achieve greater visibility, and, ultimately, illuminate the unique expertise you bring to the legal world.

Here’s to your success on LinkedIn, where your dedication, expertise, and insights can truly shine.

# In-House Resolutions For 2024? AI Predictions For 2024? Phooey!
## No longer a haven for burned-out law firm lawyers, in-housers are burned out as well. Can AI help them stop feeling the burn?

New Year’s resolutions for me are a waste of time and energy that evaporate into thin air by Valentine’s Day (if not sooner). I had thought about having an AI write this column, complete with resolutions and predictions, but that would set a dangerous precedent, at least with my editor. My Ouija board, crystal ball, and Magic 8 Ball (remember those?) are all in the shop, so it’s hard to make predictions, not that I’d want to in these times. Predict at your own risk.

However, people reflect at this time of year and decide how and if they want to move forward, and what that would look like. Often, parents would tell us that the “grass always looks greener,” “your eyes are bigger than your stomach,” and other platitudes, some of which had more than a grain of truth. Time for a change?

As one example, lawyers in law firms, especially at the associate/junior partner level, often think that if they could just land in-house jobs, life would be perfect. Au contraire, life in-house is hardly a bed of roses, but one with plenty of thorns. This [recent Axiom survey](https://www.legaldive.com/news/in-house-lawyer-job-satisfaction-axiom-survey-legal-talent-provider/703140/) proves my point. Nearly 90% of in-house lawyers say they are dissatisfied with their jobs.

That’s a huge number.

The issues in the Axiom survey are nothing new: chronic underfunding of legal departments because they are viewed as “cost centers” rather than money makers. I have always thought that the view was extremely shortsighted. The legal department may or may not help bring the money in, but it is the one that will keep it from going out the back door. For savvy businesspeople, this should not come as a surprise, but it’s amazing how often it does.

Another issue is technology: whether companies are willing to invest in the necessary bells and whistles that will make the legal department more effective and thus more cost efficient. Businesspeople shrug and say that what the legal department has is “good enough.” No, it’s not. Workloads increase and technology does not keep up with those demands.

The number of matters and their growing complexities are other reasons why in-house counsel are dissatisfied. And, of course, there’s the ever popular (but not to the legal department) notion of freezing headcount in the department, aka doing more with less, a concept that has diminishing returns.

And that “let them eat cake attitude” is prompting approximately two-thirds of in-housers to look for other opportunities, which is a whopping increase from the under 20% seeking to ditch the in-house world in last year’s survey. More attorneys want to return to a law firm environment, rather than the 33% who want another in-house position.

No longer a haven for burned-out law firm lawyers, in-housers are burned out as well. Possible solutions? If we have learned anything from the pandemic years, it’s that the old ways of leadership and management don’t work in this new environment. Listening to what the in-house team wants and needs to function is a way to start. It also takes gumption to tell businesspeople what the legal department needs to survive and thrive. Yes, there are still some businesspeople who say that they will just close the legal department and send all work outside. Good luck with that. Just wait until those bills start coming in and there’s no one to review and push back against the fees charged when no one is looking. Let the squawking begin.

And what about AI? AI can do a lot of lawyering, but it can’t give advice, at least not yet, and, I hope, not ever. [What AI can and does do](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-lawyer) is much of the drudge work that makes lawyers want to stick forks in their eyeballs or leave the profession in utter frustration. By drudge work, I mean e-discovery (I dare you to name anyone who really likes doing that); paperwork automation, thus reducing the amount of time that lawyers need to cut and paste; and basic contract drafting. There will always be issue of content or form that need human intervention but replacing lawyers completely? Nope.

We have honed certain skills that AI just doesn’t have: the ability to negotiate, the ability to read the room, the ability to see below the surface of a dispute to plumb the underlying causes, and to suss out what the client really needs and or wants. Context does matter here. No automaton can do that yet and, I hope, never will. AI stands for “artificial intelligence,” and the profession still needs HI, human intelligence, although sometimes I wonder if our profession has more “inhumane intelligence,” than “human,” but that’s a topic for another time.

Right now, the [biggest AI threat to lawyers is financial](https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/insights/legal/b/thought-leadership/posts/how-generative-ai-is-disrupting-law-firm-billing-practices), that is, the billable hour. Some courts are requiring disclosure when AI is used to create court filings. The next step may be to require law firms to disclose their use of AI in their practices and how it’s reflected in their bills. Reduce or strip away hours spent on tasks that AI can do more effectively and efficiently than lawyer hours and firms may have to start being more mindful about what they can charge for and what they can’t. Ethical practices will come into play.

Some have been predicting the demise or at least the diminution of the billable hour, and 2024 may be the year when billing practices get slapped upside the head. It’s long overdue. The demise of the billable hour? Too soon to tell, but it may well be on life support in the coming years. Try to have a happy new year anyway.

Last week was dominated by two things for me: the never-ending mortgage underwriting process, with responses to inquiries just begetting more inquiries, and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I have asthma, one of the [underlying health conditions](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccine-eligibility.page#under) currently recognized in New York State as qualifying a person to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. In the years leading up to 2020, my asthma didn’t bother me much. But last year this month, COVID-19 sent me to the hospital for 17 days, including six days on a [ventilator](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/09/my-near-death-experience-ventilator/), and my doctors believe my asthma contributed to the severity of my case.

I asked my internist if I should get vaccinated, and he said absolutely, in light of both my asthma and past COVID experience (plus increasing cases of reinfection, including that of a man in France with a history of asthma who got reinfected and wound up [hospitalized in critical condition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/02/13/reinfection-south-africa-variant/)). So I got the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine on Monday. On Tuesday, I had a strong reaction — fever, fatigue, aches — but by the end of the week, I was fine. I urge all of you to get vaccinated when you can.

Now, on to the news.

Lawyer of the Week: Vernon E. Jordan Jr.

Lawyers were all over the headlines in the past week. For example:

- Lawrence Otis Graham, the celebrated Black lawyer turned writer, who [passed away recently](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/us/lawrence-otis-graham-dead.html?surface=most-popular&fellback=false&req_id=479075143&algo=bandit-all-surfaces-decay-decay-02&variant=2_bandit-all-surfaces-decay-decay-02&imp_id=791643525&action=click&module=Most%20Popular&pgtype=Homepage) at the age of 59;
- Neera Tanden, whose nomination to lead the Office of Management and Budget [was withdrawn at her request](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/neera-tanden-nomination.html) after controversy erupted over her “[mean tweets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/20/gop-should-forgive-neera-tanden/)”;
- Vanita Gupta, nominated to serve as associate attorney general (the #3 job at the Justice Department), whose nomination is also generating [controversy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/vanita-gupta-kristen-clarke-smear-campaigns/2021/02/28/1ca77cae-786a-11eb-948d-19472e683521_story.html) (but also some [conservative support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/vanita-gupta-biden-justice-department/2021/03/01/cec4c74c-79f1-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html), interestingly enough); and
- Kade Crockford, whose work for the ACLU helping Massachusetts craft thoughtful laws governing the use of facial recognition technology was recently highlighted by Kashmir Hill in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/technology/Massachusetts-facial-recognition-rules.html).
I feel fairly confident in my winner, though: Vernon Jordan, who passed away on Monday at the age of 85. As noted in his [Times obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/vernon-jordan-dead.html), Jordan was a “civil rights leader and Washington power broker whose private counsel was sought in the highest echelons of government and the corporate world.” And his incredible career, including [four decades at Akin Gump](https://www.akingump.com/en/vernon-e-jordan-jr-1935-2021.html), was all the more impressive considering the discrimination he faced as a Black man in America.

You can read about Jordan’s remarkable life and career in his [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/vernon-jordan-dead.html) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/vernon-jordan-dead/2021/03/02/b633fb82-4b79-11ea-9b5c-eac5b16dafaa_story.html) obituaries, as well as this [eloquent remembrance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/02/vernon-jordan-made-being-black-man-america-look-effortless/) by Robin Givhan, a friend of his. I’d also like to share a personal perspective from noted broadcast journalist [Alice Travis](https://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/459384/alice-travis-presented-with-the-albert-nelson-marquis-lifetime-achievement-award-by-marquis-whos-who) (sent to me by a relative of hers who is a reader of Original Jurisdiction):

Rightfully celebrated for his advocacy and behind-the-scenes influence, Vernon Jordan leaves a profound legacy in politics, law, and business. He deserves equal remembrance as a man. As likable as he was powerful, he was one of the finest human beings I ever have known. Without recognition and in exchange for nothing, Vernon always could be counted on to lend a hand, to do a favor, to open a door, or to hold open the door of opportunity.

In June 1976, when Barbara Walters exited The Today Show, as a young television journalist, I was one such beneficiary. Vernon went straight to the top and arranged for me, a mere acquaintance, to meet not once but twice with the top NBC brass who would sign off on the new hire. It was a different world then, being of color was not to the advantage of a journalist, and I did not secure the role, but Vernon had interceded knowing thinking would change and talent would triumph.

Judge of the Week: Judge Peter W. Hall.

As I’ve mentioned before in these pages, repeat wins are possible but disfavored, especially within a short span of time. So I’m passing over Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was JOTW [just last month](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/judicial-notice-february-13-2021), even though Justice Barrett issued her [first signed majority opinion](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/us/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court.html) for the Supreme Court on Thursday. As noted by Robert Barnes of the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-epa-opinion/2021/03/04/b9008ce6-7cf5-11eb-a976-c028a4215c78_story.html), it’s customary for a justice’s first opinion to be [lopsided or even unanimous](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-epa-opinion/2021/03/04/b9008ce6-7cf5-11eb-a976-c028a4215c78_story.html) in the vote, and Justice Barrett’s concise, 11-page [opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-547_08m1.pdf) for a 7-2 majority in [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/u-s-fish-and-wildlife-service-v-sierra-club/) was no exception. It’s about the scope of the deliberative process privilege under FOIA — yes, I know, I lost you at “FOIA” — but if you want to read more, Howard Bashman has collected copious coverage over at [How Appealing](https://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/2021/03/04/#147431).

I also considered Judge Claudette White, praised in her [New York Times obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/obituaries/00claudette-white-dead-coronavirus.html?action=click&module=Latest&pgtype=Homepage) as an “innovative tribal judge” for “calling out injustice since the third grade.” A member of the tribal council of her Quechan tribe of Southern California, as well as a former chief judge for the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, Judge White passed away last month at the age of 49 from COVID-19. May she rest in peace.

For JOTW, though, I’m going with Judge Peter Hall (2d Cir.), who made news by announcing his decision to retire from active service and [take senior status](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/biden-can-flip-second-circuit-after-judge-takes-senior-status?context=search&index=0). This is significant because, combined with other recent retirement announcements from Judges Robert A. Katzmann (who went senior in January) and Denny Chin (who will go senior in June), President Joe Biden now has the opportunity to flip the Second Circuit back to a Democratic majority. As Professor Carl Tobias, a prominent scholar of the federal courts, told [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/biden-can-flip-second-circuit-after-judge-takes-senior-status?context=search&index=0), “It’s a big deal because the Second Circuit is so important.” Headquartered in Manhattan, the court hears many high-profile criminal and civil cases, including a disproportionate number of landmark cases in banking and securities law.

Who’s in the running for Second Circuit seats? The jurists mentioned by Professor Tobias — Judges J. Paul Oetken, Alison J. Nathan, and Jesse M. Furman (S.D.N.Y.), and Judge Pamela K. Chen (E.D.N.Y.) — are all highly respected trial judges who would be excellent additions to the court for the two New York seats. But in Judge Hall’s case, because he occupied the “[Vermont seat](https://vtdigger.org/2021/03/05/judge-peter-hall-who-holds-vermonts-seat-on-federal-appeals-court-to-step-down/),” the nomination will go to someone from the Green Mountain State. If you have thoughts on possible Vermont nominees, please [email me](mailto:davidlat@substack.com?subject=Second%20Circuit%20seat).

Ruling of the Week: Chevron Corp. v. Donziger.

Speaking of the Second Circuit, on Thursday the court issued its latest ruling in [Chevron Corp. v. Donziger](https://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/330a934e-d4a8-4d8c-8aa5-7e65b1ee03de/1/doc/18-855_complete_opn.pdf#xml=https://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/330a934e-d4a8-4d8c-8aa5-7e65b1ee03de/1/hilite/), the long-running, closely watched legal battle between oil giant Chevron and lawyer Steven Donziger, who filed a class-action lawsuit against Texaco back in 1993, alleging that Texaco’s oil drilling in Ecuador caused massive pollution that harmed indigenous communities in the Amazon. (Chevron is now the defendant because it acquired Texaco in 2001; Texaco operated the Lago Agrio oil field from 1972 to 1993.)

As Judge Gerard Lynch explains in his opinion, the current appeal is not about the underlying environmental litigation:

Rather, the three pending appeals relate to a subsequent civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (“RICO”) suit in which the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Lewis A. Kaplan, J.) found that the Donziger Defendants and a group of Ecuadorian residents conspired to procure [a multibillion-dollar Ecuadorian] judgment [against Chevron] through illegal means.

As noted by Judge Lynch, those means included “brib[ing] the presiding judge to enter a judgment in his clients’ favor in exchange for $500,000 of the judgment’s proceeds; coerc[ing] the court to appoint a hand-picked expert whom Donziger paid for favorable testimony; and ghost-wr[iting] the Ecuadorian Judgment ‘in whole or in major part’ with only ‘light editing’ by the judge who signed it.”

But this appeal is also not about the merits of the RICO case, which the opinion notes “has been authoritatively resolved against Donziger.” Judge Kaplan ruled against Donziger after a seven-week trial, the Second Circuit affirmed, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. (Donziger was also [disbarred by New York State last year](https://www.courthousenews.com/steven-donziger-who-battled-chevron-in-ecuador-has-been-disbarred/), so state courts haven’t been kind to him either.)

What is the instant appeal about? A few things: a challenge by Donziger to the award of costs to Chevron, various contempt rulings against him, and the award of sanctions and attorneys’ fees to Chevron. On contempt, the main issue is whether Donziger violated Judge Kaplan’s injunction against profiting from the fraudulently procured Ecuadorian judgment when he sold interests in the Ecuadorian judgment to at least six investors for $1.2 million, then paid himself with the proceeds.

As summarized by Jonathan Stempel of [Reuters](https://today.westlaw.com/Document/Ibed154a07d1f11eb8e37a1c329afe9ba/View/FullText.html?transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=(sc.Default)), the Second Circuit “largely upheld” Judge Kaplan’s rulings against Donziger, “but narrowed the scope of a 2019 civil contempt finding” against him. The ruling was mixed enough that both [Team Chevron](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304006182/en/U.S.-Court-of-Appeals-Affirms-Contempt-Rulings-Against-Disbarred-Lawyer-Behind-Fraudulent-Ecuadorian-Lawsuit) and [Team Donziger](http://redgreenandblue.org/2021/03/05/steven-donziger-beat-chevron-court-crucified-just-won-appeal/) claimed victory. (Thomas Hungar of Gibson Dunn, Chevron’s longtime counsel in this litigation, represented the company before the Second Circuit, while Donziger proceeded pro se.)

It will be interesting to see what effect, if any, the Second Circuit’s latest decision might have on the related prosecution of Donziger on criminal contempt charges, which is also making news. As Jason Grant recently reported for [Law.com](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2021/02/26/students-from-52-law-schools-boycott-seward-kissels-recruitment-over-alleged-conflict-in-donziger-prosecution/), more than 300 law students are protesting Seward & Kissel, boycotting the firm’s recruiting process because of the firm’s role in serving as court-appointed prosecutor in Donziger’s criminal contempt case.

Runner-up: [The Williams Companies Shareholder Litigation](https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=317240). As noted by Andrew Ross Sorkin and the team over at [DealBook](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/business/dealbook/fox-cnn-media-strategy.html), this was “the first time in more than two decades that the influential Chancery Court, which presides over most disputes in corporate America, [invalidated a poison pill](https://chiefexecutive.net/a-wrong-poison-pill/) adopted by a public company.” Congratulations to Bernstein Litowitz, Grant & Eisenhofer, and Friedman Oster & Tejtel, counsel to the plaintiffs.

But don’t despair, defense lawyers. As pointed out by several law firm client memos (such as [this Paul, Weiss memo](https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/transactional/mergers-acquisitions/publications/delaware-court-s-injunction-of-extreme-poison-pill-unlikely-to-affect-typical-market-practice?id=39461)), the pill in question here “had a package of novel features,” including a five percent trigger, that collectively constituted what Chancery viewed as an “extreme” poison pill.

Litigation of the Week: Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee.

In Judicial Notice, I sometimes like to go with “interesting” over “important” when it comes to my awards. But sometimes important is too important to be denied.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard [oral argument](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2020/19-1257_3ea4.pdf) in the consolidated cases of [Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/brnovich-v-democratic-national-committee/) and Arizona Republican Party v. Democratic National Committee, which challenge two election restrictions in Arizona. Adam Liptak of the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/us/politics/supreme-court-arizona-voting.html) described Brnovich as the Court’s “most important voting rights case in almost a decade.” Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, writing for the [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/columns/article/chemerinsky-voting-rights-cases-before-supreme-court-could-have-profound-effects-on-future-elections), declared that “how the court decides these cases could have a profound effect on what state laws are enacted and allowed with regard to voting, and who votes and how elections are conducted for many years to come.”

In a [February 16 letter](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-1257/169119/20210216164922124_Letter%20-%2019-1257%20and%2019-1258.pdf) to the Court, deputy solicitor general Edwin Kneedler advised the justices that the Biden administration “does not disagree” with the Trump administration’s ultimate conclusion that the challenged provisions don’t violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. But the new administration does disagree with — and disavows — the analysis previously proffered by the former administration.

And as Ruth Marcus explained in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/with-voting-rights-already-under-attack-the-supreme-court-could-deal-another-big-blow/2021/02/26/e787b074-7874-11eb-9537-496158cc5fd9_story.html), it’s the analysis that’s key; “the significance of the case will be in what standard the court adopts for how to apply Section 2 — which has been most often interpreted in the context of racial gerrymandering — to claims of discriminatory voting practices.” With more voting laws (and challenges to voting laws) in the pipeline, which will further fuel the trend of elections becoming more contested and contentious, the analytical framework for the Voting Rights Act matters more than ever.

Deal of the Week: Apollo’s acquisition of Michaels.

In terms of the “coolness” factor, it would be hard to beat the [acquisition of a majority stake in Tidal](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/business/media/tidal-square-jay-z-dorsey.html) — the streaming music service owned by Jay-Z, Beyonce, and other celebs — by Square, the mobile payments company owned by Jack Dorsey, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Twitter and a celebrity in his own right.

Jay-Z: [he’s not a businessman, he’s a business, man!](https://www.goalcast.com/2018/07/03/20-inspirational-jay-z-quotes/) He will also join the board of Square, which is noteworthy.

But in terms of the value of the deal, it was for “only” $297 million — enough for Hova and Queen Bey to [dine at Red Lobster](https://www.thecut.com/2016/03/jay-z-beyonce-eating-chips.html), but not nearly enough to make him a [Black Bill Gates in the making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ). And it’s not even that big a sum by the standards of Biglaw dealmaking, although I’m sure the law firms involved — Gibson Dunn for Square, Reed Smith and Cummings & Lockwood for Tidal — are pretty thrilled to be working on this matter (especially if they got to Zoom with either Jay-Z or Jack Dorsey at any point).

For Deal of the Week, I’m therefore going with something that has a bigger dollar value and a current-events hook: Apollo Global Management’s [acquisition of Michaels](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/business/michaels-will-be-acquired-by-a-private-equity-firm-in-a-5-billion-deal.html), the crafts retailer that’s a strip-mall staple, for $5 billion.

What’s the current-events hook? During the pandemic, with millions of Americans stuck at home and bored out of their minds, crafting became an even more popular pastime — and Michaels benefited, seizing the opportunity to launch [same-day delivery and curbside pickup services](https://risnews.com/michaels-launches-same-day-delivery-weeks-curbside-days).

The stock price of Michaels also benefited, rising by over 300 percent over the past year. The Apollo deal, if it goes through, will offer an additional premium. If it doesn’t go through, shareholders might get an even better deal; the Apollo agreement includes a 25-day “go-shop” period, during which Michaels can entertain other suiters.

Congratulations to the lawyers and law firms involved (per [Law.com](https://www.law.com/radar/?o=%2Fcard%2Fdealname-2ad00c22-15bb-4551-983b-6dd152fd8fcd%3Futm_source%3Demail&utm_medium=enl&utm_content=20210304&utm_campaign=morningminute&utm_term=law)):

Michaels, which is based in Irving, Texas, was represented by a Ropes & Gray team led by partners Will Shields, Craig Marcus, Sarah Young and Will Michener. Latham & Watkins represented UBS Group, which acted as financial adviser to Michaels. Apollo was advised by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The Simpson Thacher team included M&A partners Gregory Klein, Michael Kaplan and Atif Azher.

All four firms are noted for their expertise in private equity M&A — showing the advantages of sticking to your knitting.

Law Firm of the Week: Davis Polk & Wardwell.

Yes, Davis Polk was LFOW [back in January](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/judicial-notice-january-8-2021). But what it did last week definitely merits a repeat win.

As first reported by [Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-tells-associates-thank-you-with-extra-special-gifts/), Davis Polk — in order to “celebrate the hope of this upcoming spring,” as managing partner [Neil Barr](https://www.davispolk.com/professionals/neil-barr) wrote in his announcement email — showered its associates with gifts. More specifically, in recognition of its associates’ “resiliency during this trying time” and “commitment to client service,” DPW allowed them to choose from such thoughtful gifts as an excursion for two (outdoors, of course); fitness equipment (since many gyms are closed during the pandemic); and wine and culinary packages (because we all could use more booze and food right now). Associates could choose from more than a dozen different packages, with an estimated value of at least $1,500.

Not surprisingly, many other Biglaw firms quickly followed suit, including Akin Gump, Debevoise & Plimpton, Latham & Watkins, Shearman & Sterling, Simpson Thacher, Sullivan & Cromwell, and Willkie Farr (per Meghan Tribe of [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/davis-polk-rewards-associates-with-gifts-for-work-in-pandemic)). But on something like gifts (as opposed to bonuses), where it’s really the thought that counts (as opposed to the dollar amount), Davis Polk still gets special credit.

Of course, we all recall how Davis Polk established the [special-bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) of $7,500-$40,000 that wound up being the industry standard last year. Look for DPW to become an even hotter firm come recruiting time, if that’s even possible, and maybe to inch up a few spots in the next [Vault rankings](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/top-100-law-firms-rankings).

Lateral Move of the Week: Latham & Watkins hiring Ian Conner.

During the pandemic, lateral hiring out of government slowed significantly. Many firms were unwilling or unable to make the investment required in hiring government lawyers. Because these attorneys don’t come with clients, hiring out of government requires strategic vision and a willingness to wait — a year, 18 months, two years — while the new partner builds her practice. Many firms, lacking the vision, patience, or pocketbook, prefer to hire partners with portable practices, who (in theory) can be accretive pretty much from the get-go.

So kudos to Latham & Watkins for [hiring Ian Conner](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/03/01/ex-ftc-antitrust-director-a-kirkland-alum-chooses-latham-for-private-practice-return/), who most recently served as Director of the Bureau of Competition at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (and who served at the DOJ’s Antitrust Division earlier in his career). Antitrust is an extremely “hot” area right now, and a high-level FTC official like Conner is quite a catch. Conner will join the firm’s D.C. office as a partner in the Litigation & Trial Department, as well as a member of the Antitrust & Competition Practice. Per Dylan Jackson of [Law.com](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/03/01/ex-ftc-antitrust-director-a-kirkland-alum-chooses-latham-for-private-practice-return/), Conner joins a number of government alums at Latham, including fellow FTC alumni Amanda Reeves and Alan Devlin.

Considering that 2020 was a [much stronger year for law firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/17/early-reports-the-2021-am-law-200-financials/?kw=Early%20Reports:%20The%202021%20Am%20Law%20200%20Financials&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=afternoonupdate&utm_content=20210218&utm_term=tal) than many expected, perhaps more firms will follow Latham’s lead and restart or increase their hiring out of government. With regulation and enforcement likely to increase on multiple fronts during the Biden administration, law firms need to be ready to help their clients navigate the coming challenges.

Any rational business cares about its employees, and it cares whether employees are happy with their work  — whether employees are “engaged.”

This is common sense.  Engagement affects employee turnover (and the cost of recruiting replacements).  Engagement affects the cost of training new employees.  There’s some evidence that engagement correlates to corporate profitability.  And, as a general principle, it’s nice if people are happy.

This stuff matters.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If engagement matters, you should measure it and monitor it.

Things that are measured and monitored get done:  Number of hours billed.  Number of days worked.  Amount of revenue generated.  Value of costs saved.

Things that are not measured and monitored don’t get done:  Being collegial.  Mentoring.  Contributing to your community.  Raising the firm’s profile.  Pro bono work (in many firms).  Time spent training other lawyers. 

Employee engagement should naturally improve once everyone knows that the entity cares about it.  At a law firm, everyone ignores secretaries and mistreats paralegals, because secretaries and paralegals are low on the pecking order, and no one worries about those employees’ engagement.  Once word goes out that a firm cares about everyone’s engagement, lawyers will realize that it doesn’t hurt to say hello to secretaries, treat paralegals like human beings, and otherwise behave properly.

The problem is devising a test that (1) accurately measures engagement and (2) isn’t subject to abuse.

Think first about whether an engagement survey accurately measures engagement.  A typical question on a survey might ask:  “Is [your employer] viewed as one of the best places to work for people in your field?”  If the answer is yes, then the employee is more engaged.  If the answer is no, the employee is less engaged. 

That question makes sense for some employees, but it’s ridiculous for others.  Suppose you’re a tech geek.  You work at Google.  Is your employer viewed as one of the best places to work for people in your field?  Sure!  Tech people would die for a job at Google!

Suppose you’re a tech geek.  You work at the law firm of Bigg & Mediocre.  Is your employer viewed as one of the best places to work for people in your field?  Of course not.  Why would a tech geek go to work at Bigg & Mediocre?  Any rational person knows that Bigg & Mediocre is not one of the great places for tech geeks to work.

That doesn’t mean that it’s nuts for a tech geek to go to work for B&M.  The tech geek may be making a lifestyle choice.  The tech geek may have family in a city where B&M is located, but Google is not.  The tech geek might be perfectly happy — fabulously engaged — at B&M.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But a standard engagement survey is likely to show that employees are less engaged if employees honestly — and intelligently — answer that their employer is not a destination of choice for people in their field.

Here’s another question you’ll find on engagement surveys:  “Do you often talk about the possibility of finding a job with another employer?”

All managers worth their salt know that competent managers discuss other jobs with their direct reports:  “What’s your career path here?  Do we offer what you want?  If we don’t, or if there’s no chance of following your chosen path at this firm, where will you find a job that thrills you?  Let’s talk about other places where you might prefer to work.”

That’s honest.  That’s helpful.  There’s surely no shame in having that discussion.

But heaven forbid the employee fills out the engagement survey by saying, “I speak occasionally with my supervisor about leaving this firm.”  The employee’s not engaged!  And the supervisor is complicit!  What the heck’s going on in this joint?  Let’s fix the problem!

[Procrustean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes) engagement surveys might not work. 

The surveys must also not be subject to abuse.  For example, a manager might tell one of his direct reports:  “I know you haven’t yet filled out the engagement survey.  Please log on to the computer now, go into the survey, and complete the survey while I stand here, watching over your shoulder, to see what you say.  Remember that my compensation depends, in part, on whether people who report to me are engaged.” 

Or:  “Why don’t you log into the engagement survey and then go grab a cup of coffee?  I’ll fill out your survey for you while you’re gone.  Come back in a half hour.” 

Or:  “There’s only 85 percent engagement of people working on my team!?!  That’s outrageous!  You should all be engaged!  One hundred percent! I know these surveys are supposed to be anonymous, but I’m going to ask HR to tell me who’s not engaged.  If HR won’t answer that question, I’ll find another way to break anonymity.  I’ll ask for one report that categorizes employees by region, one that categorizes employees by age, one that categorizes employees by sex, and one that groups everyone together.  All of those reports will be anonymous, but I’m sure I can crack the anonymity by putting those reports next to each other and analyzing the results.  I’m going to figure out who’s not engaged and punish that person!” 

I’m all in favor of improving employees’ job satisfaction.  But make sure you’re measuring the actual engagement of employees who have not been coerced .

The final day I walked out of my New York City firm I had no idea that I was leaving Biglaw. I had already accepted an offer to work at a [Houston based firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/09/why-houston-is-hot-a-conversation-with-bakerhostetlers-sameer-mohan/) that, by every indication, had a healthier work-life balance and asked their associates to bring in business — values that I placed at a premium.

But two months before moving to Houston, this little start-up idea that had been nagging me for some time just wouldn’t go away. I had been in this situation once before. During my senior year of college, I started performing in stand-up comedy clubs across NYC, but after a year of hanging around waiting for Jim Gaffigan to cancel so I could ten minutes on stage, free drinks and $20, I decided to throw in the towel. I was having a blast, but going pro seemed like a lot of work (and a lot of RISK) with a slim chance of reward. Fast forward two years later during on-campus interviews — stand-up comedy was the ONLY thing partners wanted to ask me about. I still WINCE (even shudder) just thinking about it, but one partner from Cooley actually had me get up and perform my routine like some trained seal (forgive me Cooley, but you deserve it, and just be glad I’m not naming names). But every partner who interviewed me wanted to know, “Why did you leave stand-up?”

I always had to sheepishly admit that, when it came to stand-up, some part of me always wondered “what if?” What if I had stayed the course? So, when it came to [ReplyAll](http://www.replyall.me), I decided I just wouldn’t be caught looking back thinking “what if?”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So I called the firm in Houston and told them I would be declining the offer. But, as it turns out, that also would NOT be the day I left law; it was only the day I thought I left law.

You see, it occurred to me recently that, for a guy who left law for a start-up that had no specific connection to legal, I sure do spend a lot of time with lawyers. Not only do I [write for ATL](https://abovethelaw.com/author/zachabramowitz), but many of our customers are legal tech and services companies. Most of my phone calls and meetings are with in-house counsels, legal software companies and (more recently) law firm CIOs and CMOs (btw, if you haven’t scheduled a call with me, what are you waiting for?). In fact, someone on my team pointed out to me recently that over 40% of the content created through ReplyAll can be categorized as legal. When this all dawned on me, I felt like Michael Corleone “Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in.” But the truth is that, four years after trying walking away from law, I couldn’t be more excited that I never left.

Okay, but why does this matter to YOU?

The head of career services at a top ten law school once told me that so many of her law students would tell her that they wanted to use their legal degree to open doors in business, which was basically code for “NOT law.” But the problem, she explained to me, was that while she knew how to place students in legal positions, the path from law to business was murky at best. And not a week goes by that I don’t receive an email from a lawyer asking me about leaving law for start-ups. And as I’ve noted before, there are a number of Biglaw attorneys who have founded successful start-ups that have zero to do with legal. But the point I’d like to emphasize is that you don’t have to leave law if you want to work with an exciting or disruptive company.

You can leave law for law.

Now is such an exciting time for lawyers who want to do something other than work at a law firm or go in-house. Sam Altman, the president of [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com) has told me that their fund, unlike many in Silicon Valley, continues to invest in disruptive legal companies like [Casetext](http://Casetext.com), [Ross](http://www.rossintelligence.com/) and [Willing](http://Willing.com) because it’s a space that excites them. [Laura Safdie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurasafdie), the COO of Casetext told me recently why she left a lucrative position with Simpson Thacher’s New York City office to join the Silicon Valley company:

I really enjoyed my practice; I worked with brilliant litigators at an excellent firm and had a pro bono practice I was passionate about. But it’s hard to pass up an opportunity to effect change on a wider scale. Improving access to legal information will help lawyers and clients alike, and I’m excited to be part of that.

[Michael Delgado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-delgado-41abb579), who left Cravath to become general counsel at Willing and one of the members of the founding team, thinks lawyers can be effective inside of growth companies.

It’s empowering to no longer see the universe of career possibilities as big law, finance, or consulting. There’s this whole other, way bigger world of people doing all sorts of things and doing extremely well for themselves. And I’d put my lawyer friends up against any of them. It just takes letting go of the comforts of being with a big institution.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This doesn’t mean that you have to join an early stage start-up, it doesn’t even mean you have to join a tech company.

If I were still working at a law firm today, and assuming I had normal risk appetite (which, admittedly, I do not), I would be looking at opportunities with [Axiom](http://Axiomlaw.com) (full disclosure: a customer of ours) and [Dentons](http://Dentons.com), which is anything but an ordinary law firm, as well as tech companies like Casetext or [Kira Systems](http://kirasystems.com) that have demonstrated proven traction and a rocket ship trajectory. Now, it’s true that some growth companies stay away from hiring attorneys. But my experience is that many of these companies are looking for lawyers, and even the ones that stay away from hiring lawyers are trying to steer clear of excessively “lawyery” lawyers. If you’re the kind of outside the box go-getter who happens to have a J.D. and understands how lawyers think and operate, you might be a real asset for some of these companies.

Are you a disruptive legal company that’s looking to hire awesome lawyers in 2017 and get the word out? Are you a lawyer who’s looking to leave law for law? Email me or [Tweet at me](http://twitter.com/zachabramowitz) and let me know about it. I’d love to help play match-maker.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has long been one of the most attractive platforms for lawyers seeking a stint in public service. The agency offers high-profile work and generous salaries, at least by government standards. When it comes time to join the private sector, SEC attorneys generally have appealing options. That’s true now more than ever: as enforcement actions rise and the SEC extends its reach into new domains, law firm demand for attorneys with SEC experience is booming.

Unprecedented SEC rule-making activity

Bloomberg columnist [Matt Levine](https://twitter.com/matt_levine) frequently observes that “everything is securities fraud.” He’s joking, but only barely. The insight is that holding a company liable for failing to disclose socially undesirable behavior to the market is substantially easier for a plaintiff’s lawyer than winning a suit over the underlying conduct. Securities regulation has morphed into our default vehicle for deterring corporate malfeasance and encouraging “good” behavior, regardless of how attenuated the conduct is from traditional financial metrics.

Under Chairman Gary Gensler’s leadership, the SEC has pressed ahead with extending its reach into new frontiers, most strikingly through the [proposed climate-related risk disclosure rules](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11042.pdf). If the extensive proposed disclosure obligations take effect, public companies will face a range of novel compliance challenges on which legal advice will be essential. Law firms offering counsel from former SEC officials who played a role in the rule-making process will be in a strong position to capitalize.

Another notable area of expanded SEC rule-making is the [proposed new rules](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33-11048.pdf) in relation to special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Regulating disclosures for SPAC IPOs and mergers is perhaps a less ambitious project than the climate risks proposal, but it will still represent a business development opportunity for law firms.

Greater demand for SEC enforcement defense and ESG advice

Some major firms tell me client demand for SEC enforcement defense is up as much as fifty percent. They attribute this increase to a substantial uptick in SEC enforcement actions, combined with the agency’s expansion of its enforcement priorities, especially in relation to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) matters. For example, the SEC recently [secured a settlement](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-86) from BNY Mellon Investment Adviser over alleged misstatements regarding how BNY Mellon mutual funds incorporated ESG factors into the investment selection process.

Firm clients are also seeking out more advisory and counseling services involving ESG. Sidley, Kirkland, and Latham are examples of the many firms expanding their ESG-related practices. With Blackrock CEO Larry Fink predicting that the next 1,000 “unicorns” will be sustainable companies focused on decarbonization and the energy transition, the outlook for ESG counseling work is bright.

The SEC’s expanding role in crypto regulation

Regulation of the crypto sector is less broadly relevant than ESG rules, but it is worth highlighting as an area of growing focus for the SEC. Crypto companies have been pushing the SEC to provide the sector with more concrete guidance, an invitation the agency has largely rebuffed thus far. Instead, the SEC has concentrated on expanding its enforcement capabilities, [announcing](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-78) in May that it was nearly doubling the size of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit in its Division of Enforcement. As enforcement actions ramp up, there will be demand not just for defense but also for advice on complying with the emerging standards.

The value of SEC expertise

The more active the SEC becomes, the more law firm clients will value the knowledge and expertise that former SEC officials bring to the table. Law firms sometimes hesitate to bring on partners directly from government posts because those attorneys do not have immediately portable business. However, last year’s record law firm profits, combined with steadily increasing client demand in this area, will mitigate business development concerns.

For SEC officials and senior attorneys looking to make the transition from government to private practice, now is the ideal time.

# Stat Of The Week: Dubious ROI In A Booming Lateral Partner Market
## There is increasing doubt about the efficacy of a law firm growth strategy based on lateral partner acquisitions.

According to a survey conducted by [ALM Legal Intelligence](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202747504110/The-Big-Law-Lateral-Hiring-Frenzy-Continues#ixzz3zyom5w59), the Biglaw lateral partner market is booming. Lateral partner movement increased 5.6 percent over 2014, and is up about 43.5 percent compared to the post-recession low of 2010. However, despite the fact that adding lateral partners and their books of business remains the main law firm growth strategy, there is increasing doubt about its efficacy. Respondents to the survey reported that 30 percent of lateral partner candidates delivered less than half their expected book of business, while about one-fifth percent realized only between 51 percent and 75 percent of expected billings. A mere 28 percent exceeded expectations. Furthermore, as [Steven Harper](http://thelawyerbubble.com/2016/02/03/big-law-leaders-perpetuating-mistakes/) notes, “The cultural impact of aggressive inorganic growth is not susceptible to measurement, so it gets ignored in the prevailing law-firm-as-a-business model. But there are plenty of recent examples of the potentially catastrophic costs. Just look at Howrey, Dewey, and Bingham McCutchen — three recent collapses on the heels of stunning lateral growth spurts.”

# Hocus-Pocus! Biglaw Firm Casts Spell And Makes Higher Salaries Magically Appear

Abracadabra! We know this firm is trying to escape its Magic Circle designation, but the money ring that is the Biglaw raise race is the only magic circle its associates care about right now. Freshfields just announced a salary increase on top of bonuses for its U.S. associates, and they’re delighted.

We’ve now confirmed that Freshfields — a firm that brought in $2,276,264,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 17 in the most recent Global 200 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see in January 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016+ – $435,000
Freshfields is also matching the Cravath bonus scale, and their year-end bonuses will be paid on December 29, 2023:

- Class of 2023 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016+ – $115,000
Congratulations to everyone at Freshfields!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

Last spring, while tending my garden, I stumbled upon something unexpected. While digging a new flowerbed, my shovel hit a hard object. Curiosity piqued, I carefully unearthed what turned out to be an old, rusted coin. This accidental discovery led me on an exciting journey of garden archaeology, uncovering more hidden artifacts in my backyard.

This experience mirrors the process of identifying AI automation opportunities in legal work streams — a careful exploration to uncover hidden potential.

Much like my initial, accidental discovery in the garden, the first step in integrating AI into legal workflows often starts with an unexpected realization. It could be noticing a repetitive task that consumes excessive time or a process bottleneck that consistently causes delays.

Recognizing Repetition And Time-Consumption

Just as I noticed patterns in my garden — like weeds popping up repeatedly — identifying repetitive and time-consuming tasks in legal work is the first step. It’s like finding artifacts in different corners of the garden.

Much like a keen gardener assessing the richness of the soil in different patches, evaluating the frequency of tasks helps identify potential automation gold mines.

The AI Automation Discovery Process: Legal Archaeology At Its Finest

Document Review And Analysis

Much like buried artifacts, legal documents can be unearthed with AI’s help. Document review is a prime candidate for automation, just like discovering similar objects in one garden area.

Sifting through legal databases is a treasure hunt. It requires methodical exploration, much like my detailed sections in the garden.

Contract Management

Managing contracts is like handling fragile finds — especially in tracking renewals and compliance. AI can significantly streamline these processes.

Evaluating AI Suitability: Digging Deeper

Assessing Complexity And Uniqueness

Just as delicate artifacts need human handling, some legal tasks are too complex or unique for AI. It’s all about finding the right balance.

Data Availability And Quality

The success of AI implementation depends on the quality and availability of data, much like successful gardening relies on good soil conditions.

Legal And Ethical Considerations

Respecting ethical and legal boundaries is crucial. AI in legal work must adhere to standards, just as my garden archaeology followed local regulations.

Implementing AI Automation: Nurturing The Seeds Of Change

Pilot Programs

Just as I started my garden exploration in a small patch, introducing AI through pilot programs helps test the waters, beginning with areas like document review.

Feedback And Adjustment

Regular feedback is key — it’s like adjusting my digging techniques based on what I find and how the garden responds.

Scaling Up

As confidence in AI tools grows, expand their use to other areas. It’s like extending my archaeological efforts to different parts of the garden.

Overcoming Challenges: Taming The Legal Wild For A Garden Of Opportunities Blooms

The journey isn’t all sunshine and roses. Team resistance is like the initial hesitation to disturb my garden’s peace. Technical hiccups with AI tools are the days I find nothing interesting in the garden. Yet, persistence and a willingness to learn and adapt are the heroes in both scenarios.

Today, my garden boasts a small display of treasures, each telling a unique story. Similarly, a legal practice can thrive with AI integration, streamlining processes, and uncovering efficiencies. Identifying AI opportunities is a journey of discovery, evaluation, and careful cultivation. It’s about recognizing the potential, assessing viability, and nurturing it to fruition. The rewards, whether historical artifacts or enhanced efficiency in legal work, are well worth the effort. So, fellow legal archaeologists, let’s keep digging and uncover those hidden AI treasures!

# Biglaw Firm Raises Associate Salaries -- But Only If Associates Are Billing Machines
## Will associates get a raise? Depends on what their hours look like.

You’d think that a firm raising salaries would be a good thing, greeted with jubilation. But when Katten Muchin Rosenman raised associate salaries this week, associates caught the fine print, and the ones we’ve talked to are not happy with the firm.

As you’re probably aware, this [summer, associate raises and special bonuses have swept through Biglaw. ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2018-associate-salary-increase/)So, it wasn’t surprising that Katten wanted to get in on the action, and be able to say they offer associates the new hotness, as seen by this compensation scale:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This seems standard, even if there is a little compression right at the top of the scale (the majority of other firms raising salaries have a separate break out for the class of 2010 at $340,000). But it was this addition to the scale that pissed off most people:

To receive the new base salaries, associates must be providing client service up to our standards of quality and efficiency and be on an annualized pace to meet our minimum hours requirements. For those associates who are not currently on pace to meet the hours requirements, but complete the year on or over pace, we will pay a bonus to ensure that all associates on or over pace by the end of the year have the benefit of the higher salary.

Ummm, da fuq? Base compensation being tied to billing targets is a completely crappy plan. Remember, these raises amount to [only slightly more than a cost of living adjustment](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/), having that tied to the increasingly archaic billable hour standard seems harsh. And Katten tipsters have let us know just how bad they think this idea is. Complaints are pouring in, angry over the lack of clarity the firm has provided:

Please report on how underwhelming these raises are, and how it’s totally unclear what happens to you if you do not meet hours this year but do the following year, or vice versa, or regarding any details whatsoever.

Pissed that most other peer firms don’t have that requirement ([Mayer Brown](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/looks-whos-coming-to-play-at-the-compensation-party/?rf=1) and [Fenwick](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/technology-firm-adopts-new-salary-scale/?rf=1) are the only other firms to have similar requirements, though those programs are slightly different):

Lots of reaching out to recruiters because we thought we were at a different level of firm than this…

To indiscriminate anger over the whole situation:

Katten only raises if you met an hour threshold. Lots of angry people.

Oh, and just for an extra little bit of salt in that wound, the firm will not be offering [special summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) like so many of their peer firms.

# The Surprising Cities Where The Legal Sector Is Booming
## The growing pull of non-traditional markets.

One of the consequences of the new normal where every market pays like Cravath — for some reason — is that unlikely legal markets are booming. If you could make New York money with decidedly non-New York real estate, it’s hard to pass up.

A new study from real estate services firm CBRE, [featured in the American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/09/27/atlanta-austin-lead-way-in-job-opportunities-for-lawyers-legal-staff/), confirms that trend — it’s time for lawyers to expand their horizons:

Atlanta was home to 16.3 percent more lawyers in 2017 than two years earlier, labor market data compiled by CBRE showed. That growth was over four percentage points more than the runner-up, Los Angeles, where lawyer head count grew at 11.9 percent. Other cities with double-digit growth included Kansas City, Austin and San Francisco. The national average was 3 percent.

But while Atlanta may be hauling in the lawyers of today, the study suggests the market of tomorrow may be further west:

Looking at the wider category of legal services, Austin added jobs at an 11.1 percent clip, while Atlanta was second at 8.3 percent. Phoenix, Detroit and Dallas/Fort Worth rounded out the top five, all growing between 4 percent and 5 percent. The national average was 1.5 percent.

“Austin is a really interesting story, from a lot of perspectives. If you look at why law firms are growing where they are, it’s clear that they’re following business services in general,” said Julie Whelan, head of occupier research for the Americas at CBRE.

This logic is sound, but only if you assume the startup boom in Austin will behave like the booms of yesteryear. When new companies cropped up in the ’90s, lawyers needed to flock to where the business was. In an age of robust telecommunication technology, will the Austin startup still require the personal touch, or will they be content with a lawyer a time zone over?

Some firms are already banking on old habits dying hard. Reed Smith and Shearman & Sterling have both boosted their presence in Austin this year.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Whether or not this pays off for Biglaw over the long haul, what’s clear today is that any young lawyer looking to maximize their take should be considering non-traditional markets. Per [Bankrate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/moving-cost-of-living-calculator.aspx), the cost of living in Austin is almost 7.5 percent lower than Manhattan, while the cost of living in the Atlanta area is a whopping 56 percent lower. If you have any connection to either city or a burning desire to make a home there, why are you still looking in Manhattan?

Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro to become a SCOTUS repeater? On June 20, 2016, after oral argument exactly two months before, the [U.S. Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourt.gov) issued [a 6-to-2 decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-415_mlho.pdf) remanding this case for further proceedings in the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit](http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov).

Today. a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit issued [this decision](http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/01/09/13-55323.pdf) on remand. The first paragraph of the “Conclusion” section of today’s Ninth Circuit’s decision begins:

After a thorough, de novo review of congressional intent, we hold that the exemption in sec. 213(b)(10)(A) does not encompass service advisors. We acknowledge that our holding conflicts with published decisions by the Fourth and Fifth Circuits and by the Supreme Court of Montana.

The odds of this case’s becoming a SCOTUS repeater would appear to be very high.

Access today’s Order List of the [U.S. Supreme Court](http://www.supremecourt.gov): At [this link](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/010917zor_c07d.pdf). The Court did not grant review in any new cases, but the Court did call for the views of the Solicitor General’s office in four cases. In addition, the Court dismissed the direct appeal in Parrott v. Lamone, No. 16-588, “for want of jurisdiction.”

In White v. Pauly, No. 16-67. the Court issued [a unanimous per curiam decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-67_2c8f.pdf). Justice Ginsburg issued a concurring opinion.

# One Year After Its Last Merger, Top Biglaw Firm Looks For New Merger Partner
## More mergers means more money.

You’d think that completing one major merger would be enough for a top Am Law firm, but apparently the saying “new year, new you” applies to Biglaw firms too. Look out, world, because it looks like Holland & Knight has got the urge to merge once again.

Just one year after its merger with Thompson & Knight, the Top 30 firm has its sights set on Nashville, Tennessee, where H&K is reportedly in talks with Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, a 260-lawyer firm with an incredibly successful healthcare practice. Nashville isn’t just Music City — it’s synonymous with healthcare services, too, and Waller’s burgeoning practice can’t be beat.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/20/nashvilles-waller-lansden-in-merger-talks-with-holland-knight-as-big-law-moves-to-the-music-city/) has additional details on what the Holland & Knight/Waller merger would look like financially:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
If completed, the deal would combine Nashville’s largest law firm—which earned $182.4 million last year—with the nation’s 30th largest firm by gross revenue. Following its August merger with Texas Am Law 200 firm Thompson & Knight, Holland & Knight posted $1.4 billion in revenue last year. Together, the firms would bring in $1.58 billion and climb the Am Law 100 four spots to 26th (holding all else equal), according to data from the Law.com Compass Merger Model Summary. …

The firms differ along lines of profitability and billing rates. Holland & Knight equity partners make an average of $2 million annually, compared to $1 million at Waller. Waller maintains a higher profit margin and less leverage than Holland & Knight, but its average partner compensation trails Holland & Knight’s by a quarter of a million dollars, and its revenue per lawyer is $700,000 to Holland & Knight’s $1 million. Waller posted a good year in 2021, with gross revenue up 13% and net income rising nearly 20%.

A source familiar with the deal told Am Law that “neither firm’s partnership appears to be near a consensus” at this time. It would be music to Holland & Knight’s ears if the firm were able to merge with Waller and adopt its booming healthcare practice. Stay tuned for more coverage on this prospective merger.

# Milbank Announces Bonuses: What Does That Mean For The Biglaw Compensation Leader Race?
## Bonus season is finally here!

Which Biglaw firm is the true gold standard of Biglaw compensation? That’s the kind of esoteric question we here at Above the Law spend entirely too much time contemplating. Cravath is sorta the default answer, even though [they aren’t, strictly speaking, the top of the market.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/elite-firm-destroys-the-going-market-rate-first-year-associates-pull-down-210000-in-base-compensation/) And that reputation took a further hit this year when [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) started the COVID fall bonus trend followed by [Davis Polk coming](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) over the top of that scale, while Cravath [opted to wait](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) until the end of the year. Now year-end bonuses at Cravath [have been announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/?rf=1), and while their associates will get full market scale, it’s clear they’re not about making any waves this year.

But there’s another firm that’s been making their pitch to be the compensation leader. Milbank’s the firm that [brought about the $190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), and [last year, they were the first](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) to move on year-end bonuses. So they’ve definitely proven they have what it takes to set the standard in Biglaw compensation. Now they’ve released their year-end bonuses, and well, we shouldn’t get too excited:

Yup, these are the bonuses we expected, on the same scale as last year’s (and the year before’s too). But, considering the freaking pandemic — [and those fun COVID appreciation bonuses folks at Milbank got back in the fall](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/) — we imagine associates are pretty happy. Year-end bonuses will be paid on or before December 31st, and you can read [the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/milbank-bonuses-2/2/).

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The industry saw a positive end in 2023. The positives are that the industry shows a return to profit growth, and moderation in those demand declines we’ve been reporting throughout the year.

We are optimistic that ‘24 will be a better year than ‘23. I say that because of the continued performance of practice areas that drove demand last year together with the anticipated rebound in transactional practices.

— Gretta Rusanow, managing director and head of law firm advisory services at Citi’s Global Wealth at Work Law Firm Group, in comments noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2024/02/09/law-firms-witnessed-a-return-to-profit-growth-in-2023/) on law firms’ financial performance in 2023, and looking ahead to their performance in 2024. According to Citi, last year, law firms increased average revenues by 6.1% in 2023, while profits per equity partner grew by 6.6%.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Trust What Clients Say, But Verify
## Although you can't spell 'client' without 'lie,' many times, the problem isn't intentional deception, just miscommunication.

I once interned for a judge who had a coffee mug that had “Everybody Lies” printed in bold black font on its side. The judge never brought the mug into the courthouse when we were on trial, but during motion days when just lawyers were in the courtroom, the judge liked to bring the mug with him, perhaps to ensure that the attorneys in the courtroom were as candid as possible. Most lawyers would not be surprised to hear that clients are sometimes less than truthful with their lawyers. This can make it difficult for lawyers to do their jobs, and although attorneys should generally trust what a client says, they should do everything they can to make sure that statements made by clients are accurate.

One of the biggest reasons why clients might lie to their attorneys is since they believe lawyers would not want to take a case if the client was completely forthcoming with counsel. I once interacted with a client who did not tell three prior lawyers that he signed a release presumably waiving claims related to the lawsuit the client wished to file. Each of the prior lawyers dumped the client once they found out about the release. I counseled the client to just be forthcoming about the release with the next attorney, and this candor convinced the lawyer to take the case. Since both the client and attorney were on the same page about the release, they had a strategy to handle the matter, and the case eventually resolved on favorable terms as if the release never existed.

Sometimes, clients are not forthcoming since it can also impact fee arrangements surrounding a given representation. Earlier in my career, I decided to take a case on a partial contingency basis since my investigation of the claims made me believe that there could be a significant recovery in the matter. I later discovered that the defendant had significant claims of their own against my client that were not fully disclosed to me prior to taking the case. I essentially had to offer the client a “free” defense of these claims, and I barely got anything from the contingency portion of the fee arrangement when everything was said and done — a lesson I will not soon forget.

In other instances, clients simply do not understand that they need to disclose something, and this can lead to issues in the representation. For example, I once worked on a case in which my client needed to produce a bunch of records about the people who worked for the client during a given time. The client produced records for a number of workers, and we represented that these materials were all the records we had that were responsive to the need to produce records.

I later discovered that my client only provided documents related to people that were classified as employees and did not produce documents related to people the client had classified as independent contractors. This mix up might have simply been a result of miscommunication between my client and me. Nevertheless, it was only after I verified the information and materials that the client provided that I was able to determine that we needed to produce additional materials.

Sometimes, clients will not tell their lawyers the whole truth because they are embarrassed about a matter or do not want to disclose issues that may be exploited by the other side. One time, I was deposing a plaintiff who claimed that he sustained an injury while riding his motorcycle. Like any good insurance defense lawyer, I pulled all of the medical records, and I discovered that at one point, the plaintiff disclosed to his health care provider that he was injured falling down his own stairs. If I could prove that the plaintiff was injured at home, it would basically eliminate any liability in this case.

I confronted the plaintiff with this information at his deposition, and it was clear that the plaintiff’s lawyer had no idea that this inconsistency existed. If the lawyer had pulled his clients medical records beforehand, he would have known for himself that a problem existed with his case, but by trusting his client, the lawyer walked in a difficult situation. Ever since this episode, I have tried my best to pull all relevant records when verifying a client’s claims rather than taking a client’s words for it.

All told, clients often do not intentionally misrepresent matters to their lawyers, and I am not saying clients can never be trusted. However, there are numerous reasons why clients may be less than completely transparent with counsel so lawyers should try to verify information provided by a client.

John Pierce

I would say within five to seven years we’re going to replace Quinn Emanuel as the next dominant global litigation firm, no question.

— [John Pierce](https://www.piercebainbridge.com/john-m-pierce/), managing partner of litigation boutique Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht, [boasting about his firm’s future](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/08/02/is-this-the-fastest-growing-firm-in-big-law/). Pierce, a former K&L Gates partner who left the firm in 2016 after being there for just four months, also claims that his firm is the “fastest-growing law firm in the history of the world in terms of law firms that have started from absolute scratch.” For what it’s worth, Pierce says he’s “often accused of hyperbole.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Above the Law 'Power 100' Law Firm Rankings Are Out
## Looks like we can actually measure how little people respect Jones Day now.

It’s a little bit late this year, but today we can release our law firm rankings. The ATL Power 100 measures which firms talented people want to work at, and this year, we can report that pretty much nobody wants to work at Jones Day anymore.

Jones Day has decided to take the plunge as the Biglaw firm most associated with President Donald Trump. Don McGahn, a Jones Day partner, took on the job of White House Counsel. The firm was quick and eager to associate itself with the new administration in advertising during 2017.

These decision have consequences. Maybe clients like feeling like they are represented by a firm associated with Trump. But lawyers? No. Lawyers don’t want anything to do the firm.

Jones Day fell 33 spots in our rankings, year-over-year, from #18 to #51. Jones Day declined in every objective data point we measured. But the objective points are only half of the methodology. The other half is a reputation survey, and that’s where Jones Day got stuffed in a locker and ridiculed by all the cool kids.

If you are a Jones Day lawyer who wonders if your friends make fun of you behind your back, the answer appears to be “yes.” A lot. Like, they’re not laughing with you.

Overall, there was a bit of volatility in this year’s edition. Last year’s #1, Cravath, fell to #7. Kirkland dropped six spots. Davis Polk rocketed up 16 spots. The law firms moved around.

But Jones Day got hammered. It must be tough on the recruiting trails for them. Donald Trump really does wreck the reputation of every single thing he touches.

As far as we know, Squire Patton Boggs, the Biglaw firm which had a “strategic alliance” with Donald Trump’s lawyer/fixer [Michael Cohen](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/michael-cohen/), is not under investigation by the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, or any other body. But that doesn’t mean that the pressure isn’t mounting on the firm.

Sure, [we know](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/the-biglaw-firms-potentially-caught-in-the-cohen-raid/) they are trying to [distance themselves](http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/386964-law-firm-that-worked-with-cohen-says-it-was-unaware) from the dumpster fire that is Cohen, saying:

At all times, Cohen maintained his independence, was not an employee of the firm, and did not maintain files or bill clients through the firm.

But the [revelations that have come to light](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/latham-lawyer-executes-kevin-bacon-esque-all-is-well-in-wake-of-bombshell-michael-cohen-report/) about Cohen’s shell company, Essential Consultants, and the money [collected from big-name companies](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/hiring-michael-cohen-was-a-big-mistake/) for access and insights into the Trump administration have cast a pall on the Biglaw firm. [This weekend on the MSNBC show](http://www.msnbc.com/am-joy/watch/michael-cohen-reportedly-received-millions-at-t-more-1231894595806) [AM Joy,](http://www.msnbc.com/am-joy/watch/michael-cohen-reportedly-received-millions-at-t-more-1231894595806) Stormy Daniels’s attorney, [Michael Avenatti](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti), specifically called for an investigation into the relationship between Squire Patton Boggs and Cohen.

He began, and also tweeted, by noting the unusual relationship between the Biglaw firm and Cohen. Cohen [doesn’t have anywhere close to good enough](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/clown-lawyer-michael-cohen-gonna-learn-today/) academic or legal bona fides to get his foot in the door at the firm — even if they don’t classify him as as employee — in any timeline save this darkest one where Donald Trump is the U.S. President. Avenatti also pointed to the money that connects the firm to the activities of Cohen. No, Cohen was never a registered lobbyist, but that sure feels like the closest description to explain how he collected so much money from companies.

Squire Patton Boggs hiring/working with Mr. Cohen makes no sense. That firm usually only hires and works with the most highly educated, competent lawyers. We know of money flowing between EC, LLC & the law firm. They need to come clean & release ALL of the details re: Mr. Cohen.

On AM Joy, Avenatti speculated that the reason Squire Patton Boggs cultivated a relationship with Cohen was to supplement their well-known lobbying business. (Yes, Avenatti refers to the firm [by its pre-merger name](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/05/say-hello-to-squire-patton-boggs/), but we all know the firm he means.)

What did Michael Cohen sell to Patton Boggs as it related to the idea that they were going to allow Michael Cohen come to the law firm? It’s pretty clear to me what he sold them. What he sold them was a book of clients, a book of corporations or individuals that had already retained him for access to the U.S. president.

Given the questionable status of Cohen’s activities (and the amount of cash being funneled in, out, and around his shell company), Avenatti believes the Biglaw firm “needs to be investigated”:

That needs to be the next inquiry, what did Patton Boggs know, and when did they know it? Did they know that Michael Cohen was lobbying? Did they not know it?

Then came the exchange that should strike fear into the heart (do Biglaw firms have hearts?) of Squire Patton Boggs. Given Avenatti’s propensity for having the inside scoop on all things Cohen-related (don’t forget, he was the one who exposed the financial dealings of Essential Consultants), Joy Reid asked him if he already knew the answer to the questions he was asking about the Biglaw firm. He replied:

In this free white paper, our friends at Philips Dictation dispel these and other myths about dictation, and note why you don’t want to miss out on latest voice technology in your law practice.

# It Might Not Seem Like It, But Work-Life Balance Is Possible For Young Lawyers
## The struggle of the juggle is real, but there are ways to help yourself before helping others.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The legal profession is challenging, and young lawyers often find themselves navigating demanding job expectations filled with long hours, stress and overwhelming responsibilities. As you embark on the long journey of becoming a successful attorney, it is important to remember that nobody expects you to be able to “do it all,” and you certainly do not have to “do it all” alone. While navigating the start of your bright legal career, do not forget to take a step back and enjoy the moment, go on a well-deserved vacation, consider adopting a pet (or two!), and make time to spend with loved ones. After all, success in the legal profession does not need to come at the expense of your well-being and sanity.

— An excerpt from an article written by ALM’s Young Lawyer Editorial Board, offering useful tips on [how lawyers can “balance the scales”](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2024/02/22/balancing-the-scales-a-young-attorneys-guide-to-excelling-personally-and-professionally/) by taking care of themselves first, so that they can better take care of others, including members of their family, their children, and last but certainly not least, their clients.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Fried After A Long Week
## Associates with high hours can get above-market bonuses.

Fried Frank, that is. Sorry for the terrible pun, but there are only so many ways to write up a bonus announcement. And apologies if you’re getting tired of our [stock photos of money](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-23-sexiest-stock-images-of-money/).

These announcements haven’t been very surprising, but the [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/fried-frank/) announcement is especially unsurprising. It is fully consistent with the [2016 bonus policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/associate-bonus-watch-fried-frank-announces-a-new-bonus-policy/?rf=1) that the firm unveiled in October 2015. The core of that policy: a “full” aka market bonus at 2000 hours (including up to 425 hours of certain non-billable work), and bonuses 15 to 30 percent above market at the 2200- and 2450-hour marks, respectively. We’ve posted the full memo, from chairman [David Greenwald](http://www.friedfrank.com/?pageID=42&itemID=1512), on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-fried-after-a-long-week/2/).

Recite it together with me: when your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

UPDATE (4:48 p.m.): A source at FFHSJ had this to add: “Hours vary by practice group. Not everybody can hit their goal. Law students should be aware that top-tier firms do not have an hours requirement.”

UPDATE (12/5/2016, 9:45 a.m.): A different source had this rebuttal:

Hey! Saw your Fried Frank update with the passive aggressiveness for law students. FF allows people to add a whopping 425 non-billables. Super-generous. Our corporate and real estate and tax groups barely need it, with averages around 1950-2000 and most associates going well over. Litigation whines because they bill 1400-1500 and can’t swing a bonus even with a 425 handicap. The group is a drain on the firm, and associates leaving at 4-5 p.m. want an extra up to $100k? Please. RE and Corporate earned their bonuses and are carrying Lit on their shoulders just like every other year.

# The Irresistible Urge To Lie
## Why isn't the truth at least the default position?

The liars politicians were at it again last week.

The United States said that it absolutely would not provide tanks to Ukraine. The U.S. tanks — the Abrams — were too hard to keep in service, got too few miles to the gallon, and otherwise weren’t fit for the conditions in Ukraine.

Then, Germany said that it would not provide tanks (or consent to the provision of tanks) unless the U.S. also provided tanks.

On Wednesday, the United States [switched its position](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/1942768601036019439#) and agreed to provide the tanks.

When the government was asked why it had changed its position, the change supposedly had nothing to do with Germany’s demand. What had supposedly changed between last week — when the American tanks were useless — and this week — when the American tanks were great? The White House spokesperson said the “facts on the ground” had changed.

That’s manifestly ridiculous. The “facts on the ground” in Ukraine had not changed over the weekend in a way that made unfit tanks fit. The spokesperson is lying; we know that he’s lying; the White House is losing credibility; why is the White House doing this?

Why not respond with the truth? We wanted tanks to go to Ukraine. For its own political reasons, Germany wouldn’t send tanks unless the United States also agreed to send tanks. So we did.

Why’s the truth such a bad explanation?

What’s the killer follow-up question that makes the White House resist speaking the truth?

Maybe this is the follow-up: “Aha! You admit it! The United States was coerced by its own ally, Germany, to provide tanks! Gotcha!”

But what’s the “gotcha”? I have disagreements with my wife or my kids. To resolve those disputes, sometimes I agree to do something that I originally wouldn’t have done, and sometimes my wife or kids agree to do something that they wouldn’t originally have done. That’s not exactly coercion; I’d call it “accommodating people whom you love.” Is that so bad?

Why isn’t the truth at least the default position? This could be the rule: The government can lie, but only if there’s a reason to lie.

But the truth does not appear to be the default position. You see this even in corporate America. The company had a bad quarter. The company announces earnings. The stock drops three bucks in one trading session. The next week, someone asks the CEO (at a public event) why we had such a bad quarter. The answer is almost inevitably an obvious lie: “We didn’t have a bad quarter. We made investments for the future that the market didn’t understand. We’re now positioned for five years of growth!” Or: “We didn’t have a bad quarter. The analysts interpreted the drop in revenue to be a bad thing, but our EPS, unlike our revenue, actually increased. We had a great quarter!”

Then why’d the stock price drop?

The CEO is lying; we know that he’s lying; the C-suite is losing credibility; why do this?

Wouldn’t people understand (as common sense tells them) that the company missed on some metric in the quarter just passed, but the company hopes and expects to do better in the future?

I have an idea:

Let’s add an employee in the White House and all corporate C-suites. We’ll call that employee the “truth-speaker.” We won’t pay him very much. Whenever anything happens that causes the people in charge to start ginning up obvious lies, the employee’s one duty will be to whisper: “Why would speaking the truth be so bad?”

Maybe that would help.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Notes From A Legal Binge (Part II)
## Legal technology has gone from something that no one cared about to one of the industry's most important sectors -- and the conversation continues to mature.

Last month, I released Part I of my [Notes From A Legal Industry Binge](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/notes-from-a-legal-industry-binge-part-i/), my key takeaways from an October spent attending legal industry events and meeting with insiders and industry leaders. Because my takeaways take about two weeks to form, I found myself putting the final touches on Binge Part I while sitting on the tarmac ready to embark on my November pilgrimage to Park City, Utah, for the [NetDocuments](https://www.netdocuments.com/) annual user conference [ndElevate](http://ndelevate/) (disclosure: NetDocuments covered my travel costs and put me up in the super-posh Stein Eriksen Lodge). That conference, along with an early December trip to meet with GCs and law firm folks in the tri-state area, turned out to be just as binge-worthy. Binge Part II is best read start to finish, but here are the highlights in order of appearance, just in case you prefer to skip around:

- Making the case that 2018 was indeed the year that Biglaw struck back;
- A quick rant about the myth of the law firms sales cycles;
- A clearer picture of the new alliances between incumbents and contract review technology companies; and
- The trends I will be covering in 2019.
2018: The Year Biglaw Struck Back

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One of my biggest pet peeves is media prognosticators who love to Skip-Bayless-style remind us that their predictions from 10 months ago came true. So it is with a great sense of both trepidation and irony that I now point to yet another one of my predictions coming true (see e.g., [eDiscovery and Contract Review](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/ediscovery-meets-contract-review-live-conversation-with-heretik-ceo-charlie-connor/)). Earlier this year, I predicted that [2018 would be the year that Biglaw strikes back](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/legal-tech-in-2018-could-this-be-the-year-that-biglaw-strikes-back/) and begin getting creatively opportunistic with technology. Not only has that absolutely been the case, but recently an author over at Bloomberg Law actually wrote an article entitled, [“Biglaw Strikes Back](https://www.bna.com/big-law-strikes-n57982094509/),[”](https://www.bna.com/big-law-strikes-n57982094509/) which highlighted firms like Hogan Lovells and Dentons forming technology and consulting units to stave off the Big Four. To be honest, my prediction wasn’t all that risky — every single industry that has been disrupted by a new challenger ultimately faces the wrath of the incumbents (see e.g., Netflix losing streaming rights to your favorite shows and movies).

But for those keeping score, since my prediction, [Reed Smith launched their technology subsidiary Gravity Stack](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2018/04/24/reed-smith-enters-the-legal-technology-market-with-gravitystack-subsidiary/) which has already built and licensed several products (disclosure: I advised [Gravity Stack](http://gravitystack.com/) on the development of eDiscovery tracking tool Periscope); Keesal Young & Logan [launched Keesal Propulsion Labs in partnership with Mitratech](https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2018/08/14/us-law-firm-creates-tech-swat-team-partners-with-mitratech/); Latham and Clifford Chance [invested serious capital into Reynen Court](https://www.law.com/2018/12/14/clifford-chance-and-latham-put-money-into-app-store-for-legal-tech-396-10419/); and Chapman Cutler [sold their transaction management software Deal Rooms to NetDocuments](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2018/11/07/netdocuments-acquires-deal-platform-closing-room-from-chapman-and-cutler/) — and this is just the beginning. Reed Smith and Chapman Cutler have definitely entered into uncharted waters, but the truth is that law firms have, for years now, had teams internally — [Fish & Richardson](https://www.fr.com/careers/scientists-engineers/), [Troutman Sanders eMerge](http://tsemerge.com/), and [Cognicion LLC](http://www.cognicion.com/) come to mind — that have been building and selling technology, although typically packaged as a value add or a managed service. There is precedent for corporate legal originating products as well. IP docketing tech company [Anaqua](http://anaqua.com/) was actually started by British American Tobacco and Ford Motor Company’s legal departments before it was launched as an independent company.

For those wondering, I’m bullish on Biglaw (and incumbents more broadly) striking back again in 2019.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And, while we’re in the topic of law firms, allow me a quick rant.

I’m growing tired of all this talk (and a lot of it comes from startups and Silicon Valley funds) about the dreaded, prolonged law firm sales cycle. The ever more tired trope goes something like this, “Law firms are impossible to sell to because they don’t care about efficiency, but some corporate legal departments do,” or what [Jae Um](http://sixparsecs.com/) has termed [“because lawyers.”](https://tlpodcast.com/episode-12-jae-um-on-the-new-normal-for-biglaw-and-calling-bs-on-because-lawyers/)  In my conversations with NetDocuments [CTO Alvin Tedjamulia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvin-tedjamulia-a3492a12) and others in the company’s sales and marketing teams, I heard repeatedly that law firms are some of NetDocuments’ best customers and are easier to sell to than corporate legal departments. Know why this is the case? Because law firms really, really need a document management system; DMS is not a nice to have, it’s oxygen. When a law firm — or any organization for that matter — really, really needs something, the sales cycles has this way of magically shortening. Message to 90 percent of startups (even those with some traction): it’s not surprising that law firms take 12 months to decide on your product — what is surprising is that they ever say yes. So, before kvetching “because lawyers,” ask yourself the following question: is your product oxygen or hot cocoa? (End Rant)

Alliances and Exits for Large Scale Contract Review Technology Companies (LSCRTs)

Large-scale contract review technology is a mouthful, not to mention a branding train-wreck, but ANYTHING is better than using the word AI to refer to companies like [Kira](https://www.kirasystems.com/), [Heretik](http://heretik.com/), [Dilige](https://www.diligen.com/)n, [eBrevia](http://ebrevia.com/), and [Luminance](http://luminance.com/) (for more ranting against AI, check out the aforementioned [Binge Part I](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/notes-from-a-legal-industry-binge-part-i/)). So, until I come up with something catchier, I’ll be using LSCRT because, unlike AI *cringe*, it actually describes what these companies make: technology designed for reviewing a whole mess of agreements. As 2018 comes to a close, more and more LSCRTs are forming strategic alliances with incumbents. At ndElevate, I sat on a panel moderated by [Peter Buck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterbuck/) in which he and [Diligen CEO Laura van Wyngaarden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauravanwyngaarden/) announced the new strategic partnership between NetDocuments and Diligen. Following the panel, Buck told me that, “The goal of the AI marketplace, is to make it easy for CIOs to consume relevant AI solutions from trusted platform companies,” but also noted that “Kira and eBrevia [writer’s note: both available in the NetDocuments marketplace] will need a bit more NetDocuments engineering support to achieve the integration that Diligen delivers.” Diligen is not the only LSCRT forming alliances, and, in fact iManage (NetDocuments’ primary competitor) acquired RAVN in May of 2017. It’s not just DMS either — [Heretik](http://heretik.com/) has an investment from and is built on top of [Relativity](http://relativity.com/) (disclosure: Relativity was a 2017 and 2018 [ReplyAll](http://replyall.me/) sponsor), which has accelerated Heretik’s onboarding of Relativity channel partners.

Quick tangent before I get back to LSCRTs. Earlier this summer, Fastcase CEO Ed Walters told me that Dan Katz is the best speaker in legal tech ([and Ed ain’t too shabby himself](https://www.fastcase.com/blog/who-owns-the-law/)). So, having never heard Dan, I was excited to attend his talk at ndElevate and then pick his brain over lunch. Not only did Dan and each of his 50,000 slides not disappoint, but I discovered that, in addition to his academic role, he is the also CEO of [LexPredict](https://www.lexpredict.com/), itself an LSCRT. And, not to be outdone on the alliance front, [LexPredict sold to Elevate just days later](https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2018/11/15/what-the-elevate-lexpredict-deal-means-interview-with-dan-katz/) (next time give me the scoop, Dan!). Elevate is known for assembling a roster of “thought leaders” and Dan fits the bill for sure, but after speaking with [Elevate co-founder Pratik Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratikkpatel/), it is clear to me that Elevate wanted their own tool that they could sandbox and configure to their use cases. And then, not to be outdone by the not-to-be-outdoners, just before Christmas, [Donnelley Financial Solutions announced that it was acquiring eBrevia](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4229735-donnelley-financial-acquire-ebrevia-legal-ai-tech) for $19,500,000, with performance incentives that could add another $4,000,000 to the purchase price.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So just to summarize, the two biggest document management systems, the biggest eDiscovery platform, an industry leading tech enabled services provider and a publicly traded deal technology platform have created alliances, in some cases involving investments and/or acquisitions, with LSCRTs. There is much more to unpack here, but it is worth noting that Kira is noticeably absent from this list. To be fair, not having alliances is not necessarily a bad thing and, given Kira’s recent valuation, one might even argue it is a good thing. Plus, Kira is used by several service providers — most notably [Axiom](http://axiom.com/) — who pair Kira with Relativity, IS available in the NetDocuments AI marketplace, and has partnered with [Intralinks](http://intralinks.com/). But, these are integrations and partnerships, not alliances; and it will be interesting to monitor how the new alliances affect companies like Elevate, Relativity and NetDocuments, who have relationships with Kira.

The Three Legal Industry Trends I Will be Covering in 2019

To be clear, I’m not stating that these are the most important trends or the hottest trends or even the pipingest, reddest, hottest trends — they are simply the trends that I will be covering next year.

- Litigation finance and legal capital (for more on “legal capital” see [Binge Part I](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/notes-from-a-legal-industry-binge-part-i/));
- Law firms, law departments, and service providers that build and sell technology; and
- “Platformization” or “Why becoming the Force.com of legal has become the new holy grail of legal tech.”
If you or your organization are doing something promising in one of these spaces, my email is plastered all over the Internet, so feel free to get in touch. If you enjoyed Binge Part II, you might enjoy the conversations I publish with legal industry insiders; if you’d like, you can drop your email in below and get notified each time a new ReplyAll conversation gets published.

# How Generative AI Works (Part IV)
## ChatGPT isn't the only game in town.

So much has changed in the world of Generative AI since ChatGPT 3.5 was released to the public on November 30, 2022. Here are some examples:

- There are more than 100 million users of ChatGPT.
- A story went viral because a lawyer submitted fictitious court cases in a court filing as he was unaware that ChatGPT can be very convincing when it “hallucinates.”
- The legal AI pioneer and technology company Casetext was acquired for an astronomical fee.
- Many technology vendors have made announcements of features based upon ChatGPT.
For legal professionals trying to follow developments around Generative AI, all this can be mind-blowing and somewhat overwhelming. There is truly something new every day.

As we round out this series on Generative AI, let’s helicopter up a bit to look at some of the key trends to watch that will help legal professionals think more strategically about all the news.

Competition And New Entrants

ChatGPT is no longer the only burgeoning Generative AI tool on the market: many new Large Language Models (LLMs) are being made available. Just to name a few: Google has BARD and BERT. Meta has released an Open Source LLM called Llama 2.0. There is another open source product called Falcon, and Databricks released Dolley this past spring.

There is a movement toward specially trained LLMs that understand specific domains. That Generative AI will understand specific domains like engineering, medicine, or law is to be expected. Companies like [Harvey.AI](https://www.harvey.ai/) and [Alexi.com](https://alexi.com) are example of start-ups targeting legal applications with Generative AI.

In the early days of computing, companies had to rent time on a shared computer because owning a computer did not make economic sense for many corporations. This [time-sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) was popular in the 1960s and early 1970s. But in 1981, IBM introduced its first [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer) targeting individual employees at corporations.

On the Generative AI timeline, we are at a point in the technology’s evolution that is similar to the time-sharing era in the evolution of computing. OPENAI/Microsoft, Google, and Meta are the equivalent of the owners of time-share computers. It won’t take long until LLMs and Generative AI applications will enter the “personal computer” phase, when LLMs and fine-tuning techniques enable purpose-driven solutions that will make it possible for a corporation or law firm to build its own proprietary Generative AI systems.

Economic Factors

The proliferation of competitors and the pace of innovation will make Generative AI more economical, but that’s just part of the story. The availability of hardware designed for AI using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) technology will help drive costs down. Also, not every LLM application will require 175 billion parameters like ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo. Much smaller models are likely to solve for specific data sets and problems.

A decreasing cost structure and greater accessibility to LLMs is part of the equation. The other part is the opportunity for top line revenue generation. Goldman Sachs issued a[ report](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/ai-investment-forecast-to-approach-200-billion-globally-by-2025.html) earlier this year advocating for tremendous productivity enhancements and investment in AI.

Personally, I’m still bullish on Generative AI, but we need to see some truly game-changing applications appear that fundamentally change industries. It’s great if a copy editor can create a first draft of a marketing e-mail or if a sales rep can generate a response to helps progress a sale. But if we don’t see applications that accelerate innovation or create truly new solutions, then venture capital may dry up, and we’ll see a reset on the pace of adoption for Generative AI.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Professional organizations like law firms can’t be wrong — so if Generative AI is going to become a widely used solution in the industry, it’s important to ensure that the margin of error is as minimal as possible. One of the safer techniques for applying Generative AI is known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation ([RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG)).  A simpler way to think of this is to “chat with your data.” Gunderson recently announced [ChatGD,](https://www.lawnext.com/2023/08/gunderson-dettmer-launches-chatgd-first-u-s-based-firm-to-develop-proprietary-internal-generative-ai-app.html) an internal tool for use by Gunderson staff that operates on the internal knowledge of the firm. RAG solutions essentially use a natural language search to find relevant documents within a database and then use Generative AI like ChatGPT to summarize the relevant documents.

This approach has several benefits. First, the documents are a known quantity, like a firm’s trusted data in its document management system. Second, in RAG solutions the use of ChatGPT is for its mastery of conversational language and its ability to summarize data. When using ChatGPT in this way to summarize trusted content, the potential for hallucinations dramatically decreases. Links can also be created to the source documents which makes Generative AI verifiable, similar to human-generated content.

RAG systems are one of the best early applications of Generative AI that a law firm might leverage in the practice of law. With additional refinement and innovation, firms may be able to eventually develop the killer apps that change the game and truly excite venture capital funds to invest generously.

Conclusion

So let’s travel back to the year 1440 — ostensibly where we began this series. Gutenberg invented the movable type printing press which created a revolution in publishing and dramatically increased the amount of content generated and consumed. The invention opened people’s minds and created the publishing industry. It was responsible for creating the domain of copyright law, and was a major impetus to geopolitical and social change throughout the world, from the Reformation onward.

November 30, 2022, and the launch of ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo may go down in history as a similar milestone in human history. That day showed the world that Generative AI was indeed a game changer. Will there be bumps along the way? Absolutely. Will the hype cycle ebb and flow? Absolutely. Will the technology have unintended geopolitical and social consequences? Very likely. It’s going to be a fascinating ride — but whatever the future holds, the legal professionals who embrace and understand the technology will have a clear advantage.

# Top 5 Biglaw Firm Is Here To Give Associates Raises For The Third Time
## Exciting news!

As Biglaw firms continue to make it rain during the latest (and perhaps final) round of the 2022 salary wars, associates are keeping their eyes glued to their inboxes, impatiently waiting for their firms to make matches. Now, one of the biggest Biglaw firms of all has entered the scene — for the third time — to give its associates more money.

Baker McKenzie, a firm that brought in $2,899,834,000 gross revenue in 2020, making it the No. 4 firm in the latest Am Law 100 ranking, recently announced that it would be matching Cravath. If you recall, the firm was an [early adopter](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/baker-raise-2022/) of both the [Milbank salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) that was released in January and the [Davis Polk salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/baker-reraise-2022/) that was released just last week.

Here’s Baker McKenzie’s new salary scale:



The firm’s salary increases are retroactive to January 1, and associates will see more money in their March 25 paychecks. Congratulations, for the third time!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Baker McKenzie.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

It was in the fall of that year that the #MeToo Time’s Up movement was born. Remember that? The goal was to focus on eradicating sexual harassment, initially in Hollywood with Harvey Weinstein, as just one example. Convicted of sex crimes in New York and serving time there, he’s now on trial for similar crimes in Los Angeles. The movement then spread to other industries and businesses, including ours.

So, how much have you heard about the movement in the past five years? Not much, I’ll wager. Early in the movement, there was a spate of mea culpas and dead silences from a bunch of famous and not so famous men who admitted their misconduct, or took a hike after confronting evidence against them, or just stonewalled. The bunch included, but was not limited to, Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K., Sen. Al Franken (Minn.), and judicial officers, most notably Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski.

The past five years also have seen [a number of male lawyers and judges](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/still-broken-the-legal-profession-still-has-a-long-way-to-go-on-sexual-harassment/) (along with Kozinski) crash and burn due to allegations of sexual harassment. Just type the words “sexual harassment” into the ATL search bar. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York resigned his post just last year.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Remember the initial hysteria from men (and yes, I use “hysteria” deliberately) about how [men would not have any meetings with women unless office doors were open](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/05/when-men-are-afraid-to-interact-with-women-at-work-it-harms-the-whole-company) (calling Mike Pence)? How many men are still afraid to have such meetings? Not many, I guess.

The movement has suffered from the usual growing pains, directions, leadership issues, infighting and all the usual stuff that accompanies an organization that is just getting started, but five years in, who even remembers Time’s Up? Yes, its legal defense fund, housed at the National Women’s Law Center, is still extant, but Time’s Up itself is almost extinct. That’s too bad, because sexual harassment is still front and center, especially in the workplace. I don’t care how many training classes executives, managers, and employees take, some of them couldn’t know, wouldn’t know, or even worse, wouldn’t care what sexual harassment is if it smacked them in the face.

So, the momentum propelling the movement has been lost. It’s still needed; while it may be less overt and publicized, the problem remains. Nonetheless, the furor and activity around it have subsided. So is the story of Times Up [a cautionary tale](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/metoo-five-years-later-times-up-1235228096/) about how even the best of intentions can implode?

Do you think that state laws requiring transparency in pay scales will help women partners narrow the pay gap with their male counterparts? We can hope, but don’t take any bets on it. In a partner compensation survey by Major, Lindsey & Africa and Law360, the results are still not great. Surprisingly, only 13% reported that their income was affected by the pandemic. However, to the surprise of no female lawyers, they still trail male partners in average income.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here’s the nub of the findings: “At $1.21 million, average compensation for male partners continues to significantly outpace that of female partners, who earned an average of $905,000 in 2021. However, women saw their compensation increase at a greater rate (26%) than men (17%) over the past two years, and the [pay differential between men and women continues to narrow](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/insights/research/2022-partner-compensation-survey) consistently and substantially for our respondents (from 53% in the 2018 Survey, to 44% in 2020, to now a differential of 34%).”

Woohoo! Congratulations, women partners, you are now just a measly 34% (cough, cough) behind in the race for economic parity. Way to go, all those male partners, who don’t think that women partners ought to be paid equally. How about this as a final Jeopardy answer: “an oxymoron.” The question is “what is pay equity for women partners?”

A Bloomberg Law article [states the obvious](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/huge-pay-gap-for-women-lawyers-what-firms-can-do): if you start out at a low salary, then that’s where you will stay. (In other words, if you don’t ask, you don’t get.) Laterals with a book of business who join a firm can earn 20% to 30% more than their nonlateral colleagues. Pay inequity is real and creates hard feelings and resentment. For whatever reasons, companies value bright, shiny, fresh faces over those already on board. I’ve seen underperforming, bright, shiny laterals out on their keesters if they are all sizzle and no steak.

Has your state adopted a pay transparency law? [Here’s the list to date](https://pequity.com/blog/pay-transparency-in-2022-which-states-require-employers-to-provide-salary-ranges%EF%BF%BC/). California’s law [includes language](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/california_equal_pay_act.htm) that “substantially similar work” requires equal pay.

And ending on a positive note, a [bench hug for this judge](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/judge-goes-out-of-his-way-for-junior-associates/) who told senior lawyers on a particular matter that they are to let junior lawyers (e.g., those with less than four years in practice) argue two motions on video that are set for early November in an Illinois federal district case. The judge said that if the senior lawyers can’t STFU (my words, not the court’s), it will cancel the video hearing and convert it to a telephonic hearing, ruling on the written submissions. If only more judges would do this.

# Biglaw Offer Rates For Law School Student Recruitment Reaches Historic Highs
## These figures are even better than rates measured before the recession.

‘We got offers!’

For the past few years, law student recruitment for summer associate programs has been incredibly successful, harkening back to a time when law students quickly accepted the offers that Biglaw firms handed out like candy. The 2018 recruitment cycle was a little different than in years past, but only in that its outcomes were even more extraordinary than usual.

According to the latest law student recruiting figures from the National Association of Law Placement (NALP), offer rates from Biglaw summer programs have reached some historic highs. Not only did the aggregate offer rate jump to almost 97 percent after having been flat for the past three years at about 95 percent, but the acceptance rate for those offers reached a high of 88 percent after ranging from between 84 percent and 86 percent for the past seven years. What’s even more exciting is that this historic acceptance rate is significantly higher than acceptance rates measured before the recession, which tended to hover between about 73 to 77 percent. Here’s what James Leipold, NALP’s executive director, had to say about the latest recruiting figures:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
After a period of great volatility following the recession marked first by a prolonged slowdown in law student recruiting and then a period of rapid escalation in recruiting, we have seen the recruiting market stabilize over the last four or five years. The recruiting climate is most accurately described as steady in 2018, though as with law firm profitability, there remain large differences between individual firms in terms of the number of offers being extended for summer programs and the size of the summer programs themselves. Meanwhile, offer rates coming out of summer programs are at historic highs, as are yield rates on those offers, and the 3L recruiting market remains quite anemic, findings that are closely linked.

Here are some interesting facts about the results for law students who went through the on-campus interviewing process in the summer and fall of 2018:

- One may be the loneliest number, but not for law firm summer associate classes. The most common summer program class size in 2018 was a class of just one person. In fact, one-quarter of summer programs reported for summer 2018 consisted of one or two summer associates. In contrast, prior to the recession in 2008, just 16 percent of summer programs consisted of one or two associates.
- At 14, the average summer program class size was flat for the third year in a row, but for the biggest of Biglaw firms, the average summer class size was 19, a number that has fallen since 2016 (from 22 in 2016 to 20 in 2017 and so on). Seventeen percent of summer classes were larger than 20, while six 6 percent were larger than 50.

- There are still fewer summer associate positions available than there were before the recession (by a measure of at least 1,000), and law students are even more eager than before to fill those roles. Who wouldn’t be? After all, the starting salary at premier Biglaw firms is now $190,000.
Congratulations to all law students who went through the entry-level recruitment cycle in 2018, as things seem to have worked out marvelously for them. Cross your fingers and hope that remains the same for future law school classes to come.

While declaring that it is not representing Trump per se, the firm is behind the Pennsylvania “stop the count” effort and with advocacy groups urging corporations to pull business and reports emerging of internal strife, the firm seems willing to stay the course. It worked for the Titanic, after all. Meanwhile, a family law attorney pursuing the case makes an interesting complaint about the size of Kirkland & Ellis. In more heroic news, a lawsuit takes aim at Confederate monuments and we talk about the state of annual bonuses.

Bruce Stachenfeld

This three-part series of articles gave step-by-step advice on exactly what to do when you lose your job in a law firm. This is the third article. In the [first article](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/reinventing-the-law-business-you-lost-your-job-in-a-law-firm-what-do-you-do-now-part-1/), I gave advice on self-analysis necessary before moving onto the actual steps to take. In my [second article](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/reinventing-the-law-business-you-lost-your-job-in-a-law-firm-what-do-you-do-now-part-2/), I went over those steps. In this final article, I go over the interview process. If you have not read my prior two articles before reading this one, I urge you to do so.

Here is what to do in order to become great at interviewing. By the way, if you think “I am terrible at interviews,” that is just silly. Almost anyone can become great at the interview process with some practice. Here is what to do…

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Reach back for the analysis (from the first article in this series) about what you are good at, and start working on how to convey that without sounding awkward or like you are bragging. There is a forthright manner of conveying your positive attributes, and you have to get smooth at it. It is not “bragging,” but it is not humble either. Consider something like:

“Toby – I really appreciate your taking the time to interview me. Since this is an interview, I guess I am supposed to let you know what is good and special about me, so I will do just that. Sorry to be un-humble but I am really awesome at drafting. I just know how to do it. Almost every time I draft something the partner is impressed with my work and very complimentary. And the more complicated the better. One example was…”

The way to get smooth at interviewing is simple: practice, practice, practice. And don’t just go over what you “would say.” Instead, look in the mirror and say it out loud like you are talking to someone. You might be amazed – astonished, actually – at how awful you are at first. But with a little practice, you will likely be amazed – and again, astonished – at how smooth you get.

Practice with people – like your husband, your wife, your friends, whoever will help you. After a while you, will have a “rap” and be very smooth at putting it “out there.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
When you practice, have people ask you the worst question – the one you wish they wouldn’t ask. Maybe the question that you fear is really ugly and direct: “So I hear you got fired – what happened….?” Whatever that awful question is, you want to practice the answer so much that you can say in response, and truly feel, “Toby – I am really glad you asked me that question, because…….”   Your feeling of confidence, and indeed eagerness, is because you have practiced it and you have a great, strong, and powerful answer.

If there is an elephant in the room about the tough question, then seize the moment and ask it and answer it. For example, if you had a job at the top firm in your area and are leaving after six months, there is certainly a question as to why. Don’t let it hang there. Answer it flat out and get ahead of the story, whatever it might be.

As far as practicing goes, make it as real as possible. Walk into the room and give your handshake to whoever is giving you the practice interview, introduce yourself, make small talk, and do all that “stuff” that people do at the beginning of interviews. Get comfortable in the role. And ask your helper for real honest feedback. None of that “well that was great bulls**t”. Instead, ask your helper to tell you flat out what you could have done better, why wasn’t it the greatest interview he ever had. Look – hard – for criticisms. You want to get so that your performance is off the charts. No time for glad-handing here.

As noted in my first article, you will want to have a “story” that your employer will support if your employer is called for a reference. This will prevent awkwardness in the tough questions if they are asked. And, as also noted in my first article, it is much better if you are in a position of being employed and looking for a new better job for a good reason than the converse.

Here are some don’ts:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Don’t bad mouth your current/prior employer – it is bad form and calls into question your judgment. Even if you were fired in a terrible, degrading manner, just be a class act and say that you respect their position even if you don’t agree, or something like that.

Don’t talk about money – that is for after you get an offer.

Don’t talk about your desire for a lifestyle – that is also for after you get an offer.

Also, for the interview itself:

Buy an interview suit/dress, or dust off your best suit/dress. Kid yourself not – you want to look super-duper sharp for your interviews.

When you go for the interview, shine your shoes and have a well-groomed haircut. For men, make sure your tie is affixed and knotted well (of course, you are not casual in any way), and for women, the analog of the foregoing.

I reluctantly admit beards and facial hair are now in-style; however, unless you look amazing with facial hair, this is probably high time for a shave. You can always grow it back after you get the job.

And don’t forget a breath mint before you go into an interview.

If you have a clammy handshake, rub your hands together and use a tissue or do whatever it takes to be un-clammy.

Keep in mind that interviewing is an art. You want to practice it. Ultimately, you have a message to convey and you have to get good at conveying it, and you are not there to passively answer questions. If the interview is going sideways, it is perfectly okay to say something like the following:

“Well, I guess we are at an interview, and the key question is ‘why should you hire me?’ So here is the reason……”

Finally, be mindful of the fact that this is a process, and it often doesn’t go smoothly or as planned. If you keep a good attitude, don’t get discouraged when things don’t go your way, and follow the steps in my three articles, the odds are that your next gig will be better than your last.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 04.11.16
## * Professor [Victor Williams](http://www.law.edu/fac-staff/williamsv/) of the Catholic University of America School of Law, who's been called the ""Republican Lawrence Lessig"" by some, is running a write-in campaign for president with the sole intent of eliminating Ted Cruz as a candidate due to his birth in Canada. He alleges that the Texas senator committed ballot access fraud by falsely swearing that he was a natural born citizen. Thanks to Williams's allegations, a primary disqualification hearing is being held today in New Jersey. [[PR Newswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ted-cruz-risks-primary-disqualification-in-new-jersey-other-late-primary-states-charges-professor-victor-williams-300248565.html)] * Does SCOTUS have a diversity problem?

Uh-oh: Senator Ted Cruz may have some trouble in Jersey. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty)

* Professor [Victor Williams](http://www.law.edu/fac-staff/williamsv/) of the Catholic University of America School of Law, who’s been called the “Republican Lawrence Lessig” by some, is running a write-in campaign for president with the sole intent of eliminating Ted Cruz as a candidate due to his birth in Canada. He alleges that the Texas senator committed ballot access fraud by falsely swearing that he was a natural born citizen. Thanks to Williams’s allegations, a primary disqualification hearing is being held today in New Jersey.

David Reidy

David Reidy, formerly the Chief Legal & Compliance Officer at fintech startup Payactiv and before that a partner at McGuireWoods leading the national fintech practice, has joined Scale LLP as its new managing partner.

“The chance to lead Scale LLP is a once-in-a-career opportunity,” said Reidy. “We are living through a generational change in workplace culture,” said Reidy, “and the time has come for a top-tier virtual firm.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Reidy takes the reins of a rapidly growing law firm with around 50 lawyers across 10 states that doubled its partnership over the last year. Founding partner Adam Forest describes the firm as heavily influenced by its Silicon Valley roots. “Innovation is in our DNA,” he said.

Part of innovation is adapting to the changing legal landscape by bringing in leadership with experience running a national Biglaw practice group and an in-house department. Reidy is quick to note that his legal department experience Scale’s complement of former in-house lawyers — including six former GCs — are critical to the firm’s business. When it comes to building relationships with new clients, it helps to have “worn the business hat” in the past he said.

While Scale LLP endeavors to continuing growing as “a top-tier virtual firm,” it’s an open question how long the word “virtual” is really going to matter.

Traditional, brick-and-mortar — or more accurately “steel-and-glass” — law firms are tentatively adopting three- and four-day office weeks. Some are embracing remote working arrangements to lure and retain top-notch talent outside of the law’s customary power centers. Meanwhile, a virtual law firm [cracked the Am Law 200 this year](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/01/12/fisherbroyles-says-2020-revenue-hit-113m/) earning one of the most recognizable chits of an establishment law firm. So what does it even mean to be a “virtual” firm at this point?

Oh, right, the way lawyers can keep 80 percent of their fees.

But putting that admittedly important detail aside, how are virtual law firms really all that different, in terms of work product, from the way traditional firms have operated for years.

As Forest explains, the bulk of a traditional Biglaw lawyer’s work day is spent working with attorneys on different floors, in different cities, and at different firms. The law firm was already moving toward what we call “virtual” already… only with higher commercial lease outlays. We only needed a little bit of a push to get to a model where technology replaced even that small portion of daily face-to-face communication. As Reidy put it, “The pandemic proved the model can work but the need for it has been there.”

“I wouldn’t trade my experience at an Am Law 50 firm, but there are room for different approaches,” Reidy said. “50 percent of service professionals considering a change,” he said citing a recent survey, “not because they don’t want to work it’s that they want to explore alternatives.” Of all the reasons to develop alternative paths to practice, Reidy makes a point of flagging is the impact that the old face time model has had on representation and diversity in the workplace.

But the pandemic also proved that most people do crave the sort of community that virtual working doesn’t necessarily encourage. While loneliness is bad enough as a mental health factor, the strength of the law firm model is collaboration and cross-promotion, and virtual work can easily slip into siloed work. Of all of Scale LLP’s efforts to evolve the virtual law firm, its approach to maintaining community might be the most consequential for the long-term success of the model.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“We’re built with attorneys in mind,” Forest explains. “We put a heavy emphasis on community and getting to know and trust one another.” To make that happen, the firm employs full-time staff focused on building the community. Virtual meetings, celebrations, events, smaller “elevator meets” are run to get the attorneys to feel connected and build real relationships. It seems to be working. “Last year, half of all work was on someone else’s client.” That’s exactly the kind of collaboration and cross-promotion that virtual firms aren’t expected to have.

So maybe, by next year, Scale LLP will have shown us that there’s no need to tag firms with the “virtual” label any more and we can just call them all “law firms.”

# Eliminating The Mommy Track
## How law firms can support working moms without sidelining them.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Laura Sexton to our pages. Click [here](https://www.mothersesquire.com/donate-1) if you’d like to donate to MothersEsquire.

Before I went back to work, my mom warned me: “Don’t put pictures up in the office.” “Don’t talk about your kids too much.” “They’ll think you’re not serious about work.”

This was not the first time I had heard this type of advice. Before I began practicing, I wasn’t sure if I could even mention that I wanted to have kids someday. I worried I wouldn’t be taken seriously. Or worse, that I would become another casualty of the “mommy track,” a career path that ostensibly provides women with support and flexibility, but only at the cost of their career.

The “pretend it never happened” approach never sat well with me. How could new mothers — who had just gone through the biggest transition of their lives — come back and act like nothing happened?

More importantly, why should they? Motherhood does not make us weak, it is not something to hide and be ashamed of. Motherhood teaches us how to prioritize. It helps us achieve exponential gains in efficiency. It teaches us to stay calm under chaotic circumstances, to function on no sleep, and to show up again and again no matter how hard it is. Motherhood makes us stronger and more resilient.

So why should we have to choose between ignoring our motherhood or being relegated to the “mommy track”? The answer is: we shouldn’t.

Here are practical ways that firms can support working moms without sidelining them:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- Normalize having children at all levels. It is important to have visible examples in leadership of men and women who have children. Leaders should feel comfortable talking about their children and putting up pictures of them.
- Hold family events where children are welcome. Some of my favorite firm events have been the ones where children are welcome. It is fun to share such a big part of your life — your kids — with your colleagues. And it helps with building authentic relationships outside of the office.
- Give mothers credit during performance reviews for the growth and development that takes place on maternity leave. Maternity leave is a period of tremendous growth and development. Mothers should be given credit for the skills they developed during maternity leave and how those skills transfer to their practice.
- Identify and fix any experience gaps for new mothers. Women who take maternity leave, necessarily, have less time in the office to build their resumes for partnership. Firms should be proactive about identifying any experience gaps that may result and helping new mothers to find opportunities to fill those gaps.
- Assign new mothers a mentor. Coming back to the office after maternity leave is unlike anything else. You aren’t up to speed on current events, you haven’t seen the latest shows, you haven’t seen your colleagues in months, and you are a different person than when you left. Having someone to talk to can make the experience much less isolating.
- Don’t make assumptions about goals and preferences. People often make assumptions about new mothers — e.g., that they don’t want to travel — and pass them up for opportunities as a result. When I came back from maternity leave, I was so grateful when partners made an effort to ask me about these issues, rather than simply assuming I wouldn’t want to travel or be put on a trial team.
- Proactively offer accommodations. Some aspects of being a new mother are awkward. Private refrigerators for breast milk can save some embarrassment. Pumping breaks can help during long meetings, as can being sensitive to the impact last-minute schedule changes to meetings can have on a new mom’s pumping schedule. Firms should also reimburse for [Milk Stork](https://www.milkstork.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIy_TDiJDv-gIVAziGCh0eAAsKEAAYASAAEgJsVfD_BwE), which makes shipping breastmilk easier on travel days. These and other accommodations went a long way to helping me feel comfortable, appreciated, and understood.
- Offer remote work options. I am still stunned by the logistical quagmire involved in leaving the house. First there’s the breast pump, then the pump parts, then the storage bags, the nursing pads, the cooler, and the list goes on. Remote work options have saved my sanity and added hours of productivity to my days.
- Offer resources tailored to the legal profession. Many of the “back to work” resources relate to professions that are, frankly, less intense than the law. For specific advice about how to navigate motherhood within the legal profession, I recommend “[Back to Work After Baby: How to Plan and Navigate a Mindful Return from Maternity Leave](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692821635/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mindfulreturn-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0692821635&linkId=41c7350cb0f1c6ad6ecd0c861c29241a),” which was written by Lori Mihalich-Levin, a former partner in Biglaw. She also offers [e-courses](https://www.mindfulreturn.com/e-course) that receive rave reviews.
- Offer alternative arrangements where desired. Some women will, understandably, want to scale back after having children. Firms seeking to retain talent should respect these choices and, where appropriate, consider flexible and alternative arrangements. Firms should also extend recruiting efforts to candidates seeking to return to work after caring for children at home.
These are a few of the ways that firms can support new mothers without sidelining them. What has worked for your firm? I would love to hear your ideas. Please email me at [lsexton@goldmanismail.com](mailto:lsexton@goldmanismail.com).

# 'FOMO' In Biglaw Recruiting: Will More Law Schools Switch Their Dates For On-Campus Recruiting?
## With almost half of all summer associate offers coming before official OCI, it looks like the times are changing for Biglaw recruiting at law schools.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Nobody likes it, but there is a sense of FOMO going on—if you don’t do this early recruiting, you’ll miss out on the best candidates. We’re seeing a recruiting cycle that looks a lot more like what you see in other industries, where it’s really happening year round and there is no timeline or set process.

— Nikia Gray, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/yale-stanford-yield-summer-associate-recruitment-creep-other-top-law-schools-2024-02-14/) on [Yale and Stanford Law moving their interview programs to June](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/top-law-schools-change-the-dates-of-their-virtual-interview-programs/), ahead of on-campus interview programming typically scheduled for later in the summer. Gray noted that while NALP has yet to release data for 2023, a little less than half of all summer associate offers came prior to the start of law schools’ formal interview programs.

# Oh My My, Another Biglaw Firm Announces Raises
## Good compensation and bonus news at the firm.

Nothing like an end-of-day raise/bonus announcement to put some pep in the step of associates! This time the good news comes from O’Melveny & Myers, a firm that took in $1,024,780,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 50th on the AmLaw 100 ranking.

Earlier today, via a voicemail (how quaint!) from partner Marc Pensabene, O’Melveny announced that they too are ponying up the big bucks for associates (and counsel). The new compensation scale at OMM is as follows:

1st Year Associates	$225,000
2nd Year Associates	$235,000
3rd Year Associates	$260,000
4th Year Associates	$310,000
5th Year Associates	$365,000
1st Year Counsel	$390,000
2nd Year Counsel	$420,000
3rd Year Counsel	$435,000
And as for bonuses, well, yeah they’re matching the prevailing rate there as well.

Class of 2022	$20,000
Class of 2021	$30,000
Class of 2020	$57,500
Class of 2019	$75,000
Class of 2018	$90,000
Class of 2017	$105,000
Class of 2016+	$115,000
Congratulations to attorneys at OMM on your new found largesse.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Lawyer Accuses Former Firm Of Ripping Off Associates Through Creative Billing
## Is this boss cheating employees? One lawsuit says yes.

Are partners getting more than their fair share here?

The Philadelphia legal world is reeling from a complaint filed against market bigshot [Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel](http://www.obermayer.com) for allegedly reallocating billing rates in a systematic effort to reduce associate access to bonuses.

Former Obermayer associate [Ryan Leonard](http://www.dmclaw.com/Attorney%2DRyan%2DL%2DLeonard), now a principal with [Dickie McCamey & Chilcote](http://www.dmclaw.com), filed the lawsuit claiming that Obermayer internally reduced associate billing rates and increased partner billing rates to shift the credited profitability of work more toward partners — a key allegation because he claims that Obermayer’s associate bonuses are based on their profitability. In other words, Leonard claims the firm billed out clients for associate work at higher and partner work at lower rates than they credited associates and partners with when it came time for bonuses. The deviations were allegedly extreme, with associate rates shifted downward from [$170 to $88 per hour to bumping up a partner’s rate from $250 to $350](http://www.law360.com/articles/793976/obermayer-bilked-associates-out-of-bonuses-suit-claims).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Gina Passarella of The Legal Intelligencer [reports on the allegations](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/home/id=1202757980199/ExObermayer-Lawyer-Accuses-Partners-of-ShortChanging-Associates?mcode=1202617075166&curindex=0):

Leonard had worked at Obermayer Rebmann from 2008 until 2014, during which time he said he was told associate compensation was based largely on the associate’s profitability, which was calculated on a “pro-rated credit” basis. The associate’s billable hours were multiplied by the hourly rate, creating the pro-rated credit. If that figure was 2.5 times greater than the associate’s salary, the associate would receive a bonus, Leonard said in his complaint. The higher that pro-rated credit, the higher the bonus, he said.

“However, numerous partners at the firm, including partners on the management committee, engaged in a practice known as ‘reallocation of pro-rated credit,’” Leonard said in the complaint.

Leonard said he didn’t know about the practice until he saw internal documents outlining the method, contributing to his decision to leave the firm.

According to the complaint, Obermayer’s managing partner took the position that partners can adjust billing rates however they want and need not credit associates for the rates conveyed to clients.

No one is commenting on this story, but regardless of what’s really going on here, this case highlights the difficulties that can arise if firms walk away from the lockstep models of yesteryear and try to devise more complex compensation methods. Even if Leonard’s claims fail to pass legal muster, an approach like this runs a high risk of hurt feelings and mistrust and that’s never good for the workplace.
