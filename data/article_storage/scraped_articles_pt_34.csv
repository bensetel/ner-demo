As the humanitarian crisis in Eastern Europe continues to unfold, some lawyers — at least the ones who aren’t [clinging to their Russian clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/biglaw-firms-ditching-russian-government-clients-because-its-the-right-move/) — are pitching in to help. [Paul Weiss kicked things off](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/paul-weiss-mobilizing-pro-bono-resources-for-ukrainian-refugees/), announcing a donation match up to $1,500 for attorneys and staff giving to organizations engaged in the relief effort and mobilizing its pro bono power to help out.

[Kaplan Hecker committed to matching relief donations](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/kaplan-hecker-raise-2022/) in their salary increase memo (matching up to $2,000). [Debevoise announced a $1,500 match policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/debevoise-ukraine/) just yesterday.

Thankfully, the ball is still rolling.

Kirkland & Ellis has revised its annual matching policy across the board in light of the crisis:

Kirkland & Ellis Foundation

If you wish, you may access the Foundation’s annual matching grant program to supplement your Ukrainian aid gifts. In light of this crisis, the Firm has decided to increase the annual matching amounts. The following are the new annual matching levels:
Share Partners: The Firm will match no less than $100 for any one contribution with an annual limit of $12.50 per share held during the current year with the minimum annual match of $2,500.
Non-Share Partners: The Firm will match no less than $100 for any one contribution with an annual limit of $2,000.
All Other Personnel: The Firm will match no less than $50 for any one contribution with an annual limit of $1,000.

We hear that Robinson+Cole is also stepping up to match donations and offer pro bono assistance with the filing of temporary protected status applications for Ukrainians.

Meanwhile, Ropes & Gray is helping its people direct their donations to organizations providing maximum impact, lawyers are collecting essentials for donation, and the firm is gearing up to leverage its pro bono resources.

Just as I put the finishing touches on this, Pillsbury informed its folks that it will match donations to Doctors Without Borders… up to $50,000! Fifty. Thousand. Dollars. A tremendous commitment.

…And as I finished writing THAT sentence, King & Spalding announced that it is donating $25K and will separately match donations to Ukraine on a firmwide level up to $50K as well.

(UPDATE: Troutman Pepper also matched up to $50,000 and ended up raising over $212,000!)

May the donation match cycle be as robust as the salary match cycle.

# Always Waiting: A Lawyer's Tale

The child and his big brother went into their backyard and threw ground balls to each other to practice fielding.  When the big brother started playing Little League baseball, the two practiced more often. But when the older brother turned 12, and played his last Little League game, the brother gave the sad news: “There’s no reason to practice fielding ground balls anymore.”

Things are worth pursuing only if there’s a goal, of course.

The child sometimes sent away for stuff by mail.

While he waited, he was excited; there was anticipation. And then the package arrived, which was okay. But not nearly as good as the anticipation.

When the child was in high school, he’d practice shooting hoops, and he’d dream about the state championship he’d win one day.

He never did.

As a young man, he dreamed about the person that he’d meet who would change his life. The anticipation carried him through the bad times.

After law school, the young man went to a firm. He argued an appeal that was pretty significant for a person of his age. One of the old-timers at the firm told him, “You just might win this case, and it’s the sort of victory that could launch your career.” He won, but there was no obvious launch.

He published an article in a fairly well-known journal. He dreamed about the business that would come in, making him a leader within the firm. A matter or two came in, but the Earth didn’t shake.

Every once in a while he bought a lottery ticket: “I know that I’m not going to win. But it’s worth a buck to imagine for 24 hours how I’d spend the hundred million if I did.” He never won, of course.

There was a competition to select the next leader of the man’s practice within the firm. He dreamed of how his life would change if only he were picked.

Maybe he got the job; maybe he didn’t.

He reached the firm’s retirement age, and there was no reason to practice fielding ground balls any more.

But wait!  The next trip!  Just imagine how great the week in New Zealand will be!

There’s always room to dream about the destination. There’s hardly any reason to enjoy the trip along the way.

I always thought that whether a question was leading was a binary proposition: Either a question was leading or it was not.

Blah, blah, blah; is that right? Leading.

Can you explain why … ? Not leading.

On cross-examination, you use only leading questions. Simple enough.

But no.

There are variations. There are very leading questions, slightly leading questions, slightly nonleading questions, and completely open-ended questions. With the hardest witnesses, you must use excruciatingly leading questions.

Here’s an example:

You have a sales chart. The company sold 15 in December 2019, 14 in January, 13 in February, 12 in March, 11 in April, 10 in May, 9 in June, 25 in July, 24 in August, 23 in September, 22 in October, 21 in November, and 20 in December 2020. Thus: The company started with 15 sales per month and ended with 20 per month in the next year, but this was not a consistent increase.

With the toughest expert witness on cross-examination, use the most leading questions:

Q: The company sold 15 in December 2019. Did I read that correctly?

That’s extraordinarily leading. Witnesses quibble with a lot, but it’s hard to quibble with, “Did I read that correctly?”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Q: The company sold 20 in December 2020. Did I read that correctly?

Same deal. The witness can’t quibble. For very tough witnesses, stop there.  You’ve now made the point you need for closing: “As the expert witness conceded, the company sold 15 in December 2019 and 20 in December 2020.  Year-over-year, the sales were increasing.”

But you can be more aggressive with your questions, at the cost of more risk about the answers.

Suppose you try a third question:

Q:  So you agree that, year-over year, there was an increase in sales, right?

Maybe the witness is cooperative, and you get a “yes.” Eureka!

But maybe the witness is stubborn:

A:  Absolutely not. Sales peaked with 25 in July, and sales then decreased every month for half a year until finally bottoming out at 20 in December 2020. That’s not year-over-year sales growth. That’s a declining company. It’s a disaster.

You’re feeling a little stupid for having asked the question, but you show no emotion and battle on:

Q:  I’m asking about year-over-year. You’d agree that, on a year-over-year basis, from December to December, sales were increasing, right?”

This sound leading, but it’s an invitation for a counter-punch.

A: It depends of course on where you start the year. I think the last six months are most important, because they’re the most recent. If you focus on the recent months, sales have fallen off the edge of a cliff.

You struggle on, because you’re a fool and don’t know when to stop:

Q: But I’m talking about the end of one year to the end of the next.

A: Yes, you are, but that’s because you’re mistaken about what matters. If you were focused on the correct numbers, blah, blah, blah.

The questions looked so leading when you drafted them last week, but they weren’t leading enough.

Then, of course, there’s the other end of the spectrum — questions that only fools ask:

Q: Can you tell me any reason why the year-over-year numbers don’t matter?

A: Any reason? Now that you mention it, there are 14 reasons. Judge, please don’t interrupt me while I give a soliloquy for the next half hour, because this clown asked for it. Who hired this lawyer, anyway? In any event, reason number one is … .

Leading and nonleading questions. That is not a binary choice. Did I read that correctly?

# Chadbourne Swings Back Over Gender Bias Suit

You didn’t actually think that Chadbourne & Parke would take a $100 million purported class action for gender discrimination lying down, did you? Kerrie Campbell (and in the amended complaint, Jaroslawa Zelinsky Johnson) sued the Biglaw firm for discrimination, and now we have the Answer.

Chadbourne takes some mighty swings at Campbell, as the American Lawyer [reports](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202771558936/Chadbourne-Delivers-Robust-Response-to-Gender-Bias-Suit):

Chadbourne claims that partner Abbe Lowell, the head of the firm’s litigation department who was named in an amended complaint filed by Campbell on Oct. 27, was responsible for handling a “defamation matter for a high net-worth individual” that Campbell brought to the firm as a client. Chadbourne alleges that the individual, who it does not name, was dissatisfied with Campbell’s previous work and requested that she not work on the matter. Lowell instead took the lead on the engagement, which Chadbourne claims is responsible for $1.522 million of the $2.155 million in billings that Campbell took credit for in 2014.

Chadbourne also alleges that Campbell was difficult for associates in the firm’s litigation department to work with and that she “exhibited questionable legal judgment.” Chadbourne states that Campbell’s “wasteful use of associate time led to a number of write-offs.” The firm also claims that on at least one occasion, a Chabourne lawyer approached management with concerns that “he would be subject to sanctions had he advocated for Campbell’s position” in a client matter.

Then the allegations turn personal. The firm alleges that Campbell’s behavior on multiple occasions was inappropriate, and often fueled by alcohol:

Campbell also arrived at a firm event “already inebriated,” acted in a “shocking and inappropriate manner toward the male fiancé of a male Chadbourne attorney,” and made “graphic comments” to a male attorney at the same event, according to the firm’s response. During an out-of-town trial—Campbell is based in Washington, D.C.—the firm alleges that she again “displayed poor judgment with respect to the use of alcohol in the presence of a client between trial days.”

As for the other named plaintiff, Johnson, the firm said that the economic and political conditions in Ukraine, where Johnson was a partner, led to the treatment she complains about.

The Answer also took a shot at plaintiffs’ attorney, [David Sanford](https://sanfordheisler.com/team/david-sanford/):

The true goals of Sanford and Sanford Heisler are to make an example of how they are able to inflict injury upon Chadbourne reputationally, and thereby to serve notice to other law firms or companies that, should a future complaint arise against them, they would be well served to settle with [Sanford] ‘at the front end’ or they, too, would be subject to a baseless nationwide smear campaign of falsehoods like the one now being conducted against Chadbourne.

In a statement to American Lawyer, Sanford expressed little surprise over the salacious claims:

“Nothing in Chadbourne’s response surprises us, as the firm has communicated identical claims to us during the past few months,” Sanford said.

He may not be surprised, but we’re waiting here with popcorn for the next development in As The Law Firm Turns.

There is no such chant, nor has there ever been. Our partners attend services out of respect, and will enter and exit a service as a group (the reference to the “Cravath walk”) as a demonstration of collective honoring of their colleague if the family wishes that they do so.

— Fallon Szczur, who serves as head of communications at Cravath, in comments given to Daniel Stone, who recently wrote an [extensive research piece on the “Cravath Walk,”](https://danielstone.substack.com/p/cravath-walk-funeral-procession-chant) which is what happens when partners walk down the aisle at a deceased Cravath partner’s funeral, while [reportedly chanting](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/lawyers-apparently-perform-this-weird-ritual-during-cravath-partner-funerals/), “The partner is dead, the firm lives.” Both the firm and many Cravath partners, past and present, have denied that any such chant exists.

# Reading Between The Lines Of Legal Job Listings
## Some of the standard phrases are two-edged knives. Be sure you know how to handle them.

Legal job descriptions and interviewers don’t always say exactly what they mean. In fact, sometimes it’s as if they speak in code. But fear not, legal career seeker! With a bit of decoding, you can figure out what they really mean behind their artful language.

Let’s start with the phrase “fast-paced environment.” Sure, it sounds positive. But it actually means you’ll be fulfilling many roles, not just one. It’s safe to assume you’ll be doing the work of at least three or even five lawyers. Buckle up and get ready to multitask like a pro!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Another phrase to watch out for is “passion is a must.” Sounds nice, right? Who wouldn’t want to work for a company that values passion? But here’s the catch: when an interviewer says this, they really mean that the pay probably won’t be great. But hey, if you love what you do, who needs money anyway? Right? … Right?

Moving on, let’s talk about “flexible hours.” This one can go either way. On the one hand, it could mean you’ll have some control over your schedule and can work from home at least occasionally. On the other hand, it could mean that you’ll be expected to work 24/7 and have no off switch. Before you jump for joy at the thought of flexible hours, make sure you clarify exactly what it means.

And then there’s the “team player” — another warm phrase that can quickly turn into a red flag. Team players are expected to do whatever it takes to get the job done — even if it means picking up the slack for less-motivated colleagues. If you’re not a fan of group projects and don’t want to be held responsible for other people’s work, this might not be the role for you.

Then we have the infamous call for a  “self-starter.” What an employer likely expects is that you’ll automatically know what needs to be done. No one will tell you anything about anything. No pressure, right? If you like clear instructions and a well-defined role, you might want to think twice before applying here. But if you’re up for a challenge and love taking the initiative, go ahead and show them what you’re made of!

[](https://bit.ly/37tnCHR)By now, we’re all familiar with the “new normal” of navigating through a pandemic. For lawyers counseling businesses, these COVID-challenged times have required a quick refresher on the finer points of concepts including contracts, liability, and risk – and a scramble for answers to brand-new questions.

In a new treatise from PLI Press, [COVID-19 and Other Pandemics: Business and Legal Challenges](https://bit.ly/37tnCHR), public health and safety regulation experts James T. O’Reilly and Philip Hagan offer background and analysis that lawyers can use. The first publication to address these complex, evolving issues, the treatise combines practical advice with the latest scientific research and guidance from key government agencies.

Here are some key points for businesses – and their counsel – to consider as they begin to assess the impact of COVID-19 and to prepare for its long-term consequences:

Contracts are key. If you haven’t brushed up on force majeure since law school, now is a good time to revisit this and other contract concepts. A chapter on “COVID-19, Contracts and Frustration Defenses” provides an overview of contract law for businesses who may have seen their operations interrupted by the pandemic when they, their vendors, or third parties were unable to fulfill contracts. In addition to force majeure clauses, O’Reilly and Hagan explore issues of foreseeability, and defenses to non-performance like impossibility, impracticability, and frustration of purpose.

Employers should continuously evaluate risks and liabilities in their workspaces. OSHA has provided recommendations for how businesses can evaluate the risk of COVID-19 spreading in their workplaces and design systems for preventing transmission. These include both engineering controls, such as workspace redesign and upgrades to office air filtration systems, and administrative controls, which reduce person-to-person contact through “staggered work shifts, downsizing operations, delivering services remotely, and other exposure-reducing measures.” In the treatise, O’Reilly and Hagan adapt these and other recommendations into actionable guidelines.

The book includes an overview of workplace liability claims, looking at potential employer liability for employees who contract the virus on the job. The authors discuss potential theories of liability that employers should be aware of and the evidentiary difficulties that the parties will encounter. In that context, they also dive into the complexities of contact tracing as it relates to employer liability and evidence of infection. In addition, they discuss liability risks arising not just from employees catching the virus, but from customers and other members of the public catching the virus. The authors provide an overview of certain tort concepts, an explanation of workers’ compensation programs, and once again draw on OSHA guidance, or lack thereof, and explain the interaction of these concepts with respect to employer liability.

Focus on active response. Regardless of their type of business, all employers should maintain active response plans that minimize potential COVID-19 exposures to their employees and customers, the authors say. The CDC and other government entities provide guidance that can be incorporated into business operating scenarios.

Plan for “black swans.” In other words: expect the unexpected. Now that a rare event with extreme global consequences has in fact occurred, businesses will endeavor to structure contracts and business plans with risk scenarios in mind. When counseling businesses on planning and liability, think about these “black swan” events and develop strategies accordingly.

# ‘The Snapchat Story’ Has All The Salacious Details Legal and Tech Nerds Will Love

“81, they’ll bring the crashers to the party / And you know me / Turn the O2 into the O3, dog.” — [Drake](https://genius.com/13559083)

Yesterday, Kylie Jenner [tweeted](https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192) that she doesn’t open the Snapchat app anymore. And in one fell swoop, its stock price ended the day down 6%, [erasing over $1 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-tweet-kylie-jenner-wiped-164939000.html) in market value — giving Evan Spiegel and his company plenty of reasons to drink on National Margarita Day.

As an aging Millennial, I haven’t really used Snapchat [N/K/A Snap Inc.] much. But many of my friends do and they insist that “you would love it!” Although I haven’t “Snapped” much, I’ve been quite intrigued by its business model and extraordinary run to an IPO, as well as its ability to maintain a SEAL Team-esque level of operation.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This week, I had the opportunity to review the newly published book titled, [How to Turn Down a Billion Dollars: The Snapchat Story](http://amzn.to/2EMHvwg), by Billy Gallagher (affiliate link), a former fraternity brother of Spiegel. Whether you are a [Snap power user](https://mashable.com/2017/03/18/10-essential-snapchat-tips-and-tricks/#GaHY5LgC_mqm) or completely unfamiliar with the social media platform, if you are a legal and tech nerd like myself, then I firmly believe you will enjoy Gallagher’s new book.

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with how the former TechCrunch reporter covered the nuanced legal aspects of Snap’s unicorn-run to fame and fortune — despite, at many times, fawning coverage of his subject.

Above the Law recently highlighted a very [unhappy memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/) penned by the powerhouse attorney John Quinn, whose firm is covered in this book as “much more aggressive” than Snap’s other counsel, Cooley LLP. In 2013, ATL also wrote about the [infamous naked-man deposition incident](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/wherein-a-naked-man-interrupts-a-biglaw-deposition/), which occurred at Cooley before Quinn Emanuel took over on the dramatic case pitting the Snap founders against each other.

Representing the other Snap founder, Reggie Brown, was [Lee Tran & Liang LLP](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/04/14/cofounder-lawsuits-luan-tran-snapchat-yik-yak/#43ac4b433398) (founded by former QE attorneys), a firm which itself has had quite a meteoric rise during the last several years. In another Shakespearian twist of the Snap story (a [detail that was glossed over](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/04/14/cofounder-lawsuits-luan-tran-snapchat-yik-yak/&refURL=&referrer=#4e50f06e3398) in this book), it was ironically QE, who took over for Cooley, that originally referred Brown’s case to Lee Tran & Liang, who in return attempted to bar QE from the case because of its prior dealings with Brown. And the plot thickens!

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Two lessons I took away after reading this compelling book: you better review the “standard terms sheet” because it can come back to haunt you, and your casual social media actions can and will often be formally constructed against you in a deposition.

In Snap’s case, Spiegel believes he was screwed by an early venture investor due to the hidden language in the “standard terms sheet.” And in another painful, dramatic lesson for Spiegel, Lee Tran & Liang was able to negotiate a $157.5 million settlement for its outcast founder, Reggie Brown.

Without further ado, here are eight of my favorite [legal-related excerpts](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/56239877-how-to-turn-down-a-billion-dollars-the-snapchat-story) from the book:

- Evan was born on June 4, 1990, to a pair of highly successful lawyers. His mother, Melissa Thomas, graduated from Harvard Law School and practiced tax law as a partner at a prominent Los Angeles firm before resigning to become a stay-at-home mother when Evan was young. His father, John Spiegel, graduated from Stanford and Yale Law School and became a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson, an elite firm started by Berkshire Hathaway’s Charlie Munger…. When Evan was in high school, Melissa and John divorced after nearly twenty years of marriage. Evan chose to live with his father in a four-million-dollar house in Pacific Palisades, just blocks from his childhood home where his mother still lives.
- At a young age, Evan would listen in on his father’s long legal calls, which he credits for giving him early business exposure that helped develop his critical thinking and business accumen. He can often become obsessed with ideas, hungrily learning everything he can about them at a rapid pace. Evan is constantly curious and is learning and getting better at being a CEO very quickly. But his two superpowers are (1) his ability to get inside his users’ heads and think like a teenage girl and (2) his knack for attracting brilliant, powerful mentors.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- When Jeremy Liew and Lightspeed had invested just a few weeks prior, Liew had included terms giving Lightspeed the right of first refusal to invest in Snapchat’s next round of funding, as well as rights to take 50 percent of the next round. Essentially, Lightspeed controlled Snapchat’s next round of funding and made Snapchat unattractive to other investors, who would want to take a larger stake in the Series A round. Evan was furious. He felt betrayed and taken advantage of. Liew had told him these terms were standard. Evan would warn other students about this betrayal for years to come…
- At one point, Lee’s partner Luan Tran took a copy of Forbes magazine with Evan on the cover, scrawled red devil horns over his head, and pinned it to the wall in his office. The combative trial would wage for months, and each side had plenty more cards to play.
- Cooley’s Mike Rhodes began deposing Reggie, attempting to establish that Reggie had accomplished little since graduation: ‘What is your current employment, if any?’ ‘Well, currently I’m working in the South Carolina attorney general’s office….’ ‘And what were you doing, if anything, for employment prior to that date?’ ‘Well, I was applying to law school.’ ‘Were you working?’ ‘No.’ Reggie became distracted midway through answering a question about which lawyers he had spoken with. A [naked man had chosen the sidewalk across from the Cooley office](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/wherein-a-naked-man-interrupts-a-biglaw-deposition/?rf=1) as his performance stage for the day and was gesturing at Reggie through the window. The lawyers hastily closed the blinds and continued the deposition much less eventfully.
- Evan and Bobby [Murphy] were convinced Quinn Emanuel could use their experience from the most infamous startup lawsuit [[Winklevoss Twins vs. Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/id/42550836)] of all time to help them defeat Reggie. Quinn Emmanuel was much more aggressive than Cooley had been. They filed a sea of requests for documents, depositions, and subpoenas. They tried to dismiss the case and remove it to federal court, and they sought contempt sanctions and a restraining order against Reggie and Lee Tran & Liang.
- James Lee asked Bobby if he had ever referred to Reggie Brown as an employer at Picaboo [N/K/A Snap]. Bobby said he hadn’t. Lee showed him an automated email from Facebook, reading ‘Bobby Murphy tagged you in Picaboo under Employers.’ Bobby’s eyes darted, his head tilted down, and he twitched his mouth nervously. Glancing up at Lee, he sheepishly replied ‘Uh … Well it looks like here that I did something to that effect,’ Murphy said. ‘I don’t have a specific recollection of this happening … although I would say that it would have been unclear to me what … tagging someone as an ‘employer’ under Facebook would mean.’
- The lawsuit was also a major distraction to Evan, Bobby, and Snapchat, during a time when they needed to focus more than ever. Finally, they reached a settlement. Reggie would receive $157.5 million and sign a gag order to never speak about Snapchat, the founding, or the lawsuit…. So what is fair for each side to receive? Snapchat’s valuation soared so high and so quickly during the lawsuit that it was hard for each side to wrap their heads around it, let alone arbitrate what each side deserved. This question isn’t going away. The Social Network, featuring courtroom scene after courtroom scene of friends hurling accusations at each other through expensive lawyers, spurred scores of young college students to pursue startups. Evan’s massive success with Snapchat has only increased the startup fervor on Stanford’s campus. And Reggie’s lawyers’ firm, Lee Tran & Liang, has become the hot law firm for ousted startup cofounders to sue young tech companies.
The Snap Inc. founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, along with its various employees, probably had a few extra shots of tequila on National Margarita Day. But after reading Gallagher’s comprehensive guide on its history, I have a strong inkling that this is just a small bump in the road for Snap — and its team will have many things to toast to it in its future.

As for me, I just downloaded the app on my phone. I’m even thinking of buying some shares. After all, my friends insist that I would love it. But then again, I have just imbibed in three [Mambo Taxis](http://www.thefauxmartha.com/2015/08/04/mambo-taxi/)… Anyone know how I can do the [puppy face](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-the-Puppy-Face-on-Snapchat) on Snap?

As if aspiring lawyers need more pressure surrounding the bar exam. But as bar exam results are being released, there’s a question that must be asked: should their big-time jobs — the brass ring after a lifetime of academic success — be taken away if they can’t manage to get over that last hurdle on their first attempt?

We ask the question because of rumors swirling that a certain West Coast firm has been harsher than it historically has been in dealing with first-year associates who fail the biggest exam of their lives. From a tipster:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While [the firm] praises itself for being fiscally sound and providing job security, this Monday, the firm told the first year associates that did not manage to pass the bar the first time that [the firm] will not be giving them a second chance. This comes after we are seeing all-time-low passing rates in places like California and even more importantly, after the firm has told these brilliant people all the way back from OCI that they give the standard two attempts, influencing their decision on which offer to accept.

My colleagues had no warning and were led to believe that the firm has always given associates a second chance. There are even midlevel associates who have done it three times. People last year were also given a second chance, which is why I was shocked when one of the first-years walked into my office and told me what they have done to them. This information came with no warning, no precedent, and was handled poorly.

These smart people, some of whom I have had the pleasure of working with, had no warning and no notice. They were told they are being let go despite their excellent work product and stellar reviews, because of firm financial reasons. I guess they made the decision to match the 180 scale but that is how they then in turn began to treat us as associates?

This has definitely brought morale down and has made me reconsider my own views of the firm and how I feel about continuing to work here.

But here’s the rub: it seems that not all first time fail-ers were treated the same. Insiders at the firm have confirmed that others have gotten a reprieve and a second chance to pass the bar. While there don’t appear to be any hard and fast rules about which associates are beneficiaries of the “exception,” there does seem to be bitterness from those told to clear out their desks.

But should young associates get another bite at the apple? The difference in your day-to-day work between being an un-admitted associate and a junior associate that’s a member of the bar is… pretty much nothing. On the other hand, the firm is hiring (and paying) associates to be grown-up esquires, not just paralegals with more educational debt.

But a one-and-done policy is rough. Especially when others right down the hall are deemed worthy of an “exception.”

Perhaps it’s best to learn early in your career that it’s harsh out there. No one is looking out for you or rooting for your success.


It’s on you to figure out your career. If you’ve failed the bar and lost your job as a result, well, that’s two sucky things that’ve happened to you right in a row. But do not forget — rebounding is possible. You may wind up somewhere different than where you thought you’d be, however, that doesn’t mean it’s the end of your career. After all, bar exam failures can be [mayors](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/05/us/man-in-the-news-chicago-mayor-from-a-new-mold-richard-michael-daley.html), [governors](http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/david-paterson-visionary-new-yorker), [Biglaw partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/07/the-bar-exam-a-list-of-famous-failures/), or even [Supreme Court justices](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/ask-the-professor-what-happens-if-you-fail-the-bar-exam-3/).

# Ex-Biglaw Partner And Former Client Go At It In Criminal Case
## Greebel's defense will consist of throwing Shkreli under the bus.

Evan Greebel and Martin Shkreli

Remember Evan Greebel? He was a partner at Kaye Scholer (he’s since resigned) and was [arrested in 2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/pharma-karma-martin-shkreli-and-biglaw-partner-arrested/) for securities fraud. While a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman he was the attorney for Retrophin Inc. where Martin Shkreli — the former pharma king everyone loves to hate — was CEO. The crux of the government’s allegations is that the pair defrauded Retrophin in order to pay off Shkreli’s unrelated debts.

As we [previewed](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-biglaw-partner-evan-greebels-arrest/?rf=1) over a year ago, Shkreli is forwarding a theory that all of the questionable financial arrangements were signed off by Greebel. Indeed, his attorney, Benjamin Brafman, is pointing to thousands of emails between the two and millions paid in legal fees to argue “Greebel had detailed knowledge of the innermost aspects of Shkreli’s business.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now we know that Greebel’s defense will consist of throwing Shkreli under the bus, as [reported by Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/02/22/shkrelis-ex-lawyer-will-prosecute-him-at-fraud-trial-attorneys-say/):

Greebel’s lawyers, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher partners Reed Brodsky and Winston Chan and of counsel Lisa Rubin, said his defense will include “concomitant proof that Mr. Shkreli committed fraud—unbeknownst to Mr. Greebel—against investors. And, if the jury believes Mr. Greebel, the jury will necessarily find Mr. Shkreli guilty.”

“We intend to, in effect, prosecute Mr. Shkreli at trial for committing these acts of deception,” Gibson Dunn attorneys said.

So… yeah, the defendants have asked that their trials be separated.

Greebel’s attorneys are also taking shots at Shkreli’s behavior:

“Shkreli’s post-arrest conduct has been nothing short of bizarre,” they said, citing his social media remarks involving Taylor Swift, a Teen Vogue writer and Hillary Clinton.

Shkreli is “purposely creating a circus-like atmosphere … to disrupt the trial and achieve jury nullification along the lines of, in Mr. Shkreli’s own words, ‘O.J. Simpson [and] Casey Anthony’,” Gibson Dunn attorney said.

One thing is certain: the case will continue to keep Biglaw gossip mills churning.

# The Price Is Not Right
## Regrettably, coming on down is the last thing on the California State Bar's mind.

Here’s the latest from my State Bar of California. In January, it mailed all licensees to explain why it needed a large fee increase for the 2025 dues. Reasons include the following: dues assessed have been outpaced by inflation (so what else is new?); a high workload with funds spread thin (the bar says that California handles more complaints per attorney than any other state, so?); only one dues increase in the past 20 years (a lack of planning?); and, the need for an increase to fund disciplinary functions (no comment about this one).

The California Legislature holds the purse strings for the State Bar’s budget. I would think that there’s no shortage of groveling going on in Sacramento, given the Girardi fiasco and the bar’s apparent continuing inability to do more with less. (Why should it be different than anyone else in these times?)

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The State Bar seeks input from its licensees on possible ways to increase dues using different criteria in an effort, as the bar says, to “improve equity and sustainability.” (Ahem.) It’s looking into alternative fee structures based on years of practice, areas of practice, and income. The email suggests lawyers can comment on an “interactive thought exchange” through early March.

A dues structure built on years in practice might make sense, especially for newer lawyers, many of whom struggle to get a toehold in practice and don’t make much money, especially in the first five years or so (except if they are in Biglaw and then Biglaw firms usually pay bar dues as do many corporate law departments.)

This option is that the longer you’re an active licensee, the more you pay, regardless of income. Boo-hiss. Going inactive is not the answer if you want to continue to practice, whether for pay or pro bono, as inactive status can lead to unauthorized practice of law claims. Years in practice do not necessarily mean what the bar thinks it means — that the longer you practice, the more money you make. Not.

Dues structure based on income? How to calculate a fee structure based on income? Audit tax returns? I think not. Sign some kind of verification under penalty of perjury as to stated income? We all know how well “stated income” worked in the financial train wreck some years back.

Another option is the “practice sector based fee.” How would THAT work? What if your practice spans a number of areas? Do you say “eeny, meeny, miny, mo” and choose the practice area that provides the least amount of income so as to reduce the dues?

Lastly, there is the current “[share and share alike](https://fs22.formsite.com/sbcta/jo3kcdbfyn/index?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=295135990&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9tCuMs6f8o4Dp05Tu4hfa5ATkCy0tt5MJBD3xC_VIZsJ-EMiQspml4k1J7n2nBWvdQgCoWuWGlPOw0qLDdBnNrPYSe8-BBK9duf0ePLKW-2J4oRQA&utm_content=295135990&utm_source=hs_email)” model of the flat fee. I think that’s the fairest. (I’m ready for incoming flak.)

Lawyer comments show they are not happy campers. Many are figuratively blowing their stacks at any dues increase, given how many think that the bar has failed miserably in its job of “public protection.” Others think that basing fees on years in practice is a form of age discrimination, especially for those attorneys who are retired or semi-retired but who want to retain their active status.

Here’s a sample from the almost 3,000 or so posted to date:

“A ‘years in practice’ model penalizes those who have been in practice many years but who do not earn high income. One earning lower income despite many years in practice should not be caused to suffer high registration fees.”

“A 25% increase is outrageous and the idea of inflation-adjusted fees is specious. Similar states (NY, FL, TX) currently have lower fees than CA. CA has some of the highest bar dues already. Asking for more dues in the wake of a massive attorney discipline failure is embarrassing.”

“Significantly increasing fees without addressing Bar mismanagement is unacceptable. A lot of people making a lot of money are not doing their jobs competently.”

“The operative question should be how to cut unnecessary costs (e.g., by adopting the multistate bar exam), not how to equitably raise the fee. It’s telling that efforts to reduce cost is [sic] not even in the conversation. Both the attorneys and CA consumers are poorly served by the current system.”

“Years in Practice? Absurd and a violation of fairness to retirees or those with few cases, especially as this discriminates on [sic] elderly licensees. Can’t afford it.”

“Any fee increase in this time of high inflation and after the pandemic is egregious and should not happen. Lawyers are suffering except those in big firms (who don’t even pay their own dues). Any substantial fee increase will cause many to leave practice.”

“I want the State Bar to explain why they need to increase our fees. I want to know how the State Bar came up with this need to increase fees.”

“We already pay a significant licensing fee to be a member of the State Bar. I don’t exactly understand what I am paying for. This feels like a shake down.”

No words minced in these samplings. They highlight lack of transparency, mismanagement, and dismay at the seeming inability to manage the disciplinary function successfully. So, which fee structure increase would you choose? “None of the above” is not an option.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Ex-Biglaw Partner Arrested For Bankruptcy Fraud
## He owes the IRS more than $3.8 million.

Earlier this week, John Roesser, a former Biglaw partner, was arrested for making false statements and submitting falsified records in the course of his own bankruptcy proceeding. Roesser was a partner at five firms between 2010 and 2018, jumping from Seyfarth Shaw to Winston & Strawn to Alston & Bird to Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer before he finally landed at Dechert.

Being that he was a Biglaw partner, Roesser’s income was “substantial,” but so were his tax obligations. Those allegedly went unpaid, and he resigned from the New York bar in 2020 after he admitted to [misappropriating about $100,000](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/appellate-division-first-department/2020/2020-ny-slip-op-04525.html) in client funds from a post-arbitration settlement.

By 2022, Roesser had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to the indictment, owed more than $3.8 million in unpaid income taxes (including penalties and interest) while at the same time living in a multimillion-dollar house and owning an Astin Martin sports car. The [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/03/28/should-have-known-better-ex-am-law-100-partner-indicted-for-false-statements-fake-records-in-bankruptcy-proceedings/) has the details on what happened next:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Roesser] told the bankruptcy court that he would soon receive millions of dollars to pay his debts, according to the indictment. He then allegedly filed false declarations and submitted falsified bank records showing that he had, in fact, received millions of dollars.

“This was false,” prosecutors wrote. “Roesser was concealing that he had not received millions of dollars after all, in a fraudulent effort to retain control of his assets while avoiding payment of his debts.”

Roesser was later involved in sending a $3.9 million check from his debtor-in-possession account for the bankruptcy to the U.S. Treasury for his unpaid taxes, even though he knew the account “did not have a positive balance, let alone sufficient funds to pay the check.”

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams (SDNY) said of the charges that Roesser “should have known better—he used to be a lawyer.” Williams continued, stating, “This Office will always bring to justice those who use their status to abuse the public’s trust and to try to put themselves above the law.”

# Another Round Of Black Box Bonuses Spark Grumbles
## When firms introduce vague language, they only invite more questions.

Yet again, we’re hearing about another round of “black box bonuses” determined using some arcane formula. Unlike the old school model of transparent, lockstep bonuses, these firms invoke a lot of “entrepreneurship” rhetoric to convince associates that they should adore the firm’s opacity because it really means a motivated associate could take home far more than their peers at traditional powers. All they have to do is give up any sense of certainty that their compensation will necessarily match.

The firm always promises that, “for most people,” the bonuses meet or exceeded the market overall, but by shrouding the process in secrecy, individual associates never really know whether or not they’re getting the shaft compared to the rest of their class. And the firm banks on the sense of private shame to keep these associates from comparing notes lest they find out they really are the only one taking home half of a bonus.

DLA Piper follows this model and its announcement hit all the familiar notes:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
2018 Bonuses: Bonuses again were determined based on seniority, performance rating and total bonus hours (including billable, billable equivalent, shadowing, and pro bono hours), with the top bonuses being awarded to the highest rated associates with the highest hours. The vast majority of our high performing associates will receive bonuses at or above the widely published “market” scale. In addition, Associates who did not meet the requirements for the 2018 mid-year bonus as of June 30, 2018, but who met those requirements at year-end will receive increased payments reflecting those bonuses. As in the past, bonuses may be adjusted due to certain performance or other management concerns.

Seniority, performance ration, and hours are standard qualifiers. Even if performance rating introduces a lot of subjectivity to the equation, it’s unavoidable if the firm’s not ready to just give everyone their bonus like the traditionalist firms. But just when you thought the formula made a bit of sense, check out that “As in the past, bonuses may be adjusted due to certain performance or other management concerns” kicker.

It’s not so much whether or not DLA Piper really shafts people out of the blue as the fact that they build into their official announcement their willingness to do so. High performance ratings and great hours may still land an associate on the sad end of bonus season based on “other management concerns”? What the hell do performance ratings even mean then? It just smacks of shenanigans and that’s never a good look for a firm.

Because now we’re forced to ask “what would constitute an ‘other’ concern?” Is this where the firm decides they’re worried a female associate might be planning to have a baby? Implicit biases get translated into vague conclusions about “fitting in”? Or is this really just the firm’s cold offer move to get otherwise solid associates to move on without honestly telling them that partnership might be out of reach. We have no idea, but firms that level with their associates don’t have vague catch-all provisions when it comes to comp.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm With Over A Billion In Revenue Cuts Associate Salaries (And More!)
## Associates seem pretty bummed about the austerity measures.

Another top law firm has instituted cost-cutting measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019 Holland & Knight had gross revenue of $1,026,809,000, making it [number 38 on the Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#), but big revenue numbers in the past aren’t always enough to insulate Biglaw firms from the lurking economic uncertainty caused by coronavirus.

In a firmwide email ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/holland-knight-cuts/2/)), Managing Partner Steven Sonberg announced staff furloughs and salary cuts for partners, associates, and staff. Cuts to partner draws average 25 percent at the firm, and are done on a progressive scale. Associates, counsel, and senior professionals will see compensation cut by 17.5 percent. Staff making $75,000-$150,000 will have a 10 percent pay cut and staff making $150,000+ get a 15 percent reduction.

One tipster at the firm said of the cuts, “This is particularly discouraging as Holland & Knight is known for paying below market compensation even though they are billion dollar revenue firm.” Another said simply, “aw shucks.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A spokesperson for the firm provided the following statement on the austerity measures:

Holland & Knight announced today adjustments to the firm’s U.S. operations in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The plan includes temporary reductions in both partner draws and compensation for associates, counsel, senior professionals, and staff, as well as the furlough of some staff members.

Partner draws have been reduced on average by approximately 25% under a progressive scale that requires more highly compensated partners to absorb a higher percentage reduction. The firm will generally reduce the compensation of associates, counsel, and senior professionals by 17.5%. In addition, staff who earn more than $75,000 but less than $150,000 will have their compensation reduced by 10%, while staff who earn more than $150,000 will see a 15% reduction. Staff earning less than $75,000 will not be impacted.

The principal consideration in selecting staff for furlough was whether the current environment precluded or limited the firm from utilizing the staff members. Those furloughed will continue to receive their benefits during the furlough. All of these measures will remain in effect for the next 60 days, during which time the firm will evaluate the advisability of continuing, eliminating, or altering them.

In 2019, Holland & Knight’s revenue and net income increased for the tenth straight year. According to Steven Sonberg, the firm’s Managing Partner, “The firm entered the current crisis in a strong financial position. Nevertheless, it is not immune from the effects of the economic downturn. In order to meet the challenges we face, we are asking all members of Holland & Knight to sacrifice in some way as the firm continues to evaluate its operations. Our proactive, but measured, approach to management has served the firm well during the past and we are confident it will do so during this crisis.”

# The Cost Of Law Firm Associate Turnover

A client recently asked me an interesting question. 

“How much should we counteroffer an associate who has given notice?”

Many factors may play into that calculation. Some are specific to the particular associate. For example, how good is this associate’s work product? Other considerations are broader. Assume the firm makes a strong counteroffer for this associate. Will that set a precedent that encourages other associates to go out and get offers from rival firms?

But the core factor should be how much money the firm will lose if the associate leaves. Losses from lost billable hours, investments in the associate, and potentially turning away work. Add in the lost time spent recruiting and hiring on their own and a firm will face a larger cost than expected.

Lost billable hours loom largest

The most significant cost to a firm when an associate departs is lost billable hours. First are the hours lost from the departing associate. Practice groups run both lean and at full (if not above) capacity. And rarely do remaining associates have capacity to pick up hours without sacrifice. The result is a mixture of revenue loss and unhappy burned out associates.

Second are the less obvious loss of billable hours spent replacing the associate. Hours of billable time recruiting and interviewing candidates by partners and associates alike. Reviewing resumes. Conducting interviews. Taking candidates to lunch. Assessing conflicts checks. Training the replacement associate. The list never ends. Hours lost that could otherwise have brought in a new client or billed a current one.

How much does an associate departure cost?

The answer to this question depends on the seniority of the associate and how busy the group is at the time. Losing a key senior associate working a full plate that can’t easily transfer is the worst-case scenario. Losing a junior associate with spare hours will not be as costly.

A 2017 NALP Update on Associate Attrition pegged the cost of replacing an associate between $200,000 and $500,000. That may sound like a lot but a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that it doesn’t take much to reach $200,000.

Let’s assume that on an annualized basis the firm is collecting on 1600 of the associate’s billed hours, at an average rate of $750/hour. That generates annualized incremental gross revenue of $1.2 million. Also assume the associate’s compensation and benefits cost the firm a total of $400,000. If none of the associate’s hours transfer to others and the position was vacant for a year, the firm would lose $800,000. It only takes three months to hit $200,000 in lost profits. Next add lost revenue from partners and associates hiring instead of billing. Plus a potential signing bonus in a tight hiring market for certain practices. The NALP range not only becomes plausible, but likely.

Mitigating lost revenue

So, how much to counter offer? The answer is variable, but a strict cost-benefit analysis shows it can be a lot. But what about the hidden downstream cost? Will an effective counteroffer incentivize other associates to seek out their own counteroffers? Will the associate leave in a year anyways? If the answer is not an emphatic ‘no’ it may actually be more cost-effective to replace them. That’s where a firm working with a trusted recruiter can bring the cost down substantially. A firm may take four months or more to replace an associate—let alone bring the new hire up to speed. If a recruiter has the trust and backing of the firm, and fills the vacancy in two months, that’s a great deal for the firm. Increasing fees offered to recruiters reflects this basic economic calculus. Associate turnover is a part of life at law firms. A knee jerk decision to throw money at a departing associate may be the wrong move. Instead, firms should carefully and rationally weigh their options to determine the least costly path forward.

# Law Firm Replaces On-Campus Interviews With Speed Dating
## Getting your job should be more like dating.

It’s a long-standing joke that the brief, 15-20 minute on-campus interviews that law students stack back-to-back with with law firms throughout the day amount to an extended speed dating session. So it should come as no surprise that one law firm has taken the model to the next level and shifted its traditional on-campus interviewing more toward the speed dating model.

Vivia Chen, writing over at [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/30/firm-takes-its-cue-from-speed-dating/), has the scoop on a new practice from [Herrick Feinstein](http://www.herrick.com):

Then, with drinks in hand, each student picked a bar table and chatted up a hiring committee member for five minutes. (Students were told to come prepared with an elevator pitch on why they should be hired.) After five minutes, a bell rang, and students went to a new table to meet another lawyer. Repeat.

Interviewing should be more like dating. When you think about it, they both lead to the same emotional roller coaster: the thrill of that initial nibble of interest; the wild, intoxicated honeymoon of the summer; the grim reality of your first year; the nerve-racking senior days as you wait out the partnership proposal because you’re not getting any younger; and then you’re either dumped in favor of the next younger class or you settle into a lifetime of boring missionary legal practice.

Some may see this as a little less staid than the traditional model, but frankly this is a far superior approach to the initial interview. Moving from hotel room to hotel room to have one brief chat with, usually, a single lawyer from a firm offers almost nothing of value to either side. The applicant gets only a slim peek at the firm’s culture before moving on to a rival and the firm has only one snippet of face-to-face time to form their opinion before moving on to the callback.

The student now talks to a number of lawyers from the firm and has the opportunity to form a broader understanding of firm culture, while the firm has multiple, iterated chats with a specific applicant and can draw on the insights of a number of lawyers in forming the best decision before extending a callback. In a way, the traditional model of flitting from one isolated interaction to another is actually more like speed dating than what Herrick’s doing. And, let’s be honest, most of those 20-minute interviews are just time-killing exercises after a student is already plucked off the sheet based on their 1L transcript making the traditional model more like an in-person Tinder session than a substantive blind date.

That said, there are some potential downsides here worth considering. As shallow as a 20-minute interview can be, at least it’s a 20-minute interview. There’s an opportunity for follow-up questions and a genuine interchange. My on-campus interview with Cleary quickly veered off the canned introduction and became a full-scale defense of my undergrad thesis. That’s when I fell in love with the idea of working at Cleary and, apparently, they decided they liked me too. That talk definitely couldn’t have developed in the Herrick model. Could my connection have really formed after 5 minutes? Hard to say.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When stories add up about how [introverts make as good, if not better, lawyers](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/most_lawyers_are_introverted_and_thats_not_necessarily_a_bad_thing), Herrick has to worry that some of their best opportunities are slipping away because they just can’t shine in the tight, high energy format of speed dating. It’s going to be interesting to hear how Herrick feels about this process after next year’s summer program (and interesting to hear how applicants felt about going through it).

For now though, someone out there is taking a chance on a new approach and in this industry that sort of bold thinking is a rarity worth encouraging.

Just don’t give up an acceptance until at least the third callback.

# Yale Law Students Protest, Referring To School As 'Model Of Complicity' When It Comes To Sexual Harassment
## Is there nothing more important to YLS than its proximity to power and prestige?

Yesterday, the world learned what many people in legal academia had already known for years — that the Tiger Mother herself, Yale Law professor Amy Chua, had been [grooming women for their clerkship interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/no-accident-brett-kavanaughs-female-law-clerks-looked-like-models-yale-professor-told-students/?rf=1) with Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, suggesting that they “dress to exude a ‘model-like’ femininity.” In fact, Chua apparently prides herself on her ability to prep and preen the women she sent to Kavanaugh’s chambers, having reportedly told a group of law students that it was “not an accident” that all of his female law clerks “looked like models.”

At the same time, it was disclosed that Chua’s husband, Yale Law professor Jed Rubenfeld — who had reportedly warned a student to [avoid clerking](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yale-student-brett-kavanaugh-clerkship-look_us_5ba2f051e4b0181540d9e2bb) with Kavanaugh — is the subject of an internal investigation at the school having to do with allegations of harassment of and inappropriate conduct towards female students. All of this news, of course, came hot on the heels of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh of an attempted sexual assault while they were in high school.

Students of all stripes at Yale were already [displeased](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/students-disturbed-by-yales-silence-on-sexual-assault-accusations-against-judge-brett-kavanaugh/) with the way the school has handled the situation, calling for Dean Heather Gerken to rescind her “endorsement” of Kavanaugh and speak out against him. Now, in the wake of the revelations about Professor Chua’s role as Kavanaugh’s clerkship madam, law students are protesting.

These posters were displayed at Yale Law this morning, to illustrate the ways in which the school has shielded sexual harassers and abusers from accountability:








In [response to the controversies](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/details-on-the-allegations-against-and-yale-law-school-investigation-into-professor-jed-rubenfeld/) Yale Law is dealing with, Dean Gerken told members of the community that “[f]aculty misconduct has no place at Yale Law School,” and that “appropriate action” would be taken on any complaints, as “[t]he Law School has a responsibility to provide a safe environment in which all of our students can live and learn in a community of mutual respect, free of harassment of any kind.” But in times like these, Gerken’s assurances are just words until actions are taken.

One such action has already been taken by the Yale Law faculty (with some key people missing, of course), in encouraging the Senate Judiciary Committee to treat Dr. Blasey Ford with respect and allow the FBI the time necessary to investigate the allegations that have been made. Their open letter to the SJC can be found on the next page.

UPDATE (1:55 p.m.): Dean Gerken released the [following statement](https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/dean-gerken-statement-open-letter-faculty) related to the faculty’s open letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee:

As Dean of the Law School I have not and cannot take a position for or against a nominee (see our policy below). It’s a thoughtful statement and I support the efforts of individual faculty members to engage with these important issues.

*Yale Law School is a nonpartisan institution. While individual faculty members may make comments regarding a particular candidate, the Law School neither endorses nor opposes candidates for office.

What will happen to Professor Chua and Professor Rubenfeld for their respective roles in this #MeToo mess? Yes, they are tenured members of the faculty, but students do not deserve to be treated like this — especially at a school like Yale Law, which holds itself out as a bastion of high intellect and character. As one of the student protest signs wonders, “Is there nothing more important to YLS than its proximity to power and prestige?” We suppose we’ll have to wait and see just how important it is.

# Are You Pissed About Your Bonus? You're Not Alone...

Biglaw bonus season has been rolling on for about a month now, and we can tell that there’s some discontent among the ranks of associates. While associates at many firms will take home up to six-figure sums of bonus cash, associates at other firms will receive significantly less money. There is anger afoot, and we’ve received complaints.

This associate has a bone to pick about Sidley Austin’s [new bonus structure](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/will-individualized-bonuses-be-a-boon-for-sidley-associates/):

The “individualized” bonus email is a red herring. They said at the town hall meeting that the firm will retain its requirement to bill a minimum of 2000 hours to earn any bonus (note the “general eligibility criteria” mentioned in the e-mail). All this appears to be very off-market compared to peer firms, the majority of which do not have any minimum billable requirements, and many associates are pissed / anticipating to be pissed. They stated at the town hall that 560 associates are getting a bonus, and there are about 1100 total associates, which is roughly only 50-60%.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This Bryan Cave associate is right to be miffed about the firm’s [overly complex](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/firms-complex-bonus-structure-providing-most-associates-with-less-than-their-peers/) — and in many cases, overly undermarket — bonus system:

Reaction amongst a few of us here — unhappy we’re not even close to the Cravath scale (in bonus or in salary) despite merger talks with BLP heating up.

Who else out there knows the holidays won’t be happy (at least money-wise)? Drop us an [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Angry%20About%20%5BFirm%5D%20Bonus) and let us know — please feel free to vent to us.

# Steno’s Web Deposition Software Now Available As A Zoom App For Easy Exhibit Marking And Sharing
## Learn how Steno Connect has been built to make it easier for legal professionals to use platforms like Zoom for remote depositions and exhibit handling.

[](https://info.abovethelaw.com/hubfs/StenoConnectZoomApp-Featured-png-1280%C3%97720-.png)Ever since its founding in 2018, [Steno](https://bit.ly/3QjWek5) has been on a mission to disrupt depositions. It started as a court reporting agency that also offered non-recourse financing of deposition costs, and then in 2020 launched [Steno Connect](https://bit.ly/46LXJyC), its own web-based video conferencing technology specifically built for remote depositions and exhibit handling.

In the early days of the pandemic when the company developed Steno Connect, it did so to provide lawyers with an alternative to Zoom for depositions. At the time, many legal professionals were concerned about the security of Zoom meetings and many others were unable to install the Zoom client.

But in the years since, as Zoom has enhanced its security and functionality, and as it has become ubiquitous among lawyers and legal professionals, Steno’s customers began asking for Steno Connect to add more of the kinds of features they regularly used in Zoom, such as breakout rooms, chats, and virtual backgrounds.

“We were forcing our customers to choose between the experience of Zoom and the functionality of Steno Connect,” said [Dylan Ruga](https://bit.ly/3s4d8vj), Steno’s president and cofounder and a Los Angeles-based litigator.

Rather than continue down that path, Steno decided to take the functionality of its web platform and rebuild it as a Zoom app, so its customers could get the best of both worlds. The app is now available in the Zoom app store and, in launching it, Steno becomes the only court reporting agency with a Zoom integration, according to Ruga.

Easy Exhibit Handling

For depositions, the key functionality that Steno Connect brings to Zoom is exhibit handling. With the app installed, lawyers get drag-and-drop functionality to upload, preview, number, share and annotate exhibits during a deposition, and then save them all back to Steno’s Firm Dashboard.

The app appears as a panel to the right of the Zoom screen. (See image above.) Within it, the lawyer can upload exhibits to be marked, either by dragging them to the app or by selecting specific files. Once the exhibits are uploaded, the lawyer can preview the unmarked exhibits, without anyone else able to see them.

[](https://info.abovethelaw.com/hubfs/Screenshot-2023-09-11-at-2-14-51-PM-png-1437%C3%97957-.png)
Sharing an exhibit in Zoom via the Steno Connect app.

When the lawyer wants to mark an exhibit, the lawyer simply selects “Introduce.” The app assigns an exhibit number (which the lawyer can edit) and asks the lawyer to confirm that that the exhibit should be introduced.

The numbered exhibit then appears in the marked exhibits window at the top of the app. There, lawyers can still preview exhibits or, when ready, present them, which opens the exhibit and shares it with everyone.

The app also allows exhibits to be annotated in Zoom and saved with the annotations.

On the back end, all the marked exhibits are downloaded to Steno’s system so that they are available when the deposition is over.

You can install the app directly from the Zoom apps store, but in order to use it, you have to be in a Zoom meeting initiated through Steno. Participants in the deposition get an invite to a Steno Connect web page, from which they can open the Zoom session. (Zoom enterprise accounts may require permission from an administrator.)

Even if a user does not have the Steno Connect app installed, the user can still upload and access shared exhibits from the initial Steno sign-in page.

Once you have the Steno Connect app installed, you can invite other meeting participants to install it.

Disrupting Depositions

In May, [Steno raised $15 million](https://bit.ly/3Mm1aUy) in a series B round, with the goal of continuing in its mission to revolutionize depositions and litigation support services.

Ruga, a former Steptoe & Johnson partner who founded his own plaintiffs’ litigation firm in 2016, first conceived of the company as a vehicle for financing deposition costs.

He took the idea to [Greg Hong](https://bit.ly/49gq1mv), an entrepreneur who had previously founded Reserve, a restaurant reservation system, and [sold it in 2018](https://blog.resy.com/newsroom/reserve/) to another restaurant reservation company, [Resy](https://bit.ly/49d8StX), which was later acquired by American Express. Together with CTO [Dan Anderson](https://bit.ly/40glwEq), they launched Steno in 2018 as a court reporting agency paired with the non-recourse payment option, DelayPay.

After the pandemic shut down live depositions, the company developed [Steno Connect](https://bit.ly/46LXJyC), a remote video deposition platform, and then [Digital Firm Dashboard](https://bit.ly/476lcKC), on which a firm can manage all its litigation support services.

[Bob Ambrogi](https://bit.ly/3QGDgpy) [](https://www.lawnext.com/)is a lawyer, veteran legal journalist, and award-winning blogger and podcaster. In 2011, he was named to the inaugural Fastcase 50, honoring “the law’s smartest, most courageous innovators, techies, visionaries and leaders.” Earlier in his career, he was editor-in-chief of several legal publications, including The National Law Journal, and editorial director of ALM’s Litigation Services Division.

Check out all our ideological diversity!

Over at Volokh Conspiracy, everyone’s really hot for law schools to consider some more “viewpoint diversity,” which is their trumped up complaint that law schools aren’t hiring enough people willing to reduce a Con Law semester to a guy in a tri-corner hat delivering a 20-minute dramatic reading of the Constitution.

To the folks over there: you seem to be having fun writing [open letters to the Association of American Law Schools](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/02/25/our-letter-to-the-association-of-american-law-schools/?utm_term=.e2a5dc7aa872), earnestly imploring them to investigate the dearth of conservative and libertarian professors, but… just stop. Seriously, just stop because you’re generally smart people and this new hobby horse is getting downright offensive. This is going to sound harsh, but it’s tough love. I don’t think you’re trying to sound this racist and sexist, but that’s what’s coming across, so it’s time for a timeout, okay?

Let’s take a second to discuss what “diversity” means in the hiring context, shall we?

See, there are these are individuals from groups that face systemic and unwarranted discrimination based on immutable characteristics, and whose underrepresentation in the legal academy is a product of that discrimination as it compounded itself over the years. No black law professors means fewer role models and mentors for black law students looking to enter the profession. Fast forward a decade and the problem is worse because a generation of scholars who might have joined the profession are left outside. Hence the professional interest in diversity.

On the other hand, being a conservative is not to be the victim of systemic and unwarranted discrimination. And if you think, “MSNBC says I’m stupid” is systemic and unwarranted discrimination then you’ve got what we term “a persecution complex.” Seek help.

To put it more bluntly: you’re literally getting judged on content, and not the color of your skin, or your sex, or gender identification, or religion, or national origin. Sorry, the Dr. King test has spoken.

But you’ve nonetheless appropriated the rubric of diversity and clumsily appended it to your, frankly, whiny snowflake complaints about law schools not appreciating your work. See how that is prima facie demeaning to victims of racial, sexual, or any other form of discrimination based on some immutable characteristic? Because as it is, this looks like you woke up one day and said “hey, that Latina benefitted from this ‘diversity’ thing, so we should get some of that too?” Probably not what you were aiming for.

You sound like the kids in school who watched the diabetic kid get force-fed a cookie after a blood sugar crash and demanded cookies for the whole class. But I guess textualism is the celebration of contextual ignorance so maybe this shouldn’t be surprising.

So this is why you can’t try and crowd in on the rhetoric of diversity. But at least “viewpoint diversity” is ever-so-slightly less offensive than the language of “intolerance” that kicks off Randy Barnett’s post featuring this infamous open letter to AALS. Quoting a speech by John Etchemendy:

Over the years, I have watched a growing intolerance at universities in this country – not intolerance along racial or ethnic or gender lines – there, we have made laudable progress. Rather, a kind of intellectual intolerance, a political one-sidedness, that is the antithesis of what universities should stand for. . . .

Not since D.W. Griffith filmed Intolerance has there been a more suspect hijacking of the concept. I doubt law professors really want to pull this thread. Because this is the rhetoric of politicians who want intelligent design added to Biology textbooks to “present both sides.” Academic freedom isn’t a virtue per se, it’s a tool to encourage new, unconventional thinking to build on the accumulated knowledge of society. Freedom doesn’t require medical schools to tolerate the guy who still swears by phrenology.

That’s what tenure is for.

Look, there’s a marketplace of ideas. Go out and win there if you can. If you can’t, then that actually is what the university should stand for. Unlike the disingenuous arguments of the sort of people who think the progress on [racial](http://jezebel.com/reports-black-uva-student-beaten-by-police-for-having-1692199936), [ethnic](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/midwest/ct-wisconsin-stout-saudi-college-student-dead-20161101-story.html), and [gender](http://www.baylorbears.com/sports/m-footbl/bay-m-footbl-body.html) lines in the American university can be described as “laudable” — as opposed to, say, “interminably slow yet mercifully steady” — there really isn’t anything stopping conservative academics from pulling their themselves up by their Bluebooking bootstraps.

It’s just not “intolerance” when the market doesn’t value your ideological scholarship — as opposed to non-ideological “practical” scholarship — as much as you might wish it did. That’s the market. On the other hand, in [a post yesterday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/03/01/what-is-the-association-of-american-law-schools-afraid-of/?utm_term=.30390d84a548) suggesting the AALS was “scared” because they refuse let their data on hiring practices be deployed in service of this farce, Jonathan Adler raised what some suggested a market failure in hiring:

As I’ve [noted before](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/11/01/on-the-causes-of-ideological-imbalance-in-the-academy/?utm_term=.2670c587f6e2), there is almost some degree of self-selection (i.e., some conservatives and libertarians are more likely to pursue more remunerative careers than some liberals). At the same time, academic institutions — like many other institutions — tend to replicate themselves, meaning that they are institutionally unlikely to diversify themselves without concerted effort.

That’s actually how it always works. Libertarians are so cute when they see decisions made based on “imperfect” factors like comfortability and tradition and try to find any way to say, “well that’s not the free market Ayn Rand told me about!” Yeah, I remember when I learned that Optimus Prime wasn’t really coming to my birthday party. It’s tough to have your dreams dashed, but you can pick up the pieces.

Once you’ve put your intellectual faith in the power of the free market, then these are the lumps you have to take. If you don’t like it then, well, that might explain why the rest of the academy doesn’t have a lot of patience for your ideology.

But, hey, maybe there’s some unique advantage to hiring more FedSoc panelists beyond the work they’re putting out:

Training lawyers requires teaching students how to understand and get inside the arguments of those with differing interests, outlooks and orientations. It requires developing the ability to understand and articulate points of view that one does not believe. Doing this effectively requires exposure to differing points of view, and this is more difficult to achieve when faculties are ideological monocultures and echo chambers.

That’s a bit hyperbolic. When that future associate is up at 2 a.m. drafting that debt offering or toiling over that motion in limine they really aren’t going to say, “I had no idea how to put this together, but thankfully one of my professors thought clean water regulations were fascist so I’m golden.” Also, it’s not like left-leaning educators have their Devil’s Advocate powers lobotomized out of them the moment they first decided women deserve equal pay for equal work. My professor from the Bush the Elder administration was just as adept at spinning liberal justifications during Socratic questioning as my Carter administration IRS commissioner professor was at channeling the nascent Tea Partiers.

But even if that’s not a great argument for hiring more conservative professors, it is a very good reason not to exclude a conservative professor from a faculty outright. Excellent educators come in all ideological stripes. Well, maybe not the hip geologist prof going down the “Young Earth” road, but that’s not really what we’re talking about here.

But the point is, no matter where this whole inquiry goes, knock off the  “diversity” and “intolerance” terminology. If you simply can’t help but concoct an awkward, early-90s political correctness inspired name for your professional griping, just label academia “Originalist Challenged.”

It’s just as descriptive and doesn’t come across as callously tone-deaf to actual discrimination.

# An Authentic Reason For Staying In Touch

I recently heard a speaker talk about making persuasive presentations. But she veered off into business development. She told the audience that one way to impress people (or to develop business) is to “develop an authentic reason to stay in touch.”

That is very fine advice.

When I worked in private practice, I did just that — and I did it innocently. I wasn’t calculating what I could entice a colleague into reading, or whether that person could give me business, or whether the person held a position sufficiently high in an organization to be worthwhile. I just shared with people things that might interest them.

A friend works in some business. An article in the Journal reports that two of his competitors are merging. So I send a note: “On the off-chance that you didn’t see it this morning (because it was buried on page six), here’s a link to an article in today’s Journal reporting that [two of your competitors are merging]. I trust all’s well.”

A friend works in some other business. A case comes down that could affect that business dramatically. So I send a note: “It hasn’t yet been widely reported, but the Second Circuit handed down this morning its decision in X v. Y. The court decided in favor of Y, upholding the defense of [whatever]. I thought you’d be curious.”

One of my partners works in some field of law about which I know nothing. Something happens in my field that could affect hers. So I send her a note: “In a case that basically involves [my field], a court just held that [whatever]. I thought you might deploy that to good use.”

When I wrote those notes, I wasn’t being a pain in the neck. (Generally.)

I wasn’t trolling for business. (Really. I didn’t even have my eye on that ball.)

I was just alive. I saw something that might interest a colleague, and I shared it.

But, on reflection, that’s effective business development. When a person has a hiring decision to make, you’ll be top of mind. Or when your partner moves in-house years from now, your partner will remember that you were a curious person who was helpful.

That’s not bad.

Firms, as opposed to individuals, are not nearly as good at this.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Firms like to talk about themselves: “Bigg & Mediocre hired three laterals.” “Bigg & Mediocre represented the buyer in a billion-dollar energy deal.” “Eight Bigg & Mediocre lawyers were listed in the list of great lawyers.” Whatever.

I don’t care.

Really.

If you were an individual, and all you did was send me emails bragging about your accomplishments, I’d stop reading your emails pretty quickly. If you’re a law firm, and all you do is brag to me about your accomplishments, I stop reading your communications.

Why not find an authentic reason to stay in touch instead?

And some firms do, of course. I may actually care about changes to the California labor law, or the new Delaware law on proxies, or whatever. And your firm sends me the descriptions of those laws that your lawyers prepared.

But I’ve noticed something about those descriptions: Many of them are set up as clickbait. They give a teaser in the headline, offering to reveal the interesting stuff only if I peek inside.

Why set things up that way? I suspect that your marketing department cares about clicks; it shows they’re doing something: “Nearly 100 people opened the attachment! See how great we’re doing?”

But you’re not selling clicks; you’re selling law. You really don’t care how many people clicked through to see what was inside; you care about how many people saw your firm’s name attached to an intelligent idea. (A defensive lineman once said that “one sack is worth 1000 hurries.” There’s a law firm analogy: “One retention is worth 1000 clicks.”) There’s no reason to hide the good stuff inside a law firm brochure. If you have something smart to say, and you’ve decided to publish it, then put it where people see it.

Here’s just one example: “Attached please find Bigg & Mediocre’s annual survey of deals. Read it to get vital ideas about how people are structuring deals, what new provisions are being included, blah, blah, blah.”

Clickbait.

Maybe there’s something good inside; more likely, not.

If you have something interesting to say, say it first: “Bigg & Mediocre’s annual survey of deals shows that 57 percent of transactional documents do not include [some provision that a reader might think is worthwhile]. A recent change in Delaware law makes that provision more dangerous than it’s worth. For that and similar insights, read the whole report.”

Maybe I will.

Some places sell clicks (not to point any fingers around here). You don’t. You’re selling law.

Find an authentic reason to stay in touch, and don’t hide the reason behind a link.

You’re reinforcing connections, not trying to deceive readers into opening links that won’t interest them.

# Biglaw Firms Without Office Attendance Mandates Are Figuring Out What Works -- And What Doesn't
## It turns out Gen Z wants to be in the office for more human interaction and mentoring. Who knew?

Biglaw associates across the country are begrudgingly getting used to the fact that they’re going to be expected in the office more — a lot more, at some firms. With several top-ranked firms now mandating that associates be at their desks four days a week, West Coast firms that have resisted making these moves are looking better and better.

But some of these fantasy firms — where a four-day in-office work week is “simply not West Coast work culture” — are seeing trouble rise to the surface when it comes to creating meaningful in-person sessions for their younger associates. How are these problems being solved? The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2023/08/24/the-vibe-is-changing-flexible-firms-struggle-to-get-attorneys-on-the-same-page/) has the details:

[Major, Lindsey & Africa recruiter Kate Reder] Sheikh said the most effective approach she’s seen is core days—where attorneys are able to settle on two or three days for an entire practice group or team to be together in the office.

“Ultimately, where the majority of associates have landed is they want to be trusted to do their work where they are, and they want community and mentoring from their team when they come in,” she said.

Junior and midlevel associates especially “want to be in the thick of things, getting exposure to as much as possible in different specialties within their practice group,” [Lorraine Connally, a recruiter at Swan Legal Search] said. “They tend to be sponges at this level, and want to learn as much as possible.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
What’s happened to the Biglaw associate who had no desire to go to the office? According to Sheikh, there’s been a “metamorphosis” of sorts among the youngest members of Gen Z who are now entering the Biglaw workforce. “The vibe is changing,” Sheikh said, “because they have different needs.”

And how will Biglaw be able to cater to all generations of associates, who all want different things from their work experiences, all at the same time? There’s definitely going to be a bit of a learning curve here, but at least firms know what not to do.

“What is not effective is telling people to be in a few days a week, but there’s no one else there,” said Sheikh. “The experience people are having, anecdotally, is they are going into the office because it’s required or expected, and all of their meetings are on Zoom anyway.”

Much like their associates, Biglaw is still figuring this out, and hopefully things will come together in the right way sooner rather than later. For the time being, what we know is this: attendance mandates make associates feel like they’re being punished, so it’s on the firms to make associates’ time in the office feel more valuable.

Another Biglaw firm is dumping big money on associates to stay at the top of the salary mountain.

The latest firm to announce their own match of the Cravath scale is none other than Schulte Roth & Zabel, which took in $444,700,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 90th in the Am Law 100. The firm [previously announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/schulte-raises-22/) a match of the Davis Polk scale, but now that Cravath has come over the top, so has Schulte.

For those who have not yet memorized the new scale, this is the compensation grid at Schulte:



The raises are retroactive to January 1. You can read the full memo [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/srz-re-raise-22/2/).

# Reports Of Associate Stealth Layoffs At Am Law 100 Firm
## Of course the firm calls them 'productivity and performance'-based terminations.

For a couple of weeks, we here at Above the Law have been hearing rumors of stealth layoffs at Fox Rothschild, a firm that rose to 69th on the most recent edition of the Am Law 100.

For those who might only be hearing the term for the first time, stealth layoffs allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that there were economic-based layoffs. So, they’ll give the associates X number of months/weeks to find a new job and the firm frequently couches the reductions in performance review terms, that just, purely coincidentally, happen in the midst of an economic downturn. By their secretive nature, they can be challenging to confirm in specific numbers, but insiders slowly find out something is amiss.

Fox Rothschild [previously cut salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-goes-with-good-news-bad-news-approach-to-covid-19-austerity-measures/) amid the economic upheaval surrounding COVID-19, but multiple tipsters at the firm have reported layoffs — given the veneer of performance-related terminations.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
the firm fires people, mainly attorneys across all offices in a matter of one-two weeks and tries to give pretextual reasons for the firing, not admitting they are of course COVID-related financial cut backs.

We reached out to the firm, and they were able to confirm firing associates (though a smaller number than what tipsters are reporting). Mark Morris, Firmwide Managing Partner, had this to say about the terminations:

6 associates from Fox Rothschild were terminated. These dismissals stem from productivity and performance issues. We are assisting these individuals in their job transition.

Best of luck to those associates who now find themselves looking for work (and health insurance) amid a global pandemic/economic downturn.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Photo by Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her husband, Marty Ginsburg, modeled a true partnership in pursuit of gender equity. Their commitment to equal justice pervaded their personal and professional lives and will have a lasting impact on the legal profession and our society. To honor their legacy, the [Center for Women in Law](https://law.utexas.edu/cwil/) at the University of Texas School of Law is proud to announce the [Ginsburg Initiative](https://law.utexas.edu/cwil/ginsburg-initiative/), which will advance gender-neutral initiatives that support systemic change, such as best practices surrounding work assignments, performance expectations, parental leave, and transparency in career development.

On Tuesday, February 2, to mark the launch of the Ginsburg Initiative, the Center will host a virtual panel discussion on the life and legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which Lateral Link is proud to sponsor. The panel discussion will be moderated by Nina Totenberg — NPR’s celebrated legal affairs correspondent, as well as a [longtime friend of Justice Ginsburg](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/19/896733375/a-five-decade-long-friendship-that-began-with-a-phone-call) — and will feature four former RBG clerks:

- [Ryan Park](https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-josh-stein-announces-transitions-in-solicitor-generals-office/), Solicitor General, the State of North Carolina;
- [Alexandra A.E. Shapiro](https://www.shapiroarato.com/person/alexandra-shapiro/), Partner, Shapiro Arato Bach;
- [Amanda Tyler](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/amanda-tyler/), Shannon Cecil Turner Professor of Law, UC Berkeley School of Law; and
- The Honorable [Paul J. Watford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_J._Watford), Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
The event is free and open to the public, and it has been approved for 1.25 hours of CLE credit (in Texas and reciprocal jurisdictions). Please [register here](https://utexas.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_XFEXqqWgQKmAdyOx9TlrRw?utm_source=Master+List-Alum+and+PR%2FSummit+Attendee&utm_campaign=63c7bdddc6-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_03_04_13_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6bc543fc6c-63c7bdddc6-333836808) for what will surely be a fascinating discussion about one of the most important and groundbreaking figures in American history.

Meanwhile, here at Lateral Link we have been working on the development of a new podcast focused on the Biglaw lateral market, entitled “Movers, Shakers, and Rainmakers.” Each week, my colleague [Zach Sandberg](https://www.laterallink.com/team/zach-sandberg/) and I will dissect some of the most significant recent lateral partner moves, discuss important trends in the legal market, and provide you with the news you need to know about the ever-changing ecosystem of the world’s largest law firms. If you have suggestions for topics or guests for the podcast, please reach out [to me](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com?subject=Podcast%20Idea) or [to Zach](mailto:mailto:zsandberg@laterallink.com?subject=Podcast%20Idea).

We look forward to hearing from you, and we look forward to seeing you on February 2!

The junior partner was elated:  “I just landed a big case in Los Angeles!”

The senior partner was much calmer:  “Congratulations.  How do you plan to staff it?”

“I’m going to call the head of the LA office this afternoon and ask for help.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Are you nuts?”

“What?”

“Don’t call the head of the LA office.  The head of the LA office has one objective:  To keep everyone in LA busy, so the office looks good at the end of the year.  When you ask the head of the LA office for help, he’ll find the one lawyer who has nothing to do, and he’ll assign that lawyer to your case, to keep the lawyer busy.”

“So?”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“Any associate in this firm who’s any good has too much work to do.  Partners are fighting for the associate’s time.  The person with nothing to do is terrible.  He produces garbage, so nobody wants to use him.  That’s why he’s sitting around twiddling his thumbs.  Call the head of the LA office to ask for help, and that’s the person who’ll be assigned to your case.”

“What should I do?”

“Is there anyone you know and trust in LA?  Call someone in LA who you personally know and trust.  Ask that person to recommend a good associate to you.  Then call the associate directly, and entice the associate to work on your new matter.  Whatever you do, don’t call the head of the office.”

“I never would have thought of that.  Thanks for the suggestion.”

“No problem.  By the way, who are you using here in Chicago for help on your new case?”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“I’m using [Jarndyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce).  Jarndyce helped me on my last case, and she was spectacular.  I’m asking her to help again.”

“Is Jarndyce really good?”

“Terrific.  She’s one of the best associates I’ve ever worked with.”

“You’d better keep that under your hat.”

“Huh?”

“If you ever find any associates who are worth a damn, you don’t want your partners to know the associates’ names.  Your partners will steal those people from you.”

“Huh?”

“The average associate around here is average.  That’s not very good.  No partner wants typical associates working on the partner’s cases.  Partners wants the few great associates that we have, so the partners are able to produce great quality work for their clients.  If you ever stumble onto associates who are good, the last thing you want is for everybody else to know their names.”

“Can I ever tell anyone that associates are good?”

“Sure — at review time.  When we’re reviewing associates, you want our management to know which are the quality associates, and you want to help the careers of those people.  But that’s it.  Otherwise, tell people you don’t know any good associates — or tell people that the bad associates are good.”

“How long have you been working here at Bigg & Mediocre?”

“Ever since I graduated from law school 25 years ago. Trust me.  I’ve seen a lot.”

# Biglaw Firm Gets To The Business Of Raises AND High Biller Bonuses
## Happy (money) days are here again.

Good times are back for folks at Winston & Strawn! After what could be characterized as a bumpy 2020 (and really, whose 2020 wasn’t — at least at times — shit) the firm’s back to handing out the big bucks to associates.

[Back in September of 2020, we reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/associate-layoffs-and-staff-cuts-come-to-am-law-50-biglaw-firm/) that the firm, ranked #45 on the latest Am Law 100 list, was letting go a number of associates and staff, and that was after they’d already[ cut partner compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-top-50-firm-cuts-partner-compensation-in-half-over-covid-19-concerns/) as part of their COVID-19 austerity measures. But we are very much in the “post” now, and Winston’s fortunes have turned around.

[In December](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/winston-2020-bonuses/), the firm handed out market bonuses, and also got on the [special bonus train ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/winston-special-bonuses/)earlier this year (and also announced an increase to the firm’s high biller pool), so things are very much back to normal at the firm. On June 11, they quickly matched the Milbank scale, but now that the slightly higher DPW scale is dominating the industry, they’re ready to match that as well.

You can read the [full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/winston-raises/2/).

Plus, remember those increased high biller bonuses? The firm announced more details on those. The pool is anticipated to be at least 75 percent larger, and they’ll kick in at 2,100 hours (which is lower than the historical threshold). The scale of those bonuses is as follows:

# Unlike Most Other Biglaw Firms, Cravath Bucks The Trend Of Record Partnership Class Sizes
## An interesting announcement as Biglaw bonus season is set to begin.

Thanks to the hot lateral market, Biglaw firms are handing out partnership offers like candy, perhaps as a way to keep their best associates from fleeing to another firm. Biglaw firms have continuously announced [record partnership class sizes](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-firms-scared-of-losing-associates-are-making-them-partner/) in response to the ongoing talent war, but one prestigious firm doesn’t seem interested in keeping up with the Kirklands (a firm where a record [151 lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/worlds-wealthiest-law-firm-announces-colossal-partner-class/) were elevated to partner).

It was just last year that Cravath boasted one of its largest partnership classes in recent memory — and its [most diverse partnership class](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/cravath-makes-history-in-diversity-with-its-new-partnership-class/?rf=1) in history — by promoting 11 associates. This year, the firm [returned to its old ways](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/11/18/a-year-after-largest-partner-class-ever-cravath-returns-to-5-year-average/), inviting six associates to become members of its partnership. Cravath has had a 6.4 new partners per-year average over the course of the past five years.

It was July when we wondered if the pandemic had [broken the Cravath system](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/did-the-pandemic-break-the-cravath-system/). After all, the firm that typically shies away from laterals was hiring an “attorney talent recruitment manager.” Back then, the firm was willing to join the crusade to gobble up laterals but now it seems to be bucking the Biglaw trend of making partnership promotions en masse.

What other trends will Cravath be willing to buck?

Biglaw is on the precipice of 2021’s year-end bonus season, and after a year marked by bonuses upon bonuses upon bonuses, associates across the country are waiting and watching to see what Cravath will do. The firm was once the market leader for salaries and bonuses, but has allowed others to take the lead in recent years. Associates think it’s time for a change — and a big one, at that.

The $15,000 to $100,000 seniority-based bonus scale has been in place for years on end. Will Cravath step up to the plate, retake its place at the top of the compensation ladder, and offer associates more money? We suppose we’ll soon see.

Congratulations to Cravath’s new partners!

# Now That Abortion Rights Have Been Decimated, Biglaw Leader Offers Heartfelt Message Of Support For Lawyers
## This is the perfect example of what Biglaw firms can do to help their attorneys right now.

Now that the Supreme Court has laid waste to nearly 50 years of precedent by overturning Roe v. Wade with its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, attorneys have been left wondering what comes next. For many, it’s a truly depressing day to be a lawyer in America. How can we possibly reconcile the destruction of the fundamental right to choose against the fractured political framework that seeks to deny our reproductive freedom? When your bodily autonomy is under attack, it’s incredibly distracting, to say the very least.

While some firms have released statements reminding associates that they should [try to be collegial](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/abortion-rights-are-about-to-be-destroyed-so-biglaw-firm-piles-on-the-bullsht/) during these divisive times, others are making their priorities known, and the contrast is stark.

[Julie Jones](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/biographies/j/julie-h-jones), the chair of Ropes & Gray, released the following statement just minutes after the Supreme Court released its opinion in Dobbs. We will let the statement speak for itself. Please let it serve as a lesson on what Biglaw leaders across the country can do guide their attorneys in times like these.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This morning, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, ending 50 years of federal constitutional protection of abortion rights.  The Dobbs ruling has created extraordinarily strong feelings in many of us.  As a lawyer, I reflect on Supreme Court jurisprudence, the principle of stare decisis and the future of privacy rights and other civil right protections in the United States.   As a woman, I have a profound feeling of vulnerability caused by the elimination of a long-standing right of women – a right that affects their bodies and their agency.  As a person with privilege, I recognize and worry about the decision’s disproportionate impact on women with limited resources.   As an American, I fear the divisive nature of this topic will further fracture an already angry and divided citizenry. As a leader of Ropes & Gray, I am concerned about the effect of this decision on our community.  We have strong, principled and differing beliefs on abortion rights within the firm; even in our very respectful community, internal dialogue about the Dobbs decision and its consequences could be imbued with bitterness. This very writing, which I undertook because of the gravity of the moment, carries the likelihood of offense to portions of our community who, for a variety of reasons, favored the reversal of Roe v. Wade.  

While I don’t have answers about the future direction of the Court’s decisions or how to heal a divided citizenry, I do know that at moments where so many colleagues are hurting and need support, the Ropes & Gray community stands tall for each other.  To that end, we will be holding two community gatherings over the next few days.   The Women’s Forum will host a meeting for all interested colleagues – to offer the comfort of community and a forum for conversation in small breakout groups.  In a second gathering, Doug Hallward-Driemeier will lead an overview of federal and state law on reproductive rights post-Dobbs.    

Ropes & Gray has long dedicated itself to the protection of civil rights and individual liberties – whether those rights are grounded in federal, state or local law.  We will remain steadfast in that mission in the weeks and months to come.  Anticipating today’s decision, many of you have reached out to the head of our pro bono program, Roz Nasdor, and our U.S. pro bono committee chairs, Jenny Rikoski and Chris Conniff, to ask how you can channel your concern into action.   There will be many opportunities for those interested to contribute on a pro bono basis to the protection of health care rights for women, a cause which Ropes & Gray will continue to champion.

President Joe Biden’s granddaughter, Naomi Biden, is an [associate at Arnold & Porter](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/biden-granddaughter-to-join-d-c-biglaw-firm/), and accordingly, has a Secret Service detail (for that first part, not because she’s a Biglaw associate). Over the weekend, those agents were called into action when they witnessed three individuals trying to break into an unmarked Secret Service vehicle.

As [reported by](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/secret-service-agents-shoot-naomi-biden-car_n_65522920e4b09c9500ab193e) the Associated Press, the incident took place on Sunday night in the Georgetown neighborhood. One agent discharged their weapon, but it is not believed that anyone was injured.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
One of the agents opened fire, but no one was struck by the gunfire, the Secret Service said in a statement. The three people were seen fleeing in a red car, and the Secret Service said it put out a regional bulletin to Metropolitan Police to be on the lookout for it.

Our preliminary statement on the weapon discharge following a break-in to a Secret Service vehicle. Two to Three possible suspects fled the scene in a vehicle and a regional bulletin has been issued to supporting units. [@DCPoliceDept](https://twitter.com/DCPoliceDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) are investigating the incident. [pic.twitter.com/lECykumT2s](https://t.co/lECykumT2s)

It isn’t known if Naomi Biden heard the incident as it developed outside.

Some elite Biglaw firms are known for offering market-beating bonuses for their biggest billers. Year after year, they prove that they’re willing to pay for the most committed legal talent by adding tens of thousands of dollars to their regular year-end bonus payouts.

One of those firms is Quinn Emanuel.

Hot on the heels of announcing that it would allow its lawyers to [work remotely, indefinitely](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/quinn-emanuel-will-allow-lawyers-to-work-remotely-indefinitely-from-anywhere-in-the-country/), from anywhere in the country, the top 30 Am Law firm unveiled its 2021 bonus matrix. As usual, there are some pretty big rewards in store for those who truly dedicated their lives to the firm.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Associates who billed between 2100 and 2399 hours will receive a bonus equal to the market rate (the original [Cravath year-end bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) with the [Davis Polk special bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/) on top). Big billers start raking in more cash at 2400 hours. Depending on class year, those who billed 2400 hours or more will receive up to $23,000 more than market, while those who billed 2700 hours or more will receive up to $40,250 more than market, not including special bonuses.

Check out the Quinn Emanuel matrix below:



This year, the firm is offering partial bonuses to those who had hours between 2000-2099, and as usual, the firm is rounding associates up to market bonuses if they just missed the 2100 cutoff, with special bonuses “paid proportionally” to those who missed the 2100-hour mark.

“Why haven’t we heard anything from Gibson Dunn? This is insulting.”

“You need to call out Gibson Dunn. Absurd!!!”

“Now that literally all of our peer firms have matched nationwide, associates at GDC are becoming irate.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“You need to shame Gibson Dunn into matching Cravath. We’ve had enough waiting.”

That’s just a smattering of what we’d heard from readers about Gibson Dunn. Considering the fact that the firm places [just outside the Top 10 in Vault’s rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/which-vault-top-25-firms-have-not-yet-announced-raises/2/), associates were pretty pissed off when they heard nothing but silence with regard to matching the now-prevailing $180K salary scale that’s been adopted throughout top-tier Biglaw firms. Don’t worry, associates, you needn’t be irate anymore.

Today, Gibson Dunn has finally decided to match the market. [Kenneth Doran](http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/kdoran), the firm’s managing partner, said in an email addressed to all associates that this move was “[i]n keeping with our commitment to pay competitive compensation to our associates.” Gibson has matched the Cravath scale for all classes through 2008, and will be matching the Cravath scale for incoming associates in the class of 2016 as well. Associates in the following locations will receive a raise: Los Angeles, CA; Century City, CA; Orange County, CA; Palo Alto, CA; San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; Dallas, TX; Denver, CO; and Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, there is no mention of how current summer associates’ compensation will be affected in the memo.

Congratulations to all Gibson Dunn associates! You finally got what you wanted!

Marshae Jones

The New York Mets in their worst season didn’t have as many errors as this indictment.

— Mark White, of White Arnold & Dowd, representing Marshae Jones told [AL.com](https://www.al.com/news/2019/06/motion-to-dismiss-marshae-jones-charge-to-be-filed-monday-attorney-says.html) he will be filing a motion to dismiss the charges against his client. Jones’s criminal case rose to national prominence when Alabama indicted her for her fetus’s death after she was shot and the charges against the shooter were dropped. Jones’s case has been a [source of outrage](https://jezebel.com/alabama-woman-indicted-after-someone-else-shoots-her-in-1835892341) for those that see this as a dystopian extension of Alabama’s anti-choice laws. White went on to say “It appears that someone who should’ve been objective decided to frame the narrative for their own personal political reasons.” He also noted Jones’s case was an “unprecedented, inappropriate charge that is not permitted under that the law in Alabama.”

# This Lawyer Built A Biglaw Firm Serving The Spanish Speaking Immigrant Community (Hint: Not Aaron Schlossberg)
## Nearly 100 years ago, there were lawyers with better attitudes about speaking Spanish.

While [Aaron Schlossberg](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/aaron-schlossberg-is-having-a-delightfully-bad-day/) may not appreciate people speaking Spanish in America, which firm’s named founder built an elite powerhouse providing legal services to Chicago’s then-growing Mexican American community in 1925?

Hint: The lawyer would parlay his Spanish skills into advising American companies investing in Latin America.

# Morning Docket: 09.13.16
## * Green Party presidential nominee Dr. Jill Stein will appear at Vermont Law School today, where she'll meet with members of the law school community to speak about her plan to transition the country using 100 percent renewable energy. Law students will be especially excited to hear about her plans to cancel all student loan debt. [[VTDigger](https://vtdigger.org/2016/09/12/presidential-candidate-stein-set-speak-vermont-law-school-tuesday/)] * “Talk to your classmates, especially those with different views. Even if you come away from it disagreeing even more, at least you know what makes them tick, which is a useful thing.” Last week, Justice Elena Kagan went back to Harvard Law, the school where she once served as dean, to share helpful tips with law students. [[Harvard Crimson](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/9/justice-kagan-addresses-law-students/)] * Federal prosecutors may have dropped their corruption case against ex-Gov. Bob McDonnell after SCOTUS threw out his convictions, but now he's got some pretty hefty legal bills to pay to Jones Day and Holland & Knight. Right now, he owes more than $10M to the partners who helped clear his name. [[Richmond Times-Dispatch](http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_bcfe6873-dd0f-535f-a2a1-927782b02659.html?mode=jqm)] * A lot of big-time lateral moves were announced yesterday, including Kirkland & Ellis's mass hiring of all Bancroft lawyers, but Gibson Dunn's news may top all the rest we've yet to cover. Stuart Delery, the former acting associate attorney general of the Justice Department, will join the firm as a partner in Washington, D.C. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/place-your-vote-for-the-days-biggest-lateral-hire/)] * Ex-Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper has found a new home -- or rather, a ""strategic affiliation"" -- with a global Biglaw firm.

# Biglaw Salary Cuts Might Not Be Enough To Keep Layoffs At Bay
## This is unsettling news.

[W]hile salary cuts shore up a firm’s finances, they don’t fix the underlying problem: too many lawyers, specifically more lawyers than can be kept growing professionally at the required pace given the volume of work available to them. With the level of U.S. economic activity not expected to regain its Q4 2019 level until the first half of 2022, this is more than a short-term challenge. Unchecked, it creates a post-recession existential risk for firms: clients decamping to rivals to avoid being served by under-experienced associate cohorts. Hence, we should expect layoffs when lawyers return to their offices (you can’t reasonably lay someone off over Zoom).

— [Hugh A. Simons](https://twitter.com/simonshugh?lang=en), formerly a senior partner and executive committee member at The Boston Consulting Group and chief operating officer and policy committee member at Ropes & Gray, arguing salary cuts may not be enough for some law firms, and that [layoffs — and even closures — may be coming](https://www.law.com/2020/05/15/as-salary-cuts-move-to-higher-profit-firms-what-happens-next/) down the line. As he notes in his well-reasoned essay, “There’s a new class of associates set to arrive (averaging 6-7 percent of lawyer headcount) and voluntary attrition has gone to zero (as it does in any recession). It will be ugly.”

# Firm Pays Sub-Market Bonuses And Associates Are... Cool With It?
## There's more to life than money.

Most of our coverage of “market” compensation tracks the New York Biglaw scale. That’s the most elite American legal market and it’s where the top talent — all else equal — tends to flow. Those salaries generate the most excitement because everyone judges themselves based on where they pay relative to that high water mark.

In 2016, firms all over the country fell all over themselves to match that compensation structure. It’s how we ended up with associates in Charlotte able to buy mansions with New York paychecks.

Locke Lord just walked around its bonuses for the year and they are not matching the “market.” Top billers at some levels will be seeing a match, but generally, Locke Lord’s bonuses seem to be missing the Cravath scale generally by about 25-30 percent by our estimation based on a limited sample size.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Some might cry foul over this disparate treatment, but one associate with a well-developed sense of the big picture sent us this testimonial:

I think every time this time of year comes along there’s a twinge of jealousy for our NY brethren who get larger bonuses in the lockstep manner, but after about 30 seconds, I pack up to head home at a reasonable hour, in a nice car with no debt, to a house that I can easily afford, to a spouse who can work out of enjoyment rather than as a necessity, to talk about whether we should invest or donate most of the bonus because law school debt has already been paid off, and I say “God bless Texas and God bless Locke Lord.”

There’s more to the legal life than money. And there’s a lot more to life when you remember that even these “small” bonuses are still tens of thousands of dollars.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Ex-Attorney At Top 10 Biglaw Firm Receives Short Prison Sentence For Insider Trading
## Prosecutors called the lawyer’s conduct ‘egregious.’

Trading on insider information never, ever ends well for anyone — especially if you’re an attorney at a Biglaw firm.

Romero Cabral Da Costa Neto, 33, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, started working as a visiting attorney at Gibson Dunn in September 2022. Back in August, Costa was [arrested and charged with insider trading](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/ex-attorney-at-top-10-biglaw-firm-charged-with-insider-trading/), accused of accessing confidential client information from within Gibson Dunn’s internal filing system to make trades ahead of a major pharmaceutical M&A deal.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In early November, Costa pleaded guilty to the charges, and earlier this week, he was sentenced. Costa asked for time already served plus supervised release, but instead, he was received two months in prison. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/12/21/ex-visiting-attorney-at-gibson-dunn-sentenced-to-2-months-in-prison-for-insider-trading/) has the details:

The sentence is less than the eight months federal prosecutors had sought for Costa, which they noted was on the low end of the total offense level, in a sentencing memorandum filed Dec. 16.

Prosecutors argued that Costa’s ”personal characteristics, education, employment, and family wealth, make his conduct even more egregious” and that an incarceration sentence “deters the general public from committing these crimes as well,” in the memorandum.

According to prosecutors, among other illegal trades, Costa traded on information related to biopharmaceutical company Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB’s acquisition of CTI BioPharma Corp (CTIC), a Gibson Dunn client. He bought more than 10,000 CTIC shares the day prior to the deal being announced publicly, and sold them the day after, making more than $42,000 in profits.

On top of being sentenced to spend time behind bars, Costa was ordered to forfeit the profits he made, as well as pay a $100 fine. He also came to an agreement with the SEC in a related civil enforcement action.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Contemplating Transatlantic Merger
## Hopefully these two lovebirds can find a way to make it in this crazy world.

Dum dum da dum… Is that wedding bells I hear? No, just another Biglaw firm looking to get in on the 2017 merger mania.

Today, Bryan Cave [announced](https://www.bryancave.com/en/news-events/bryan-cave-and-berwin-leighton-paisner-confirm-they-are-in.html) it was investigating a possible combination with U.K. firm Berwin Leighton Paisner (BLP). If this merger happens — still a big if at this stage — the new firm would be formidable with 1,500 lawyers, 32 offices in 12 countries, and a total combined gross revenue approaching $1 billion. And good news, the happy couple has already pick out its silverware, erm website, registering [www.bryancaveblp.com](http://www.bryancaveblp.com/) on October 12th.

As one might imagine, the joint statement from the firms is optimistic, and focused on the improved services they plan to provide clients:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“If we combine, we will operate without regard to geographic boundaries,” said Bryan Cave chair Therese Pritchard in the joint statement issued by her firm and BLP. “Our firm would be one of only a handful of global firms operating in a one-firm structure with more than 500 lawyers in both the U.S. and also internationally. We will seamlessly provide counsel to clients across the globe, deliver client service at a new level and use technology and innovation to redefine efficiency in the practice of law.”

But the firms are careful not to be overly enthusiastic before their memberships have approved the merger. See, both firms have been down similar roads before, without a successful result. As [reported by](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202800501086/Bryan-Cave-Big-British-Firm-BLP-Confirm-Merger-Talks) Law.com, BLP tried to merge with Greenberg Traurig last year before it fell apart, and Bryan Cave is no stranger to merger heartbreak either:

In late 2015, Bryan Cave was close to acquiring Dickstein Shapiro before a deal collapsed shortly after Christmas, leading what was left of the latter to pursue another according with Blank Rome. But Bryan Cave has a long track record when it comes to law firm combinations, having absorbed Denver-based Holme Roberts & Owen in 2012, Atlanta-based Powell Goldstein in 2009 and New York’s Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn & Berman in 2002. In 2006, Bryan Cave held unsuccessful merger talks with Squire Patton Boggs predecessor Squire, Sanders & Dempsey.

With firm cultures and financials that seem to fit, hopefully these two  lovebirds can find a way to make it in this crazy world.

The facts contained in the report reveal that the President engaged in persistent conduct intended to derail, undermine and obstruct ongoing federal investigations. In light of the longstanding Department of Justice legal opinion that a sitting President cannot be indicted, we view it as irrelevant whether there is a prosecutorial recommendation that the crime of obstruction has been committed. Instead, we believe that the President’s conduct demonstrates a flagrant disregard for the rule of law — a disregard that is in direct conflict with his constitutional responsibilities, including his commitment under oath to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” …

We believe the framers of the Constitution would have viewed the totality of this conduct as evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors. Accordingly, Congress, which carries its own constitutional oversight responsibilities, should conduct further investigation.

Joe and Kathryn chat about the lawsuit against George Mason University brought by GMU Law School — better known by their unfortunately chosen name “ASSLaw” — law professor Todd Zywicki over his refusal to get vaccinated. It’s a remarkably unimpressive complaint. Cravath, in the midst of many changes, announces a new flexible office work policy based around a floating 6 remote work days per month. Could this become the new normal? And Rudy Giuliani is still broadcasting to the world that he works at Greenberg Tarurig. Maybe he means Greenberg Traurig Total Landscaping?

# Cravath Is NOT Offering Special Bonuses, And Associates Are Pissed
## Ooof. The former bonus leader has really made its associates angry.

It’s been about two weeks since Biglaw firms started handing out cash to associates in appreciation for all of their hard work during the pandemic. First came [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/), which started the COVID bonus trend in the first place. Next came [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/), which blew the Cooley scale out of the water, and others firms quickly fell over themselves to match the generous scale, one by one by one by one. So many firms have matched the bonus scale that we’ve started a [bonus tracker](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) here at Above the Law.

All the while, we’ve been wondering: Where is Cravath? Why hasn’t the perrenial bonus leader entered the bonus fray?

Cravath has heard Biglaw’s whispers and has finally entered the COVID bonus wars — but alas, the elite firm seems to be echoing [Kirkland’s response](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/). HA.

That’s right, Cravath will not be offering its associates a fall bonus. Cravath, the firm whose equity partners earned $4,414,000 in profits in 2019, is going to be sitting this one out, and unlike Kirkland — which pledged to “take into account … the fall bonuses paid by any other firm” in determining its December bonuses — didn’t even commit to taking the fall bonuses into consideration in announcing its year-end bonuses.

Read the memo for yourself:



Cravath associates are understandably not thrilled by this news:

It’s embarrassing that we bill so much at Cravath, but make less than our peers, especially when you consider our terrible benefits. We’re suckers.

Cravath’s bonus memo also makes no commitment that 2020 bonuses will be at least at 2019 levels. No reassurance for its associates on any level –> why say anything?

This is insulting to associates and short-sighted by the partners. It looks particularly bad not to make a similar type of commitment to what Kirkland made. It makes you think: did these guys lose a big malpractice arbitration? Do they not have enough cash on hand to make this kind of payment without doing a capital call? Goodbye #1 Vault ranking.

People come to Cravath for two reasons: the training and prestige. The Firm’s decision not to pay out COVID bonuses (at least not yet (I hope)), directly undermines the prestige factor. And that hurts associates and partners alike, which I assume the partners appreciate. Which leads me to wonder: are they hurting financially? We associates don’t know because you won’t find a partnership less transparent than this one in BigLaw.

Cravath is outright insulting their associates. They don’t even guarantee the same bonuses as last year, so they are worse than K&E.

Cravath gave associates the dick punch. No bonuses.

Ouch.

# Law School Students PISSED At Nixon Peabody's Handling Of Summer Associate Program
## COVID-19 ruins everything.

COVID-19 has forced a lot of Biglaw firms to take a hard look at exactly how and where they are spending their money. And one firm that has been taking an axe to expenses is Nixon Peabody. Unlike some other firms that [cut expenses and salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/am-law-100-firm-cuts-pay-for-all-to-avoid-covid-19-layoffs/) as the first austerity measures to combat the economic upheaval surrounding the novel coronavirus while keeping as many people as possible gainfully employed, Nixon Peabody went right for cutting jobs.

As we’ve previously reported, the firm [laid off/furloughed approximately](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-and-furloughs/) 10 percent of non-partner attorneys and [did massive staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/massive-furloughs-hit-this-biglaw-firm/). Now we’re hearing from law school students that were supposed to start work as summer associates at Nixon Peabody that the firm has left them, “shit out of luck.”

As tipsters report the firm has canceled their summer program. While that isn’t, unfortunately, unheard of in these times, Nixon isn’t extending the summer associates offers of future employment (either after graduation for 2Ls, or next summer for 1Ls). That is bound to sting, especially when the [majority of other top law firms](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/fuf8ki/tracking_summer_program_changes/) are making their summer associates offers. And, yeah, based on the emails Above the Law is receiving, folks are angry indeed:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Only a few weeks before I was slated to move, they called telling me I’m basically shit out of luck and no guaranteed offer…. They didn’t even have the decency to let me know back in early April. They had to do it only a few weeks before the program was supposed to start to fuck everyone over with housing and zero notice to look for a new summer internship. And now with NO 2L summer job, I likely will have to head into 3L hiring. It’s so annoying because I was good enough of a student to have landed a biglaw summer associateship! I had other options but I CHOSE these guys and completely got shafted. RIP.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson at Nixon Peabody confirmed the cancellation of their summer program and noted the firm will offer summer associates a $5,000 stipend and 1L summer associates will be considered for next year’s summer program.

Best of luck to those that now find themselves without a clear career path due to COVID-19.

# The Haves And The Have Nots
## Business professionals and staff are more valuable than ever, so why do so many law firms treat them like second-class citizens?

It’s no secret that lawyers tend to have high opinions of themselves. There are many reasons for this attitude. As a group, lawyers have reached at least some level of academic achievement, are trained to discredit the ideas of others, have passed a test to become members of an exclusive club, and have a certain status that comes along with being in a highly compensated profession.

Lawyers’ inflated sense of self-worth can wreak havoc on many parts of life. It’s part of the reason many lawyers find healthy, nonadversarial relationships elusive. It’s also why we’re the butt of countless jokes. Heck, it’s the widespread disdain for lawyers that undoubtedly caused Steven Spielberg to make the scene where the [T. rex gobbled up the lawyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMzfrod7hcE) in “Jurassic Park” the moment of the film’s comedic relief. He wouldn’t have gotten the same crowd-pleasing reaction if that dino’s dinner had been a software developer.

The halos lawyers see around their own heads are also problematic when it comes to running a law firm. One area where this is particularly evident in the way lawyers dismiss the contributions of law firm professionals without JDs.

Lawyers, Lawyers Everywhere

The problem is deeper than mindset; it’s structural. The basic makeup of law firms differs from that of most other businesses in ways that often cause us to systematically overvalue the importance of attorneys and undervalue the business professionals and staff that keep the firm’s engine humming.

Most of the large, nonlegal businesses we’re used to thinking about, talking about, or advising are made up of discrete departments focused on specific tasks. By working together, administrators, sales departments, recruiters, and managers collectively power the entire company. The owners, hoping to keep the profits coming in, pass some of those benefits back to these key team members who made it all happen.

What makes law firms unique, however, is that practicing lawyers are in many key firm positions. Lawyers are often a company’s management, sales team, recruiters, and product all rolled into one. And on top of that, they usually own the company itself. In structure, law firms are less like a Fortune 500 outfit and much more like a collective of plumbers or carpenters. For all the marble in our offices, we’re tradespeople at heart, working not in steel or wood, but in PDFs and privilege logs.

Who Matters?

The challenge with this concentration of roles and power within law firms is that it often systematically leads to firm leadership thinking in terms of there being two types of people they work with: attorneys and everyone else. The haves and the have nots. And that two-tiered thinking leads to two-tiered treatment.

The attorneys, who own the firm, run it. They directly generate most of its revenue, have all the leverage and incentive needed to grant themselves large pay packages, ample benefits and perks, and expansive freedom to manage their business lives how they see fit. Few nonattorney staff members get those same luxuries. Consider how many firms offer unlimited vacation time and flexible working arrangements for attorneys, but require their staff to spend mandatory time in-office and strictly measure and cap their days off.

And those are just the objective ways that attorneys and nonattorneys are treated differently. A firm’s overall tone and atmosphere can also convey that the opinions and treatment of lawyers are vastly more important than those of staff. I’m sure plenty of law firm team members without JDs have had the experience of coming up with good ideas to improve their workplace, only to be stonewalled on implementing those ideas unless they can convince an attorney to take up the cause and advocate for it. In some firms, attorneys are allowed to get away with unprofessional or abusive behavior that would get a nonattorney terminated immediately. At worst, this two-tiered system can cause firms to give off a downright dystopic, “Hunger Games”-y vibe.

Every time we reinforce the perception that attorneys run on a different system of rules and accountability than everyone else, we push our nonattorney colleagues a little closer to the door.

Driving People Away When We Need Them Most

Nonattorney business professionals such as those in marketing, HR, finance, or IT are often at particular risk of feeling undervalued and minimized in law firm spaces. We expect these professionals to work side by side with us on problems that are fundamental to the firm’s success and growth, yet often minimize their contributions and fail to give their advice its proper weight. Sometimes that can contribute to professionals seeking out another firm that will value them more highly, such as the entire marketing team that just [jumped ship from Cooley to Fried Frank](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/13/marketing-team-exits-cooley-for-fried-frank-highlighting-competitive-landscape-for-business-pros/). But other times it may drive them out of the legal sector altogether, in favor of industries that are less captured by a single segment of the company’s headcount.

For once, the business professionals actually have some leverage. Hiring to fill positions remains difficult even in the face of other economic indicators, which means competition for talent is fierce. Though many lawyers are slow to acknowledge it, our business professionals and administrative team members are talented, and they’re needed to keep our firms alive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. If we don’t value them, the Big Four accounting firms and Alternative Legal Service Provider companies that are steadily eroding law firms’ market share sure will.

This is not a tenable situation. For as confident as we attorneys may be in our abilities to master whatever challenges we face, lawyers should not be dabbling part time in the management of major organizations involving hundreds or thousands of people and potentially billions of dollars of annual revenue. We need dedicated, experienced people running our complex businesses on a full-time basis. To get those people, and retain them, firms need to treat them better than second-class citizens.

Show, Don’t Tell

The best way to start correcting bad patterns of behavior within an organization is for leadership to demonstrate the right way of acting. At my firm, we’re working hard to demonstrate how much we value our business professionals from the top down. We regularly invite our business professionals to meetings, including having them present regularly. We actively solicit their input on firm decisions, and our management team tries to show that they have our trust and confidence.

This shouldn’t be unusual. It shouldn’t be a surprise that people who have dedicated their careers to marketing, HR, business management, accounting, or the myriad other aspects of running a large business are going to have better ideas about it than a bunch of dilettantes with a JD. We may own our firms, and we may be the product that drives the revenue, but a large law firm cannot survive on lawyers alone in today’s environment. We need our business professionals, and these days we often need them more than they need us.

One of the major themes of the practice of law in the 21st century has been the maturation of the large law firm model. It used to make sense to run our firms like a collection of jumped-up white-collar tradespeople, but today’s complex legal market requires thinking more like a traditional business enterprise.

That requires us lawyers, who enjoy outsized representation and influence within our firms, to recognize that outsized influence does not equal outsized competence. We have roles to fill within our firms, but we cannot be the only people the firm listens to or is concerned with serving. We have colleagues who bring brilliant ideas and valuable experiences to the table. We ignore or undervalue them at our peril. So why not check that ego, let go of the reins a bit, and try listening to the people who are full-time using their talents to make your firm as strong as it can be? It never hurts to treat people with respect, and that small change could make all the difference for your firm.

# Will Millennials Make The 2,500-Hour Year The New Normal?
## Millennials are ""work martyrs""?!?!

Millennials get a bum rap for being lazy, entitled jerks. But according to the results of a new survey in the Harvard Business Review, they are more likely to show “complete dedication” to their jobs and feel guilty about taking time off.

Not what you expected from an article about the work ethic of the youngsters, huh? As [Vivia Chen of The Careerist reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/24/are-millennials-driving-up-billables/?slreturn=20160724122441):

From what I’ve seen, [these millennials are] not a generation of revolutionaries that’s out to change Big Law. If anything, they were bred to please.

Boy, was I right. Actually, millennials are even more pathetically conformist than I thought, reports Sarah Green Carmichael, a senior editor at Harvard Business Review.

According to a new survey, Project: Time Off and GfK, millennials are actually more likely to see themselves—proudly—as “work martyrs” than older workers and less likely to use all their vacation time.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Of course, “work martyrs” are hardly a good thing. Pro tip: Unless there’s been an actual death, the word “martyr” is never bandied about in a complimentary way. They are less likely to take vacation, making them more likely to burn out and get stressed. And for all that effort they are, according to the Harvard Business Review, less likely to get promoted for their work.

Crappy deal for junior lawyers? Sure. But it is likely the Biglaw machines will benefit:

It might be healthier for lawyers and firms for everyone to take off the standard four weeks, but will most millennials do so? More importantly, will firms push them to take time off? HBR advocates that managers take a proactive role in steering employees to work less, take time off and smell the flowers.

Maybe some professions will tell those crazy millennials to knock off the work martyrdom, but I don’t see it in law. Before you know it, 2,500 billable hours a year will be normal.

Why would a Biglaw firm care if you are miserable as long as you’re billing 2,500? That’s cold, hard cash for the firm, and they’re banking on you leaving the firm before you’re up for partner anyway.

[](https://bit.ly/3Lirb5B)We all go through periods in our careers when the daily workload starts to feel like more of a chore than a reason to jump out of bed. For attorneys, the long hours, lack of variety and high pressure environment can get too much, but if you’re not yet ready to turn your back on your legal career and want to carry on working with top clients on interesting projects it might just be time for a change.

Many lawyers consider interim assignments as they are building their careers but rule them out for fear of taking a step back on the career ladder. In fact, switching out of the traditional linear track and taking on some project-based legal assignments can be a great way to strengthen a top-quality legal resume helping you demonstrate ambition and gain unique and varied experiences that will make you stand out in a highly competitive talent market.

Peerpoint, global law firm Allen & Overy’s flexible resourcing business, has been helping lawyers all over the world to build exceptional and exciting careers for nearly a decade, and we have hundreds of top-tier professionals on our panel. Let us dispel a few myths about the realities of interim opportunities:

Firstly, they are not just for lawyers who can’t hack it.

Opting to pursue project-based assignments is not about taking a step back, and it is certainly not for those that can’t cope with the demands of Biglaw. Rather, we are supporting pre-eminent global companies and financial institutions with their interim legal requirements, and those clients want the best of the best.

If you want the prestige of working with big-name organizations on their cutting-edge, mission-critical assignments, then that’s what’s on offer. The great difference about doing it on an interim basis is that you have more control: you might choose to try something new, to take longer breaks between contracts, to work part-time or to seek exposure to a wider range of industries.

You won’t sabotage your career by doing this.

In fact, our interim attorneys are able to propel their careers to the next level, often boosting their credentials by building a portfolio of experience across a range of clients, projects and sectors. Forward-thinking attorneys can diversify their expertise and build new skills by accessing a variety of work, winning the chance to engage with clients they might never have dealt with if they had stayed in a permanent role.

Choosing to go down the interim lawyering route needn’t affect your ability to get a permanent role in future, and can accelerate the pace at which you can achieve your professional goals.

Finally, it’s not true that the work is menial and junior.

Our clients don’t settle for second best – they are looking for brilliant, ambitious, self-directed professionals to step in and help on their major transactions, legal projects or during peak busy periods. The practice areas that we typically resource include capital markets, banking and finance, corporate M&A, technology, intellectual property, data privacy and employment law.

The work you will be doing will be on a par with what you are doing in your permanent role, and you are likely to find it more interesting and challenging, and on your terms. You will get to push yourself forward, stretch your mind and expand your network, while always having a choice about the next assignment you take on.

Working on a project-basis isn’t for everyone, but whatever your experience, ambitions and goals, Peerpoint commits to offering its lawyers all the support they need to thrive. Our interim attorneys have the backing of Allen & Overy, so you’re never on your own and can instead tap into the highest-level work with the full support of our dedicated teams.

We have been doing this long enough to know how to match attorneys to the right opportunities, so we’ll help you tick the boxes you want to tick and keep you heading in the direction you want to travel.

# Burned Out In Biglaw? Don’t Jump In-House Without Also Considering Boutiques
## Fortunately, Biglaw and in-house are not the only options. Attorneys who are tired of Biglaw life should also consider a different alternative: boutique and midsize law firms.

We all know that Biglaw practice can be a grueling experience. Some lawyers love practicing at the cutting edge and manage to navigate the lifestyle trade-offs over the long term. However, many Biglaw attorneys eventually find themselves feeling burned out and needing to escape. That feeling tends to be especially acute towards the end of the year, as associates confront the prospect of spending yet another holiday season burning the midnight oil. 

So with a new year on the horizon, it’s unsurprising that many candidates have been coming to me to discuss potential in-house opportunities. After all, in-house is the most widely discussed alternative career path. But before plunging headfirst into an in-house search, I find it helpful to dig a little deeper into what these candidates are trying to achieve. It turns out that many Biglaw associates who initially tell me they want to go in-house haven’t actually thought hard about the realities of in-house careers, whether they would be a strong fit for those roles, or if this would be the best fit in the long term. Fundamentally, they’re just seeking a more balanced lifestyle, and they see in-house as the easiest means to that end.

The thing is, in-house isn’t for everyone. To be sure, some lawyers thrive as in-house counsel. But many are disappointed to discover that [the grass isn’t actually greener](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/an-in-house-reality-check-the-grass-may-not-be-greener/).

Fortunately, Biglaw and in-house are not the only options. Attorneys who are tired of Biglaw life should also consider a different alternative: boutique and midsize law firms.

The boutique and midsize alternative

I know what some of you are thinking. “Hold up. I’m trying to get away from billing hours. Wouldn’t a boutique mean working the same nights and weekends, but for less money?”

The truth is, in some cases, it absolutely would mean that. But not all. Attorneys working for boutique and midsize firms have a wide range of experiences. It’s an overstatement to say that Biglaw firms are all the same, but the basic business model is pretty standardized. In contrast, there is way more differentiation between boutique law firm models. The key is finding a boutique or midsize firm that offers the right model for you.

Some boutiques are designed very explicitly for Biglaw refugees: same high-level, interesting matters with highly-trained colleagues, but working fewer hours, for somewhat less pay. Exactly how many fewer hours and how substantial a pay cut will vary from firm to firm, and market to market. But note that these are essentially the same trade-offs that candidates confront when considering in-house roles. The most lucrative in-house positions tend to require almost Biglaw-level hours, whereas a true 9-to-5 in-house role will require a significant pay cut. (If it doesn’t, the job very likely won’t be 9-to-5!)

Evaluating boutique/midsize opportunities

What should you think about when exploring boutique or midsize roles? The basic mantra is: do not make assumptions. Talk to many people. Ask probing questions.

For example, when comparing opportunities, don’t just look at the number of billable hours required. The number alone won’t tell you very much—you need to dig deeper. How does the firm bill? What counts as billable? Are associates generally billing significantly more than the requirement? Are there additional marketing hours required or is the quoted hours number the full amount actually expected?  

Let’s imagine you are currently at a Biglaw firm that requires 1950 hours. You have an opportunity at a boutique or midsize firm that requires 1800. On the surface, that doesn’t sound too different. But there’s a good chance your current 1950-hour requirement does not fully capture how much you are working. It’s quite likely that you end up billing more than the requirement in most years on client matters alone—perhaps significantly more. On top of that, Biglaw firms often expect something like 300 hours on marketing, CLEs, and other work that isn’t billed to a client. Just as you might want to give a candidate considering your firm some additional context about the “1950 hours,” you would be well-advised to ask questions about your potential new firm’s 1800-hour target, so that you can make an informed comparison.

Speak with multiple associates and really probe to understand the reality of the lifestyle. Some boutique and midsize firms genuinely offer work/life balance. Others do not. Do your diligence to figure out the true nature of the opportunity presented.

A trusted recruiter can be an especially useful resource in this process. A recruiter who knows your market well has likely already placed candidates at the firms you should be considering. Take advantage of the inside knowledge and introductions your recruiter can offer.

If you manage to navigate the process successfully, it really is possible to end up in a sweet spot. Interesting work. Humane hours. Solid compensation. While in-house may appear to be the easy answer, if a better lifestyle is what you’re seeking, the boutique/midsize path is well worth your consideration.

Has the [beleaguered firm](https://abovethelaw.com/kenyon-kenyon/) of Kenyon & Kenyon finally found a suitable partner to merge with? Though both firms have refused to comment, [Law.com reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/26/andrews-kurth-kenyon-kenyon-draw-closer-amid-merger-rumors/) that according to anonymous sources at Kenyon and its rumored paramour, Andrews Kurth, leadership at the firms have voted to approve the partnership, though it isn’t final. And there is another bit of info some clever internet sleuthing has uncovered:

Internet registration records show that the two firms share a common domain name. The website [www.andrewskurthkenyon.com](http://www.andrewskurthkenyon.com/) was registered anonymously on Aug. 12, according to data on file with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

Looks like things have at least gotten to the planning stage.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Kenyon & Kenyon has been at the [center of merger rumors](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/struggling-firm-desperately-seeking-savior-as-lawyer-headcount-sinks/) for a while — the firm’s headcount is down to about a third of its historic high, and the firm’s [survival has been questioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/will-this-law-firm-survive-2016/). But according to Law.com, the merger just might make sense for both parties:

Rumors of merger talks have intensified this summer, as Kenyon & Kenyon has slimmed down to about 55 attorneys, down from about 150 in 2014. Kenyon & Kenyon managing partner Edward Colbert—a brother of the late night talk show host with the same last name—told the New York Law Journal this spring that he expected the boutique to decide in 2016 whether to merge or stand alone.

A combination with Kenyon & Kenyon would give a critical IP boost to Andrews Kurth. The 320-lawyer firm has only about 30 lawyers in its IP group, including four in New York, according to the firm’s website. Both Andrews Kurth and Kenyon & Kenyon have relatively small offices in Washington, D.C.

Best of luck as these firms try to hammer out a final deal.

UPDATE (1:52 p.m): Andrews Kurth and Kenyon & Kenyon have just announced they will not be merging the two firms. BUT! As [Law.com reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/29/andrews-kurth-to-hire-all-55-kenyon-kenyon-lawyers/), all 55 Kenyon lawyers have been hired by Andrews Kurth in a mass lateral hire:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In early August, Andrews Kurth partners voted “overwhelmingly” to approve the deal, managing partner Robert Jewell said. Kenyon partners finished up their vote, which was unanimous, by Aug. 18, said Edward Colbert, the Kenyon managing partner.

“This was an opportunity we couldn’t pass up to bolster a key practice. The core assets of so many of our clients are IP assets,” Jewell said in an interview Monday morning. “We are always looking to add tier-one practices and Kenyon has clearly had a premier IP and technology practice for a long time.”

Colbert said it was to the firm’s advantage to join a firm of Andrews Kurth’s caliber.  “They can deliver to us what we don’t have – a great geographic spread,” he said.

The Kenyon & Kenyon firm will dissolve after the lateral move.

Once the Kenyon lawyers join Andrews Kurth, the law firm will be known as Andrews Kurth in Texas and Andrews Kurth Kenyon on the East and West Coasts.

As of yet there’s no word on the fate of Kenyon staff members.

Orrick Labs product Joinder has spun off into its own company. The venture is run by former Orrick partner, Don Keller, and Jim Brock. The platform operates as a “distributed document management system,” where, instead of having all the documents in a central repository, they are where the work is being done. In this sense, it combines document management, calendaring, task management and collaboration under one roof.

Joinder offers ready-made solutions, initially developed to address the needs of Orrick’s clients. These solutions span four practice areas: litigation, corporate and IP, compliance, and legal operations. The entire platform is designed to serve established and growing legal departments, with no coding, consultants, or extended implementation required. For the first time, corporate legal departments are able to take ownership and control of their internal and external team’s execution via strategic playbooks.

It’s designed to serve corporate legal departments as a comprehensive matter management solution, charging the in-house department while allowing free access to outside counsel.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

It’s another instance of the promise of Biglaw incubation.

“When we launched Orrick Labs, our goal was to tackle problems for which we did not see adequate solutions in the market,” said Mitch Zuklie, Orrick Chairman and CEO. “Joinder, the result of our client’s demands for more insight into their records, is the first product to spin out from the Lab. And it is just that: a better platform for legal engagement, built by a team that understands how lawyers and legal departments work together. We are thrilled to spin Joinder out to an independent company, led by a top-notch team.”

A couple months ago we discussed the pitfalls of legal tech partnering with law firms. On the one hand, the partnership brings instant buy in and built-in feedback. On the other hand, it can impose a kind of tunnel vision on the process. Orrick Labs has managed to strike the right balance and spawn a product that can move out the nest and take on the world.

# Former Biglaw Associate Convicted Of Sexual Assault Banned From Profession
## After his jail time, he won't just be able to go back to the profession.

[Last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/former-biglaw-attorney-sentenced-to-8-years-jail-time-for-sexual-assault-charges/), former Biglaw attorney, Tom Hagyard, was convicted of two counts of assault by penetration and two counts of sexual assault and sentenced to eight years in prison.

The conviction stems from an October 2017 house party in West London, England. Hagyard had recently begun working at Eversheds Sutherland, and attended a housewarming party with some colleagues. At the party, Hagyard assaulted two women, one of whom was a law student. He was suspended from the firm when the allegations became public, and was formally terminated by Eversheds in June of 2018.

But that’s not the end of the consequences for Hagyard. [As reported by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/10/ex-eversheds-trainee-banned-from-profession-following-sexual-assault-convictions/) Legal Cheek, he’s been booted from the profession:

Hagyard has now been made subject to a section 43 order, barring him from working in the legal profession without prior permission from the Solicitors Regulation Authority.

The regulator [found](https://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/solicitor-check/642436/) that “it is undesirable for him to be involved in a legal practice”.

Which, honestly, feels like an understatement.

[[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/paul-weiss-partner-diversity-law-firm.html)] * President Donald Trump recently met with a group of right-wing activists led by Ginni Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, where they criticized transgender people and women serving in the military. Trump reportedly looked “taken aback“ during the meeting, which is a bit of a rarity. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/trump-ginni-thomas-meeting.html)] * Some pretty major lateral moves for some pretty major players when it comes to appellate practice: Lisa Blatt is returning to Williams & Connelly where she’ll lead the firm’s Supreme Court practice, and Kannon Shanmugam is leaving Williams & Connolly to lead a new Supreme Court practice at Paul Weiss. Congrats!

[[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meek-mill-jay-z-high-profile-supporters-launch-reform-alliance-criminal-justice-reform/)] * What happened to the people who were told that they passed the D.C. bar exam, when in reality they actually failed? “Just shock.

# CA To $190K!? Which Firm Raised First-Year Salaries?
## This firm was willing to bump up first-year starting salaries to a number that's been seen only in associates' dreams.

As first-year associates at large law firms know all too well, the last time associate base salaries were raised across the board was nine years ago, on January 22, 2007, when Simpson Thacher & Bartlett announced that it would raise starting salaries for entry-level associates [from $145,000 to $160,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/). Since then, first-year salaries have remained stagnant, and associates’ desperate cries of “NY to 190!” have largely gone ignored.

This past fall, we thought Simpson Thacher had finally decided to take action based on a [copy of a memo we’d received](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/ny-to-190k-which-firm-may-be-raising-first-year-salaries/), but unfortunately, it was nothing more than a false flame. It seems that we’ve come to rely upon the New York market as an agent of change for too long a time. Why not look to the West Coast for a firm that’s willing to bump up first-year starting salaries to a number that’s been seen only in associates’ dreams?

We’ve just received word that a member of the [$160K-Plus Club](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-160k-plus-club/), a group of firms that pay starting salaries greater than $160,000, has further increased its already incredibly high starting salary of $187,500 to $190,000. Which highly selective firm just fulfilled the fantasies of associates everywhere?

It’s none other than [Dovel & Luner](http://www.dovellaw.com/index.php), a California litigation boutique that specializes in plaintiff-side patent litigation on a contingency fee basis. The firm has just eight lawyers, but if you look at [their bios](http://www.dovellaw.com/attorneys.php), you’ll see a nothing but a glittering array of top law schools, elite clerkships, and leading Biglaw firms in their backgrounds.

The firm might be tiny, but the rewards of working there are [huge](http://www.dovellaw.com/salary-and-benefits.php) (you can click the image to enlarge it, but you should be able to read those big numbers just fine):

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dovel-Luner-190K-Salary.jpg)

Dovel & Luner’s first-year salary increase to $190K may not move the needle for Biglaw firms nationwide, but it may certainly have an impact on certain other firms that are either comparable to Dovel & Luner, are members of the $160K-Plus Club, or both. If you’re interested in making more money than your peers, here is a listing of those firms (please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=The%20160K%20Plus%20Club) or text us (646-820-8477) if any of these numbers are outdated):

Congratulations to Dovel & Luner for raising its first-year salary to the vaunted number of $190,000. What an achievement! We hope to see more firms follow in its footsteps.

Ed. note: This is part two of a two-part series on how law firms can address critical vulnerabilities in their security posture.  [Part One](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2019/06/13/strengthening-the-soft-underbelly-of-cybersecurity/) focused on setting the stage for an external expert assessment and used a case study to examine physical security issues law firms should be examining.  Part Two will continue with the case study by addressing assessment techniques including attack simulations, social engineering and open source intelligence review.

A hostile threat environment that requires lawyers to critically consider how to adequately protect their clients’ communications in the digital age is something the ABA tackled head-on in [ABA Formal Opinion 477](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/law_national_security/ABA%20Formal%20Opinion%20477.authcheckdam.pdf) in May 2017 stating that cybersecurity recognizes a world where law enforcement discusses hacking and data loss in terms of “when and not if.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Law firms are logical targets for hackers because they collect and store highly sensitive information about clients.  Small and medium-sized firms often struggle with ensuring they allocate proper attention to the electronic infrastructure in which to be productive and adequately protect data and communications.  Additionally, client data notwithstanding, law firms have their own data, business practices, intellectual property, and employee data to protect.  So it comes as no surprise that sophisticated hackers actively test the perimeters of law firms’ networks and cloud environments and are targeting employees to gain the fastest path into databases and other systems containing this valuable information.  What’s on the line: reputational damages, lawsuits, and risk of regulatory enforcement.

Outside experts can help law firms reduce the risk of a harmful and costly breach.  In [part one](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2019/06/13/strengthening-the-soft-underbelly-of-cybersecurity/), we discussed the benefit of physical security assessments.  Now let’s get into additional attack simulation exercises which can bring great value to uncovering and shoring up vulnerabilities.

##Attack Simulations
Typically, law firms have invested a great deal of hours and funding into what they believe are strong enough security stacks to withstand hackers.  To create a truly resilient environment, however, it’s useful to vet this assessment against the realities of what sophisticated hackers can achieve.  Traditionally, adversaries approach exploitation of a target through social engineering, email compromise, public websites, or gaining physical access to a facility.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
With a deep dive assessment that mimics a real-world attack by a malicious actor, an outside expert can demonstrate the ability to gain access to an office through a “red team” approach: this simply means that an outside team (the red team) will stage an attack against all potential attack vectors to evaluate the effectiveness of the firm’s security infrastructure and response capabilities.

Aside from attempting to compromise physical security assets such as badge reading systems and closed-circuit TV (CCTV) once inside the physical perimeter, an additional goal of a red team exercise within this context is typically to perform lateral movement within a network to other geographically disbursed offices, highlighting any vulnerabilities in network segmentation. Shared applications and resources between different global locations are prime targets within the internal network and pose unique threats to organizations with global locations.  These resources could range from file shares to intranet web pages, allowing unintended jump points between networks bypassing any segmentation between those systems.

Another tactic is to target key administrators with access to production systems and/or to attempt bypassing or compromising sensitive [Security Operations Center](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/security-operations-center/) (SOC) assets and tools.  This delivers a clear view of the SOC’s ability to properly monitor against risk and gauges the ability and response time of automated security technology alerts and IT personnel.

Finally, the red team will try to compromise internet-facing applications and network infrastructure including open ports and vulnerable services. They do this by performing credential stealing, executing two-factor authentication bypass, and applying other attack methodologies.

After these attack simulations are complete, the red team compiles a final report containing findings, precise remediation recommendations, and a gap analysis demonstrating areas for improvement.

##Targeted Social Engineering Simulations
Another form of attack simulation is a highly tailored social engineering campaign directed at agreed-upon initial targets such as global help desk operations or other personnel who are typically on the front lines of inbound communications.

The primary objective of social engineering is to circumvent network defenses, leveraging an approach that targets trusted users to gain access to privileged information or resources.  Attackers often use social engineering to establish initial access and gather intelligence to prepare for a future remote attack.

Additional objectives of social engineering attack simulations include:

- Identify remote code execution vulnerabilities on workstations.
- Collect data on likelihood that your personnel will click on potentially malicious links or open emails yielding network credentials. This can be used to measure effectiveness of anti-spear phishing training.
- Bypass security controls, restrictions, and boundaries.
- Inform and prioritize risk mitigation and avoidance to prevent catastrophic effects from such attacks.
An important goal of these assessments is to determine a firm’s maturity in withstanding phishing attempts.  Broadly speaking, phishing denotes an adversary’s attempt to exploit a target by gaining entry (physical or electronic) by convincing employees or contractors to take an enabling action allowing entry or assets transfer to an attacker.  Phishing can take many forms including the following:

- Email/Chat Spearphishing
- Emails impersonating fictitious entities which may contain malicious links, embedded malicious content, or attachments that contain malicious code.
- The attack effort can include:
- Establishing whether the email infrastructure is properly flagging spam.
- Enticing users to click or execute malicious messages which ultimately would provide a hacker with access to a corporate endpoint.
- Enticing high-level individuals (think: C-suite) to take actions more productive to the adversary because of the access and actions available to the high-level target (aka “whaling”).
- Enticing targeted administrators to take enabling actions (aka “spearphishing”).
- Phone Phishing
- Phone calls in which operators attempt to elicit sensitive corporate data, reset a users’ password, or paired with email phishing, establish remote access to a user’s workstation through “pretexting,” which amounts to pretending to be someone else to obtain private information.
- Physical Phishing
- Attempts to gain physical access to a corporate environment with the purpose of either collection of sensitive data, or installation of remote connectivity (see: [physical security assessments](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2019/06/13/strengthening-the-soft-underbelly-of-cybersecurity/)).
Deploying the proper training, monitoring, email scanning/filtering, and policies designed to segment off critical assets can fend off even the most clever social engineering hackers. Understanding the capabilities of a firm’s people and systems is an important first step.

##Open Source Intelligence Assessments
Through reviewing publicly available information on the internet, law firms can gain a better grasp of how hostile actors may be building profiles of their organizations.  Physical and digital vulnerabilities often begin with a small thread discovered online, such as in an employee’s social media postings or client files entrusted to a firm now being sold on the dark web.  Experts use a full suite of open source research tools and methodologies including social media to comprehensively identify personally identifiable information, leaked credentials, or breached data.  With an understanding of what hackers can learn about their executives, practices, clients, and physical assets online, firms can shore up their defenses and create a more secure perimeter around their critical assets.

No organization, law firms included, can fully reduce the risk of being a target of hacking.  The best approach is to understand the risk more comprehensively through sophisticated and tailored external assessments.  From there, detailed recommendations can direct internal resources to fix technical gaps.  The goal is not to extinguish the threat altogether, but to at least do so better than the next law firm.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Think of Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft as the [canary in the Biglaw coal mine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine).[[1]](#f1)

In July 2008, Cadwalader [laid off almost 100 lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/07/breaking-cadwalader-announces-layoffs-of-96-lawyers/). A few weeks later, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and the U.S. economy went into meltdown mode — taking much of Biglaw with it.

It’s January 2017, and CWT is once again having… issues. Is that a sign of big trouble for Biglaw?

Over the long weekend, Brian Baxter broke this news on [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202776892585/Cadwalader-to-Close-Houston-Office-in-Core-Practice-Pivot?mcode=1202615717726&slreturn=20170017133814):

Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft’s energy and commodities group is breaking up, with lawyers leaving for Allen & Overy and Haynes and Boone, part of a process that will see the Wall Street firm close a Houston office that it opened six years ago.

For those keeping track at home, this is the third Cadwalader closure in the past six months. Back in September, CWT [closed two Asia offices and laid off 25 lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/biglaw-firm-to-close-two-offices-lay-off-25-lawyers/).

Looking on the bright side, no lawyers will [wind up on the breadline](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/notes-from-the-breadline/) as a result of this latest closure. The [Houston office](http://www.cadwalader.com/offices/houston) was small — partners Chad Mills and Tania Perez, special counsel Adam Roth, and associate Kathryn Shurin — and all four know where they’ll be working next. Tania Perez will remain with Cadwalader and work out of New York (after previously splitting her time between the two cities). Chad Mills is taking his talents to Haynes and Boone, where Adam Roth and Kathryn Shurin will join him. So perhaps the only folks who will lose their jobs as a result of CWT leaving Houston will be the support staff, assuming they don’t move with their lawyers. (We reached out to CWT to inquire about layoffs and severance in Houston but did not hear back.)

“It was never expected to be a big office,” one CWT source said to us. And its closing didn’t come as a huge shock: “I always wondered why we still had Houston.”

What motivated the closure? Here’s what the firm told [Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202776892585/Cadwalader-to-Close-Houston-Office-in-Core-Practice-Pivot?mcode=1202615717726&slreturn=20170017133814):

Cadwalader’s managing partner [Patrick Quinn](http://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/pat-quinn) said the firm’s decision to shutter its Houston outpost was a reflection of its new emphasis on a core client base that includes big banks and financial institutions, large companies and hedge funds.

“This focused strategic approach has, not surprisingly, resulted in some of our partners moving on,” Quinn said. “We are sad to see our friends depart and wish them well. However, in order to provide exceptional service to our natural client base and a profitable platform for our partners, we must continue to pursue our strategy.”

Sounds a bit like… [Project Rightsize?](http://adamsmithesq.com/2007/02/_time_to_play_name/) That’s what CWT tried in the 1990s and again around 2007-08, when it shed lawyers and offices in an effort to focus on its core strengths. It’s the middle of a decade, time for another Cadwalader “rightsizing”?

As a result of this restructuring, energy lawyers are exiting Cadwalader. Earlier this month, partners Paul Pantano Jr. and Athena Yvonne Eastwood [moved over to Willkie Farr](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202776745891/Willkie-Welcomes-Cadwalader-Energy-Regulatory-Duo-in-DC?slreturn=20170016125458) in Washington. As some of you might recall, Pantano was part of a large group of energy lawyers that moved [from McDermott Will & Emery to Cadwalader](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/musical-chairs-legal-celebrities-on-the-moveincluding-the-energy-lawyers-going-from-mwe-to-cwt/) six years ago, in early 2011.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
More recently in D.C. — just now, in fact — Allen & Overy [announced the hiring](http://www.allenovery.com/news/en-gb/articles/Pages/Allen--Overy-adds-two-Investigations-and-Litigation-partners-in-Washington-D-C--Further-strengthens-U-S--growth.aspx) of former Cadwalader partners Anthony Mansfield and Gregory Mocek. Mansfield and Mocek were also part of the original MWE-to-CWT group. Allen & Overy sounds thrilled to have them. From John Terzaken, head of A&o’s investigations and litigation group: “With extensive global reach and deep connections to the relevant industries, Allen & Overy is well-positioned for global commodities investigations and enforcement actions. Adding partners like Greg and Tony, both with deep CFTC experience, to our team will provide our clients the support they need to manage the growth of multi-billion dollar, multi-jurisdictional enforcement actions.”

In happier news at Cadwalader, the firm just named [ten new partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/project-rightsize-strikes-again-another-office-bites-the-dust/2/) — its largest incoming partner class since 1993. We’ve been tracking diversity in [new Biglaw partner classes](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/new-partner-watch/), and the CWT class is decently diverse. Four out of ten are women, which is slightly above the [average for large law firms today](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/), and there seems to be some racial/ethnic diversity as well (Sinjini Saha and Ed Wei are Asian).

In terms of office locations, seven of the new partners are based in New York, one is based in D.C., and two are based in London. The new partners reflect Cadwalader’s heightened focus on finance — almost all work out of a major financial center, and there’s just one litigator in the group, Nathan Bull (and much of his securities and commercial litigation practice revolves around complex financial instruments and structured products). You can flip to the next page to read the [full Cadwalader press release](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/project-rightsize-strikes-again-another-office-bites-the-dust/2/).

Raise a glass to Cadwalader’s new partners, as well as to the future of the firm — because as Cadwalader goes, so goes Biglaw.

Cadwalader is here for the new salary scale!

It was[ only this morning](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) that Milbank announced they were upping the stakes in the battle for the hearts and minds (and billable hours) of associates by increasing the compensation scale by an impressive $10,000 to $20,000, depending on class year. Now Cadwalader announced they will be matching that new compensation grid. And as multiple Above the Law tipsters noted, folks at the firm are pretty jazzed at how quickly they issued the match.

The new salary scale at Cadwalader is as follows:

Class	Old Salary	New Salary
Class of 2021	$205K	$215K
Class of 2020	$215K	$225K
Class of 2019	$240K	$250K
Class of 2018	$275K	$285K
Class of 2017	$305K	$325K
Class of 2016	$330K	$350K
Class of 2015	$350K	$370K
Class of 2014+	$365K	$385K
And the raises will be retroactive to January 1.

The full email is[ available on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/cwt-match-22/2/)

# Don’t Let Your Law Firm Get Over-Lawyered To Death
## How the classic law firm model fails, and how modern law firms succeed.

Six months ago, most of us hadn’t even heard of generative AI. Today, legal industry leaders are all grappling with how much this new technology is going to change the way we do business, from basic research to contract drafting to potentially changing how much headcount a firm can or should maintain. These days, generational shifts in the practice of law seem to be coming around every two or three years. Law today is not for the faint of heart.

Back when change was more incremental, law firm leaders could afford to make decisions slowly and deliberately. This generally suited lawyers’ personalities. Ours is a precedent-based business. We make our living helping clients identify and avoid risk, piloting their grand business visions through established processes and safe harbors. Being careful and considered about change is in our nature.

Slow decision-making processes were also an artifact of the relatively unique ownership structure of most firms as compared to the larger business world. When considering the universe of companies making hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in revenue a year, most have either a highly concentrated or highly dispersed ownership structure. You have closely held mega-corporations, often governed by the owners themselves, and your publicly traded entities, governed by the C-suite and a selected board of experienced business professionals.

What you don’t find a lot of are companies in the middle, those with flat organizational structures and large numbers of stakeholders. No stakeholder commands huge voting power on their own, but all of them have a sizable voice and a non-negligible amount of influence. In the cutthroat survival-of-the-fittest business world, few organizations have evolved that sort of structure. Yet that is the model on which so many firms operate — largely, I’d argue, to their detriment.

The Odd Industry Out

Most of the prevalence of this model strikes me as a combination of an historical accident and an artifact of temperament. The modern law firm started on the classic partnership model, which is a model that makes sense when it’s a few people in a room trying to make decisions about their combined enterprise. But as the practice of law scaled up, the model of our business stayed largely the same.

That’s partly because, for better or worse, law firms are made up of lawyers. We’re smart, opinionated people who get paid well to weigh in on our clients’ major decisions. Is it any wonder that a group made up of the people who gravitate to that sort of job would also have a lot of strong voices that care about maintaining their seat at the table? More than that, we’re owner-operators who live and breathe our company in ways that passive investors and executives-for-hire just can’t. Stockholders can sell out, executives can move on, but a lawyer never really leaves their practice behind them.

Whereas most trades and industries shifted responsibility for management and vision up to the C-suite over the past decades, much of the legal industry has kept its leadership structure flat and broadly distributed. Their legal structure may have changed, but in their heart of hearts most law firms remain partnerships.

All of these factors — temperamental, historical, and structural — reinforce a law firm culture of slow, measured change. We analyze, discuss, and debate ideas thoroughly. We campaign within our firms to build consensus, and we find compromises to get the votes we need. It’s the same careful, deliberate decision-making that our framers sought when they created our congressional system.

But if you’ve been paying attention to our government any time in the past 30 years, that comparison should not inspire confidence.

What Makes Sense Today?

I understand why the partnership decision-making model has dominated for as long as it has, but I don’t think it’s made sense from a business perspective for decades. As soon as law partnerships graduated from a few attorneys around a conference table to mature enterprises with hundreds of attorneys and thousands of staff, the old model stopped working. Most partners spend the majority of their time tending to their practices and keeping their cases moving along, and they simply don’t have the bandwidth to keep up with industry trends and changes — let alone have critical statistics committed to memory and know the inner-workings of the firm.

Further, the sheer number of voices needing to be heard on every issue in a partnership management model is a recipe for death by committee. By both nature and training, we tend to be good at spotting problems and pitfalls in proposed solutions, while underdeveloped at spotting and seizing opportunities. Consensus tends to be easier to build around old, proven, safe ideas, while transformative, disruptive concepts struggle to get off the starting line. Although partnerships sit around and debate concepts to death, tabling bold action for further consideration, more nimble corporate entities can swoop in and eat the partnership’s lunch.

Perhaps when the economy was booming and industry-wide changes were rare, we could get away with suboptimal leadership methods. Inefficiencies and mistakes were masked by strong market conditions. But those days are gone.

Can We Stop Ourselves?

It’s no secret that lawyers have high opinions of themselves. We think we’re the smartest people in the room. We’re control freaks. We love to share our views with others. Why should we stop ourselves from inserting ourselves into every management decision — pointing out flaws and risk?

The answer: because you’ll kill your law firm if you don’t. Law firms that want to thrive in the coming years need to adopt governance models that empower their leadership to make rapid, bold, and sometimes controversial decisions. Firms need to embrace risk and change, and the discomfort that comes from trying something transformational. Partners need to shift from thinking of themselves as individual contributors and think more about the health of their firms as a whole. It’s a big ask, but the times demand it.

This isn’t a call for firm management teams to be given a blank check and no oversight. If anything, empowering firm managers to make tough decisions quickly will make consensus building more necessary than ever. A law firm’s executive team needs to communicate its thoughts, goals, and vision relentlessly. It needs to have an open door for partners, associates, and staff to be heard and potentially influence the decisions that get made. More than anything, leadership needs to cultivate trust and buy in within the firm, because increasing our tolerance of risk will lead to failures at some point. By building trust, we can survive the failures, learn from them, and fight back against the inevitable push to retreat to the old business model that doesn’t work anymore and never really did.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Some Are Quite Doubtful Biglaw Can Repeat Its Pandemic Profit Boom

It certainly will be really hard to repeat any kind of growth. Firms will struggle to match this year’s results, and that might be possible, though it’s going to be hard. I can’t imagine any firms will be able to move forward with 20% to 30% growth in profitability.

— Law firm consultant Lisa Smith of Fairfax Associates, commenting on whether or not she thinks [Biglaw’s soaring (and perhaps unprecedented) pandemic profit levels will be sustainable](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-laws-soaring-profits-may-be-next-pandemic-darling-to-falter) given our economic environment, the state of world affairs, and additional cost of associate salary increases.

# Morning Docket: 11.21.16
## * Despite the fact that President-elect Trump has called for the cast of ""Hamilton"" to apologize to Vice President-elect Pence for delivering a message to him after the show, Pence handled it well, saying he ""wasn't offended,"" and that he reminded his kids that the mixture of boos and cheers from the audience as he took his seat was ""what freedom sounds like.""

Perhaps the president-elect -- or his legal team -- really does know the tax code better than anyone else. [[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2016/11/18/trump-gets-25-million-tax-write-off-for-trump-university-settlement/)] * Libertarian vice presidential candidate Bill Weld is settling back into private practice after the election.

Meg Sullivan (via Paul Hastings)

“Jack Frost chilling, the hawk is out / And that’s what Christmas is all about / The time is now, the place is here / And whole wide world is filled with cheer.” — [Run D.M.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_Hollis), Christmas in Hollis

According to a [new report](https://www.paulhastings.com/news/details/?id=60d9ea69-2334-6428-811c-ff00004cbded) from Paul Hastings and Bloomberg BNA’s Big Law Business, a substantial majority of attorneys believe that the most prevalent challenge in advancing diversity and inclusion at their law firms is [implicit and unconscious bias](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/implicit-bias-the-silent-killer-of-diversity-in-the-legal-profession/).

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In July, Paul Hastings, in partnership with Bloomberg Law’s Big Law Business, surveyed 261 law firm attorneys and corporate counsel to assess their views and practices regarding diversity and inclusion in the legal industry.

Nearly nine in 10 corporate counsel surveyed had practiced law in a law firm previously— with nearly four in 10 saying they left law firms because of diversity and/or inclusion related reasons, according to the [report](http://images.about.bna.com/Web/BloombergBNA/%7Bae603543-5553-46ce-b71c-27357d2ed8d9%7D_21191_Diversity__Inclusion_Executive_Summary.pdf?elqTrackId=01A28E30EEB52C9D07A41F7D9865F0CE&elqaid=560&elqat=2).

In addition to listing implicit bias as an obstacle to advancing diversity and inclusion efforts, the report outlines fourteen other challenges law firms face. Here are the top twelve deterrents to diversity and inclusion, according to the surveyed attorneys and corporate counsel (with the percentage of respondents indicated parenthetically):

-
Implicit/unconscious bias (69%)

-
Lack of diversity on executive committee (48%)

-
Lack of succession planning for institutional client relationships (46%)

-
Not getting asked to go on client pitches (45%)

-
Lack of diversity on compensation committee (41%)

-
Clients not pushing for diversity (41%)

-
Not getting enough challenging and stretch opportunities (37%)

-
Lack of succession planning for leadership (36%)

-
Confirmation bias (35%)

-
Not getting assigned to lead roles on cases (34%)

-
Failure to get critical feedback (33%)

-
Unfair allocation of origination credit (29%)

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with Meg Sullivan, Paul Hastings’s Chief Business Development, Marketing and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Officer and Founder of the [Quorum Initiative](http://www.thequoruminitiative.com/), an international organization focused on accelerating the advancement of executive women in business.

Throughout our conversation, I couldn’t help but notice Sullivan’s vast international experience. Before joining Paul Hastings, Meg was based in Europe for ten years. She was the Director of Marketing for the Europe, Middle East, India and Africa region at Andersen, the former global professional services firm. In addition, Meg served as the director of development and export for a major French clothing manufacturer, the director of development for the largest French shoe manufacturer, and the assistant vice president in an American venture capital business. Not surprisingly, she is also fluent in French.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): This summer, “Corporate Social Responsibility Officer” was added to your official title. Can you tell us what this entails?

Meg Sullivan (MS): I have always been passionate about diversity, inclusion and corporate responsibility. With the addition of CSR to my remit, I now have the opportunity to further embed corporate social responsibility into the business of Paul Hastings.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We know that corporate social responsibility is not just the right thing to do, but that it’s smart business. I am helping to ensure that we undertake our pro bono, sustainability, charitable, and diversity and inclusion programs, with the same intensity that we bring to our work for clients.

RC: According to your [report](http://images.about.bna.com/Web/BloombergBNA/%7Bae603543-5553-46ce-b71c-27357d2ed8d9%7D_21191_Diversity__Inclusion_Executive_Summary.pdf?elqTrackId=01A28E30EEB52C9D07A41F7D9865F0CE&elqaid=560&elqat=2), the most prevalent challenge in advancing diversity and inclusion at law firms is implicit and unconscious bias. Your report also highlights fourteen another challenges. What are some specific things law firms can do right now to increase diversity and foster a more inclusive culture?

MS: Law firms need to make the business case for diversity and inclusion. We know that diversity and inclusion is not only something that our clients are pushing for, but it is also critical for innovation, and something that helps businesses to succeed.

Law firms need to move from looking at diversity and inclusion as nice to have, to viewing it as a business enabler. That means embedding diversity and inclusion into the business, rather than having it exist in a silo. It means working with the practices on diversity and inclusion goals, programs and recruiting. Cultivating diversity and inclusion needs to be important to everyone at the firm.

RC:  Why should law firms be worried about these issues?

MS: I’d go back to highlighting that diversity and inclusion is smart business. At the end of the day, it’s a bad decision to not focus on diversity and inclusion when we know that diverse perspectives help firms to better serve their clients and drive innovation.

Law firms should do it for themselves, and if that’s not enough to push them, they should be cultivating diversity and inclusion because we know that clients want it. They should be worried because they need diversity to make informed decisions in a changing legal landscape.

RC: Over the next five years, what does success look like for Paul Hastings in this space?

MS: Success would be for diversity and inclusion to be fully integrated into our business. Success would be for all of our people to feel like they can bring their best selves to work, to express their perspectives, and to be a catalyst for change at Paul Hastings.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

MS: I just wanted to thank Above the Law for casting a spotlight on this important issue and to thank your audience for reading. The more dialogue around these issues, the more possibility for evolution and change. I couldn’t be more optimistic about developments in this space for the future because it makes great business sense.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Meg Sullivan for sharing her experience and wisdom with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

To see the full list of challenges law firms face in advancing diversity and inclusion, be sure check out the [Diversity and Inclusion: Annual Report](http://images.about.bna.com/Web/BloombergBNA/%7Bae603543-5553-46ce-b71c-27357d2ed8d9%7D_21191_Diversity__Inclusion_Executive_Summary.pdf?elqTrackId=01A28E30EEB52C9D07A41F7D9865F0CE&elqaid=560&elqat=2). And if your firm is launching innovative diversity initiatives, please let us know about them.

Terrible news from University of California Berkeley School of Law: rising 2L Brian Lewinstein is presumed dead after falling from a waterfall in Oregon in an attempt to take a picture earlier this week.

According to[ reports](https://www.law.com/2018/08/15/uc-berkeley-devastated-by-law-students-presumed-death/), Lewinstein crossed a safety line in order to get a picture of Toketee Falls from above when he fell. Police are continuing their search today through difficult terrain, but[ they say](https://www.flashalert.net/news.html?id=5204&alert=1) Lewinstein is presumed dead:

“There are several factors at play that make this search problematic, such as the steepness of the terrain, the length of the fall and the fact that Mr. Lewinstein possibly landed in the first pool beneath the falls. If he landed in the falls there is a possibility he was washed down to the second pool or even into the North Umpqua River,” said Wayne Stinson Emergency Management Coordinator.

Divers are unable to search the pools due to dangerous water conditions.

Search efforts are expected to wind down today, after Search and Rescue personnel are comfortable they searched all ground where Lewinstein could have fallen.

Berkeley Law has been hit hard by the loss of one of their own. Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, who taught Lewinstein last year, [reached out to the law school community:](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2018/08/14/rescuers-looking-for-uc-berkeley-student-who-fell-near-waterfall-in-oregon)

“We are devastated at the news of Brian’s accident,” said Dean Erwin Chemerinsky in an email. “He was a beloved member of our community. Our thoughts and deep sympathies are with his family at this difficult time.” Chemerinsky said he taught Lewinstein in a constitutional law class.

The school has also made counseling services available:

“We’re a close-knit community,” said law school spokesman Michael Bazeley on Wednesday. “Students get to know each other well, as do students and faculty and staff. When something like this happens, it can hit hard. We’ve reminded students, faculty, and staff that we have counseling services available to anyone who wants to use them.”

Our thoughts go out to Lewinstein’s family and friends at this difficult time.

# More Firms Should Offer Origination Bonuses To Associates
## The extra revenue and professional development opportunities are usually well worth the expense.

As many people within the legal profession already know, numerous law firms offer associates a bonus for work that they bring into a firm.  Indeed, many shops award associates a percentage of any revenue from clients they originate, and this amount is usually 10 to 20 percent of all collections received from an associate’s clients.  However, a number of law firms do not provide associates with any reward if they bring in business, or merely assure attorneys that any business development will affect end-of-year bonus determinations.  Nevertheless, more law firms should offer origination bonuses to associates, since firms can increase their revenue through such initiatives and associates will be more motivated to grow professionally.

I first became aware of origination bonuses when I worked at my second job after graduating from law school.  During the interview process, the partners told me that the firm had an origination bonus program, and this really appealed to me.  In order to increase my income, I made sure to attend as many networking events as possible and cultivate my contacts so that I could originate business at the firm.

It took a while to bring in business, but over time, I originated a handful of clients that eventually accounted for six figures of revenue.  This was a decent amount of money to the small firm I worked at, and the business I originated helped keep people busy at the firm.  In addition, I stayed at that firm longer than most attorneys did, so that I could develop the business that I helped originate.  Furthermore, origination bonuses helped me develop skills and step outside my comfort zone in ways that I had not done earlier in my career. I am not sure if I would have felt confident [starting my own firm](https://www.rothmanlawyer.com/) if I did not have experiences with origination bonuses while working at this shop.

I later worked at a few different firms that did not have origination bonus programs.  Because the firms did not award additional compensation based on the work associates originated, I did not feel as compelled to bring in business.  In fact, none of the associates at those firms really originated business.  As a result, the firm was largely reliant on a handful of clients that were originated years ago by a few senior partners.

At one of my year-end reviews, I brought up the issue of origination bonuses when the partners opened the floor up to suggestions that could improve the firm.  The partners seemed hostile about implementing origination bonuses, and seemed peeved that I would bring up the topic.  The senior partner gave two reasons why the firm did not want to institute origination bonuses.  First, the senior partner said that origination bonuses could increase the firm’s malpractice liability, since matters originated by associates are usually outside of the firm’s wheelhouse.  Second, the senior partner said that origination bonuses could open the firm up to additional conflict-of-interest issues with our major clients.

I never found either of these arguments convincing.  Clients originated by associates would be vetted just like clients originated by partners, and simply instituting an origination bonus program does not mean that the firm needs to take every matter that comes our way.  In fact, if an associate bagged a juicy corporate client, neither of these reasons would likely be implicated.  The senior partner was honing in on a few past issues that had no bearing on origination bonus programs as a whole.

It seems like there are a few major reasons why firms do not institute origination bonuses.  Not to mince words, but the main reason is greed.  Partners sometimes do not want to share more of the firm’s revenues with associates than is absolutely necessary.  Indeed, one time earlier in my career, I was at a firm that did not have an established origination bonus program, and rather told associates any business would be considered during year-end bonus determinations.  One associate originated an extremely lucrative personal injury matter that eventually netted the firm a substantial amount of money.  That associate received absolutely nothing for the origination, and this example shows that some firms are simply unwilling to share extra revenue with associates.

Another major reason why firms do not have origination bonuses is because firms want to be in control of all of the money that is shared in a firm.  By instituting origination bonus programs, firms are less able to control how revenue is distributed, since money is provided to associates according to a calculation instead of the discretion of managers.  However, firms can establish programs that merely entitle associates to ten to twenty percent of the revenue from clients they originate so the lion’s share of revenue is still in the control of the firm.

Some might say that origination bonuses shouldn’t be necessary, and that associates should see business development as part of their job.  Indeed, some may argue that associates are not being team players if they only strive to originate business when there is something directly in it for them.  However, most associates are simply tasked with billing time to generate revenue, and developing business is not within their normal job description.  In addition, people should not denigrate associates for being motivated by making more money, and firms should try to incentivize associates accordingly.  Although firms may have to pay associates additional compensation with origination bonuses, the extra revenue and professional development opportunities are usually well worth the expense.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Announces Their Own Year-End And Special Bonuses For Associates
## The market has finally settled on a standard.

Once [Davis Polk decided](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/) to announce bonuses — and come over the top of the scale set by Cravath via an additional round of special bonuses — we knew it’d only be a matter of time before the floodgates opened. And boy, the rapid clip at which firms are announcing bonuses of their own is something to behold. It sure feels like Biglaw was waiting for the market standard to be set just as anxiously as we were!

Proskauer Rose, a firm which took in $989,981,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 43rd in the Am Law 100, announced their own scale of both year-end and special bonuses for associates. And whaddya know? As is completely expected, the firm matched both the annual and special numbers that make up the prevailing market rate.

# Baker McKenzie Is *Finally* Offering Associates Special Bonuses
## The firm is also offering true-up payments for its salary cuts. Great news!

On November 11, Baker McKenzie shocked the Biglaw world by making the [very first bonus announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) of the year. Two weeks later, Cravath [adopted the same bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) and added special bonuses on top, and the rest of Biglaw rushed to match the new market standard.

Associates at the firm were disappointed that there were no special bonuses to be had, but when making its original bonus announcement, the firm said it would match any increases in the market. On New Year’s Eve, Baker McKenzie management finally came through on that promise, announcing that it would be matching the special bonuses that had been circulating for months. These bonuses will be made available to associates who have at least 1,900 qualifying billable hours (including 125 approved pro bono and diversity and inclusion hours). Check out the special bonus scale, below:

On top of that great news, the firm will also be making full salary restoration payments to all employees who were affected by the COVID-related spending cuts the firm instituted on May 1. All special bonus and salary true-up payments will be made on January 29. Happy new year, Baker McKenzie associates!

(Flip to the next page to read the full Baker McKenzie memo.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Partners Should Avoid Badmouthing Their Law Firm To Associates
## Perhaps most importantly for partners, badmouthing a law firm to associates does not make these partners look good.

People generally love to badmouth their employers, especially if their employer is implementing a policy that is disfavored or is failing to look after employees’ needs. Indeed, at every single law firm at which I worked before starting my own practice, associate attorneys would constantly gossip and badmouth disfavored practices. This often helped build a connection between employees and would help pass the time when work was slow. However, at some law firms, certain partners also badmouthed the law firm which employed all of us. This is generally bad for morale, and partners should definitely watch what they say if they commonly badmouth a law firm to associates.

To be clear, most partners understand that it is not usually a good idea to badmouth a law firm. Even though partners might have issues with a law firm, voicing concerns with associates is unlikely to lead to any positive change that can benefit a partner. Moreover, voicing concerns with associates can irritate other partners, which can have a negative impact on a given partner’s career at a law firm. However, sometimes partners cannot resist the urge to gossip and badmouth a law firm to associates. Perhaps the partner has unique knowledge about a situation or just wants to get something off their chest. In any event, some more-senior attorneys cannot resist the urge to badmouth a law firm to other lawyers at a shop, including associates.

I once worked at a law firm where the partners would routinely badmouth the law firm and other partners. The law firm was not doing well financially, and it was safe to say that its best days were well behind us. People at the firm complained about wages, oversight by managers, and numerous other issues that people had to deal with during the course of their jobs. I did not get the sense that most of the partners were equity partners of the shop and had a financial stake at the law firm. Most of the partners were just elevated to this position for the sake of the title due to having been at the firm for a number of years, and it was probably easier for them to bill the attorneys at a higher rate if clients knew that they were partners at a shop.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Hearing partners badmouth the law firm often had no benefits for the firm. None of this lead to any positive changes at the shop since associates had absolutely no “juice” at the firm and could not implement any type of changes as a result of what the partners said. Moreover, associates second-guessed the future of the firm because of all of the badmouthing which, 1.) made it less likely that associates would sacrifice to improve the firm and,  2.) made it more likely that associates would look for the exits and find new positions. The badmouthing partners also sucked up oxygen around the office, since the time they spent gossiping about how awful things were was time not spent billing hours or completing other tasks that could improve a law firm.

Perhaps more importantly for the partners, badmouthing a law firm to associates did not make these partners look good. Although everyone loves office gossip, people might respect partners who badmouth their own law firms less. Some might think that it is a partner’s duty to toe the party line and that they are not living up to their job expectations if they spend their time badmouthing the firm that employs the partner.

The respect of associates can be important to the future career prospects of partners, [as I have discussed in a few previous articles](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/partners-shouldnt-burn-bridges-with-associates/). Associates enter all different kinds of roles after they leave their law firm jobs. If these associates enter in-house roles or the business sector, they can be a good source of business for partners who used to employ them. Even if they stay in private practice, associates who leave shops can always refer matters that they cannot handle themselves to former partners. However, associates might be less likely to refer matters to partners who badmouthed their former law firms since these former associates might not respect the partners as much due to this conduct.

All told, office gossip is inevitable, and sometimes it can be enjoyable to badmouth a law firm, especially if a shop is guilty of egregious practices toward its employees. However, partners should be more careful about not speaking negatively of their employer since this can have a number of negative consequences for the firm and their own reputation as well.

Adam H. Schuman is perhaps best known for his work in prosecuting the “Wolf of Wall Street” securities fraud case, made infamous by the Leonardo DiCaprio film by the same name. Now he’s leaving his government work, most recently as special counsel for public integrity for New York, to [join the partnership](https://biglawbusiness.com/perkins-coie-hires-wolf-of-wall-street-prosecutor/) of Biglaw.

Today, Perkins Coie announced Schuman was taking his [talents to their New York office](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/adam-h-schuman.html), where he’ll join their white collar and investigations practice:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“Adam is a highly respected and experienced litigator and trial attorney,” Markus Funk, chair of Perkins Coie’s White Collar & Investigations practice, said. “His prosecution and high-stakes defense background, coupled with his in-house and public-sector experience, is an ideal match with our culture of professional excellence. We are excited to have him on our team.”

A New York University Law School alum, Schuman’s worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of New York (where he worked on the Wolf of Wall Street case) and spent over a decade working in the legal department of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. He clerked for S.D.N.Y Judge Loretta Preska after law school and went on to work at Paul, Weiss and Corbin Silverman & Sanseverino.

Congratulations on the new gig!

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2012/01/IMDb-Internet-Movie-Database.png)When I was a kid, my father leaned across the dinner table and whispered to me, “Never ask a woman’s age or weight.” He then stole a glance at my mother, who was busy shoveling mashed potatoes into her maw, and sighed. I could never tell whether my dad was trying to offer the wisdom of the ages or making a statement about the tyranny of manners, the clichés they birth, and the way in which politeness can imprison a good man in a loveless relationship that inevitably leads to you watching your 400-pound wife shovel potatoes back like she was auditioning for The Biggest Loser.

And so it was that the Internet Movie Database, aka [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/), found itself under attack for revealing an actress’s age and “real Asian name.” Kash [detailed](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/10/actress-to-imdb-im-too-old-for-this-sh/) the charges last October. A few weeks ago, [we noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/12/morning-docket-12-27-11/) that the woman would have to put up (her name) or shut up (legally speaking).

Well, I don’t want to waste any more of your precious time. The grand reveal is finally here.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

After the jump, pictures of an attractive Asian woman….


In Kash’s [original post](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/10/actress-to-imdb-im-too-old-for-this-sh/) on the topic, there were only two guesses in the comments section as to the actress’s identity (Academy Award winner Bai Ling and “asian porn star Katsumi”). Both excellent guesses. When I read the story, I was only able to come up with a few myself. I thought it had to be either [Maggie Q](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MTQyMDIyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMzODAzMQ@@._V1._SY314_CR19,0,214,314_.jpg), [Moon Bloodgood](http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjk4MzA4Mzk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxNDY1Mg@@._V1._SY314_CR5,0,214,314_.jpg), the man who jumps out of the trunk in Hangover with the small penis, or the Joy Luck Club.

Well, dear readers, we all struck out. If we had merely thought back to the time we had that really rad slumber party and watched all those great movies, we would have distinctly remembered the “young” woman who portrayed Ghetto Girl Three in Hoodrats 2: Hoodrat Warriors. You’ve already guessed her name, haven’t you? Yep, [Junie Hoang](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387470/).

At least, that’s the name she used when she played Janet in My Big Phat Hip Hop Family. It’s the name that appeared in the credits (just before the keygrips) when she memorably portrayed Slapping Girl in Single and Dealing With It. It most definitely is the name she used when she put Hollywood on notice in her turn as Ensign del Rio in Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust. Hell, she used Junie Hoang when she showed up again in that franchise’s Gingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Cleaver.

But guys? That’s not her real name. Those a-holes over at IMDb had the audacity to gank her credit card information and reveal to the entire world that her name is Huong Hoang. And that’s not all. They also posted on her awe-inspiring IMDb profile her real age of 40. 40! Listen, you don’t need to have seen Searching for Debra Winger to know that women in Hollywood are forced to lie about their ages all the time. Once their real ages are out there, they have no recourse but to play minor roles in movies like Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust. Real talk, guys.

The Hollywood Reporter has been all over this important story. Kash linked to the original complaint, via THR, in [her original post](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/10/actress-to-imdb-im-too-old-for-this-sh/), and THR also broke the news of her real name [this time around](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/actress-suing-imdb-reveals-name-279213).

Anyway, before we go, let’s take a quick look at [Huong Hoang](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/huang-hoang/) née [Junie Hoang](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/junie-hoang/). Because pictures are better than words.

# 'This Is A Slap In The Face,' Say Associates After Hearing About Bonuses
## Things don't seem too rosy over there.

Troutman Sanders is about to merge with Pepper Hamilton in a move that [should create an Am Law 50 firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/troutman-pepper-hamilton-sanders-honors-both-firms-names-until-we-all-shorten-it-to-troutman-in-6-months/), but the current Troutman associates don’t seem too excited with the state of the firm right now.

Troutman sent around individualized bonus announcements yesterday and based on the reactions we’re hearing, folks didn’t do so well. As Troutman associates move up the ranks, the gap between their compensation and the market level diverges sharply, and one tipster said, “I haven’t heard one associate get even 50 percent of market.” Associate reactions we’ve heard about include:

“This is a slap in the face.”
“This is what I expected.”
“This is embarrassing”
“The partners must really hate the associates.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Given the individualized nature of the bonuses, we’re obviously only hearing a slice of it. Though bonus numbers that evoke strong reactions like these aren’t great for the firm even if there’s a counterbalance out there somewhere. It just doesn’t set a good tone with the market. In any case, if these responses are representative of the reaction throughout the firm, that merger with Pepper Hamilton couldn’t come soon enough. Because Pepper’s culture is much better about bonuses, right? [Oh… oh no!](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/pepper-bonus-2019/)

Hey, maybe 1+1=3!

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Biglaw Firm Gives Majority Of Associates Bonuses Bigger Than Cravath Scale
## If a firm is going to wait three extra months to announce bonuses, at least they have the courtesy to beat the prevailing market scale.

December *feels* more like bonus season than March. The end of the year and holiday season puts folks in a retrospective mood, plus there’s so much money rolling out — travel, gifts, parties — it’s nice to get a nice big check rolling in. But just because most Biglaw firms use the end of the calendar year as the marker doesn’t mean we are completely devoid of Biglaw bonus news.

Last week, McDermott Will & Emery began making their individualized bonus announcements. This week, the firm revealed that 51 percent of their associates got bonuses in excess of the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/) — with the top billers exceeding the market rates by $60,000 or more.

If a firm is going to wait three extra months to announce bonuses, at least they have the courtesy to beat the prevailing market scale.

The reaction from ATL tipsters seems to be very positive so far:

McDermott announces bonuses today.  Haven’t talked to many people yet, but I am very happy.  2013 grad with high hours and good reviews, more than double Cravath market.

[The Above the Law polls will stay open till 9:00 p.m. EST](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-above-the-law-electoral-law-school-election/). But right now, it does not look like Trump is going to win the lawyer vote. Our entire map is blue, meaning that every law school for which we have data is going for Hillary Clinton.

In fact, he might not finish second. Here’s our current vote tally:

Hilary Clinton 78.12%
Gary Johnson 10.74%
Donald Trump 10.34%
Jill Stein 0.84%

Good lord.

The strongest Trump contingent is from Harvard Law School, with seven votes… out of 80 cast. UVA has been the Gary Johnson stronghold: eight out of 36 votes. Only the University of Chicago has registered more than one Jill Stein vote… with two.

It’s not surprising that lawyers are with Her, but the margin is kind of amazing.

# Biglaw Offices In Russia And Ukraine Confront Reality Of Wartime Law Practice

As Russia invades Ukraine, [Baker McKenzie and Dentons have closed up their Ukraine offices](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/baker-mckenzie-dentons-close-kyiv-offices-as-russia-invades/). No word on the DLA Piper presence, but it’s likely closed up as well. Dentons told Bloomberg Law that “We are in regular contact with our team in Kyiv and are providing our 49 colleagues with any assistance they need, including relocation assistance in the neighboring countries.”

Which is to be expected. It’s impossible to imagine a global law firm operating in Ukraine over the last few years without formulating an emergency response. As soon as the former administration lifted sanctions on Russia and held up military aid to Ukraine, conflict may not have been guaranteed, but became increasingly likely. Hopefully these firms have successfully practiced for this scenario and have their people protected.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But what about the firms operating in Russia? There’s not an immediate risk of conventional attack in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but the security situation will clearly deteriorate quickly, whether from genuine guerrilla threats or — probably more likely — a martial crackdown by Russian authorities motivated by hypothetical guerrilla threats. Beyond the immediate safety of law firm personnel, how do firms continue working on deals for the benefit of the Russian government or private entities with devastating blanket sanctions looming? That’s before even getting into the moral question of lending legal succor to an international aggressor.

According to [Legal 500](https://www.legal500.com/c/russia/directory/), these firms are all doing business in Russia:

Akin Gump
Allen & Overy
[UPDATE: Baker Botts]
Bryan Cave
Cleary
Clifford Chance
Debevoise
Dechert
Dentons
DLA Piper
Eversheds
HoLove
King & Spalding
Latham
Morgan Lewis
Norton Rose
Squire Patton Boggs
White & Case
Winston & Strawn

We’ve reached out to a few of these firms to hear what they’re doing in response to the situation. We’ll update as we learn specifics. In the meantime, while lawyers and staff working in Ukraine are under immediate threat, keep those working in Russia in your thoughts as well. There’s not really a safe place when neighboring countries are locked in a full-scale war.

# Elon Musk And Twitter Clash In Court Over How Many Months We Have To Listen To This Before Musk Loses

Today marked the first hearing in Twitter’s lawsuit against Elon Musk (which will soon [also be Musk’s countersuit against Twitter](https://nypost.com/2022/07/18/elon-musk-to-countersue-twitter-in-attempt-to-scrap-44b-buyout/)). If you’ve missed this case so far, Musk asked to buy Twitter, offering a “seller friendly” agreement designed to close the deal on an expedited basis before the speculative bubble inflating his personal wealth took a hit from a combination of market forces and investors deciding that buying Twitter for a massively inflated price just to make a weed joke ($54.20 a share… GET IT!) might be a red flag about Musk’s business acumen.

The agreement waived his right to due diligence, agreed to a $1B breakup fee if he walked away, and included an explicit agreement that he’d consent to being ordered by the court to close the deal in the alternative. It’s… [pretty brutal for Musk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/) unless you’re getting really disingenuous [CREATIVE!](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/elon-musk-will-beat-twitter-wsj-says-its-obvious-assuming-you-change-every-single-fact-and-law/)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This opening hearing dealt with Musk’s opposition to Twitter’s request for an expedited trial. Apparently, now he wants everything to slow down. But the crux of Musk’s argument rested on his claim that Twitter’s spam bot calculations required intensive factual and expert discovery which… [is total nonsense](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/elon-musk-asks-court-to-push-trial-to-2023-based-on-his-inability-to-understand-statistics/). But you go to Delaware with the army you’ve got not the army you want, so off to the hearing they went!

For a complete breakdown, enjoy this [full real-time reaction from business school professor @Kolyin](https://twitter.com/Kolyin/status/1549407533269504002). But here are some highlights from the thread along with some additional commentary:



I agree completely about the appropriateness of “ain’t” here. This is the crux of Musk’s whole defense and it makes no sense. Twitter’s methodology to test for bots — at least as described by Twitter — is statistically sound and there’s very little chance it would be off by more than a percent or so, which is nowhere near enough to be material. It’s so laughable that it deserves the casual blow off that “ain’t” would convey.

The “45 seconds” line is critical, because Musk wants some sort of “turn over every rock” approach to bots, but given that he had access to all the public filings and still didn’t negotiate this into the contract, the relevant question isn’t “how many bots are there?” but “did Twitter perform the test it claimed it performed and did that test turn out the numbers it claims?” That makes a huge difference in the scope of discovery.



Do we go ahead and include an orgy image? Why not?

Will it be grueling for the litigation teams at these firms? Sure. But it’s eminently doable.

This also raises a philosophical question: would you rather work around the clock for three months or 75 percent of around eight months? I feel like it’s a lot easier to get up for a three-month crucible. Maybe that’s just me. But while this motion is mostly about Twitter and Musk, it’s also about the exact contours of hell awaiting the associates on both sides.



Freudian projection became a recurring theme for the Musk team. And it didn’t augur well that they’re kicking off the argument reminding the court to stick to the agreement because, you know, that’s the document that’s extraordinarily damning for Musk.



See what I mean?





It’s worth taking a second to focus on the restatement, which does indicate that Twitter thought it was material — at least in the context of the filing, but maybe not in the context of an acquisition — but, as Twitter would point out later in the hearing… that happened days after the agreement but Musk didn’t seem perturbed about it until much later.



Yup. You CAN call out the other party for breaching the agreement, but you don’t HAVE to. Twitter was content to [watch Musk breach the agreement all over the place](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/elon-musk-already-breached-the-twitter-takeover-agreement-with-his-stellar-record-of-following-the-rules/). They literally had between one and roughly 44 billion reasons to just watch it all burn like an unfortunate Tesla.



This is excellent analysis. It is kind of an implied threat, which is never good, but it’s also a terrible one. If there’s enough in this case to ruin the next 60 days, why in the world would the court agree to make this the story of the next eight months?

And, as it happens, Judge Kathaleen McCormick was having none of that:



In other words…



Honestly, I wasn’t necessarily reading the statement as a swipe at the court, but the judge certainly seems to have had that takeaway. If I didn’t already think his legal team was about to lean hard on Musk to settle, this should give them the firepower to lean hard on Musk to settle. Because she can’t be too pleased with counsel that questions the court’s ability to do its job and that’s a bad omen for every future delay tactic that the defense may be eyeing.

And for the finale:



There you have it. I’d say this will be a fun Halloween, but worse than the expedited trial date is the tentative five-day trial. That’s a much clearer signal that the court is not buying that the complexity argument because Biglaw firms can jam thorny discovery into a short, intensive window, but no one is hearing both sides of an impenetrably complicated M&A deal in five days.

This is a klaxon for Musk that the court isn’t planning to indulge a bunch of wild twists and turns.

Will he hear it?

# Trump Lawyer Cleta Mitchell Let Her Freak Flag Fly In Jan. 6 Committee Deposition

Cleta Mitchell (image from the old Foley & Lardner site)

Representative democracy is fine, but let’s not carried away here.

That appears to be the stance taken by Trump lawyer Cleta Mitchell in her [acrimonious interview](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000083769/pdf/GPO-J6-TRANSCRIPT-CTRL0000083769.pdf) with the January 6 Select Committee on May 18, 2022. Mitchell, who was swiftly [un-personned](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/) from Foley & Lardner after her involvement with the Trump campaign’s efforts to overturn President Biden’s Georgia win, seemed largely unconcerned with the expressed wishes of the voters.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Here she is explaining that state legislators are entitled under the Constitution to simply reject the results of any presidential election if they don’t like the outcome:

Let me make something very clear. The Constitution of the United States grants plenary power to state legislatures to chose the electors of the state. Congress has enacted a statute which is an enabling law, which I happen to think is unconstitutional, because that power granted in the Constitution to state legislatures is complete and total. There’s nothing in the Constitution about allowing people, citizens to vote on electors. Now, that is something that legislatures have over time decided they want to do. But in my view, according to the Constitution, that’s an advisory role that happens because the legislature has created a mechanism to conduct the election. And assuming that that mechanism is carried out in accordance with the statutes that the legislature has enacted to make it possible for the citizens to weigh in and make their voices heard, then the legislature can use — choose to use what the people have decided. But that’s not in the Constitution. And so I think that that is one of the things that we hadn’t really — as a country, we haven’t focused on that. But that is what the Constitution says. So it’s not like picking an alternate slate of electors. The legislature has the authority to choose the electors. And they don’t have to ask anybody’s position, in my view.

And here she is explaining that Congress has the constitutional right to simply reject a state’s electors for any reason or no reason at all:

I have got a report that somebody may have sent to me last year that goes through the history of the United States and the number of times that members of Congress have said I’m not going to vote to certify these electors. And they don’t have to have a reason. They can just say I’m not voting for this. And they have done that.  And there have been a lot more Democrats doing that than Republicans over the years. So there’s a long history of that happening. Now, Mike Lee is a constitutionalist and he came to believe that, absent a competing set of electors that he had, he did not have the constitutional prerogative to reject the electoral slate. That’s up to him. I respect that. I don’t agree with it, but I’m not going to argue with Mike Lee about the Constitution, for heaven’s sake.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In fact, she seems pretty skeptical about voting across the board, alleging that money spent by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to increase voter participation amounts to a violation of state election law. Similarly, she pointed to increased ballot access measures passed during the pandemic as “a pretext for upending the duly enacted laws passed by state legislatures.”

“Now, you may have a different view, but we’re lawyers and we’re both entitled to read the law in the way that we think is appropriate,” she said, implicitly acknowledging that her viewpoints are somewhat outside the mainstream, adding that, “I don’t think people ought to be massacred or put in jail or disbarred because they have a different legal view than you do.”

Who is being massacred, Cleta? 

If these cockamamie theories sound familiar, it’s because they were also advanced by Trump’s Coups 4 Dummies lawyer John Eastman, whom Mitchell referred to as “one of the most brilliant lawyers I know, and he’s brilliant on constitutional law and constitutional history.” Eastman was also separated from his job at Chapman University Law School when his connection to the fake electors scheme came to light — and that’s not the only connection between these two.

Mitchell made repeated reference in her testimony to one of the Trump election challenges in Georgia, not only making [false assertions](https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/000A-Myths-and-Facts-of-the-2020-Presidential-Election-20210113-FINAL.pdf) about a dastardly failure to get a judge assigned in timely fashion (the delay was the fault of Team Trump jumping the gun on an appeal), but claiming that she’d presented proof of thousands of illegally cast votes, more than sufficient to overturn Biden’s margin of victory.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It would appear that this was what Eastman was [referring to](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/court-finds-even-more-crime-frauding-in-last-batch-of-john-eastman-emails/) in a December 31, 2020 email in which he wrote: “Although the President signed a verification for [the state court filing] back on Dec. 1, he has since been made aware that some of the allegations (and evidence proffered by the experts) has been inaccurate. For him to sign a new verification with that knowledge (and incorporation by reference) would not be accurate.” US District Judge David O. Carter abrogated attorney-client privilege as to this email under the crime-fraud exception, since Eastman was apparently trying wangle his way around having Trump sign a false attestation. But the fact that even Eastman knew that Mitchell’s numbers were nonsense is … pretty funny. And not for nothing, but Trump went on to sign it anyway.

Also funny were Mitchell’s dogged attempts to ignore the inconsistencies in her own position. Why was she bothering to sue if the state legislature and US Congress could simply reject the electors out of hand? Why was she only challenging ballot access initiatives and COVID modifications in swing states where Democrats won? Wouldn’t her fakakta theories mean that Democrats were entitled to reject red state electors if they controlled the Senate? How could she possibly be claiming attorney-client privilege for her communications with the White House Counsel’s Office? And if she thought Mike Pence’s role on January 6 was “ministerial,” why did she suggest that he reject Georgia’s electoral slate citing pending litigation?

But no issue caused greater fireworks than her denial that she had anything to do with the fake electors scheme, despite multiple communications suggesting otherwise:

STAFF COUNSEL:  Senator Lee says, “I think that’s the best way to frame this, that our role (as to any state’s electoral votes) is triggered by the existence of a competing slate of electors?” And then Senator Lee says, “That seems to be the sweet spot for getting my colleagues to engage.” You say, “Yes. That’s why I was asking the White House today to organize that ASAP.” I’m trying to understand — I’m trying to understand what Ms. Mitchell is saying.

MITCHELL: It seems to me that it speaks for itself. The communications  speak for itself.

STAFF COUNSEL: Are you refusing to answer the question I asked you?

MITCHELL: I’m not refusing to answer. You keep asking me the same thing and I keep telling you the same thing.

STAFF COUNSEL: I don’t think you’ve answered.

MITCHELL: I think state legislatures have a certain authority and I think members of Congress have a separate distinct responsibility and authority. And I don’t think any of this, none of it, should rise to the level of your badgering me, because I’m a lawyer and I’m having a conversation with a senator about the constitutional prerogatives of the Senate.

STAFF COUNSEL: Ms. Mitchell, I’m not —

MITCHELL: Yes, you are. And I’m not refusing to answer. I’m telling you that the document speaks for itself. That’s the conversation. That’s roughly the way I remember it. And I would like to move on.

The ugliness went on for several minutes, at the conclusion of which Mitchell finally conceded that, “Perhaps, yes,” she was suggesting that she’d told the White House that they needed to organize “competing sets of electors” to satisfy the members of Congress who’d have to reject the ones legitimately chosen by the voters.

At the end of which she was neither massacred or jailed. She wasn’t even disbarred!  But no doubt if you asked her, Mitchell would tell you that she’s the real victim here.

# Morning Docket: 10.02.17
## * Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families, friends, and colleagues of the victims of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, which took place last night in Las Vegas, Nevada. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/us/las-vegas-shooting.html?mcubz=0)] * ""There’s only one prediction that’s entirely safe about the upcoming term. It will be momentous."" The Supreme Court's October Term 2017 begins today, and it will be Justice Neil Gorsuch's first full term. The docket features issues like voting rights, religion and discrimination, workers' rights, and digital privacy, and Trump's DOJ has radically flipped its position from that of prior administrations in many of the cases, which hasn't happened in decades. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/us/politics/supreme-court-term-2017.html)] * Jeffrey Toobin wonders, ""How badly is Neil Gorsuch annoying the other Supreme Court justices?"" Based on the junior justice's behavior thus far -- from his seemingly politicized appearances to his domination of oral arguments to his dissenting jab at Justice Kennedy -- the answer could very well be PRETTY BADLY.

What do Roberta Kaplan, the longtime Paul, Weiss partner and Above the Law’s [2013 Lawyer of the Year](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/above-the-laws-2013-lawyer-of-the-year-competition-the-winner/), and J. Michael Luttig, the Fourth Circuit judge turned Boeing general counsel, share in common?

Not a lot, you might think. Kaplan, a leading liberal litigator, is most famous for winning the Supreme Court case of [United States v. Windsor](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf), a landmark LGBT rights ruling. Judge Luttig, in contrast, was for many years a top conservative contender to sit on the high court (and is now reportedly [under consideration to serve as FBI director](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/who-is-being-considered-to-succeed-james-comey-as-director-of-the-fbi/)).

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Well, here’s your answer: they both [spoke at law school graduations](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/2017-law-school-graduation-speaker-round-up/) this year, and in their remarks, they both stressed the importance of the rule of law. In her commencement address at Pace Law School, Robbie Kaplan even gave Judge Luttig (and Above the Law) a nice shout-out:

This sense of inherent dignity that animates the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence in Windsor and Obergefell is not necessarily limited to people. Like my client Edie Windsor, principles and institutions like the United States Constitution, the Rule of Law, and the Presidency itself have their own sense of dignity. Those of you who read the Above the Law blog may have seen [a post](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/supreme-court-shortlister-turned-general-counsel-calls-out-the-court-plus-presidents-and-congress-too/) about a speech former Fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig gave at the graduation of the University of South Carolina law school earlier this month. In that speech, Judge Luttig proclaimed that “we in the legal profession are the stewards and guardians of the Rule of Law – the foundation of civilized society and the guarantor of liberty. If this sounds as if the lawyer holds a special place in the constitutional order that is our democracy and that we are weighted by an almost-sacred responsibility, it is because we do and we are.”

In these polarized times, it’s nice to see two legal luminaries from opposite sides of the aisle stressing the importance of the rule of law (even if they might disagree on whether specific actions — such as President Donald Trump’s firing of FBI director James Comey, discussed by Kaplan in her speech — are consistent with the rule of law).

This is just one highlight from Robbie Kaplan’s moving and thoughtful speech, in which she shares three lessons she learned from litigating the Windsor case. Flip to the next page to read her remarks in full (and if you haven’t read it already, check out her wonderful memoir, [Then Comes Marriage](http://amzn.to/1kHR552) (affiliate link)).

# Morning Docket: 06.20.18
## * A Guatemalan woman seeking asylum in the United States has filed suit against the Trump administration, alleging that her 7-year-old son was taken from her at the border last month. She's only spoken to him once, and desperately wants to be reunited with her child. [[The Hill](http://thehill.com/latino/393063-guatemalan-woman-sues-trump-administration-over-alleged-separation-from-her-son-after)] * Stop the inhumane insanity: A group of state attorneys general and former U.S. attorneys have written letters to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, demanding that he ""immediately"" reverse his policy of separating families at the border, letting him know that ""the unfolding tragedy falls squarely on [his] shoulders."" [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2018/06/19/state-ags-to-sessions-stop-separating-families-at-the-border/)] * After being dumped by McDermott Will, Michael Cohen has hired Guy Petrillo as his attorney. Petrillo is an ex-S.D.N.Y. prosecutor, which could make it easier for his client to negotiate a deal of some sort after he starts cooperating. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/nyregion/cohen-trump-prosecutor-lawyer.html)] * Seyfarth Shaw has been slapped with a $40 million malpractice suit by Manhattan's Blue Dog restaurant group, with claims that the firm ""negligently, deceptively, and repeatedly"" failed in its attempts to properly represent them. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/19/seyfarth-hit-with-40m-malpractice-action-in-ny/)] * The Justice Department will be holding its annual DOJ Pride event on June 26, and it's doubtful that AG Sessions will attend. To be honest, given his record, it's probably better this way for the LGBT employees who'd be celebrating.

# Saying Biglaw Hiring Coordinators ‘Have More Beauty And Fewer Brains’ A Bad Move For Headhunter
## Most legal recruiters don't hurl sexist rants at the people they have to work with. Some, apparently, do.

This is, apparently, a law firm hiring coordinator in this guy’s mind.

I don’t get it. I’ve tried these many years to figure out what drives him, but I just don’t get it. Every few months, Harrison Barnes, the big boss man over at BCG Attorney Search and LawCrossing, decides to take a break from dispensing straightforward career advice and delves into these massive screeds that absolutely never end well for him.

Finally, he may be starting to figure this out.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For a guy whose business is based on building relationships with prospective laterals and the law firms that might hire them, Barnes just keeps going out of his way to make public statements that only seem to alienate everyone he’d theoretically hope to attract. He’s waxed philosophic about whether or not poor black people can have [the work ethic required for Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/poor-black-lawyers-lack-work-ethic-says-legal-recruiter/) and told attorneys to avoid anything that might suggest they [aren’t a white, heterosexual male](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/how-to-make-your-resume-shine-for-racist-homophobic-misogynists/). One could imagine a charitable reading where he’s just decrying the ugly yet persistent biases of law firm hiring, but he never seems to make those connections as much as he gives them further currency.

Perhaps he thinks that once he crosses the 9,000-word threshold, no one is going to bother to read up to the point where he starts going into how important it is to provide a phrenology map in your résumé or whatever his bugaboo of the week happens to be. Personally, I think he should probably try putting his thoughts in a diary, locking it, then setting it aflame, scattering the ashes in multiple states, then hiring a ghostwriter to write color-by-numbers “Put Your Best Foot Forward!” pieces for his business from now on.

So now Barnes has managed to insult law firm legal recruiters because on a long enough timeline he’ll get around to insulting everyone. In a piece ostensibly about [helping applicants understand the Biglaw hiring process](http://www.bcgsearch.com/article/900047900/What-Does-Silence-Mean-When-a-Law-Firm-Fails-to-Respond-to-Your-Application-or-Interviews-You-and-Then-Goes-Dark/), he throws in some now deleted passages about his estimation of firm recruiters:

“If you have not noticed by now, most legal recruiters are women, and most are quite attractive and fit. This is because they are in positions that involve public relations—sort of like an on-air television newscaster. There is nothing wrong with the fact that most law firms put people like this in these positions because they are the public face of the law firm. What is problematical, though, is that some of these people can also—occasionally—be a little ditzy and not have the other sorts of qualifications that would make them qualified for the job. Not only do they sometimes have more beauty and fewer brains, but they also may have more beauty and less interest in people, less ability to connect with people, and similar negative characteristics. This means they expect people to treat them as if they are special and sometimes are more focused on themselves than their jobs.

It is not uncommon for recruiting coordinators to use their workspaces as a hunting ground for mates—and it works. Many recruiting coordinators marry (or get married to) associates and partners inside of the law firm. This is what happens when attractive and successful people are put in confined spaces 10 hours a day. Once a legal recruiting coordinator gets close to an associate or partner in the firm, the recruiting coordinator may start playing favorites—and often does. People who are close to the associate or partner may get special treatment when applying to the firm, for example. If there is tension in the job of the associate or partner (i.e., getting fired, getting a bad performance review, or leaving), this can affect the performance of the recruiting coordinator a great deal.”

This is vintage Barnes ranting right here. He could have said that firm hiring folks vary in skill and attention to the applicant’s file — which would probably still irk the firms — but instead he decided to kick it up that extra notch by throwing in a surfeit of retrograde sexism. Consider the deft handling of both the dumb-hot dichotomy and the conniving golddigger trope — in the same passage! This isn’t easy folks. And this gem: “marry (or get married to).” Masterfully stripping away her very agency! After all, she doesn’t get married, a male lawyer gets married to her.

Remember, this is an article about how to deal with not hearing back after an interview. If you give a thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters to work on a piece about not hearing back from an interview… they still wouldn’t write any of this.

As you might imagine, recruiting coordinators didn’t appreciate the piece. A sampling of comments made on LinkedIn (where Barnes mind-bogglingly decided to put it):

- This article is offensive and sexist, and Harrison Barnes, you should be ashamed to have published this.
- This article is extremely sexist, not to mention full of overbroad, inaccurate statements offered without any supporting evidence. Qualified candidates should know better than to take advice from anyone spouting this sort of nonsense.
- If this article is any evidence of how you treat and regard these professionals, then perhaps that is the reason you don’t receive the feedback or responsiveness you’d like, not because of their own skills or attributes.
As the uproar mounted, Barnes began his much-needed apology tour, writing law firms a mercifully non-rambling mea culpa that concluded with a key announcement:

I take this issue very seriously. It has become clear to me that I need to take some time to reflect on my comments. To that end, I have decided to take an extended leave of absence from BCG Attorney Search to reflect on my actions, and I will no longer be making submissions on behalf of our candidates. I am very, very sorry for any offense this article has caused.

Good for him. Seriously, I’ve been covering his posts for over four years and every single time I wonder when it’ll dawn on him how self-destructive these posts are. Stepping away for a while is a good first step.

Just when you thought the salary wars were getting boring….

It started interestingly enough, with Milbank shocking the Biglaw world with new raises. Simpson Thacher kept the intrigue alive when they went over the top with special bonuses. But once Cravath finally came to play, slightly increasing salaries from the Milbank scale for senior associates, most firms have adopted the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale. But now a firm has decided to be different — but associates aren’t happy about it.

Cooley has announced they are raising base associate compensation in line with the market standard. But there are no summer bonuses for associates:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In regard to the summer bonuses being paid by some firms, we have chosen a different course consistent with our long-standing commitment to awarding merit-based bonuses. In the Management Committee’s view, the only basis upon which to decide who would receive a summer bonus and who would not would be year-to-date billable hours averages through June. The variability of work flow and the timing of leaves of absence and vacations across a given calendar year aside, the simple fact is that our bonus system is not based upon productivity alone. As we have consistently demonstrated, we differentially reward am attorney’s total contribution to the firm, to include performance, productivity and non-billable contributions which demonstrate behavior that is consonant with the Firm’s values.

Rather than pay bonuses based on productivity alone at this stage in the year, our 2018 bonuses will be paid with a clear understanding of the total compensation being paid within the market at the conclusion of the year. Consistent with prior years, our differentiated bonus payments will provide total annualized compensation for our top performers which materially exceeds the total compensation received by attorneys at other firms.

It strikes me as odd the firm’s decision to whiff on summer bonuses depends so much on an arbitrary definition of fairness. Sure, some firms have explicitly tied bonuses to prorated billable targets which might seem unfair, particularly if you anticipate a busy Q4. But… there are a lot of ways to give associate bonuses in a *fair* way. You could not tie these dollar amounts to any billable target, which many firms seem to have done. Or you could take the creative approach of Gunderson:

To be eligible for this mid-year bonus only, you must have annualized hours of at least 1,800 for the six-month period ended May 31, 2018.  We recognize that there is significant variability in hours over a partial year and have therefore set the eligibility threshold at a relatively low level.  If you are not eligible for this mid-year bonus but finish the year with annual hours greater than 1,800, then you will receive an amount equal to what your mid-year bonus would have been (had you been eligible) in addition to your year-end bonus (not diminished or reduced by the year-end payment to you of a mid-year bonus amount).  Mid-year bonuses will be prorated based on start date, part-time and leave arrangements.

See, there are lots of options besides telling associates to wait and trust that the firm will make it up.

Reaction from associates… hasn’t been kind. As one tipster notes:

Associates are beyond livid at this cheap and short-sighted move by the firm.

And yes, associates are making a lot of money, but they have every right to be pissed off. First of all, it ties an additional 6 months of employment at the firm to their promised payday. There are a lot of interesting prospects in the lateral market, but if associates want to be paid the same as peers at other firms they’ll have to wait till the end of the year to think about moving. There’s also the time value of money — the concept that money available at right now is worth more than the same amount in the future. If Cooley is so damn sure they’ll beat the market in overall compensation, they could just pay all associates market bonuses now and deduct that from the end of the year bonuses.

But that’s not what Cooley decided to do.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”).

# Demand For The Billable Hour Is Down
## But the industry as a whole might be okay.

The past decade has been a period of stagnation in demand growth for law firm services.

— The [conclusion of the 2017 Report on the State of the Legal Market](http://thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2017/january/2017-report-on-the-state-of-the-legal-market.html), by The Center for the Study of the Legal Profession at Georgetown University Law Center and Thomson Reuters Legal Executive Institute. However, as Steve Kovalan of [ALM Intelligence notes](http://www.law.com/sites/ali/2017/02/21/big-law-and-the-case-of-the-missing-demand/) the report tracks demand of law firm billable hours, so the legal industry as a whole, specifically alternative service providers and those using alternative fee arrangements, might still be alright.

You’ve updated your resume and your LinkedIn profile to strategically market you and your terrific legal skill set. You’ve got the right number of keywords in both, you feel confident about taking the next steps to advance your legal career, and you’re excited to get out there and begin interviewing.

Yet, no one is knocking down your door? Why?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
You can have an amazing resume and equally fantastic LinkedIn profile, but you still need to put the time into your job search strategy. That means taking advanced steps beyond just waiting for the phone to ring.

I like to think of it this way: [your career is a marathon not a sprint](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/finding-your-own-career-happiness-and-path-to-success-in-law/). It isn’t just a simple 5k that you roll out of bed and show up to a start line. It takes planning, preparedness, and strategy to make it to the finish line (i.e., a job offer). Your job search is like a pie: one-third is your resume, one-third is your LinkedIn, and the other third is your job search strategy.

LinkedIn makes it easy for you to actively pursue opportunities, but you must pursue them. This means connecting with the right people, targeting the right companies, and building a network to propel your job search. It also means spending maybe 15% of your time applying to job search boards and the rest on making connections and expanding (or building) your network for opportunities. Here are some specific strategies I recommend undertaking during your job search:

- Look beyond just having a LinkedIn profile. While being on LinkedIn is a necessity for a digital-age job search, just [having a LinkedIn profile](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/quick-ways-to-refresh-and-optimize-your-linkedin-profile/) only gets you so far. Start becoming more active on LinkedIn by sharing articles, increasing the size of your network, and engaging with those in and out of your network. For example, I had a senior law firm partner with deep experience in the private equity space who heavily marketed himself on LinkedIn by connecting with general counsels at specific private equity companies he found intriguing in the SaaS technology space. He secured multiple [informational interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/how-to-power-your-career-transition-or-job-search-with-an-informational-interview/) that ultimately led to multiple job opportunities. Again, this was done specifically through calculated and targeted networking, not a “spray and pray” method of job searching.
- Connect with recruiters on LinkedIn. Don’t wait for recruiters to reach out to you — be proactive and start building relationships with recruiters who are actively posting open opportunities on LinkedIn. Send an e-note and let them know you’re beginning a confidential job search. Don’t be afraid to ask to set up a quick chat so you can run through the type of role you’re seeking. You want to build an ongoing relationship with multiple recruiters so they can keep you apprised of any future opportunities where you might be a good fit. While it’s good to build relationships with recruiters in your geographic area, expand your search to recruiters who do nationwide placements since the job market today fosters incredible opportunities for remote work.
- Check your LinkedIn settings. Make sure your [LinkedIn settings are correct](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/how-to-update-your-linkedin-profile-without-making-your-law-firm-or-company-suspicious/) and that your profile is searchable and visible to nonconnections. Check your job search preferences. Make sure those are turned on as well as the button that allows recruiters to reach out to you directly. These preferences allow you to target on-site, hybrid, and remote opportunities — they’re terrific if you’re looking to pursue an out-of-state or international job search.
- Seek out informational interviews and networking meetings. Begin setting up meetings and heavily networking with other high-level executives who are where you want to be currently as well as in the future. Message them. Introduce yourself and your reason for reaching out (but do not push your resume in their face — if your LinkedIn profile is optimized correctly, it will give enough detail for that cursory introductory call). Find a common thread if possible (example: you both worked in Biglaw or you both grew up in Florida and went to undergrad there). Ask for a 20-minute chat to learn more about their in-house experience at XYZ company. Let them know you’re pursuing an in-house opportunity in the industrial manufacturing space — perhaps they know of a similar company that’s currently seeking a corporate counsel with your level of experience. Continue to engage with their content on LinkedIn. Show enthusiasm for their subject matter expertise and thought leadership.
- Apply for jobs that are advertised as well as not advertised. A good number of jobs are not advertised online (also known as the hidden job market), and many advertised online are filled by internal candidates. This is why it’s imperative to network. Again, I emphasize this: reach out and connect with people who are where you want to be five, 10, or 15 years from now. An employee referral is one of the best ways to get your foot in the door and can lead to those hidden job market opportunities. Remember, follow-up with people. Do not wait for them to get back to you.
- Apply to the right positions. Just because you read a job description and think the role seems intriguing doesn’t mean it’s the right position for you. If you’ve got 15 to 20 years of practical experience running a legal department at a publicly traded company and the job posting is seeking a general counsel with three to five years of experience, that likely means the company is seeking someone more junior to serve as the sole counsel (and likely at a lower salary range than what you would be commanding with two decades of experience). Go through the roster of people in the legal department before you apply to a role — perform a simple search of the employees listed on the company’s LinkedIn profile. You’ll get a feel for how long they’ve been there for and how long they’ve been in practice for. While you can still inquire about the role even if you’re outside the realm of their target and seek out an informational interview, concentrate your efforts where your years of experience match and you meet at least 75% to 80% of the key qualifications. You’ll find you get better responses that lead to better opportunities.
- Organize your job search. Create a list of companies or law firms you want to target (anywhere from five to 15). Also, consider industry, sector, and geographic targets. Next, [create a job search spreadsheet](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/effective-strategies-to-organize-your-job-search-and-keep-a-positive-mindset/) to keep yourself organized. You’ll want to keep track of when you’ve made outreach, who you’ve contacted, and the progress of the outreach. Complete as much research as you can on a company before you ever reach out to anyone at the company — if you’re already a general counsel, you’ll want to interact with other members of the C-suite team. If you’re a junior corporate counsel, you’ll want to connect with someone who is more senior than you who will have decision-making authority. The key is to create a warm lead that fosters a long-term relationship. This means following up and nurturing that relationship.

The job search process has changed dramatically in the past few years. Proactive networking, an organized strategy, and a [positive mindset](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/effective-strategies-to-organize-your-job-search-and-keep-a-positive-mindset/) are just some of the tools you’ll need in the process. I hope these job search strategies will set you up for great success in your upcoming or future digital age job search.

# Associate Bonus Watch: A Litigation Powerhouse Announces
## Some associates are pleased, but others don't like the firm's expanding marketing requirement.

The litigation powerhouse of Quinn Emanuel, one of the most [formidable](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/09/the-biglaw-firms-most-feared-in-litigation-2014/) and [financially successful](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) firms in all of Biglaw, just announced bonuses. From our sources at the firm, we have good news and bad news.

The good news: the firm used the same bonus matrix as [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-firm-with-fat-stacks-of-cash-for-its-biggest-billers/), which was well received at the time. Said a source:

Quinn bonuses are finally out! Looks like same as last year. Mildly head-scratching why they’d take so long just to repeat, but immediate payment is great and can’t complain on top of the base salary increase.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
That’s the good news. What’s the bad news?

Some sources are irritated by what they see as the increasing burden imposed by the [marketing project](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/quinn-emanuels-new-marketing-initiative-an-interview-with-john-quinn/) that associates must complete if they want to be [eligible for a bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/top-law-firm-withholding-bonuses-unless-associates-do-a-marketing-project/). We have posted on the next page an email that went out to associates that tightens up the criteria for a qualifying marketing project, emphasizing that it must be a “substantial” effort taking up twenty or more hours of time. Here is one tipster’s take:

The constantly increasing requirements on the marketing project are annoying. We basically have to work 120+ hours compared to peers in order to get a market-level bonus now. It’s going to be interesting what effect this has on recruiting and retaining talent when the [Susmans](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-and-new-partner-watch-susman-godfrey/) and [Boieses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schillers-bounty/) of the world we’re competing against actually have market-beating compensation.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Marketing requirement is bad. Doesn’t even count to the proverbial “100 hour bucket” (for pro bono, recruiting, non-billable stuff like that). Basically requiring unpaid work.

Back to our original tipster:

[There seems] to be a universal feeling of annoyance at the goalpost shifting [on the marketing project]. Some of us were joking that next year it’ll evolve to “the project must result in originating at least $500k in fees in order to qualify for a bonus.”

I also think the associates wouldn’t have any issue with above-market requirements if they were met with truly above-market compensation — not taking home less than a 10th of the revenue you generate for the firm as a thank you for billing an extra 300 hours to hit 2400.

Flip to the next page for the complete QE bonus matrix. The highest bonus tier gives associates about 35 percent above market, but for hitting the (pretty brutal) benchmark of 2700 hours.

One possible rebuttal: people who work 2700 hours do so because that’s what’s required to serve the client, and it’s not supposed to be a purely monetary matter. Quinn associates are also fortunate enough to work on some of the most interesting and high-profile cases in the country, and they get hands-on litigation experience at a much earlier point in their careers than many of their colleagues at other firms.

The rebuttal to the rebuttal: with [$4.4 million in profits per partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/), the second-highest in the Am Law 100, Quinn Emanuel can afford to pay bigger bonuses and still enjoy crazy-high PPP. Displacing Wachtell Lipton in the top spot might have to wait a while (at least until the M&A market cools down further), but QE’s in no danger of falling out of the top 10.

Now that we have bonus news from Kirkland & Ellis, Sidley Austin, and Quinn Emanuel, many of the major players have weighed in. But we haven’t heard from all of them — for example, West Coast-focused firms, which typically announce bonuses a bit later.

We’re happy to cover those announcements, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Happy holidays!

# March Is For The Girls

March is one of my favorite times of the year — as a lifelong basketball fan and a former Division III college player, there is nothing quite like the madness of this month. The sheer volume of games compressed into such a short time span, combined with the unpredictable upsets and unforgettable moments, truly encapsulates the essence of the sport.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This year is particularly special to me, as it feels like women’s sports — and in particular, women’s basketball — are finally getting the attention they are due, thanks to the incredible year and career of Iowa’s Caitlin Clark. Clark has broken most offensive records of note, and on March 3, 2024, she broke Pete Maravich’s 54-year record to become the all-time leading scorer in NCAA basketball (men’s or women’s). And she’s not done yet.

As remarkable as Clark’s season and career have been, what I have found most inspiring is what she has done for women’s basketball as a whole. Clark is the biggest story of this season for women’s and men’s basketball. Girls and boys are clamoring for a picture or autograph from Clark. The AP reported that Iowa road games saw a [150% increase](https://apnews.com/article/caitlin-clark-scoring-aaef3ceebb200a2dd326dc94371585c1) in average attendance. [More people](https://thespun.com/college-hoops/womens-college-basketball-has-better-ratings-than-mens-on-fox) are watching women’s games than men’s games.  The [New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/business/caitlin-clark-womens-sports-economics.html) that women’s sports would generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year, up about 300% from a 2021 estimate.

As we head into the NCAA National Championship tournaments, the women’s competition is getting as much, if not more, attention as the men’s. Even [Shaquille O’Neal](https://people.com/shaquille-o-neal-says-hes-only-watching-womens-college-basketball-this-year-just-a-better-game-exclusive-8608817) is more closely following the women’s tournament. Considering all of this, it’s astonishing to recall that [until 2022](https://theathletic.com/4196257/2021/09/29/march-madness-to-be-used-for-womens-basketball-championships-starting-in-2022/), the NCAA declined to promote or utilize its “March Madness” trademark for the women’s tournament.

I am a lifelong basketball fan. I was playing year-round by the time I was 10. It was my first true love, and I was fortunate enough to continue my career in college, at the small engineering school I attended. As a young girl, I worshiped the likes of Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi — incredible players in their own right.  But neither of them captured the imagination of the country like Caitlin Clark.

This year may mark a [sea change](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/caitlin-clark-women-college-stars/677788/). Because as fabulous as Clark is, a wave of exceptional players is coming up behind her. Junior Angel Reese led LSU to the national championship over Iowa last year and is poised to make another run this year. Freshman Juju Watkins at the University of Southern California is [averaging more points per game](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-basketball/news/juju-watkins-caitlin-clark-stats-comparison/5e59b08ba22a65124aef87b2) than Clark did in her first year. The landmark changes with Name, Image, and Likeness deals offer [substantial opportunities](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/15/that-nike-bronny-james-nil-deal-was-a-big-deal-for-women-too.html) for increased visibility and exposure for female athletes. There is every reason to believe that the attention Clark has brought to the game, and the talent following in her wake, will continue to capture the attention of the country.

My basketball career ended almost 15 years ago, and I am now a practicing lawyer and a mom of two little boys. I am filled with gratitude knowing that my sons will grow up in a world where women’s sports are finally receiving the recognition they’ve long deserved. It brings me immense happiness to think that they will have remarkable athletes like Clark to admire and look up to.

Clark’s popularity also gives me hope that other segments of American society, including the legal profession, can make great strides in reaching gender equality. Bloomberg reported in January of this year that for the [first time](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/women-exceed-50-of-law-firm-associates-for-first-time), a slim majority of law firm associates are women.  The same report also found that women make up 40% of all attorneys at private firms — another record.

These statistics resonate deeply with my own career in private practice. A decade ago, as I was starting my career focused on patent law, the sense of being the only woman in the room was palpable, and it only seemed to intensify as I progressed. However, in recent years, we’ve  made real strides in recruiting and retaining women for our IP Department, even within this traditionally male-dominated field of patent law. Just as Clark’s achievements pave the way for future women athletes, the success of more women in the legal industry continues to provide a clearer path for those who will follow.

There is still much work to do to achieve true gender equality, and to ensure society and our institutions value women’s efforts as much as men’s.
