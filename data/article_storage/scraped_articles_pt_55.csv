# On The Future Of Offices And Cities
## The bottom line: I'm worried -- very, very worried.

Me, about 20 years ago, in my (most definitely not paperless) office (Photo by David Lat).

This coming weekend, my husband and son and I will return to Manhattan.

For the past four and a half months, since my [discharge from the hospital](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/coronavirus-and-me-david-lat-covid-19-journal/) on April 1, we’ve been away from New York, dividing our time between my parents in New Jersey and my parents-in-law in Massachusetts. But we feel that it’s finally time to come home.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Of course, we could certainly stay away for longer if we wanted to. My husband and I could continue working remotely, since our employers have not yet reopened their offices. Our son is not yet old enough to be required to go to school (and for kids who are, school reopening plans [remain unclear](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/nyregion/new-york-schools-reopening-coronavirus.html)).

And many of our fellow New Yorkers have decided that they will stay away for longer — much, much longer, like forever. These New Yorkers have decided that they [are tired of being New Yorkers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/realestate/coronavirus-escape-city-to-suburbs.html). If they’re not required to be in the city for work, and if many of the cultural and culinary attractions of New York are either still closed or only partially reopened, why put up with the difficulties, inconveniences, and high cost of city living?

I have previously written about how the coronavirus pandemic has made Biglaw [more open to working remotely](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/what-good-might-come-out-of-the-coronavirus-crisis/). Forced to go virtual, law firms have discovered that it’s not so bad — and even has its advantages. Lawyers who no longer have to commute have more time to bill; in my work as a recruiter, I’ve spoken to a number of partners and associates who have hit records in terms of monthly billing during the pandemic. And work is more tolerable when, say, you can take a break in the afternoon to play with your kid or jog on the beach.

So let’s play this out a little. Even after the COVID-19 crisis is behind us, law firms will be more tolerant of working remotely, and individual lawyers will increasingly expect — and even demand — the ability to work remotely (at least for part of the time, or for specified reasons).

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In 2017, brokerage Cushman & Wakefield asked 500 law firms a question: Do you anticipate your attorneys will work more remotely in the next five years? Of the respondents, 62 percent said yes. The brokerage asked the same question in January 2020. This time, the figure jumped, with 78 percent responding yes.

And that was before a pandemic.

When the brokerage asked the question amid the coronavirus outbreak this spring, some 120 firms, large to small, responded — and 96 percent said yes, they anticipated their attorneys will work more remotely in the next five years.

Even before COVID-19, law firms were already moving in the direction of smaller offices. Post-pandemic, the trend will accelerate, as law firms try to reduce their real estate costs — one of the biggest expenses of a law firm — by taking advantage of the fact that more of their employees will be working remotely, for more of the time.

I suspect that some law firms will move to either [“hoteling” or “hot desking,”](https://spaceiq.com/blog/what-is-hoteling-in-the-workplace/) two models in which employees don’t have their own set offices or desks. (In hoteling, you make a “reservation” for a space, like you would for a hotel room; in hot desking, it’s more “first come, first served,” where you grab an open space.) For example, check out what Freshfields has in store for employees in its new London office, as reported by [Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/13/you-must-give-up-your-office-if-you-are-not-in-freshfields-tells-lawyers-405-65817/):

Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer lawyers face a new challenge when the firm completes its move into its new London office later this year. The firm is planning to operate an ‘office release system’ which means someone else can use your office if you are working remotely.

“If you’re not there, you give your office up,” said London managing partner Claire Wills of the office-wide rule.

The system, which will mean junior lawyers or colleagues from overseas can use a partner’s office if it is empty, will be a cultural change for the top U.K.-based firm…. However, [Wills] said that the pandemic has accelerated such cultural changes, with technology and paper-free working fast becoming the norm.

Note the reference to “paper-free working,” a key component of the equation. Lawyers previously justified having private offices, which they could lock when they left for the day, because of all the (often sensitive or confidential) documents in their offices. But now that those documents are largely digital, whether housed in servers or in the cloud, the case for proprietary desks and offices is much weaker.

And maybe that’s not a bad thing. Going paperless has forced me, a paper pack rat — see the photo of me in my office as a law clerk at the top of this post — to clean up my act. Today I can find documents much more easily, whether they’re on my MacBook or in Google Drive, than I could when they were in disorganized stacks on my desk. I suspect I’m not alone.

So far, so good. The ability for more people to work remotely, whether permanently or on as-needed basis — e.g., because you’re sick, your child is sick, or you have to wait for the cable guy (or gal) — seems like a good thing. The ability of law firms to spend less on office overhead also seems like a good thing. They can (and will) spend some of the savings on technology, of course — more telecommuting requires better tech — but some of the savings will surely find a way back to the pockets of partners, associates, and staff.

But here’s what worries me: the future of our cities. Consider this [portrait of midtown Manhattan](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-time-life-building.html) — the greatest agglomeration of major law firms in the United States, if not the world — from the New York Times:

Midtown Manhattan, the muscular power center of New York City for a century, faces an economic catastrophe, a cascade of loss upon loss that threatens to alter the very identity of the city’s corporate base. The coronavirus’s toll of lost professions, lost professionals and untold billions of lost income and tax revenue may take years to understand and resolve.

Now, midtown has never been the most charming neighborhood — the West Village it is not — so maybe some might say, “Good riddance.” But that ignores the economic toll that collapsing commercial centers and dying downtowns inflict upon the cities in which they’re situated.

If you’re in the mood to read something depressing and disturbing, check out this [post by James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/nyc-is-dead-forever-heres-why/), a longtime New Yorker. Here’s his response to the “New York comes back, it has always come back” argument:

[T]his time is different. You’re never supposed to say that but this time it’s true. If you believe this time is no different, that NYC is resilient, I hope you’re right….

[T]his time is different. One reason: Bandwidth.

In 2008, average bandwidth speeds were 3 megabits per second. That’s not enough for a Zoom meeting with reliable video quality. Now, it’s over 20 megabits per second. That’s more than enough for high-quality video.

There’s a before and after. BEFORE: No remote work. AFTER: Everyone can work remotely.

And, for better or worse, many people will. As more residents leave, no longer required to live in New York, it will become a less attractive place to live and work. New York and cities like it will lose their cultural cachet — they will no longer be where the “cool kids” live — and some people will leave for that reason. The remaining residents will face higher taxes, and some of them will leave too.

This coming weekend, my husband and son and I will return to Manhattan. Our (almost) 3-year-old son can’t wait; for weeks he has been saying, “Tomorrow we’re going back to New York City.”

We still believe in New York. We hope our belief is justified.

# Biglaw Associate Says He Was Fired As Part Of 'Political Purge'

It ain’t easy being cheesy, or a conservative in Biglaw these days. That’s the message we’re hearing —[ again](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/on-the-need-for-diverse-viewpoints). And though it’s [easy to disprove](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/biglaw-isnt-a-cancel-culture-its-a-business-that-cares-more-about-money-than-your-feelings/), it’s a pernicious take that’s making the rounds. The latest incarnation is a[ story on Law.com](https://www.law.com/2024/02/23/fired-associate-says-its-not-easy-being-a-conservative-in-big-law/) about William D. Brown Jr., a former associate at McCarter & English who claims he was fired from the Biglaw firm as part of a “political purge.”

Oh jeez. There’s no cross quite so high as one a right winger puts themselves on. Okay, fine. You’ve got me. Let’s delve into Brown’s story.

Brown was let go from McCarter & English in December of 2023 due to a LinkedIn post about “gangsta rap” and violence in the Muslim world. At least, that’s Brown’s take — McCarter & English would only say they’re “unable to comment on personnel matters.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Let’s start with the [reminder](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/law-professor-where-are-the-men/) — LinkedIn is a professional forum, you don’t need to post every thought there. But let’s dive into what Brown said.

The post that prompted his firing referenced Brown’s experience serving as a Navy SEAL in Iraq, where, he wrote, “There are many beautiful and tolerant Muslims, but the textual language within the Koran is far from tolerant.”

Ummmm, if we want to talk about religious texts that are intolerant, let’s talk about the Bible. Because [in Violence & Theology](https://reflections.yale.edu/article/violence-and-theology/bible-and-legitimation-violence), Professor John J. Collins of the Yale Divinity School explains how little tolerance the Canaanites were shown:

The Book of Exodus tells us that “the Lord is a man of war.” In the ancient world, gods were supposed to defend their people and help them in battle, and the God of Israel was no different in this respect. The most problematic part of the biblical account, however, is surely the conquest of Canaan. According to Deuteronomy, the Israelites were to destroy the people of the land utterly. “Make no covenant with them and show them no mercy.” Rather: “break down their altars, smash their pillars, hew down their sacred poles and burn their idols with fire. For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples of the earth.”1 The Book of Joshua describes how this commandment was carried out. Because Israel is the chosen people, it may, and is even commanded to, destroy any people that seem to obstruct its mission.

Brown’s post continued:

The post went on to say that ”[i]t’s my opinion that there’s also a radical culture within the Islamic world that promotes anti social values and glorifies violence. This has had a devastating impact on millions of young and easily influenced lives.”

Speaking of religious texts that justify real life violence, again from Collins:

The violence towards the Canaanites must be balanced against the humanistic aspects of Deuteronomic law. But the violence remains, and it has had fateful consequences in western history. The English Puritan revolution was justified repeatedly by biblical analogies drawn from the Old Testament. Oliver Cromwell drew a parallel between his revolution and the Exodus, and proceeded to treat the Catholics of Ireland as the Canaanites. He even declared that “there are great occasions in which some men are called to great services in the doing of which they are excused from the common rule of morality,”7 as were the heroes of the Old Testament. A generation later, the Puritans of New England applied the biblical texts about the conquest to their own situation, casting the native American Indians in the role of the Canaanites and Amalekites. In 1689, Cotton Mather urged the colonists to go forth against “Amalek annoying this Israel in the wilderness.”8 A few years later, one Herbert Gibbs gave thanks for “the mercies of God in extirpating the enemies of Israel in Canaan.” He was not referring to biblical times. Similar rhetoric persisted in American Puritanism through the 18th century, and indeed biblical analogies have continued to play a part in American political rhetoric down to the present.9

So maybe not the slam dunk of an argument that Brown supposes it is.

But Brown also used LinkedIn to trot out the problematic trope of rap music causing violence.

The posting also said that “[t]he promotion of anti-social values and the glorification of violence and drugs portrayed in gangsta rap had a huge negative influence on the many young and easily impressionable American black youth.”

Hmmm, notice how Taylor Swift catches no heat for singing “No Body, No Crime” nor did The Chicks when they wrote how Earl had to die. WHAT COULD BE DIFFERENT? Listen, [literal dissertations ](http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1306255326)have been written analyzing violent lyrics and the impact of rap music on Black culture, but I promise you none of that nuance is captured in Brown’s post.

Regardless, Brown says he stopped getting work from the bankruptcy group — he was an associate in that practice area — when Joseph Lubertazzi was elevated to chair. Brown thinks that was because of his political posts on LinkedIn. “When Lubertazzi became chair, it’s my opinion that he wanted to distance himself and the firm from me because he wanted me to go,” Brown said. Which… he bases on vibes, I guess? I dunno, there’s not much by the way of concrete evidence as to why Brown thinks Lubertazzi distanced himself.

But he says it got harder when he asked his colleagues for a referral. Wait… that doesn’t make much sense. Networking is a vital part of lawyering and referrals are a fantastic way to cement a professional relationship.

Then, when another former Navy SEAL friend asked Brown to recommend a criminal defense lawyer, Brown got a lukewarm response from colleagues.

The friend and his son were being questioned by the FBI because they were at the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of the insurrection, although Brown said they “didn’t do anything wrong.”

Other attorneys at the firm showed little interest in making a recommendation, Brown said.

OOOOOhhhhhhhh. Well, now that makes a little more sense. The stink of insurrection and all that.

Brown also complained that he wasn’t put on the firm’s diversity, equity, and inclusion committee to represent veterans. He complained the DEI committee didn’t commemorate 9/11. He complained about the work he didn’t get assigned at the firm. Honestly, it sounds like he was pretty unhappy at the firm.

But that doesn’t play with the story Brown is selling.

He also notes in the article that he does volunteer work:

Brown puts on an annual fundraiser in which Navy SEALS and other athletes swim from Jersey City, New Jersey, to the Statute of Liberty, then to Ellis Island, and finally to Battery Park in Manhattan, where they carry American flags on a run to the World Trade Center site.

As if people who do fundraising are immune from being fired for cause. But being a former Navy SEAL who is a PATRIOT seems way more relevant to Brown than the bankruptcy work he was hired to perform.

So obsessed with that fundraiser is Brown that it’s used to promote the story about the unrelated discrimination he allegedly experienced as a conservative in Biglaw.



Hmmm… A topless photo? Provided as a courtesy to promote this terrible tale of discrimination? Very serious, very professional.

Part of being a counselor is using discretion and judgment, particularly in professional settings. Based on the very little I’ve been able to glean about Brown from this article, wouldn’t shock me if McCarter & English had very justified concerns in this area.

The telling of Brown’s story is all just in service to a larger narrative of conservative victimization. And you know how you *know* this is about getting publicity and maybe even hitting the talk show circuit to complain about the “bias in Biglaw” and not about some grave injustice? It’s a bunch of quotes from a self-serving article in ALM, not from a complaint. The article says Brown is considering litigation, but so far, nothing burger. Indeed, Brown has been such a desperado to get his version of the facts out there he’s been shopping his story to Above the Law and other media outlets. Well, Brownie, we are talking about you… but something tells me you won’t be happy about it.

# Congratulations To The 2020 Skadden Fellows

Skadden Arps (photo by David Lat).

The holiday season is an opportune time to think not just about [Biglaw bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bonuses/), Christmas parties, and vacations, but also about the less fortunate. It’s a time to be thankful for our blessings, but also to share those blessings with others.

So it’s appropriate that this time every year is when we learn about the latest class of Skadden Fellows. As we’ve [explained in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/congratulations-to-the-2019-skadden-fellows/), these prestigious fellowships, “the public-interest world’s version of Supreme Court clerkships or Rhodes Scholarships,” allow their recipients to pursue public interest work on a full-time basis for two years.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Skadden Arps started the program in 1988 to commemorate its 40th anniversary as a law firm, and in honor of the firm’s 70th anniversary in 2018, it extended the program for another decade. According to Kathleen Rubenstein, who [took over](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/congratulations-to-the-2019-skadden-fellows/) as executive director of the Skadden Foundation earlier this year from longtime executive director Susan Butler Plum, this latest crop of 28 new fellows will take the total number of fellows to 877 in just over three decades.

When I spoke with Plum [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/congratulations-to-the-2019-skadden-fellows/) about the selection process for fellows and their projects, she told me, “We try to stay away from what’s sexy and what’s hot. We focus on the work. Nobody knows what the clients need better than the applicants, because they’ve worked closely with the agencies in developing their proposed projects.”

That said, there’s no denying that the fellows and their projects will reflect current events to some degree. So it should come as no surprise that several of the new fellows will be focusing their work on immigration and on serving immigrant communities. In a piece about the new Skadden Fellows for [Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/skaddens-2020-fellows-bring-public-interest-law-to-the-fore), Elizabeth Olson shines the spotlight on two such fellows — Juan Bedoya of NYU Law School and Iva Velickovic of Yale Law School — both the children of immigrants themselves.

Congratulations to Bedoya, Velickovic, and the 26 other deserving recipients and thank you for the work that you already have done — and will do, as Skadden Fellows — in service of the public interest.

# Am Law 100 Firm Reverses Course On COVID Cuts, Restores Full Pay
## But will employees be made whole for the money they missed out on?

As we close out the year of the pandemic, Biglaw firms that instituted austerity measures thanks to the novel coronavirus and the economic uncertainties that came along with it are now walking them back in their entirety. Today, we have news on that front from Blank Rome.

Back in April, the firm — which found itself at No. 80 in the latest Am Law 100 rankings, posting $474,010,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — not only [furloughed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-am-law-100-covid-19-furloughs-continue/?rf=1) a small number of staff members, but it also moved forward with across-the-board pay cuts, [slashing salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/not-content-with-staff-furloughs-am-law-100-firm-follows-up-with-across-the-board-pay-cuts/) up and down the ladder by 15 percent for everyone ranging from staff to partners. After about six months of going without their full salaries, we’ve now received word that the firm has rolled back its all of its cuts.

Employees at Blank Rome are now wondering if they’ll receive true-up payments that will make them whole. We’ve reached out to the firm for comment, and will provide an update here if and when we hear back.

# Biglaw Giant Matches Associate Raises, PLUS Special Summer Bonuses!
## Raises are nice, but raises plus special bonuses are even better.

Now the party has motherf*cking started! Simpson Thacher & Bartlett has come to play in the associate compensation game. They become the [first Biglaw firm with gross revenue over 1 billion dollars](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-billion-dollar-biglaw-firms-that-have-not-raised-associate-salaries/) to match the new scale for associate compensation set [by Milbank earlier this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/).

That’s nice and all… but wait, there’s more.

They also announced summer bonuses, and not in small, inconsequential sums. It ranges, based on seniority, from $5,000 for first-years to an impressive $25,000 for the classes of 2010-2012. That’ll buy baby a nice new pair of shoes.

The new compensation scale at Simpson is as follows:

Class of 2017 $190,000
Class of 2016 $200,000
Class of 2015 $220,000
Class of 2014 $250,000
Class of 2013 $275,000
Class of 2012 $295,000
Class of 2011 $315,000
Class of 2010 $330,000

Summer associates will also have the windfall applied to their paychecks.

As one tipster noted:

IT IS A GOOD YEAR, A GOOD GOOD YEAR

Now we get to speculate about how this will impact the rest of the market. Will other firms match the summer bonus? Will this shame other big-name firms into finally matching the new associate scale? Are the bonuses designed to be a preemptive strike in case Cravath, or another big player, decides to come over the top and raise the base salary to $200,000? Will the summer bonus impact associates’ end-of-year bonuses? Only time will tell how this all plays out.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Making Biglaw Partner In The Time Of COVID

In The Jabot’s 100th episode, I am joined by [Jennifer Schramm](https://www.kslaw.com/people/jennifer-schramm), a partner at King & Spalding. We discuss Jennifer’s career highs and lows, and how she balances her professional life with other interests. Jennifer also speaks about what it was like to make partners during a pandemic, and how to make the best of your career during tumultuous times.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Judge Benchslaps Gibson Dunn Saying They 'Committed Fraud About Fraud'

Delaware Vice Chancellor Travis Laster is pretty miffed at the Biglaw firm of Gibson Dunn. The specifics of it don’t matter much — well, if you care about whether COVID-19 counts in a contract’s exception for calamities or natural disasters, you might care about the case AB Stable VII v. MAPS Hotels and Resorts and you should feel free to read the [243-page opinion yourself](https://static.reuters.com/resources/media/editorial/20201202/anbangopinion.pdf) — but we are so here for the benchslap.

Gibson Dunn represents Anbang Insurance, which was trying to sell luxury hotels to Mirae Asset. But even before the global pandemic threw a monkey wrench into the proceedings, Laster says Anbang — and their attorneys — withheld key information that should have been disclosed to the buyers.

As [reported by ](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28B6M9)Allison Frankel of Reuters:

According to Laster, Gibson Dunn deliberately withheld key information from Mirae and its lawyers at Greenberg Traurig, instead providing “misleadingly incomplete” representations about disputed deeds on some of the Anbang hotel properties. The firm also “sadly … misled the court,” about Anbang’s own investigation of the disputed deeds, the vice chancellor wrote.

“Put bluntly, (Anbang and Gibson Dunn) committed fraud about fraud,” the judge said.

Ultimately, Laster found, the decision by Anbang and its lawyers to withhold critical information from Mirae and the lenders that were slated to provide billions in financing ended up backfiring when the information came to light. The funders were spooked, the closing was delayed and COVID-19 proceeded to decimate the hotels’ business. If Gibson Dunn and its client had been “candid” from the beginning, Vice Chancellor Laster wrote, “the transaction likely would have closed, and this litigation would never have happened.”

According to the judge, a “shadowy and elusive” character concocted a scheme involving forged deeds to claim ownership of some of the properties. In a separate case — also in front of Judge Laster, World Award Foundation v. Anbang — over the ownership of the properties, Gibson Dunn represented that they didn’t know anything about the scheme. That was in January of 2020, however, the judge notes, “Gibson Dunn had … embarked on a massive investigation in August 2019, and it had uncovered considerable information.” That’s… not a great look.

According to the opinion, Gibson Dunn and Anbang did not disclose the World Award case to Mirae, and when the case was found by Goldman Sachs investigators, the signing got postponed. This pushed the closing of the deal into COVID times, and well, that’s how we get this case.

Gibson Dunn hasn’t commented on the matter, but as Frankel notes:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In Anbang’s final post-trial brief, the firm said that the disclosure issue was a red herring because the disputed deeds were obvious fakes. It also said that Mirae hadn’t shown any impact from any delay in revealing the extent of the fake deed dispute, since “those matters were disclosed before a closing date had been set.”

But Mirae’s counsel, Michael Carlinsky of Quinn Emanuel, has a different take, saying, “We are extremely gratified with Vice Chancellor Laster’s thorough and detailed opinion finding that Mirae Asset was justified in terminating the transaction based on (Anbang’s) breaches and pattern of deception.”

I just bet they are.

# Yikes! Biglaw Firms Are Having A Rough Go Of It When It Comes To Collections

Clients this year, more than ever, have been slow to pay. More clients are looking for longer payment terms which can really restrict cash flow. We’ve had to redouble our efforts in collecting from many of our clients before year end.

— The managing partner of a major West Coast Biglaw firm, in comments given to Jenna Greene of [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/its-not-just-you-law-firm-collections-this-year-are-brutal-2022-12-19/), when discussing what 2022’s year-end collections looked like for law firms.

# Biglaw Firm Facing Lawsuit Over Hack Of Client Data
## The vulnerability of Biglaw on display.

Now, I’m not a Biglaw firm leader, but I have to imagine one of the things that keeps them up at night is the threat of hackers. It’s an ever-present scourge and the firm has a constant stream of highly sensitive client documents hackers would just love to to get their hands on.

And if your firm does fall victim to hackers, there’s more than angry clients you may have to smooth things over with — there’s also the federal government. Covington & Burling has been hit with a [lawsuit](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/dwvkdaalwpm/SEC-v-Covington-cyber-attack-2023-01-10.pdf) by the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the heart of the complaint is a 2020 cyber attack suffered by the firm by the Hafnium cyber-espionage group, who allegedly has ties to the Chinese government. The SEC is seeking the identity of 298 publicly traded firm clients whose information is alleged to be compromised, saying they’re investigating possible securities violations.

As [reported by](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/sec-sues-covington-law-firm-names-300-clients-caught-up-hack-2023-01-11/) Reuters, Covington downplayed the scope of the breach.

In a letter to SEC investigators filed in the case, Covington’s legal team said an internal investigation determined the hack was directed at a “small group of lawyers and advisors” and was focused on “policy issues of specific interest to China in light of the incoming Biden Administration.”

And protecting attorney-client privilege is playing a large role in the firm’s response to the lawsuit:

The law firm told the SEC it is bound by attorney-client privilege and client confidentiality to resist the portion of the subpoena requiring it to name its clients. It said only seven of the affected companies’ files contained information that could be material to investors, a figure the commission said it could not verify, according to the SEC’s lawsuit.

The firm has confirmed they experienced a “state-sponsored” cyberattack. They also said they’ve communicated with impacted clients and worked with the FBI on an investigation into the attack.

# Biglaw Firm Accused Of Covering Up For Hacker
## The allegations in this suit are crazy.

The allegations in this case are just wild — so buckle up and we’ll walk you through the deets.

So, LabMD is a cancer-screening lab — well, it used to be; it went out of business — that claims it was a victim of a “shakedown scheme” by a cybersecurity company, Tiversa Inc., that hacked into its files, obtained patient data, and posted it on a peer-to-peer file-sharing network. LabMD claims that when they refused to use Tiversa to remediate the hack, Tiversa turned around and reported them to the FTC. This led to an FTC data security enforcement action against LabMD. LabMD also alleges the Biglaw firm of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner and former U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan (now a partner at Bryan Cave) assisted Tiversa in the scheme.

The complaint, filed April 28th in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Tiversa was able to hack into LabMD using FBI surveillance tools. The real nut is LabMD’s allegation that Tiversa got its hands on the FBI tools from Buchanan. Back in 2007, when she was U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, LabMD claims that Buchanan used the services of Tiversa in the prosecution of child pornographers and that’s how Tiversa received access to “FBI proprietary surveillance software and equipment,” which they then allegedly used for their own gain.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The complaint goes on to allege that when Buchanan went to Bryan Cave she represented Richard E. Wallace, a former Tiversa employee who had been fired, as a whistleblower in the 2013 FTC action against LabMD, in violation of the Ethics in Government Act. The Act prevents former government employees from participating in matters related to work they did on behalf of the government.

Then there are some truly eye-popping allegations…. like that the Biglaw giant and the FTC colluded together against LabMD, because… reasons. As [reported by](https://biglawbusiness.com/former-u-s-attorney-bryan-cave-accused-of-hacking-cover-up/) Big Law Business, the complaint further alleges that the FTC and Buchanan worked together to build their case against LabMD, in violation of federal law:

The complaint says that FTC officials knew that Buchanan’s involvement in the enforcement action violated the Ethics in Government Act—and that they used that knowledge to shape Wallace’s testimony, by getting him to agree “not to disclose that he and Tiversa had acted as government agents in the FTC investigations.”

LabMD says Buchanan had her own interest in appearing in the FTC matter: ensuring that Wallace didn’t reveal that she had given him access to the FBI surveillance tools.

“Buchanan’s self-interest in keeping her violation of [the Ethics in Government Act] secret and her participation in Tiversa’s wrongdoing was so extreme that she was willing to jeopardize her client’s immunity by directing him to omit critically important and material facts from his testimony,” the complaint says.

Then there’s a claim that Bryan Cave owed a fiduciary duty to LabMD and its founder Michael J. Daugherty. This is based on a defamation and qui tam case against Tiversa filed by Daughterty and Wallace:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The complaint says that because Daugherty and Wallace are partners in the qui tam action, “Buchanan and BCLP had a special, fiduciary and privity-like relationship with Daugherty that imposed on them a duty to impart correct and complete information.”

The complaint asserts claims for “negligent omissions” and “fraudulent omissions” against Buchanan and Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.

All in all, the complaint is a wild ride of cybersecurity and intrigue.

Bryan Cave and Buchanan have not yet commented on the suit.

This would be a big accomplishment for both firms. Thompson & Knight has always punched above its weight in quality and still does and is highly sought after.

— Kent Zimmermann, a consultant for law firm management at The Zeughauser Group, commenting on the [potential tie-up between Holland & Knight and Thompson & Knight](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/thompson-knight-holland-knight-in-talks-for-tie-up). The combined firm would have nearly 1,600 lawyers across 30 offices, making it one of the largest law firms in the country. The potential merger is one of the largest announced in 2021 yet.

# Justice Department Attack On Affirmative Action Is The Most Predictable White Man Thing Ever

Of course the Justice Department is gearing up for a frontal attack on affirmative action. Did you really need a [leaked internal memo](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-affirmative-action-universities.html) to tell you that? What are you going to tell me next: Bowser has kidnapped a white princess?

I didn’t use that reference idly. The research shows that affirmative action primarily benefits white women. [People who support it understand this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/affirmative-action-white-women_us_56a0ef6ae4b0d8cc1098d3a5). [Intelligent people who oppose it understand this](http://hlrecord.org/2012/10/affirmative-action-benefits-white-people/). The only people who think affirmative action is the racial injustice of our time are mediocre white men, and the mothers of mediocre white men.

And you’d be hard-pressed to find a greater collection of mediocre white guys than Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump, and the people who are running our country right now.

I get it. Affirmative action takes the low-account white man’s greatest asset — being a white man — and devalues it. It doesn’t strip the asset away; I would LOVE if there was some policy or social program you could implement that would actually strip white men of their privilege. I’d vote for it every Tuesday. But affirmative action doesn’t stop the white man from enjoying all the privileges associated with being a white man. It just devalues that currency a little bit.

Talented white men can easily overcome that minor nerfing of their white male privilege, what with having talents and such. “How can I compete with all these disadvantaged minorities on a test designed and promulgated by my own people?” — said no talented white man ever.

For mediocre snowflakes, being a white male is kind of all they have going for them. Think about it: if they were particularly smart, they’d out-compete most other white guys and get into whatever school they wanted to go to. If they had money, they’d be a legacy admission somewhere nice. If they were particularly athletic or noticeably artistic, they could scrounge up one of those “bad grades/good extracurriculars” slots every top university has. If they were, you know, INTERESTING, their experiential diversity would come through in their essays and some school would “take a chance” on them.

But, failing all that, the mediocre white guy still thinks that they can fall back on being white and male to get them where they want to go.

Which is why affirmative action rocks their world. Telling white guys with nothing else that being a white male isn’t going to help them this time, or telling those guys that being a white male might actually hurt them this time, makes them LOSE THEIR S**T. Their little brains can barely comprehend a world where their skin color and gender are not an automatic “positive.” Even the suggestion that their demographic identity could be a “negative,” and white guys start talking about how they “know how the slaves must have felt.”

If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the rise of Donald Trump, it’s that the white man doesn’t feel like being white and male is worth what it used to be. Affirmative action seemingly codifies that reduction in status. From the perspective of the aggrieved white male, it’s got to go. Make Being White And Male Great Again!

But I’d caution those unimpressive white males, if they were literate enough to read this post. Once you take away affirmative action and build your border wall and chain your wives to their stoves, what’s your excuse going to be for your demonstrable lack of talent? Seriously, when you reset the world to 1950, back to a point when your privilege was protected by law, what’s going to be your reason for why your kids aren’t doing better than their parents?

You might want to keep affirmative action around, just so you have an excuse for why little Timmy didn’t get into Harvard even though he can (more or less) multiply and seems to “like books.”

15 years of “How Appealing” — reader mail: Today’s email is from an attorney who asked me to omit his name:

Congratulations on the 15-year milestone!

I have been reading this blog since its inception when I was an undergraduate at NYU. I had been reading cases since high school as I just loved (and love) the law. Your blog is the greatest resource for keeping current on the state of the law, which I believe is absolutely necessary to have a successful practice. I have been litigating appeals for 10 years now and I find your insights always interesting and refreshing. Most notably, I think, your blog provides a great resource for CTA cases that eventually become SCOTUS cases. Following the percolation of issues in the circuits is something that is invaluable, and without your blog it would be impossible to track things like that.

So thank you for being a wonderful resource and eminently readable.

# Biglaw Coronavirus Policy Tracker: Which Firms Will Let Lawyers Work From Home?

The rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic across the globe has impacted virtually every facet of life. The times we live in are now uncertain, and nothing is normal anymore. The stock market has tanked, sports seasons have been canceled outright, the lights have gone out on Broadway, school districts have closed, entire countries have been put on lockdown, states of emergency have been declared, and people are waging wars over toilet paper in supermarket aisles.

In order to contain the community spread of COVID-19, many law schools have shuttered for semesters at a time, moving to online learning platforms to spare their students from potentially contracting the virus. Some Biglaw firms have decided to do the same, offering their employees opportunities to work from home in an effort to protect the health and wellness of their most valuable assets.

Just as we’ve done in the past when it comes to raises and bonuses, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have announced coronavirus policies that will benefit their employees, who those policies apply to (lawyers and staff or only lawyers), and the markets where those policies are in effect. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on these policies is announced. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Coronavirus%20Policy%20Tracker%20Correction).

Help us help you. Let us know what your firm is doing to take care of all of its employees during this unprecedented moment in time.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw news, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s coronavirus policy memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Coronavirus%20Response) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Coronavirus Response”). We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Are you at the center of the Venn diagram that is hopeless romantics and securities law purists? (Come on, I know it’s more than just me.) Then this story is sure to infuriate on MULTIPLE LEVELS.

Seth Markin, a former FBI trainee, and his friend Brandon Wong [were arrested](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1521706/download) on insider trading charges (there’s also a parallel civil complaint [filed by](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2022/lr25451.htm) the Securities and Exchange Commission) earlier this week. According to the indictment, the pair made ~$1.4 million by improperly trading on nonpublic information, specifically that Pandion was set to be acquired by pharmaceutical company Merck.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
How’d they come across this insider information? The indictment indicated Markin was dating a Biglaw associate staffed on the M&A deal, and he “abused his relationship of trust and confidence” to gain access to the information.

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1514882) Law360:

The law firm associate girlfriend was working from home as she worked on the Merck deal, trusting that Markin would “maintain her confidences and keep information she shared with him confidential,” according to the indictment.

“Markin told the law firm associate that he had a security clearance, was going to be an FBI agent, was always truthful with her, and wanted to marry her,” the DOJ said.

The associate took confidential work calls from her apartment, sometimes on speakerphone, and kept work documents such as binders, notes, and legal pads “out in the open in her apartment,” where Markin sometimes stayed for days at a time, the DOJ said.

“Because she trusted Seth Markin … she left him alone in her apartment and gave him a key fob to access her building,” the indictment states. “[She] trusted that Markin would not look through her confidential work materials, and if he overheard or saw anything confidential, he would keep it secret.”

But, alas, the government alleges those confidences were not kept.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Neither the associate nor the firm (though unidentified in the indictment, it does indicate the associate worked on behalf of Merck and Merck was represented by Covington & Burling on the deal) have been accused of any wrongdoing. But you *have* to imagine it’s a source of discomfort/embarrassment for everyone involved. It’s a pretty decent reminder that attorneys have to be aggressive about confidentiality — even when loved ones think we’re being overly cautious.

Markin attempted to conceal his trading from both his now ex-girlfriend and the FBI:

Markin also lied to hide the insider trading, authorities said. After Markin and the law firm associate ended their relationship and as Markin was preparing to begin training as a new FBI agent, the attorney called Markin to ask why his name had come up in an inquiry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority into Pandion stock.

“In response, Markin lied … and falsely claimed that he did not trade in Pandion stock,” the DOJ said. “Markin subsequently took steps to further conceal his criminal activity, including by lying to the FBI when he was interviewed about the trading at issue in this case.”

But in other ways, Markin and Wong were not subtle about their windfall:

After closing out their positions in the stock, Wong bought Markin a Rolex watch to thank him for the tips and paid some of Markin’s expenses for a Hawaiian vacation, which they went on together, they added.

The Rolex was worth about $40,000, the DOJ said. Wong also bought Markin a meal at a “three-[Michelin](https://www.law360.com/companies/michelin-group)-starred restaurant” in New York that cost over $1,000, and he purchased himself a home in Florida, according to the indictment.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And now they’re facing a boatload of charges: Markin is charged with nine counts of securities fraud and eight counts of tender offer fraud, one count of conspiracy and one count of making false statements; Wong with 11 counts of securities fraud, 10 counts of tender offer fraud, and one count of conspiracy.

Markin and Wong’s arrests are [part of a larger](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/stephen-buyer-republican-who-served-nearly-2-decades-in-congress-arrested-for-insider-trading/) insider trading sting. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams noted this “should send a strong message to anyone who [is] even thinking about committing insider trading. Cut it out, because we’re watching.”

You’ve got about 3,500 billionaires in the whole world. I’m blessed to have a few of them as clients.

It’s a lot better being on clients’ yachts and planes than it is being stuck in a conference room. That doesn’t mean I never get stuck in a conference room, but at least there are times I can be on their yachts and planes.

I say half-jokingly I represent the rich and the spoiled. They have to be very rich, and sometimes spoiled. But they do have to be very rich.

— [Michael Kosnitzky](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/michael-kosnitzky.html), co-leader of Pillsburys’s Private Wealth practice, offering some [commentary on the clients he represents](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/11/15/pillsburys-michael-kosnitzky-wont-apologize-for-representing-billionaires/) worldwide. “Even the ultra-wealthy need protection, and maybe no more so than now,” Kosnitzky said. “Because there’s an unfair connotation that those who are ultra-wealthy achieved their wealth unfairly, and that is anything but the case.” While some of his clients are worth between $20 and $50 million, the vast the majority are worth more than $100 million.

# Firm Details The 'Special Bonus' It Will Offer To Close The Cravath Gap
## After a vague announcement, this firm finally explains a portion of its compensation plan.

When Dentons made its [initial tepid salary announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/worlds-biggest-law-firm-makes-a-salary-announcement/), associates expressed their frustration by walking out of the meeting to schedule interviews. But the latest memo from the powers-that-be goes a long way toward mending those frayed relationships, with a new “special bonus” intended to bring associates asymptotically closer to the Cravath scale.

To recap, at the initial meeting, the firm kvetched about clients not wanting raises, before telling the assembled team that Dentons offers “competitive compensation” and will be figure out what that means by January 31, 2017. The firm also committed to offer a bonus to reflect 2016 performance based on vague evaluation criteria.

We haven’t fleshed out the new compensation structure (and there are some black box elements that may keep it obscured), but we do know a lot more about the special bonuses being offered, and the early reaction seems pretty positive.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The new one-time, special bonus that Dentons offers to bring associates a little 2016 relief before they set new salaries in 2017 requires associates to meet either of the following criteria:

a. Achieve 1800 creditable hours (1750 in Kansas City and St. Louis) for the full year 2016, of which 1750 (1700 in Kansas City and St. Louis) must be billable hours; OR

b. Achieve 1850 creditable hours (1800 in Kansas City and St. Louis) on an annualized basis for the final six months of 2016, of which 1800 (1750 in Kansas City and St. Louis) must be billable.

The stated annual target for Dentons is 2000 hours, so the firm is going out of its way to expand access to this bonus. Kudos to Dentons for realizing that when it’s switching horses midstream, there’s a fundamental unfairness in holding people to draconian hours requirements. These are relatively lax, and the option of pushing hard over the last six months of the year to get back on track is a welcome move.

In addition, to recognize significant individual contributions in 2016, the amount of the Special Bonus will be increased by twenty-five percent (25%) for any associate with either:

c. 2100 creditable hours (2050 in Kansas City and St. Louis), of which 2000 (1950 in Kansas City and St. Louis) must be billable hours, for the full year 2016; OR

d. 2200 creditable hours (2150 in Kansas City and St. Louis) on an annualized basis for the final six months of 2016, of which 2100 (2050 in Kansas City and St. Louis) must be billable.

That sweetens the pot a bit. And at least one tipster is happy:

We received the attached memorandum re associate compensation. I’m actually pretty happy with it. You definitely don’t have to bill 2000 hours at Dentons (technically it’s their requirement but nothing really happens to you if you don’t bill 2000 and the average associate hours are below 2000), so the fact that I can bill 1800 hours and still get… a “special bonus” seems fair to me. I would rather have this set-up than be someplace where I had to bill 2000 or more even if I would get more money.

Dentons also reminds associates that this bonus is entirely independent of the annual merit bonus.

The amount of these special bonuses is based on the 2016 salary each associate receives, which varied across offices. Here’s the rundown:

New York	Atlanta/Chicago/Dallas/
Denver/Houston/Los Angeles/Phoenix/
San Diego/San Francisco /Silicon Valley/D.C.	Boston/Short Hills/Tysons Corner	KC/St. Louis
Associate	5%	6%	4%	5%
Managing Associate	8%	10%	3%	7%
Sr. Managing Associate	11%	10%	6%	10%

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That’s a bit abstract, but assuming a New York associate had a salary of $160K in 2016, if they meet the relaxed standards for this bonus, they will take home $174,400, and if they meet the enhanced 25 percent upgraded bonus, they will take home… $180K.

So first-years in New York working above and beyond the firm’s stated target will be matching Cravath. For a firm with a rap for paying a little below market in most of its offices, that’s not the worst salary deal in the world.

# Biglaw Firm And Partner Ripped To Shreds On National TV
## This is one of the many 'perks' of representing the president in his tax matters.

A letter released by President Trump’s lawyers claims that the last 10 years of his tax returns do not show any income from Russian sources, “with a few exceptions.” “With a few exceptions” is not a comforting phrase. That’s like hearing, “Don’t worry, all the kids came back from the field trip… with a few exceptions.”

I’d also just like to point out that one of his tax attorneys is named Willie Nelson. I know it’s not [this Willie Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Nelson), who famously didn’t pay his taxes, but still I wouldn’t hire a babysitter whose legal name was [Jared Fogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Fogle).

— Saturday Night Live’s [Colin Jost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Jost), discussing the now infamous Russian income letter sent by Morgan Lewis partners [Sheri Dillon](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/sdillon) and [William Nelson](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/williamnelson) to President Donald Trump, during SNL’s Weekend Update segment. That letter was perhaps another instance of the [“comically bad drafting”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/trump-lawyers-produce-more-comically-bad-drafting/) we’ve come to know from Trump’s cavalcade of attorneys.

# Biglaw Partner Wants More 'Intensity' From Associates
## Partner is over hearing ‘l'm too busy’ from associates.

Listen, it’s a weird time in Biglaw. Sure, (most) firms are coming off of an [epically good year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/all-the-billion-dollar-biglaw-firms-a-look-at-the-am-law-100/)… but there is also plenty of talk about [industry layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/financial-trouble-and-potential-layoffs-ahead-for-biglaw-firms-wall-street-bankers-think-so/) spurred by a downward tick in M&A deals. Most massive [firms are also struggling](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/ropes-three-days-a-week/) with what post-COVID (or at least post- most Americans caring about COVID) offices look like. Yes, associates and partners can easily bill from home (see, the aforementioned good year in Biglaw), but training brand new associates remotely? That’s another matter entirely. And in a business model that revolves around burning and churning through associates, it’s vital that the younger generation of attorneys is as clued in as to the firm’s way of lawyering as possible.

This long preamble is a way of framing the tensions swirling around Biglaw, and by the looks of an internal email sent to Above the Law, that’s certainly the case at Akin Gump.

Partner [Stephen Baldini ](https://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/stephen-m-baldini.html)heads the firm’s litigation practice and he’s not pleased with associates in the group. Seems partners have had some trouble staffing matters, as he writes in the email, “Too many calls for help are either ignored or met with ‘I’m too busy.'”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The problem with the overextended excuse? “These responses simply do not synch with our productivity, which for 2 months has been extremely low.” He goes on to link that dip in productivity to folks eschewing the office in violation of the firm’s attendance expectations. (I’m not sure that particular correlation holds much water, since, you know, everyone *had* to be home for the better part of two years and the firm took in over a billion dollars in revenue last year. Regardless, it’s clear there’s at least frustration at both of those things.)

Baldini continues with a plea:

We need engagement and intensity from everyone on the Lit team across the firm — we also need to act like a team. We need to help each other by easing the burden that is falling on colleagues, and we need to work together to meet our clients’ needs. So when you are asked to help out, please promptly respond, and if you have any capacity please say “yes.” And, if you have capacity, proactively reach out and let others know. We are all professionals and we need to practice with a high degree of commitment to our clients and each other.

As a lapsed Catholic, I appreciate the how thickly the guilt is laid on here.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Fundamentally, who gets the sympathy in this story probably depends how “capacity” is defined. If associates are on-track to bill 1,500 hours… well, you’d best start begging to be staffed on cases. If you’re on-track for 2,000 but partners would really like if you could squeeze out 2,400… then you probably deserve to take advantage of the slow months. Though I’ll note the[ firm’s previously said ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/choo-choo-top-50-firm-boards-the-biglaw-bonus-train/2/)1,950 hours is in line with their expectations.

Only associates’ timesheets know the truth. But again with layoffs — and the dreaded[ stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/biglaw-business-is-booming-obviously-its-time-to-talk-about-layoffs/) — being discussed in the industry, perhaps it isn’t the worst idea to show a little enthusiasm — or intensity, if you will — for your next matter.

# Biglaw Partner Shares Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Affirmative Action Case Before The Supreme Court
## The case is likely to change higher education, but there's a plan to deal with that.

In this episode, I welcome [Ishan Bhabha](https://jenner.com/people/IshanBhabha), co-chair of Jenner and Block’s Education Practice and a member of its Appellate and Supreme Court Practice, to talk about the well-publicized affirmative action cases at the oral arguments at the Supreme Court. He discusses his experiences representing the Ivy League and other schools, as well as the importance of diversity in education and the stakes of the cases. Ishan also recalls how he found appellate law to be more interesting and exciting, as it combines logic and reasoning with the ability to do the right thing. For Ishan, the biggest appeal of appellate law is its diversity — he never knows what his clients will need help with next.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

Schulte Roth & Zabel announced their bonuses last week, but for some reason no one sent us the memo until now. I guess everyone over there was too busy [helping out their boy Matt Lauer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/12/01/defending-his-millions-matt-lauer-turns-to-lawyer-william-zabel/) to give ATL the heads up.

In any event, SRZ matched the Cravath scale for its rank and file associates. For those who’ve forgotten, the Cravath scale is:

But the real winners are those who billed 2300+ and 2500+ this year.

In addition the Firm will again reward associates who have made extraordinary contributions to the Firm and our clients by recording 2,300 and 2,500 eligible hours with additional bonuses. This year we are very pleased to increase these additional amounts to $20,000 for associates attaining each threshold (for a total of $40,000 for those satisfying both).

That’s a nice way to walk into 2018 for these associates. A first-year could take home $55K? Not too shabby.

# Former Willkie Partner Pleads Guilty To Role In Fraud Scheme
## Three years later and we have a guilty plea.

Keila Ravelo used to be a high-flying Biglaw antitrust partner at Willkie Farr (and before that at Hunton & Williams). But three years ago, that all came crashing down when she was [arrested in 2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/partner-allegedly-steals-millions-from-biglaw-firms-to-lead-luxurious-lifestyle/?rf=1) for a variety of financial crimes.

Ravelo, along with her husband, was initially indicted on charges of wire fraud and embezzlement for allegedly creating dummy corporations to funnel “legal consulting fees” (for work that was never actually done) from both of her former firms. The indictment was later updated to include charges of tax evasion and using fake billings to funnel the allegedly fraudulently obtained $7.8 million in litigation support fees. Her (now estranged) husband pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme in August 2015.

Today, the case comes to its conclusion. In a District of New Jersey courtroom, Ravelo pleaded guilty one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of tax evasion, on the condition the remaining counts be dropped. She will also sell assets to pay restitution. As [reported by New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/sites/newyorklawjournal/2017/11/20/ex-big-law-partner-pleads-guilty-to-wire-fraud-evasion-charges/), the plea didn’t go off without any hitches before eventually being provisionally accepted by Judge McNulty:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Monday’s hearing before U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty of the District of New Jersey hit a few snags when Ravelo was questioned about details of her actions in order to provide that her guilty plea had a basis in fact. Ravelo engaged in lengthy, whispered consultations with defense counsel, Lawrence Lustberg of Gibbons in Newark and Steve Sadow of Schulten Ward Turner & Weiss in Atlanta, before ultimately answering affirmatively to questions such as whether she committed fraud amounting to $7.8 million through a scheme of fraudulent payments to vendors.

The government ultimately accepted her answers even after she added caveats that her involvement in the scheme began in 2012 and that she did not know the total cost of the scheme.

An interesting — if somewhat anticlimactic — ending to a legal saga that has stretched out almost three years.

# 2023, The Year Of CBD?
## Important legal updates on hemp and CBD.

2022 ended with two interesting developments for the hemp industry.

Google Ads Policy Update 

In December, Google Ads [announced](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/12997469?hl=en&ref_topic=29265) that as of January 20, 2023, the company will relax its advertising policies and allow the promotion of cannabidiol (“CBD”)-infused topicals containing no more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) in California, Colorado, and Puerto Rico. As I have discussed in this column, the marketing of topicals, specifically [cosmetics](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cbd-cosmetics-unregulated-yes-risk-free-no/), is generally less risky and more tolerated by the FDA and the FTC.

Only topical CBD products that have been certified by [LegitScript](https://www.legitscript.com/google-cbd), a Portland, Oregon-based internet and payments compliance company that provides, among other things, certification in high-risk industries, will be allowed.

To be certified for advertising, companies will have to provide a copy of their certificate of analysis along with samples of their product to be tested.

In addition to the geographical restrictions, ad promotions of these certified products will be limited to users identified as 18 or older and will be excluded from certain formats such as YouTube Masthead.

Although CBD-infused food products, dietary supplements, and inhalants will remain prohibited by Google Ads, this recent marketing development is a small breakthrough for CBD companies, which have been hit with suspensions, deletions, and warnings for advertising their products online. You can read more on this issue in this [article](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/stop-censoring-cbd/).

Not only will this policy update afford CBD companies an opportunity to connect with consumers and expand their market reach in the three permitted jurisdictions, it will also provide consumers with assurance that these products have been thoroughly vetted.

FDA Regulatory Assessment

On December 29, 2022, the Wall Street Journal published an [interview](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-concerned-about-safety-explores-regulating-cbd-in-foods-supplements-11672146030) with the FDA in which the agency announced being just months away from releasing a regulatory assessment for hemp-derived products, including CBD.

This is big news given that, for the past four years, the FDA has been reluctant to develop a regulatory pathway for the manufacture, sale, and marketing of CBD products. Despite acknowledging the growing public interest in CBD products, the agency has consistently [maintained](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/the-fda-continues-to-kick-the-cbd-can-down-the-road/) that more robust information about the potential safety problems or adverse effects associated with CBD and other cannabis-derived products had to be done before the agency could develop regulations for hemp-derived products.

In the WSJ interview, three FDA officials leading the agency’s cannabis regulation efforts discussed their plan for these products: “[T]he FDA will decide within months how legal cannabis should best be regulated and whether that will require new agency rules or new legislation from Congress.”

However, before it proceeds with its assessment, the FDA first needs to review the available data. This data includes scientific evidence submitted via the FDA’s public docket as well as pilot initiatives and partnerships focused on advancing data-driven safety signal detection, and building advanced technology capabilities developed through the Agency’s Cannabis-Derived Product Data Acceleration Plan (“[DAP](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/cannabis-derived-products-data-acceleration-plan)”).

The FDA officials also shared being concerned about whether the existing regulatory pathways for food and dietary supplements are appropriate for CBD. This comment suggests that the agency may ultimately decide not to regulate these products in the same manner as states that have adopted a legal framework for these products and might instead regulate them as drug products or under a new product category.

If the agency ultimately decides to deviate from the existing state regulations and to regulate these products as drugs or as a separate product category, the matching rules will inevitably further disrupt the CBD industry. Not only will these companies be forced, once again, to deploy huge financial resources to adjust and comply with these new rules, they will also be faced with greater competition, like pharmaceutical companies, that is eager to get a slice of the CBD pie.

So, whether this latest FDA development is a good omen for the industry, is anyone’s guess at this point.

# The Hidden Factor Undermining Your Firm’s COVID-19 Protocols
## How law firms can navigate omicron and its complexities.

When I wrote about the omicron variant [a few short weeks ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/dont-let-your-yule-log-burn-out/), I said “It might be the next delta, or it might be another minor bump in the road.” It turned out to be neither. This version has brought its own unique mix of facts that law firm leaders must face.

Let’s start with the grim news. The original COVID-19 strain and the delta variant each peaked, at their worst, around 300,000 new infections a day in the United States. By contrast, omicron recorded over 1.4 million new cases on January 10 alone. That’s 0.4% of the entire population of the United States infected in a single day. Over 5 million people have been diagnosed in the week leading up to this column, which amounts to about 1 in every 66 Americans catching COVID in seven days. The numbers are staggering.

But there is encouraging news for those who are vaccinated. As the Washington Post [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/12/28/omicron-how-severe-us/), “Healthy individuals who have been vaccinated, and especially those who have been boosted, appear unlikely to develop severe infections from the Omicron variant that would land them in the hospital.” Consistent with this, reports [domestically](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/oct/05/kathryn-moffett-bradford/are-90-95-those-hospitalized-covid-19-unvaccinated/) and [abroad](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/22/help-us-to-help-you-doctors-in-england-make-pleas-to-unvaccinated) suggest that 5% to 10% of those hospitalized with COVID are vaccinated. So even though breakthrough cases are happening at record pace, the vaccinated have done far better with omicron than with the delta variant.

But back to gloomier news. The above hospitalization stats don’t give you any solace if you’re unvaccinated. And even asymptomatic people — vaccinated or not — can still spread omicron. All of which creates a strain on the health care system.

So here we are again. With all of this happening, what’s the next move for law firms?

Why 2020 Was Comparatively Easy

Although March 2020 was a huge lift for law firm leaders, it was in some ways easier than where we are today in terms of making hard decisions.

Once we understood the risk COVID-19 posed, the world simply shut down. Businesses moved to remote work, professional sports and the entertainment industry closed their doors, schools went online. Everything nonessential was cancelled while we all sat at home watching “Tiger King” and trying to figure out what was going on.

But while the simplicity of a global shut down was appealing, it obviously wasn’t tenable long term. Ever since then, responding to COVID today has become more and more complicated. There’s no longer any one-size-fits-all approach that can work in every office. Leaders looking to review or revise their COVID protocols in light of omicron need to think about, among myriad other things:

- Who’s vaccinated and who’s not?
- Who will wear a mask, what type, and where and when will they wear it?
- To what extent do your team members trust public health resources like the CDC and the government?
- Who is in an elevated risk category, or has high-risk people such as the elderly or children too young to vaccinate in their household?
- How likely is your team to comply with your policies?
- Are you willing to have team members leave if they won’t comply with the policies in place?
There’s also a hidden component that subtly, but deeply affects every COVID policy we consider and implement. The issue is called [pandemic fatigue](https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/how-to-not-let-pandemic-fatigue-turn-into-pandemic-burnout/).

Pandemic exhaustion isn’t the tiredness that often comes as a symptom of the virus. Instead, it’s that overwhelming exhaustion many of us feel at the very notion of returning to lockdown to mitigate the spread of this virus. Many of us spent the first year of the pandemic juggling more than we’d ever juggled before, bearing a tremendous mental load trying to keep ourselves and others safe while everything normal in our lives got upended. When the vaccine finally became available last spring and summer, it was the relief we’d been waiting for since March 2020. Many of us returned to a life that felt more or less like it had been before the pandemic, treasuring more than ever the freedom we had given up for so long in the name of keeping ourselves, our loved ones, and our fellow human beings safer.

That’s where pandemic exhaustion comes in. If willpower is a muscle, many of us feel like we wore it out that first year spent in isolation waiting for the vaccine. Every social event skipped, mask donned, or day spent homeschooling a child was another chance to stress a muscle that wasn’t getting any downtime to recover. Most of us still haven’t recovered those energy reserves. That’s why today, when lockdown might seem to make more sense than ever, the will to do it seems absent. That’s why people who didn’t leave their homes for most of 2020 might have been found going to movies, eating in restaurants, and going to crowded parties over the 2021 holidays. We feel like we worked too hard for too long to go back to how things were. Our willpower is too tired to be of use.

So then, even with the latest iteration of COVID spreading faster than ever, it’s currently harder than ever to craft a coherently tailored COVID mitigation plan, to build consensus and buy-in for that plan from the team, or to get your teams to comply. What are you supposed to do with all of this?

Knowing about and adapting to pandemic exhaustion should be part of that solution. Doing what you can to keep the mental load on your team light will help them feel better while also keeping them safe (and, incidentally, more productive than they’d be if they caught COVID).

Lightening Your Team’s Lift

One easy win for many office situations is to continue to be flexible with working arrangements. If your people are fed up wearing masks in the office, let them work from home in their pajamas. They’re not stressing about following office COVID protocols, and you’re not stressing about them getting others sick.

You can also reduce your team’s mental load by reducing ambiguity wherever you can. As tiring as COVID protocols can sometimes be, what’s worse is not having any strong game plan and forcing your team members to spend their energy wondering what they need to be doing to keep themselves and others safe. If you need to pivot, let people know and explain why.

Consider involving experts. Smart firms are hiring infectious disease consultants to bring their expertise to bear and craft a manageable mitigation plan to suit their specific needs. There are also broadly available free resources and mitigation plans available from the CDC, many branches of government, and any number of universities or nonprofits. Find an evidence-based resource you can trust, develop strong written policies that your team will know how to follow, and keep an eye open as that resource updates its findings and recommendations.

No one’s certain how this will all end, or when, but we continue to owe it to each other to keep each other physically and mentally healthy, and that duty comes at a mental cost on us all. Recognizing that pandemic exhaustion exists, working around it, and extending a bit of grace to ourselves and our communities can help us lessen this load we all share.

# Quibi’s IP Quibble
## Armed to the teeth with Biglaw IP heavyweights leading their representation, both sides have filled the case docket with filings.

No startup wants to deal with IP disputes, especially around the time their product or service is launching. But high-profile startups often launch with a bull’s-eye on their backs, particularly when an erstwhile vendor to that startup feels aggrieved about being passed over with respect to a feature that makes its way into the startup’s launch offering. When that dynamic is present, IP fireworks are always a possibility. Sprinkle in some Hollywood glamour squaring off against Wall Street financial backing, and what would normally be a relatively run-of-the-mill IP quibble quickly morphs into a headline-a-day IP battle for the ages. Such a battle is currently playing out in the Central District of California, in a case that has already packed a year’s worth of twists and turns in just its opening months.

The combatants are already fully engaged. Backed by litigation funding provided by leading activist hedge fund Elliott Management, IP owner Eko — which counts Walmart as an investor and is known for its “choose-your-own adventure style”  or “branching” videos — is taking on one of the streaming wars’ newest contenders, Jeffrey Katzenberg’s prestigious “short bites” streaming startup[ Quibi](https://www.quibi.com/). I first flagged the case as one to watch in a May 4 blog [post](https://www.markmanadvisors.com/blog/2020/5/4/why-elliott-is-watching-quibi-closely) for our patent consultancy. The action has only intensified since my initial review of the issues presented by the case.

Armed to the teeth with Biglaw IP heavyweights leading their representation, both sides have filled the case docket with filings, headlined by Eko’s preliminary injunction motion on its allegedly misappropriated trade secret as well as two amended complaints. One can only imagine what will happen once the case inevitably expands to incorporate Quibi’s expected IPR filings, as well as whatever additional claims the parties can unearth during discovery. Already, the case has taken on quite an unusual posture for an IP dispute, with numerous individuals named as defendants, coupled with the specter of Elliott looming large over settlement negotiations, considering it has already been reported to have taken an equity stake in Eko.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The presence of Elliott’s funding makes the case an interesting study in how IP owners litigate when cost is no option, aside from the interesting aspects of the case generated by the involvement of entertainment industry participants. To that point, Eko has embraced an escalation-at-every-turn approach, clearly designed to force Quibi to the negotiating table hat-in-hand. From naming Quibi executives personally, to filing for the preliminary injunction, to adding patents in amended complaints, Eko’s aims are transparent. First, they are placing a premium on creating a narrative where they are the innovator being wronged by an IP thief desperate to launch quickly on the backs of someone else’s innovations. Second, they are maximizing the marketing impact of their lawsuit by bringing their claims almost as soon as Quibi launched, while exerting every effort to have major issues adjudicated quickly by the court. As I noted in my earlier blog post, filing the preliminary injunction motion on the trade secret claim “is a low-risk high-reward move” which, if successful, could lead to early settlement, with little consequence should it fail. (But for their expense, it has long seemed to me that preliminary injunction motions are an underutilized tool in high-stakes IP litigation, especially where the claims don’t exclusively arise out of patent causes.)

For its part, Quibi has clearly embraced what I called a “proactive defense approach” to Eko’s claims. Starting with its declaratory judgment complaint filing, Quibi has pushed back strongly on each of Eko’s claims without reservation, including by offering a compelling counternarrative relating to its allegedly independent development of the key technology feature at issue in the case — Quibi’s highly promoted “Turnstyle” feature, which allows users to get a different perspective on what they are watching depending on the phone’s orientation in either portrait or landscape mode. To that end, Quibi’s filings reference the significant investment in resources it has made in developing Turnstyle, as well as the fact that Eko has apparently sat on its claims against Quibi for at least a year. Furthermore, Quibi calls attention to the transparent timing of Eko’s IP assault, coming as it does on the heels of Quibi’s high-profile launch in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. We can expect that Quibi will continue to put Eko’s IP to the test, and remain undeterred by Eko’s on-the-fly refinement of its claims, including the addition of more patents that Quibi has allegedly infringed.

In short, neither side has shown any fear in terms of putting issues before the court to decide. A recent order in the case is illustrative. It references how Eko will have more time to file a second amended complaint to beef up its claim of “aiding and abetting breach of implied contract,” while also denying Quibi’s motion to dismiss Eko’s first amended complaint as moot. Topping matters off, the court proactively indicated that any motion to dismiss by Quibi of Eko’s Second Amended Complaint would be heard at the same time as Eko’s “anticipated motion to dismiss Quibi’s First Amended Complaint in the related action.” Got all that? And this is just a few months into the litigation!

Ultimately, this is clearly yet another example of an IP dispute made “high-stakes” by the nature of the players involved, the timing of the dispute, and the presence of litigation funding. All ingredients that should eventually result in the parties reaching a settlement of some sort, as is the case with the overwhelming majority of IP disputes. Until then, we will have plenty of legal wrangling to watch. Quibi may hope to make its name on its “short bite” productions, but for now it faces a long legal battle ahead.

# An Afternoon With Jeh Johnson, General Counsel of the Defense Department
## Jeh C. Johnson, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, can be described as one of the most powerful and influential lawyers in the entire federal government. Our very own David Lat had the pleasure of interviewing him.

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The fate of Guantanamo Bay. The repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” The rise of WikiLeaks. The raid on Osama Bin Laden’s compound. The conflict in Libya.

On these and many other critical national security legal issues, one of the most important advisers to Defense Secretary Robert Gates and President Barack Obama’s White House has been [Jeh C. Johnson](http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=173), General Counsel of the Department of Defense. In light of his role as senior legal adviser to the largest government agency in the world, responsible for the work of over 10,000 lawyers, it is no understatement to describe Johnson as one of the powerful and influential lawyers in the entire federal government.

I recently went down to Washington to interview Johnson in his office at the Pentagon. If you think security at your law firm is tight, visit the Pentagon. I had to pass through a metal detector and multiple security checkpoints before arriving at Johnson’s office, located on the E Ring within the mammoth structure — the world’s largest office building by floor area, with over 6.5 million square feet housing over 25,000 employees. (I was accompanied at all times by a member of Johnson’s staff, which prevented me from getting lost inside the maze-like complex.)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Before entering Johnson’s private office, I had to surrender my Blackberry – the office is a [SCIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIF) (pronounced “skiff”), or “Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.” This means that it is specially designed to prevent eavesdropping, thanks to walls and doors of specified thickness and the use of jamming technologies. The windows of Johnson’s office, tinted a yellowish green, are blast-resistant and designed to preclude visual surveillance.

Once I made it to the inner sanctum, I was in for a treat. My wide-ranging discussion with [Jeh Johnson](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jeh-johnson/) covered his remarkable career path, which has included service as a federal prosecutor, partnership at a top law firm ([Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/paul-weiss/)), and his current post as GC of the Defense Department; the virtues of public service, as well as the growing challenges for lawyers interested in it; and Johnson’s advice for law students and lawyers who aspire to careers in government (hint: keep your nanny on the books)….


Johnson’s large private office is an amazing space, filled with remarkable objects. These include model planes and ships, meticulously maintained (Johnson collects them); a rack full of brightly colored military coins, which are used for [challenges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_coin); and numerous framed commendations, certificates, newspaper articles, and photographs (including a great one of Johnson, his son, and President Obama). The office has multiple telephones, of varying levels of security: confidential, secret, and top secret. Johnson has one main computer, but with the flick of a button, he can toggle between multiple email systems – again, confidential, secret, and top secret.

The spacious office contains a large conference table – a necessity, given how many meetings Johnson has each day (more on that later). He and I sat at the conference table and chatted for almost an hour and a half, under the watchful gaze of Lieutenant Colonel Tanya Bradsher, a Pentagon public affairs officer.

I asked: Is Johnson enjoying his service as General Counsel of the Defense Department?

“Am I having fun? No, I’m not having fun,” said Johnson, good-naturedly. “Public service is not a frolic or a sabbatical. There are over 10,000 lawyers in DoD, I oversee their work, and I make less than a first year associate at Paul Weiss. ‘Enjoy’ is not the right word.”

So why did Johnson leave his (extremely lucrative) Paul Weiss partnership to take up this post?

“Loyalty to this President, commitment to public service and the safety of our country, and never having a dull day are what keep me going,” he said. “There is nothing else I’d rather be doing right now. It’s not exactly fun, but it is fulfilling and demanding, and I do it out of a sense of public service.”

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2011/07/Columbia-Law-School-CLS-logo.jpg)Johnson’s current, Senate-confirmed post as General Counsel to the DoD is the top line of a long and dazzling résumé. After graduating from Morehouse College in 1979 and [Columbia Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/columbia-law-school/) in 1982, he worked for approximately two years as a litigation associate at the white-shoe firm of [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/sullivan-cromwell/). In 1984, he moved laterally to the similarly elite firm of [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/paul-weiss/), where he hoped to keep working on complex cases while also exploring his interests in politics and public affairs. PW has a long tradition of public service, with numerous lawyers who have moved back and forth between the private and public sectors. (During our interview, Johnson pulled out of his desk drawer a 1976 New York Times article about Paul Weiss which he read in college and told me, “This is what inspired me to want to come to Paul Weiss.”)

After working for several years as an associate at Paul Weiss, alongside such legendary litigators as Arthur Liman, Morris Abram and name partner Simon Rifkind, Johnson decided he wanted to pursue a longtime goal that he held back in law school: service as a federal prosecutor. He interviewed for a position as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York and was hired, by then-U.S. Attorney [Rudolph Giuliani](https://abovethelaw.com/rudy-giuliani/). During his three years as an AUSA in the S.D.N.Y., Johnson tried 12 cases and argued 11 appeals, with a focus on public corruption cases.

Johnson returned to Paul Weiss in 1992, and two years later, he became the firm’s first African-American partner. He remained at the firm, litigating complex civil and criminal cases, until 1998, when he was offered the opportunity to serve as General Counsel of the Department of the Air Force, in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Although Johnson had never set foot in the Pentagon prior to that point, he was intrigued and excited by the challenge, which he accepted. He served as GC of the Air Force for over two years, from October 1998 to January 2001.

After the end of the Clinton Administration, Johnson returned to New York and to Paul Weiss. He had missed some profitable years for the partnership: “When they told me earnings per share for the years that I missed, I practically fell out of my chair!”

[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2011/07/Paul-Weiss-small.jpg)Fortunately for Johnson (and Paul Weiss), the best years were yet to come. The next eight years were successive record years for the firm in terms of profitability. Johnson returned to litigating, generally trying about one large case a year, primarily civil. He also remained active in community service and in politics. From 2001 to 2004, he chaired the Judiciary Committee of the New York City Bar Association, which reviews and rates judicial nominees – federal, state, and local – within New York City. For the 2004 election, Johnson became involved in John Kerry’s presidential campaign, serving as a lawyer and a fundraiser for the campaign.

“I was so disappointed when he lost,” said Johnson. “I couldn’t get out of bed the next morning.”

Despite the painful loss, Johnson continued to work in support of Democratic Party candidates. In June 2006, at a fundraiser he hosted for Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Johnson met then-Senator [Barack Obama](https://abovethelaw.com/barack-obama/), a rising star of the party. Over the next few months, the two continued to cross paths – at political fundraisers, at a book signing by Obama – and grew closer. Then, in November 2006, Obama personally recruited Johnson to join his presidential campaign. (Johnson showed me the “While You Were Out” memo for Obama’s phone call to him, with the “Telephoned” and “Please Call Back” boxes checked, and a 312 phone number listed as the return number.)

The rest, as they say, is history. In December 2006, Johnson became one of the first former Clinton Administration officials to “come out” as an Obama supporter. Over the next two years, Johnson performed many roles for the Obama campaign, from fundraising and surrogate TV to lawyering and door-to-door canvassing (in places as varied as Des Moines, Iowa and West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania).

“It is a truly remarkable, once-in-a-lifetime experience,” said Johnson, “to get to know someone by his first name, and then get to address him as ‘Mr. President.’ I could never repeat that experience.”

After the 2008 election, Johnson served on the Obama transition team, advising on defense matters. On January 8, 2009, President-Elect Obama publicly designated Johnson to be the nominee for General Counsel of the Defense Department. After a fairly swift Senate confirmation, Johnson assumed his current position on February 10, 2009.

During the almost two and a half years that Johnson has served as General Counsel, he has worked on a wide range of important and challenging issues. He played a major role in the successful repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” co-authoring a report (with General Carter Ham) that was praised by the Washington Post for “its honest, thorough and respectful handling of a delicate subject,” and by journalist Andrew Sullivan as “extremely calm and fair” and “one of the most impressive reports I’ve read from a government agency.” (Johnson confided to me that much of the writing style in the report reflects years of training as a Paul Weiss litigation associate.) More recently, Johnson [advised the White House](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/world/africa/18powers.html) about military activities in Libya.

Given the tremendous responsibilities of his job, as well as his familial responsibilities – Johnson is married to Dr. Susan DiMarco, a dentist, and they have two children, Jeh Jr. and Natalie – how does he do it all? As you might expect, time management is critical.

“I budget my time carefully,” Johnson explained. “I’m a very early riser. I wake up before 5 a.m., and I’m at my desk at 6:05 a.m.”

“My days here are much more intense than they were at Paul Weiss,” said Johnson. “At Paul Weiss, I’d spend time thinking about far fewer matters. Here, it’s all meetings, back to back with no white space in between. Some days I complain to my scheduler that I feel like a nail salon!”

Johnson has as many as 12 to 15 meetings a day, generally at the Pentagon or at the White House, which he visits about three times a week. His work day tends to end at around 7:00 to 7:30 p.m. – a 13- to 14-hour day, having started at 6 a.m. And even after he leaves the office, he is on email constantly. But there are limits on how much work he can handle outside the office, because so much of his work is classified; this sometimes requires him to come into the Pentagon at odd hours or on weekends. (Fortunately he has a short commute, under 10 minutes.)

At the same time, according to Johnson, it’s important for busy lawyers to have outlets outside of work. In addition to spending time with his wife and two kids, he enjoys model trains (HO scale), wine tasting, classic R&B – in fact, he has served in the past as a guest DJ on [WBGO Newark](http://www.wbgo.org/) (88.3 on the FM dial) – and gardening. Yes, gardening. “I deal with high-level counterterrorism issues,” said Johnson, “but I also like to plant impatiens.”

Given the stress of the job and the difficult issues that comprise Johnson’s portfolio – “no easy problems reach me, because if they were easy, they would have been solved already” – burnout would seem to be a real danger. But Johnson is willing to continue serving, at least through the end of President Obama’s first term.

“Every Senate-confirmed presidential appointee should presume four years, but nothing beyond four years,” said Johnson. “Even if he is reelected, we shouldn’t presume that we will be asked to continue serving. We serve at the pleasure of the president.”

Looking ahead to when he eventually concludes his service as General Counsel, what does Johnson see in his future? A judgeship? Elective office?

“My presumption is that I will return to private practice when I’m done,” he said. “This will be it for public service, after three separate stints. I can’t repeat the experience of starting with a man at ground level, going all the way through primary season, the convention, the debates, the national election, the transition, and then, finally, governing.”

Despite the excitement and fulfillment of government service, Johnson does miss certain aspects of private practice. He cited advocacy, especially drafting a brief, then editing it “until it sings”; recruiting lawyers to the firm; and mentoring young associates and summer associates. (Johnson gets to mentor on a smaller scale by working closely with his three special assistants, whom I had the pleasure of meeting: Chris Fonzone, Harvard Law ’07, who clerked for Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson and Justice Stephen Breyer; Michael Negron, Harvard Law ’07, a former Naval officer; and Brodi Kemp, Yale Law ’04, Harvard Ph.D. (Political Science) ’11.)

Johnson also misses the private-sector paycheck: “You have to be a little crazy to go into public service. If you’re a fifty-something partner in a law firm, you have to be a little crazy to go into government. The gap between private sector law firm incomes and what we earn here is getting larger and larger.”

And it’s not just about the benjamins. The vetting process for prospective public servants is more intense and intrusive than ever, in this age of diminishing (or perhaps evolving) notions of privacy.

“In order to survive the vetting, you have to have lived your life in a certain way and be prepared to bare it all in public,” Johnson explained. “You need to pay every tax dollar for every nanny. Always keep them on the books. From the day that I got married, I had a ‘nanny accountant,’ to make sure I was handling these issues correctly.”

“A lot of professionals don’t think this way,” said Johnson. “They have normal, private lives. But I’ve been in public service several times, so I know. You need to lead your life in a certain way, in preparation for the day when it suddenly becomes exposed to the public.”

Once you are being considered for a position, a vetting team will “violate your privacy eight different ways,” said Johnson. You’ll be asked by a young lawyer whom you don’t even know about your health, your mental health, your marital fidelity, your spouse’s health, your spouse’s mental health, your finances – practically nothing is off limits. The inquiries will come from multiple quarters: the Office of Government Ethics, the White House, the FBI, and the Senate (for positions requiring Senate confirmation).

“My SF-278 [financial disclosure form] was made public, and Politico did a [story](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/18080.html) on the huge pay cut I was taking,” said Johnson. “I saw my net worth and income splashed all over Politico. I ended up apologizing to my [Paul Weiss] partners for how information reflecting on the firm’s finances suddenly became so public.”

(Johnson said that he learned his new salary as General Counsel to the Defense Department from Politico as well. “I didn’t even ask how much I’d make in this job before taking it!”)

Despite the challenges of being a public servant, it definitely has its perks and its high points. Your work makes a difference – and you are sometimes recognized for it. On June 14, the U.S. Marine Corps honored Johnson with a sunset parade (which you can find [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p96D22zx_Iw); see also the photos below and on subsequent pages).

“How often do you get honored with a parade?” asked Johnson. “There were no parades for us at Paul Weiss.”

Notwithstanding the doubts being raised in some quarters about law school and legal careers, Johnson remains fundamentally optimistic about the opportunities available to lawyers. “I believe as much in law as a career as I did before,” said Johnson. “Even more so. I’ve seen all the different things one can do with a law degree.” What’s important, according to Johnson, is to remember what brought you into the law in the first place.

“A lot of people go to law school with the same ambitions I had: public service, a possible career in politics, community service,” he said. “Then they lose that ambition as life progresses, as they take on mortgages, and familial responsibilities.”

“But you shouldn’t lose the original ambition that took you to law school,” Johnson urged. “It is still possible to have that kind of career, a mixture of fulfilling public service and exceptional private practice.”

Achieving success as a lawyer in both public and private practice is not easy. It will require a great deal of hard work, as well as talent and luck. But it is most certainly possible.

Need proof? Just ask Jeh Johnson.

# Does This Top Biglaw Firm Have The Urge To Merge? It Sure Seems Like It...
## Which firm will be the one to combine with Baker Botts?

Biglaw mergers have been all the rage in 2023, and some firms have been approaching the prospect from seats of power rather than desperation. One of those firms is Baker Botts, which is coming off of an extremely successful year. The firm — currently ranked at No. 64 on the latest Am Law 100 — managed to drive its revenue up by 4% last year to $752.2 million (its second-highest ever) while increasing its revenue per lawyer by 12%.

Baker Botts was once a potential suitor for struggling Shearman but those talks were fruitless. In a [past Am Law interview](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2023/01/27/aiming-to-sharpen-value-for-clients-baker-botts-posts-higher-financials-across-the-board-in-2022/), managing partner [John Martin](https://www.bakerbotts.com/people/m/martin-john-w) said that while Baker Botts “never comments on market speculation or rumors,” the firm will be “opportunistic” and “open-minded to ideas on how to strengthen the firm.”

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2023/04/27/is-a-merger-in-baker-botts-future/) reached out to Baker Botts for comment on its potential merger plans. Here’s a statement provided by the firm:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“As one of only four firms to hit double-digit RPL growth in 2022 and after recording the second-highest growth in PEP of any Am Law 100 firm, we continue to build on our record year, execute on our strategy, and strengthen our core value of professional excellence in representing clients, including those in the energy, technology and life sciences sectors.”

In 2022, Baker Botts saw its profits per equity partner rise by 28.3% — but at the same time, the firm watched its equity partner ranks fall by the same percentage. Martin was positive about this, noting that the firm’s PEP increase “is significant and reflects some continuous moves to enhance our leverage.” But is this attractive for a merger partner?

One individual familiar with the Texas market said a trickle of partner departures from Baker Botts has turned into a stream, and that could contribute to the firm’s willingness to think about a merger.

“If they are like most firms, they are probably spending a lot of time trying to attract laterals and groups, but probably aren’t happy with the progress, especially as they are losing people and teams they don’t want to lose,” the individual said.

Martin said that the firm has “particular interest in” increasing the attorney head count in the San Francisco Bay area and New York, while at the same time strengthening its home base in Texas, while giving some special attention to Washington, D.C., and London.

# World's Biggest Law Firm Makes A Salary Announcement
## Biggest fish of all takes the plunge. Or perhaps tests the water.

UPDATE (7/8/16, 7:47 a.m.): More details available below.

Associates at Dentons — or more specifically, Dentons US LLP — received word earlier today that the firm was “holding a video conference for its associates at 4:30 p.m. EST ‘to discuss associate compensation and benefits.'” This was one of those big fish we were still waiting upon. Even if the firm refuses to participate in Am Law’s financial roundup any more, we have every indication that their PPP is… somewhere north of $1 million.

And this afternoon, a floating head straight out of The Wizard of Oz (probably not) informed associates of their new salary structure.

It was not well received…

Dentons management had a meeting today (which is still ongoing) to tell associates that they are not matching the new scale. This isn’t surprising, since the firm’s black-box salary system results in most mid-levels being paid less than the new first-year benchmark. The meeting was characteristically tone-deaf, with management spending 40 minutes talking about negative client reactions to the salary increases and the firm’s commitment to “innovation” (wtf?) before even mentioning anything about salaries.

Holy hell. “Innovation”? Blaming clients? Hm. Maybe there’s a reason they don’t report numbers to Am Law….

At least one tipster had the perfect reaction to this meeting:

I left the meeting early because I had a call with my recruiter regarding the two lateral interviews I have scheduled next week.

Good luck!

UPDATE (7/8/16, 7:47 a.m.): We’ve gotten some more reaction from folks who were able to make it through the long meeting.

To be fair, while not matching, the firm said that it would be giving a second year-end bonus in January that was meant to make up for the 2016 salary shortfall and that they would be raising salaries in January to competitive levels. I won’t be holding my breath, but they did technically announce raises, but in their very own Dentons way.

An even more detailed tip echoed this skepticism:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Mike McNamara, the US managing partner, outlined a few different components to remain competitive in Thursday’s meeting.

First, Dentons commits to offer “competitive compensation.” It will reevaluate compensation for 2017 and, presumably, associates will receive increased compensation that reflects the market. Dentons, however, has historically underpaid its associates, so I’m sure the new “competitive compensation” will reflect this lower trend. New compensation will be payable on January 31, 2017.

Second, Dentons will offer one-time bonuses to reflect good performance in 2016 if evaluation criteria are met. This means at least 2,000 credible hours plus other fuzzy “contribution” factors–whatever that means.

The firm is also considering enhanced benefits and other vague, ill-defined “compensation enhancements.” Parental leave was one example, as was a travel option for working out of international offices so associates can get a glimpse of the grandeur of Denton’s worldwide footprint. Some of these initiatives will become clearer by the end of the month, and some might only be implemented in 2018.

Overall, I think the associates are pretty skeptical that the new compensation scheme will approach anything close to market rates at Cravath-matching firms. Nevertheless, for a stellar performer, I guess it’s possible he or she might make a Cravath-level salary. The other 99% of us will not.

So there you have it. Not a complete match, but at least you can toil in an international office occasionally. Maybe. In 2018.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Moves To Phase 2 Of COVID-19 Austerity Measures
## It sounds like a confusing time at the firm.

Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney has already made some COVID-19 inspired cost-cutting moves. [Salaries at the firm have been cut](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-200-firm-cuts-salaries-across-all-levels/?rf=1), but that doesn’t seem to be the end of the austerity measures.

One tipster reported being given the pay cut as previously announced, then shortly after they were “terminated due to a workforce reduction.” Another said, “They are conducting layoffs, just not announcing them.”

When asked for comment, Joseph A. Dougherty, CEO and Managing Director of the firm, confirmed that some staff were furloughed and laid out their plan for summer associates and the new class of associates but made no mention of any other layoffs:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As you have previously reported, several weeks ago Buchanan temporarily adjusted compensation across all levels and furloughed a very limited number of administrative staff. We look forward to bringing these individuals back when the pandemic subsides. This week, we announced we are shortening our 2020 summer associate program to four weeks and will be offering each second year summer associate an offer for full time employment in 2021. While we expect to welcome our summer associates to our offices in July, we are fully prepared to provide an excellent experience remotely, if need be. In addition, we are deferring the start of our Fall first year associate class to January 2021. These prudent decisions reflect our commitment to our clients, our communities and our future talent.

Sounds like folks at the firm have a different perspective than management. So what’s really going on at the firm? Buchanan associates, feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Buchanan%20Updates), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

In the early days of this year’s bonus season, way back in November, one firm matched the Cravath scale straight out of the gate, prompting a few other firms to follow in its footsteps. That firm was [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/cleary-bonus-2021/), one of the usual suspects for an early match each bonus season.

If you thought that the firm would leave its associates high and dry when it came to matching Davis Polk’s special bonuses, you’d be wrong. Earlier this week, on December 7, the firm came through for associates with extra bonus cash, and we hear they were quite excited.

After months of bad news, it certainly seemed like Shearman & Sterling — a firm that brought in $906,936,000 in 2022, putting it at No. 58 in the most recent Am Law 100 — was struggling, with headlines detailing [associate and staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/), a [scrapped merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/rumored-merger-between-hogan-lovells-and-shearman-scrapped/) with Hogan Lovells, and a [sudden change in leadership](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/shearman-names-new-leader-after-merger-talks-flop/). What was to become of the former top five earning firm that recently saw its revenue slide down 10% with its partner profits off by 17.5%? At long last, the firm finally has some good news to report, with a hero rushing in to its rescue.

Yesterday, Shearman jointly announced a merger with its knight in shining armor, Allen & Overy. The new firm will be called Allen Overy Shearman Sterling, or A&O Shearman for short. Once combined, the firm will have 3,900 lawyers with approximately 800 partners (30% in the U.S., 30% in the U.K., and 40% around the world), spread across 49 offices. A&O Shearman’s combined revenue will total $3.4 billion, and depending on how their finances are assessed, that would catapult the firm near the top of the Am Law 100 and even higher on the UK 100 (A&O is currently #4).

According to the firms’ [joint statement](https://www.shearman.com/en/news-and-events/news/2023/05/allen-and-overy-and-shearman-abd-sterling-to-create-fully-integrated-global-elite-law-firm), “A&O Shearman will be the only global firm with U.S. Law, English Law, and Local Law capabilities in equal measure.” The firms went on to note that the merger is “driven by clients’ needs for a seamless global offering of the highest quality and depth to support them in navigating an increasingly complex legal, regulatory, and geopolitical environment.”

Allen & Overy has long been trying to expand its U.S. footprint, and even attempted to merge with O’Melveny & Myers several years ago. The talks lasted more than a year, but in the end, it [didn’t work out](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/after-over-a-year-allen-overy-and-omelveny-call-off-merger/). Perhaps it was all for the best, because now A&O has chosen to partner with Shearman.

Here’s what A&O’s senior partner, Wim Dejonghe, had to say about the proposed merger:

“This combination of two great firms is such an exciting step for us. Both firms have a history of excellence, and together we think A&O Shearman will be a firm unlike any other in the world. We have listened to our clients and their requests for the highest quality advice to help navigate the demands they face, and to do so in an integrated and globally consistent way. We, A&O Shearman, will do this by accelerating our ability to bring the best of both firms, regardless of geography.

Shearman & Sterling is an incredible group of legal minds; a firm built on integrity and excellence, founded like us in a premier global financial capital and with an extraordinary group of longstanding clients. What excites me about this merger is the complementary cultures of our two firms. We have striking similarities across the board, and I believe we are going to be wonderful partners to one another on this journey.”

Adam Hakki, Shearman’s senior partner, also shared his thoughts about the planned combination:

“Client need for global elite firms has never been greater. They are calling for integrated global legal solutions and advice: merging with Allen & Overy will dramatically accelerate our ability to meet their needs in an increasingly complex environment. Allen & Overy is an outstanding firm whose work we have long admired and thought of as a kindred spirit. We have both always placed great emphasis on attracting and retaining top talent, were early to globalize, and are relentlessly focused on quality, excellence, and collaboration.

This is truly a game-changing moment for both firms that will create an unparalleled offering for our clients. It is also a fantastic opportunity for our people to be part of a transformative transaction and an institution of such significance, and we look forward to recruiting even more stellar talent in the coming years.”

Davis Polk is advising Shearman on the deal, while Simpson Thacher is advising A&O. Best of luck to both firms as their merger plans unfold.

# Holland & Knight's Leader Calls It Quits After Successfully Turning The Firm Into A Billion-Dollar Operation
## Thanks to several strategic mergers, he steered the firm to its financial prowess. Congratulations!

After a 16-year run as the head of the firm, [Steven Sonberg](https://www.hklaw.com/en/professionals/s/sonberg-steven) is stepping down from his role as managing partner of Holland & Knight.

During his time serving as the firm’s leader, Sonberg, 76, oversaw tremendous growth at Holland & Knight. Not only did the firm add about 900 lawyers and 17 offices through a series of mergers — namely its mergers with [Thompson & Knight](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-firms-to-merge-miss-ultimate-in-branding-opportunity/) and [Waller Lansden](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/one-year-after-its-last-merger-top-biglaw-firm-looks-for-new-merger-partner/) — for a total of almost 2,000 attorneys and 34 offices across the globe, but it also increased its revenue by nearly $1 billion. If that’s not the definition of success, we don’t know what is.

Sonberg will be passing the reins to [Robert Grammig](https://www.hklaw.com/en/professionals/g/grammig-robert-j), who currently serves as practice group co-leader of the firm’s corporate, M&A, and securities division. Grammig will assume the new titles of chair and CEO in the first quarter of 2024, once his move up the firm’s leadership ladder is done. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firm-holland-knight-shakes-up-leadership-after-16-years-growth-2023-06-08/) has the details on other roles the firm has added to its leadership hierarchy:

Holland & Knight also added two new leadership positions to aid with succession planning, Sonberg said. David Whitestone will serve as managing partner and Tiffani Lee will act as deputy managing partner, formalizing administrative work they have been doing for years, he said.

Unlike other firms, Holland & Knight has no mandatory retirement age, so Sonberg will remain with the firm. Congratulations on a job well done!

# Donald Trump's Lawyer Needs A Graphic Designer Who Isn't Copying And Pasting Quinn Emanuel's Logo
## One of these things is just like the other...

A firm’s logo is often a client’s first real contact with an attorney. Whether it’s on a billboard or a website or on the business card the lawyer handed a prospective client, the logo tells a client something about the attorney. Aesthetics matter and a professional logo communicates to the viewer that the attorney takes the business seriously enough to spend the time and resources to appreciate graphic design. [The alternative is not great](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/biglaw-firm-rebrands-and-the-new-logo-is-lets-just-say-unconventional/) and [can prove very bad for business](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/).

He’s got [a nice, slick website design](https://www.tacopinalaw.com/attorney/joseph-tacopina/) with a professional logo.

Classy.

There’s a pop of color with that green and white scheme that draws the viewer in. Most law firms stick with boring, conservative black, gray, and white, making this stand out in a positive way. The lettering combines a clean, compact font and lower-case lettering to convey a modern outlook. People overlook the importance of an aesthetically pleasing font, but there’s a reason [no one is submitting resumes to firms in Comic Sans](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/what-font-should-you-use-for-your-resume-apparently-this-matters-to-people/).

The coloring and lettering gives off an almost West Coast feel for the New York firm, doesn’t it?

Oh no.

Yes, it appears as though Tacopina deploys the same logo design as [Quinn Emanuel](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/). Well, not exactly. Quinn green is a little darker than Tacopina green. Is Tacopina going for the Jets uniform vibe, perhaps? If so, consider this the [butt fumble](https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/21401659/butt-fumble-oral-history-new-york-jets-nfl-king-bloopers-five-year-anniversary) of firm branding.

Even the under-logo featuring the full name of the firm seems like a copy. Tacopina’s firm uses all caps and Quinn stays in lower-case, but conceptually it’s the same.

Presumably, Tacopina and his team didn’t intend to do this. Some designer probably grabbed something that looked “lawyerish” and slapped it on there. Or maybe Quinn hired someone who did the same to Tacopina’s website. Either way. To borrow from one of the best SNL bits of the last several years:

Yeah, he just highlighted the firm name, he clicked the drop down menu, and the he randomly selected Impact Bold and colored the first half green. Like a thoughtless child wandering through a garden yanking leaves along the way.

Maybe Tacopina is waiting for those Trump fees to start rolling in so he can hire a graphic designer to revamp the look. If that’s the plan, he [may want to check in with Rudy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/trump-stiffs-rudy-for-all-his-amazing-legal-services/), because sometimes those bills don’t get paid.

# Lawyers -- Our Only Hope In The Metaverse!
## The metaverse is hard to regulate because there are no national laws or boundaries in interlocking digital spaces.

One of the great paradoxes of the legal profession is that lawyers are stereotyped as allergic to technology while simultaneously being at the bleeding edge of the way society interacts with technological advancement.

The Association of Corporate Counsel Annual Gathering in Las Vegas, which I attended last week, provided a first-hand opportunity to explore this thesis.

On the one hand, an entire convention hall was filled with legal technology companies vying for attention with conference bait like headphone raffles, lavender spray handouts, and even pretend movie star selfies. Something about the transactional nature of such exchanges would seem to reinforce the stereotype: “Fine I’ll demo your newfangled gizmo if you give me a children’s toy I can bring home to the family” (no doubt leading to exclamations of “My Mommy/Daddy went to Las Vegas for three days, and all I got was this branded rubber duck!”).

It was all good fun and, by the looks of it, the sponsors were successful in winning some of that attention to show the power and promise of technologies for corporate legal departments big and small, innovative and not. While I overhead many lawyers talking about how they keep all their data in their heads and tend to primarily rely on law firms they already know and trust, there was a level of inquisitiveness that implied many corporate counsel know the power of the solutions being presented and are on a journey to think about using them “in real life.” I’m a huge advocate of the need to leverage technology in the legal space, and I left optimistic that many in-house counsel are interested in how advances can make their jobs easier. So, I think the first half of the thesis was at least partially disproven.

I was able to test the second half of the paradox during a very substantive panel on the metaverse. I chair the advisory board of a rapidly growing virtual reality business, [MesmeriseVR](http://www.mesmerisevr.com), so I have a lot of experience rolling out metaverse tools to enterprise-scale corporations. I am certain that few of the nearly 100-plus corporate lawyer attendees for the metaverse session had ever put on VR goggles or purchased NFTs. Yet there was an extremely in-depth conversation between the panel and audience about how hard the metaverse is to regulate because there are no national laws or boundaries in interlocking digital spaces. The conversation cut across how charities can raise money in the metaverse as well as the complexities of minors in digital environments from countries with different ages of consent — and many other topics. In effect, the lawyers in the room could fully contemplate the legal implications of the metaverse even if they hadn’t fully experienced it.

And this was where it all crystallized for me. We live in a world without any type of global leadership at a time when technology is advancing at an exponential rate. When this occurs within a national boundary, governments will pick up the baton (often slowly) and generate the policy playing field in which companies must operate. Companies will play inside those rules, searching for ways to find advantage or influence rule changes as they can.

However, the metaverse is an altogether different challenge. For example, at Mesmerise, we [recently held an alumni gathering for Harvard Business School](https://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-students-metaverse-school-reunion-potential-use-vr-tech-2022-6) where classmates from 28 countries joined as avatars for a book launch of one of their professors and to network. If they had tried to meet in person, they would have had to navigate all sorts of settled law — visas, conditions of carriage, hotel contracts, COVID-19 restrictions, and the like. Those regimes would have actually made such a meeting unlikely to happen. Instead, they all materialized in a common digital space to high-five and trade stories.

In that type of dynamic, whose rules are we all following? What data policies take precedence? If someone were to conclude a verbal agreement for a business deal during the session, what would the jurisdiction have been?

None of the answers are clear. But what is clear is that lawyers are already starting to fill in the uncertainty. Instead of being led by policy or precedent, for now, business behavior in the metaverse will be guided virtually entirely by the opinion of corporate counsel who determine the extent to which their employees can participate and under what rules because this limits the viability of metaverse business models. This goes for the consumer metaverse as well, as providers and participants need to assess the risks and implications of such a fuzzy legal domain.

I actually recently had one enterprise ask me if Mesmerise’s virtual reality platform could handle electronic signatures. I think the better question would have been if their lawyer’s avatar could accompany them into virtual reality to review any documents!

Far from being hopeless with technology, in the absence of clear multilateral rules and norms, it is actually lawyers who will define the space in which businesses can play. This is as true in real life as it is in the metaverse.

# When Your Brother Blows Up Your Biglaw Interview
## Maybe you just weren't meant to get that job.

Sometimes it feels like the universe just does not want you to get what you want. Sure, you may think you really want a particular Biglaw job, but events conspire to keep that brass ring out of reach.

Take this interview horror story from an ATL reader. He was ready for his Biglaw interview when a surprise appearance by his brother (a bizarre occurrence in and of itself) threw off his game. Unable to recover it time, he didn’t get the job:

Background: My brother graduated from law school three years before I did and was working for a small firm in Tennessee. Or so I thought he was.

While clerking for a federal judge in North Carolina, I was interviewing with some Atlanta firms. During one such interview with an Atlanta Biglaw firm, I was having the obligatory lunch with a couple of partners at a big Atlanta restaurant. Unbeknownst to me, my brother had left his Tennessee law firm and started with a different Atlanta Biglaw. Unbeknownst to me, he was doing his obligatory first-day-with-the-new-associate lunch at the same big restaurant. Unbeknownst to either of us, we were seated in adjacent tables, back-to-back.

About midway through the meal, my brother thought he heard a voice he recognized. He turned around and, to his surprise, saw me. He got up and said, “David, what are you doing here?” I replied, “Me? What the hell are you doing in Atlanta?” At that point, his very important partners got up from their table and introduced themselves. One of them kindly asked, “So, who are you interviewing with today?” Still flustered from the brother ambush, I managed an “uh, uh, uh.” After about 20 seconds of that, one of the partners I was interviewing with said, “We’re with [Biglaw name].”

I did not receive an offer.

Fate is a helluva thing. Let’s hope some window was left cracked open when this particular door got slammed shut.

# Poetic C&D Response Tells Biglaw To Get Lost In Verse
## Someone's exercising that humanities education.

The cease and desist call and response is one of the few areas of legal practice that actually affords attorneys a bit of creative license. Without a judge involved, attorneys are free to let their snarky side show. We’ve even had a whole contest [pitting the best letters we’ve received over the years](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/the-greatest-letter-ever-the-atl-lawyer-letter-bracket-day-1/) against each other.

Software company [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/) began an advertising campaign calling out their rival [Gusto](https://gusto.com/) by name on a billboard, prompting Gusto to take the time-honored step of making their Biglaw attorneys draft a cease and desist letter to get Rippling to stop being mean. Rippling GC Vanessa Wu decided to have some fun in response, replying in iambic pentameter as one does.

Enjoy.

# The Top Above The Law Stories Of The Last Decade (Sort Of)
## What has entranced ATL readers the most over the last 10 years?

Technically the decade doesn’t end until December 31, 2020. That said, no one is looking to Above the Law to be the sort of obnoxious gunner who points out something so wildly pedantic. Let’s just lean back and celebrate the common parlance end out the 2010s with a look back the top stories we’ve put out over the first full decade of Above the Law coverage.

Why is this a “sort of” list? Above the Law changed how we track traffic in 2015 so while we can see stories from the whole decade, we can only identify the traffic those stories have generated since the summer of 2015. So when you look at this list you may wonder if there are some early decade blockbusters that should be in here. For instance, [Dewey think the death of a law firm might have cracked the list](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/05/dewey-know-what-led-to-the-collapse-and-what-lessons-can-be-learned/)? Probably. I happen to know from memory that this particular post about a former Michigan judge [had traffic higher than all but three of the articles listed below](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/shirtless-wade-mccree-may-be-heading-to-the-supreme-court/). But we have to work with what we have and this list is a good thumbnail sketch of the years.

Of course, if you’re looking to hear a quick recap of the just top stories of 2019 — the feature we usually drop at this point — there’s always the [Thinking Like A Lawyer recap](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2019/12/the-top-stories-of-2019/).

Without further ado, behold a decade in the life of Above the Law:

10. [Which Bar Exam Prep Course Is The Best?](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/05/which-bar-exam-prep-course-is-the-best-2/): Back in 2013, we endeavored to provide 3Ls with a comprehensive guide to the best bar prep courses available to them by simply laying out all the costs, discounts, and policies of the big players in bar prep so graduates could make an informed decision. The success of this post over the last decade is a reminder that while timely announcements that lawyers are demanding opposing counsel [“eat a bowl of dicks”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/small-firm-lawyer-tells-biglaw-team-to-eat-bowl-of-dicks-during-settlement-negotiations/) (while that story was only published in December, it is currently the 12th most read story of the decade), ATL also delivers serious, practical information and often that stuff delivers as many eyeballs as the more scandalous stories. And given that this article pre-dates the traffic black hole, it deserves to be much, much higher on this list.

9. [The Brett Kavanaugh Chickens Have Come Home To Roost](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/the-brett-kavanaugh-chickens-have-come-home-to-roost/): The top story of 2019 is also the 9th entry in the decade’s hit list. “The Brett Kavanaugh Chickens” in this case represent Maine Senator Susan Collins realizing that she had torched the “I’m a moderate, pro-woman Republican” image that she’d mostly fictionalized to sustain her career in Maine politics. Kavanaugh was certainly a bigger deal this year, but let’s not undersell when she backed Neil Gorsuch as a defender of “precedent” because he’d written a book on it right before gutting the 40-year-old Abood decision. The moral of the story is that Susan Collins is a talentless hack who’s successfully hoodwinked Maine into thinking she’s Olympia Snowe for too long.

8. [Apparent Suicide In Front Of D.C. Law Office Building](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/apparent-suicide-in-front-of-d-c-law-office-building/): One of the biggest struggles internally at Above the Law is how to cover death, and in particular death by suicide. On the one hand, interrupting the light tone of the publication to pass along tragic news. On the other hand, this is the brother/sisterhood of the profession and we owe it to the legal industry at large to acknowledge that this happens and to encourage everyone who might be going through the same stuff that help is out there. Frankly, in a roundup of the themes that touched the ATL audience the most over the last decade, it’s important that a story about losing one of the fellowship is in here.

7. [Salary Wars Scorecard: Which Firms Have Announced Raises And Bonuses? (2018)](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/): Last year, Milbank and Simpson and Cravath combined to give associates a cost of living adjustment to the 2016 raises. Sure, it was only 2 years after the last salary bump so it wasn’t as big of a splash, but it’s a testament to ATL’s audience growth that coverage of the 2018 adjustment actually outpaced the 2016 coverage. In fact, this post was split into two (reflecting the pre- and post- Cravath match and raise) and would actually be 4th if combined. The coverage of individual firm moves generally outpaced 2016 too with one pretty obvious exception that we’ll talk about in a minute.

6. [City Attorney Spraying Anti-Trump Graffiti While Drinking Wine Is All We Have Left](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/city-attorney-spraying-anti-trump-graffiti-while-drinking-wine-is-all-we-have-left/): Duncan Lloyd, an assistant city solicitor in Philadelphia, spray painted “Fuck Trump” on a wall in 2016 and his story became the first of many springboards for Elie Mystal to elucidate his frustration over the 2016 election.

5. [The Lawyer Holiday Gift Guide: The Best Gifts For The Attorney In Your Life](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/the-lawyer-holiday-gift-guide-the-best-gifts-for-the-attorney-in-your-life/): The gifting holidays are behind us for another year, but the gift guide we maintain for those out there looking to bring cheer to attorneys remains an audience favorite.

4. [You Realize Arming Teachers Is Going To Lead To Black Students Getting Murdered By Their Teacher, Right?](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/you-realize-arming-teachers-is-going-to-lead-to-black-students-getting-murdered-by-their-teacher-right/): I remember everything about the genesis of this post. In the immediate aftermath of Parkland shooting, Republicans began discussing a comprehensive plan to solve mass shootings by giving high-powered weaponry to public school teachers in what’s arguably the least sensical idea they’ve had since supply-side tax cuts. Elie had begun work on a post about how the idea just won’t work when Kathryn Rubino and I mentioned that someone we know had pointed out that his biggest concern as a black man was that this will only spiral into teachers killing black students. Within about 20 seconds the original draft was junked and Elie started drafting this full explanation of exactly where this insane policy would end up.

3. [The Absurdity Of Current Law School Scholarship Offerings](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-absurdity-of-current-law-school-scholarship-offerings/): The rise in law school tuition defines one of Above the Law’s longest-running crusades. The profession doesn’t offer the same golden ticket it once did, but law schools are still treating third-tier students like they’ll be Latham’s next rainmaker. This straightforward piece looks at the trend of law schools driving up scholarship opportunities to cover for their increasingly unrealistic tuition demands.

2. [Breaking: NY To $180K!!! Cravath Raises Associate Base Salaries!!! ](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/): After almost a decade of stagnation in associate salaries, the 2016 announcement that Cravath would bump salaries to the $180K scale became a huge story for Above the Law. And a good portion of its traffic didn’t even come in 2016. Almost a third of the pageviews for this post came in 2018 right after [Milbank made the first move in that round of salary hikes](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), as people looked back to see how the 2016 round shaped up.

1. [A Pictorial Walkthrough On How To Use Excel For Law Firm Billing](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/a-pictoral-walkthrough-on-how-to-use-excel-for-law-firm-billing/): Some of Above the Law’s most popular content doesn’t move the needle when it’s first written. This technology piece for small law attorneys is the perfect marriage of two of ATL’s most important — but niche — audiences. We provide a great deal of legal technology coverage that may not generate a click from law students out there, but when attorneys are looking for product reviews and just a frank, maybe even irreverent look at emerging trends in the space, we provide a lot of content. For small law attorneys who needed to get the bills out the door and didn’t have a lot of capital to invest in billing software, this guide was a godsend and it continued to generate a small but steady stream of clicks for years. Today, billing software is more cost effective, so the guide’s traffic has slowed a bit, but it had a tremendous run as the most popular post of the decade.

# Creating An Effective Career Management Strategy
## Whether you’re at the beginning of your legal career or 15 years in, this is something you need to do.

Most clients come to me when they are faced with a crossroad in their career, usually in the form of one of these situations:

- the client has reached the ceiling of growth at their company and acknowledges it’s time to move on;
- the culture and mission of the company or firm has taken a turn and no longer aligns with the client’s own values; or
- the company is approaching a major transition (acquisition or financial downsizing) and the client needs to be prepared for a job search “just in case.”
These situations are proactive in nature as clients are thinking ahead of what to do and taking next best steps.

Whether you’re at the beginning of your legal career or 15 years in, I wholeheartedly believe in creating an effective career management strategy. This means you will always be prepared for the unexpected twists and turns because you’re actively updating your career documents, you’re performing ongoing annual audits, you’re continuously building your professional network, and you’re consistently reevaluating your goals. Below are detailed strategies to help you ensure you’re always improving your career health and outlook.

Set Annual Goals, Including 5- And 10-Year Plans

Most of us are often focused on the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of our roles — we settle into a firm or company and put the annual goals on the backburner until personal evaluations come around, and we’re forced to reflect. By setting annual goals and writing down short- and long-term career plans, it provides a working checklist that you can audit year after year to see if you’re growing in your career trajectory or in need of a reboot. This also means performing a yearly audit and looking outside of your role to determine if you’re continuing to develop professionally — research and consider obtaining certifications such as the CIPP/US if you’re increasing your skills and interest in data privacy, or even consider leadership development training courses and programs to advance your executive presence for a future seat in the boardroom. Engage in CLEs and other professional development opportunities to build knowledge in key areas, as well as learn about new and emerging areas of practice.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
A key facet of career management is keeping an [updated brag book and career portfolio](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/why-you-should-always-be-prepared-for-a-job-search-and-what-to-do-to-prepare/) — this includes your resume, deal/transaction sheet with representative engagements (i.e., case results), professional bio, and a current LinkedIn profile. Opportunities often present themselves when we least expect. Schedule an audit every six months on your leadership and functional responsibilities, new areas of accountability, key projects you’ve led or worked on, and other representative engagements that showcase your legal skill sets. Reflect on your LinkedIn profile and [analyze specific areas where you can increase its optimization](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/about-to-job-search-dont-overlook-these-areas-of-your-linkedin-profile/).

Manage Your Network And Nurture It

Having a strong network is key in the digital age. If you’re in the beginning years of practice, seek out mentors, and explore connecting with experienced lawyers who are where you want to be five or 10 years from now. Don’t be afraid to build that network on LinkedIn and send messages with a request to connect, including explaining your interest in setting up a coffee chat. Read up on current trends and observe the movers and shakers in your practice area that are blogging and speaking about these legal trends — watch how they leverage their subject-matter expertise. Build relationships with recruiters. By continuously nurturing your network, you are setting yourself up for more legal career opportunities down the road.

Your career management strategy is a long-term one that will continue to grow and evolve over the course of your legal career across the ebbs and flows of the changing landscape. Consider it a work in progress that needs constant fine-tuning and reflecting.

# Thank You, Tipsters!
## You are the absolute best. Pat yourselves on the back with a ""Like.""

Just a quick note on behalf of all of us here: the tipster community is absolutely killing it this week. I’ve tried to respond to some of your texts and emails, but frankly, I haven’t been as thorough as I’d like because often there are 10-20 more tips coming in while I’ve already moved on to writing the story. You’ve been our eyes and ears this week and we couldn’t have done it without you. So if you haven’t heard back from one of us directly, know that we’re all incredibly appreciative of your help in keeping the legal world aware of the latest salary moves.

And it’s not just when you receive confirmation. If you know that the partners are meeting, let us know that too! It’s tremendously helpful to have the head’s up that an announcement — one way or the other — is imminent.

As always, a reminder that when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Bonus season is the most wonderful season in Biglaw! It’s the annual reminder to associates that all the billable hours were really worth it.

Earlier this week, Skadden shared its annual monetary appreciation with associates. The firm’s bonus scale matches the one set last month by Baker McKenzie, but contains a little something extra for the most experienced associates. As you can see from the chart below, bonuses for the two most senior classes of associates have a range of bonus money, which *starts* at the market rate and heads north from there.



Bonuses will be paid on December 16th. According to tipsters at the firm, the “productive hours requirement” for bonuses is 1800 hours and includes unlimited pro bono time and generally up to 150 hours of productive non-billable work.

You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/skaddens-bonuses-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Which Biglaw firm lays claim to being the “oldest continuing Wall Street law practice in the United States”?

Hint: The oldest firm in the United States (but not on Wall Street) is Rawle & Henderson, established in Philadelphia in 1783.

# Biglaw Firm Learns Pandemic Not Over When Associate Retreat Leads To COVID Outbreak
## COVID strikes at Biglaw firm.

I really wish COVID was over. And I’m definitely not the only one. But while the numbers are still mercifully well below the height of the pandemic, the new Omicron subvariant — BA.2 — is quickly gaining steam.

However, the eagerness for a post-COVID life is intense. Cities are dropping mask mandates like they’re hot. The CDC is slashing quarantine times. And Biglaw firms are returning to the office.

At Katten Muchin Rosenman, getting back to normal also included a — voluntary — junior associate retreat in Chicago. Unfortunately, that’s resulted in a COVID outbreak at the firm, as an email from Chief Talent Officer Melanie Priddy confirmed:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As some of you may know, we held a Junior Associate Retreat in Chicago last week and we were notified that a number of people who attended tested positive for COVID-19. Specifically, of the 110+ individuals who attended the retreat, so far we are aware of 19 who have tested positive.

Priddy notes the firm has a vaccine and testing mandate for those who attend out-of-town retreats like this, but well, reducing one’s risk is not the same as eliminating it. The firm also detailed the steps it’s taking to minimize the outbreak.

Our Human Resources department has been in contact with these individuals and are monitoring their health status, along with identifying close contacts (who have been notified separately). For those who attended the Junior Associate Retreat, in abundance of caution, we ask that you do not go into any of our U.S. Katten offices for the remainder of this week, monitor for any symptoms and notify your local HR Manager if you do test positive for COVID.

Above the Law wishes everyone involved a speedy recovery. And let this be a reminder, wishing the pandemic over is not the same as it actually being over.

We want to be flexible for our clients. Bitcoin is an easy and secure way to transfer funds, and we embrace it.

— [John Quinn](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/quinn-john-b/), founding partner of [Quinn Emanuel](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/quinn-john-b/), commenting on the firm’s recent decision to [accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/11/05/quinn-emanuel-says-clients-can-pay-in-bitcoin/) for legal services. Less than a handful of other Biglaw firms (e.g., Perkins Coie, Steptoe & Johnson, and Frost Brown Todd) have publicly announced accepting payment via cryptocurrency.

# Millennial Lawyers’ Impact On The Legal Industry
## Download our free report for insights into how millennials are shaping law firm culture.

Members of the millennial generation make up the largest proportion of the legal profession, and more are becoming partners and moving into leadership roles at their firms. What impact are they having on firm policies and attitudes?

As part of Above the Law’s long-running study with Major, Lindsey & Africa, we recently surveyed more than 1,000 attorneys to better understand the priorities and perspectives of the millennial generation. The results of our 2023 survey are now available in this [free report](https://info.abovethelaw.com/searching-for-balance-millennial-lawyers-perspectives-on-the-legal-industry).

Among the key findings:

- 45% of respondents want to become partners at their current firm—a significant increase over the 24% who reported the same in 2021.
- Compensation and work/life balance remain the most important factors for respondents evaluating potential employers.
- More than half of respondents said they would trade a portion of their compensation for more time off.
- A majority of associates and more than 40% of partners believe that the millennial generation is transforming law firm policies and culture for the better, and that current law firm leadership has outstayed its effectiveness.
- Certain results—particularly with respect to access to meaningful work and perceptions of bias—underscore critical differences based on generation, position, gender, and race.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

The legal industry is at a tipping point when it comes to capitalizing on legal analytics to provide better and more efficient legal services. [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/2Z1zsTA), a leading provider of [legal analytics tools](https://bit.ly/3i2ZgHQ), recently commissioned the [2020 Legal Analytics Study](https://bit.ly/3fZEYwZ), in partnership with ALM Intelligence, to explore the current use of legal analytics in the legal industry and the benefits it offers law firms. The study surveyed 163 large law firm professionals in December 2019 to uncover the industry’s views on the adoption and application of legal analytics.

We recently sat down with [Sean Fitzpatrick](https://bit.ly/3euNSlC), CEO of LexisNexis North America, to discuss the results of the study, current trends in legal analytics, and what we can expect to see in the legal analytics arena going forward.

What are some of the biggest takeaways from the 2020 Legal Analytics Study?

The results from this year’s study clearly show we’ve reached a tipping point in the legal analytics adoption curve among Am Law 200 firms, driven by competitive pressures, the expectations of corporate clients and the need to control costs. An overwhelming majority of law firms — 70% — recognize these benefits and have adopted legal analytics, while 90% of analytics users agree that legal analytics make them better legal practitioners. This survey validates what we’ve known for quite some time — that law firms should provide access to the legal analytics tools their professionals value and desire to remain competitive.   

Are more firms today adopting analytics? If so, what’s driving the increase?

We’re seeing a rapid increase in the adoption of analytics, and we expect to see that increase continue. Of the lawyers whose organizations have access to legal analytics, 75% reported seeing usage increase in the last 12 months and 92% said they intend to increase their use of legal analytics in the next year.

Client expectations and competitive pressures were cited as the top two drivers of legal analytics adoption among large law firms. Of the users surveyed, a vast majority said legal analytics were encouraged or looked upon favorably by clients. It’s an extremely powerful thing for legal professionals — and their clients — to be able to look at a thorough analysis of how long it would take a case to reach summary judgment and what the potential damages would be before pursuing a legal strategy. It makes the intrinsic value of analytics and how it can improve the knowledge, competitiveness, and efficiency of legal professionals and their law firm clear.

What benefits do legal analytics offer?

The overwhelming majority of lawyers who currently use legal analytics say it makes them better, more efficient, and more effective practitioners. And even the majority of those who don’t currently have access to the technology, recognize its value and believe that it would make them better lawyers if they used it. 

The cited top benefits of legal analytics include increases in an organization’s knowledge, competitiveness and efficiency, as well as a better ability to gain competitive insights, strategically assess and price cases and pursue new business, but I don’t think it stops there. The ability to take massive amounts of data and truly pinpoint exact strategies or language that can make or break a case is a revolutionary shift for the legal industry. Being able to walk into court and know how your judge has ruled on similar cases in the past and what language or cases he cited in his rulings gives you a huge competitive advantage that is only accessible with advanced language analytics.

How can law firms get the most out of legal analytics?

Analytics have useful applications in both the practice of law and the business of law. In the practice of law use-cases, lawyers value the ability to gain competitive insights on other players in litigation, the knowledge to better assess cases and the ability to have a greater footing for determining case strategy.

What was really interesting is how business of law use-cases for legal analytics have grown over the past year, expanding beyond its original function as a litigation tool. This clearly indicates that law firms recognize that legal analytics can do so much more for their organizations, such as pricing legal matters, gathering competitive intelligence for new business, or simply demonstrating a competitive advantage to clients.

How is LexisNexis changing the legal analytics game?

The legal industry’s most groundbreaking, innovative, and impactful analytics solutions reside on our flagship Lexis Advance platform, enabling attorneys to do their work more efficiently, provide better client counsel, and make more informed business decisions in today’s hypercompetitive environment. Additionally, through sophisticated tools like [Context](https://bit.ly/318ZmaK) and [Lex Machina](https://bit.ly/2BzwlKw), we’re helping lawyers across the industry make the most of the analytics capabilities available today. 

As the leader in legal analytics, we couldn’t be happier to see more law firms, attorneys, and other legal professionals adopting these tools and finding new ways for the technology to add value to their business and profession.

What should we expect to see in the realm of legal analytics in the future?

Based on the positive survey results and our own in-market intelligence, we’re expecting continued growth and adoption of legal analytics in the years to come. Nearly all law firms that use legal analytics expect to increase or expand its use in the next year, and a solid number of firms that don’t use it plan to invest in legal analytics over the next two years. 

The legal analytics tools available today offer data-driven attorneys the ability to know things that were previously unknowable, and we only expect those abilities to increase in the future as the technologies become more powerful and refined.

What impact has COVID-19 had on analytics use? Are you seeing an uptick in analytics usage and adoption? 

As one would imagine, the federally mandated COVID-19 restrictions in March disrupted many of the established processes that had been driving the practice of law — including the use of analytics. But once attorneys adjusted to working from home, we saw a tremendous uptick in usage and adoption of analytics. 

For instance, our language analytics platform, Context, recorded its highest usage ever in April 2020, up more than 50% above its previous high-usage record in February and spiking nearly 80% from March. The increase came primarily from the large law and academic segments and included a very notable increase in the same users coming back repeatedly. Similarly, Lex Machina’s Legal Analytics, whose growth had been trending upward in late February, saw a near 25% drop in usage in the first half of March but by the end of April, usage had rebounded to within a few basis points of its February high. Overall, this rebound demonstrates the importance of analytics to today’s legal practice and its ability to deliver critical information and insights under the most challenging of circumstances.

Welcome to the latest installment of [The Struggle](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-struggle/), a series where we examine the mental-health issues that students encounter during the oftentimes grueling law school experience. We are posting these stories because sometimes what law students really need is to know that they’re not alone in their pain. Sometimes what law students need is to know that they’ve got a friend who is willing to share not just in their triumphs, but also in their struggles. These are real e-mails and messages we’ve received from real readers.

If these issues resonate with you, please reach out to us. Your stories need to be heard. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=The%20Struggle), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog). We will share your stories anonymously. You may be able to help a law student who needs to know that someone else has been there before and survived.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I’ve been sober for four years now, and have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. I was not a problem drinker until I went to law school, although the signs were there. I had spent a lifetime alternating high performance with periodic Byronesque depressions, which I covered with all my strength, so nobody would see I was dead inside.

In law school, my anxiety level slowly ramped up after first year. I was at a second-tier school, and I knew grades were absolutely critical. I thought everything would get better when I landed the Biglaw gig. The Biglaw firm, though, was a haven of high-functioning (and some not so high-functioning) alcoholics. Every single party or occasion or even quick get-together was swimming in alcohol, and you were judged on your ability to hold your liquor. As a woman, I always wanted to try to keep up with the boys, and was rewarded for that. I was an introvert, perpetually feeling like a square peg in a round hole, and alcohol helped with that. But after six years there, I slipped into a serious depression and should have taken time off, or even gone to a hospital, as I now know, but instead I tried to gut it out. The quality and speed of my work suffered, but it was less upsetting to me to be thought slightly less careful than to be thought of as mentally ill. You could tell by the way other lawyers talked about the few people who were honest about having had problems that this was simply not an option. I was eventually forced out, which I took as a personal disaster of the largest imaginable proportions even though, of course, at such a place, you have to leave eventually if you aren’t going to make partner — and that clearly wasn’t going to happen.

We had not prepared for this, and almost lost our house in the ensuing financial cleanup. My family was very supportive, we were prepared to move and downsize if necessary, but I ultimately landed another job, at a firm where I did okay, until another crash. For the first time, I took time off and got help. I received a diagnosis, a serious depressive illness. I was honest with HR and my supervising partner about what was going on. I wish I could say that had a happy ending — it did in the sense that I wasn’t fired, but it was clear that the supervising partner was never comfortable with me again, never had the same level of trust. It was awful to know that, like a steady drip of acid indigestion.

I spent the two years after my diagnosis looking for a different sort of job, one where I thought I could practice within my need for occasional time off and flexibility. By the time I found the job I have now, I had obtained lengthy treatment and therapy which make full functioning possible. I quit drinking during my last two years at the prior firm also — my diagnosis made it clear drinking had to be off the table if I was going to get better. I was able to start fresh at this new place, in a non-associate senior lawyer position so I don’t have to worry about making partner or not. It’s small, and friendly, and flexible. I’m effectively in charge of my own practice and nobody cares where I am so long as the work gets done. There’s an AA meeting down the street, where I go when I am meeting “a friend” for lunch.

But this new firm will never know, because I will never again make the mistake of sharing that information with any lawyer in management. My recommendation to those who suffer is treat your disease vigorously — with therapy and meds if you need them — but unless you are 100% confident that your managing lawyers are completely okay with the knowledge that you have a mental health issue, call it something else. If you need therapy and have to take time off during the day, it can be “physical therapy for my bum knee,” or “yoga,” or something acceptable. If you need to go to the hospital for a depression or for alcohol/drug rehab, go, do it, yesterday, for your life, which is more important than a stupid job. Call it something else — you are not obligated to share. If I am really pressed about why I don’t drink and am in company where I feel comfortable, I say “because I didn’t have an off switch” or “because I can’t really remember the 90s” — it’s actually more acceptable to be a recovering alcoholic than mentally ill, even though they so often go together. But nobody is owed an explanation as to why you don’t drink. I did confide some level of my “deal” with my direct colleague, because I found out that colleague has similar issues — we look out for each other and cover when needed. It has been absolutely a godsend.

I also look out for fellow lawyers, especially younger lawyers, for signs of problems or drinking issues. I want to be sure that I am not the senior lawyer who marginalizes or fails to help or understand another attorney in need. I would freely share with a colleague if I thought it would help them.

So, I guess the moral of the story is, you can practice law with a serious mental illness, but you have to be both aggressive and circumspect in getting the help you need, depending on your circumstances. But always err on the side of getting help, even if it means suffering the embarrassment of exposure. No job is worth your life. Stay. Get help. Stay.

Most colleges and universities have counseling and psychological services resources that students can turn to if they are in crisis or would like counseling, even after hours. If these services are not available at your school, and if you’re depressed and in need help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ([1-800-273-8255](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org)) or a [lawyer assistance program](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state.html) in your state. Remember that you are loved, so please reach out if you need assistance, before it’s too late.

# Paul Hastings Involved In Embarrassing Email SNAFU
## It's not the end of the world, but it's not a great look.

Paul Hastings had an unfortunate technical screw-up in the UK and the nearly 400 young lawyers applying for its training contract program had to be informed that the deadline would be extended. Unfortunately, this notification created a second, much bigger technical mishap when every applicant meant to be blind copied was carbon copied instead.

[Legal Cheek has the scoop on the email mishap](https://www.legalcheek.com/2019/08/us-firm-paul-hastings-email-blunder-lets-prospective-trainees-see-who-theyre-up-against/) that allowed every applicant to see just who they’re competing against for the job:

The email — sent by an external company to applicants yesterday morning, and seen by Legal Cheek — flagged “technical problems” with the service provider’s external website on training contract deadline day yesterday. Paul Hastings accordingly extended the deadline for its 2021 trainee scheme until today.

What would have been a well-intentioned gesture, unfortunately, backfired, when the email was sent out with all 388 prospective applicants’ email addresses (some of which featured the names of candidates) in the ‘Cc’ field rather than the ‘Bcc’ one.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The email was sent by Thomson Reuters, which is looking into how it came to pass.

While certainly embarrassing, this shouldn’t be blown out of proportion into some Capital One-level data breach. It’s not like this email posted everybody’s transcript or anything — applying to work at a well-respected law firm isn’t a dirty little secret. If anything, everyone involved should be happy that the foul-up didn’t expose anything more damaging and can use this occasion to tighten up their controls.

To put it in terms the players will appreciate, think of every crisis as an email and opportunity as the bcc!

# Top 5 Firm Matches Bonus Scale
## Some real momentum.

Any doubt that Davis Polk successfully redefined the 2021 bonus scale is melting away in real time. Firms are rapidly announcing bonus matches, providing the frenzied bonus atmosphere eerily lacking in the immediate wake of the original Cravath memo. It’s an exciting time to be an associate when firms offer a 15 percent bonus hike and the market offers a collective, “gee, that doesn’t seem like enough.” Now Skadden — Am Law’s number 5 firm in revenue — has thrown its weight behind the new scale and we’ve finally got some momentum behind this thing.

Here are the numbers from the Skadden memo, but don’t get too excited… we’ll explain below.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Those paying close attention to these announcements will note that the special bonuses are bigger than the announced Davis Polk scale. But don’t be deceived: this is a direct match. Well, except for the senior associates on the upper tier of that two-tiered base bonus, but that’s neither here nor there when it comes to the scale itself.

The discrepancy comes from the fact that Skadden’s spring bonus memo [broke that special bonus into two tranches](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/skadden-spring-bonuses/), with one to be paid out in December. Those were $6K to $32K bonuses, exactly corresponding to the premium over the $4K-$23K special bonus component of the Davis Polk scale.

And remember, the firm is also handing out some free tech, [with an iPad Pro gift](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/skadden-steps-up-to-thank-associates-with-a-different-kind-of-holiday-bonus/). It was probably tacky to send out a gift notice for anything other than bonuses during the end of November. The firm knows it’s going to be setting bonuses within the next two weeks — sending out “gift” emails about anything else during the bonus season before actual bonuses is just a tease no matter how nice it may be. But associates will certainly let bygones be bygones at this point.

If anyone’s interested, the full memo is on the next page.

# Yet Another Firm Eager To Leap Off Financial Cliff To Follow Cravath
## Which firm has given in to peer pressure to follow Cravath this time?

Biglaw firms are all about peer pressure. If the market leader when it came to compensation were to jump off a cliff, hundreds of other firms would quickly follow, regardless of whether or not it would be financially prudent for them to do so. Which is the latest firm to take the leap in the wake of Cravath’s 2017 bonus announcement?

That would be Covington & Burling, which if you recall, was [wishy-washy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/) about whether it would change its salary scale outside of New York following Cravath’s move to a $180K base rate — until the firm was essentially [forced to do so](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-changes-course-on-associate-compensation/) by prevailing market forces.

Last year, Covington had some rather curious wording in its bonus memo, offering [“maximum bonus amounts”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-firm-offers-maximum-bonus-amounts-that-match-the-market/) — which were equal to Cravath rate, not above them, as seemingly suggested. This year, the firm has once again matched Cravath for all U.S. offices, and it’s deleted that odd language from its memo (which is available on the next page). Once again, those bonuses will be paid “by the end of January.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That’s our take on the Covington & Burling bonuses. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we promise we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Cravath Announces Raises -- Comes Over The Top Of Milbank Scale (For Some Associates)
## Now will the rest of Biglaw react?

It’s been three weeks since[ Milbank showed up and showed out](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) rocking the Biglaw echo chamber with both bonuses (expected) and raises (not expected). And until today, no firm has dipped their toe into that water by announcing a similar move — despite the argument the raises were [tracked to inflationary pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/the-insufferable-nonsense-biglaw-is-spouting-over-milbanks-raises/).

But now, finally, Cravath has decided to respond to the clamoring of associates desperate to know if they’ll be making the top-of-the-market compensation come the new year.

They’ve announced a match of the Milbank scale for compensation for junior associates — but midlevel and senior associates will do even better at Cravath. The new salary scale at Cravath is as follows:

Class of 2023  	$225,000  ($10K raise)
Class of 2022  	$235,000  ($10K raise)
Class of 2021  	$260,000  ($10K raise)
Class of 2020  	$310,000 ($5K more than Milbank, $15K total raise)  
Class of 2019  	$365,000  ($10K more than Milbank, $20K total raise)
Class of 2018  	$390,000  ($10K more than Milbank, $20K total raise)
Class of 2017  	$420,000  ($10K more than Milbank, $20K total raise)
Raises are effective January 1.

Additionally, year-end bonuses were also announced, which match Milbank’s (and last year’s) numbers.

Class of 2023  	$15,000  
Class of 2022  	$20,000  
Class of 2021  	$30,000  
Class of 2020  	$57,500  
Class of 2019  	$75,000  
Class of 2018  	$90,000  
Class of 2017  	$105,000
The full memo is below.

Cravath has long been considered a compensation leader. Now that they’ve made their move, it can’t be too long before the rest of Biglaw reacts.

# Global Firm Expands Tech Incubator As Part Of Growing Range Of Outside-The-Box Services
## Allen & Overy offers a lot more than traditional law firm services.

Law firms aren’t just law firms these days. And I don’t mean those firms that are crypto-lobbyists destroying the world for fun and profit… I mean law firms also doing useful stuff.

Hanging out in the exhibit hall at last week’s Corporate Legal Operations Consortium Global Institute, where the [rapidly expanding field of Legal Ops professionals](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/cloc-is-all-about-establishing-a-new-professional-guild-and-im-here-for-it/) showed up to grow their craft and maybe buy some sweet tech for the legal department on the side, I couldn’t help but notice the curious sight of a few law firm representatives milling about. Legal Ops may be taking over in-house departments, but selecting outside counsel is still a GC role, right?

It sort of depends on what a department is looking to to get from a firm. Because whether it’s tech, human resources, or consulting, it’s possible to get a lot from a known law firm brand.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[Allen & Overy’s Fuse](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/expertise/advanced_delivery/tech_innovation) is a tech innovation space where the firm [leverages its assets and expertise](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/biglaw-firms-become-tech-incubators/) to partner and build legal tech solutions. For its sixth cohort, the program welcomed 16 companies, its largest iteration yet and a testament to client interest in the program.

Shruti Ajitsaria, partner and head of Fuse commented: “We’ve had an incredible amount of interest this year with over 130 applications from technology companies based in 25 countries. The quality of these applications is a sign that we remain attractive to the LegalTech ecosystem and that the legal sector continues to be ripe for disruptive transformation. We feel immensely proud that Fuse serves as a key focal point in uncovering and supporting these new technologies.”

But building out new legal technology to serve clients is only one of the firm’s outside-the-historical-law-firm-box services designed to deepen the A&O relationship with clients at a time when the competition among outside counsel is more fierce than ever.

Late last year, the firm launched Peerpoint in the U.S., an extension of the firm’s international “flexible resourcing platform.” At an abstract level, Peerpoint offers temporary and interim lawyers… but it’s not a standard contract lawyer program, having grown out of the firm’s efforts to retain A&O trained talent that otherwise planned to leave Biglaw. Amie Davidson, Head of Peerpoint in the U.S., explained the value proposition is delivering A&O quality on a flexible basis. The program has expanded beyond just retaining A&O lawyers, but the firm continues to vet its Peerpoint attorneys to the firm’s standards.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In a world where rocketing firm salaries make in-house hiring a more difficult proposition, the option to get an A&O level attorney basically seconded to the legal department for a while would be an attractive option.

Catie Butt, an Executive Director in Allen & Overy’s corporate and legal function transformation business, sort of brought all these strands together. A&O’s consulting arm is there to help clients approach innovation — the same problem Fuse is looking to solve building tech options and Peerpoint is solving through flexible human resources.

Butt explained that when it comes to clients, “what they’re talking to me about is implementation.” It’s one thing to buy a contract lifecycle management solution, it’s another to set it up to serve the client’s needs. Some CLM options provide a bunch of data the client doesn’t need. Others don’t provide the data it does need. Ironically, one of the most difficult options is when a vendor provides a blank slate and asks the client what they want. That seems the most accommodating, but lawyers are better editors than creators and they’re definitely not natural engineers — they could use a good jump start. A&O’s bringing the expertise to bridge the gap between the product and the client’s ideal implementation with people who’ve implemented this stuff for years.

Clients don’t have to use all three of these prongs… but they’re all right there for the taking.

We may be in 2022, but that doesn’t mean the Biglaw bonus news is done for the year! And the firm of Irell & Manella made its associates extra happy before 2021 ended.

In 2020, Irell made $132,903,000 in gross revenue making it #183 on the Am Law 200. And the firm has elected to share the wealth with its hardworking associates. Not only are they matching the year-end and special bonuses that have become the industry standard, they are coming over the top with “good year” bonuses, all helpfully spelled out in a chart:

Class	Market December Bonus (base market plus 20% market “special”)	Irell Additional Good Year December Bonus	Total Irell December 2021
Bonus

New Associate (pro-rated for start date)	$15,000 – N/A
 

$24,000 – 2020 class rate applied

$15,000	$39,000 (pro-rated)
1st year (2020)	$24,000	$15,000	$39,000
2nd year (2019)	$36,000	$15,000	$51,000
3rd year (2018)	$69,000	$20,000	$89,000
4th year (2017)	$90,000	$20,000	$110,000
5th year (2016)	$108,000	$20,000	$128,000
6th year (2015)	$126,000	$30,000	$156,000
7th year (2014)	$138,000	$30,000	$168,000
 

Bonuses were paid out on December 23rd, meaning it was a very happy holiday indeed.

You can read the full memo on [the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/irell-bonuses-21/2/).

The morning air is getting brisk and summer officially ends in two days. Another thing that’s ending is Biglaw firms’ hopes and dreams of getting associates and staff back into their offices before the new year begins. Thanks to the continued assault of the coronavirus crisis, many of the nation’s most prestigious law firms have delayed their reopenings numerous times.

But how many postponements does it take for a firm to realize that it may not be safe or wise to reopen in full in 2021?

For Holland & Knight — a firm that brought in $1,044,337,000 gross revenue in 2020 and recently [completed a merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-firms-to-merge-miss-ultimate-in-branding-opportunity/) with Thompson & Knight — the third time seems to have been the charm.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Last week, on September 15, the firm sent out a memo (available in full on the next page) concerning its decision to forgo bringing employees back to the office this year. Here’s a relevant excerpt from the memo:

In May, we believed that a return date following Labor Day for our domestic offices would be appropriate as the pandemic seemed to be waning. During the summer, however, the rise of the Delta variant and increasing infections led us to announce that the return date would be delayed to October 12. …

Given the current circumstances and the outlook for the next few months, the Firm has decided to postpone the October 12 return date for our domestic offices. We will continue to evaluate when to move forward, and plan to provide at least 30 days’ notice of a new return date for our U.S. offices. At this time, it appears unlikely that a full reopening date would occur earlier than January, 2022.

Holland & Knight joins Cahill, Cooley, Perkins Coie, Sanford Heisler, and Willkie in giving up its return-to-office plans in 2021. For those who do wish to return to the office in some fashion, there are rules, including  a vaccine mandate:

- As of August 30, personnel must have provided proof of partial vaccination status to be present in the office. As of October 12, personnel must have provided proof of full vaccination status to be present in the office.
- Personnel should not visit the office if they recently had or currently have COVID-19 symptoms.
- Personnel are “strongly discouraged” from planning or attending firm events and meetings with more than 10 guests.

There was a desire on my part to continue a very active practice and do so unencumbered by institutional requirements that ran contrary to that. When you add in the respect and affection I have for people here [at Mayer Brown] from prior experiences, it was a relatively easy decision.

—Jim Schell, now a partner at Mayer Brown, [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/01/06/with-skaddens-retirement-policy-looming-partner-moves-to-mayer-brown/) that part of the reason he lateraled from Skadden — a firm he practiced at for over 30 years — was a desire to practice after 70, Skadden’s mandatory retirement age. He also said that at Mayer Brown, “I wouldn’t have to worry about a ‘time for you to go’ business model. I want to be active, I have been active, and this was an ideal home for me to continue to do that.”

We have some tragic news to report from Australia, where an accomplished Biglaw associate recently died by suicide.

According to the [Australian Financial Review](https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/death-of-baker-mckenzie-associate-rocks-law-firm-20240410-p5fiu7), in late March, an unnamed associate at Baker McKenzie took their own life, and colleagues attended the funeral this week. News of the associate’s suicide comes during a time of renewed interest in mental health and well-being assistance for attorneys in the wake of the death of a Pinsent Masons partner who was overworked and [suffered from an “acute mental health crisis.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/biglaw-partner-suffered-from-acute-mental-health-crisis-before-her-tragic-death/)

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[Ann-Marie Allgrove](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/a/allgrove-annemarie), managing partner of Baker McKenzie’s Australian offices, offered a statement on the associate’s passing, per the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13299463/Baker-McKenzie-lawyer-dies-taking-life-Sydney.html):

‘We are devastated for their family and friends, and have extended our deepest sympathies and support at this very challenging time.

‘The firm and all who knew them are deeply mourning this loss.

‘We have provided onsite support for our staff in the Sydney office and engaged our Employee Assistance Program provider for additional support across all three of our Australian offices.’

We here at Above the Law extend our condolences to this associate’s family, friends, and colleagues during this extremely difficult time.

If you or someone you know is depressed and in need help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ([1-800-273-8255](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)) or a [lawyer assistance program](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state.html) in your state (don’t be fooled by the name; these programs also provide services to law students). Remember that you are loved, so please reach out if you need assistance.

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries, But That Doesn't Mean Everyone Is Happy
## Check out the update to our story -- some associates ARE happy.

The good news for associates at Schulte Roth is that the firm has moved — and relatively quickly — to increase associate compensation, both base salaries and special bonuses. They’ll now be paying associates in line with the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale that’s become all the rage at the biggest and best law firms.

Associate compensation at Schulte will now range between $190,000 and $350,000, depending on seniority. And special bonuses will run from $5,000 – $25,000:

But it’s the bonuses that are causing consternation among many associates at the firm. Schulte has taken the route of linking the money to mid-year bonus targets. And tipsters are letting us know their feelings about it:

As usual, they take the insanely cheap route re: bonuses. And a new twist, anyone who’s taken a vacation in the early part of the year gets screwed.

Schulte’s announcement noted that while associates have to meet 90 percent of their annualized target hours through June 30th to get the bonus, at year-end if an associate that did not previously qualify for the bonus meets their annual target they’ll get the special bonus amount added to the end of the year bonus. Which seems pretty reasonable. But sources at the firm reveal meeting the billable targets at all is an uphill battle for a lot of practice groups:

In case this isn’t known, most departments at the firm never get their associates close to the year end billable requirement. It’s also been a very slow year and with a 200 hour cap on all pro bono, firm promotion, and recruitment activity, this just isn’t happening for nearly everyone. We already have an attrition problem. This won’t help.

It’s hard to bill when the work isn’t there.

UPDATE: We’ve heard from more associates at the firm, and some folks are pretty happy with the firm:

I realize that you’re working with the tips that you get, but I think that some of the comments you received from tipsters were a bit off base.  I’m a 5th year associate at SRZ, and I can tell you that while some people have difficulty meeting those hours targets, plenty of us are super busy and appreciate that the firm came through on this.

Bonuses have always been tied to the same annual requirement for 20+ years.  Everyone knows the deal regarding target hours, people who are pissed about it either can’t get better jobs or are just bitter. Those of us billing heavily  don’t get to leave at 5 often or have weekends free, and we appreciate the bonuses.  I’m not going to speak for everyone, but the firm struck a good balance in my opinion.

It’s true, disgruntled associates definitely reach out to Above the Law more than happy ones. But this post seems to have touched a nerve:

In short, this is why we cannot have nice things. The bonus policy is more than fair. It allows you to use “Target A” non-billable hours toward the requirement, and even sets the threshold at 90 of pro rated target to account for people who have taken time off or had an uneven schedule (which I consider not only fair, but generous). Schulte also trues up anyone who makes target by year end. I can also tell you that, generally speaking based on my group and those I have spoken to in most other groups, the firm is busy and having one of the busier first halves of the year than I’ve seen in the past. Of course not everyone is on target, but perhaps disgruntled people should look inward at why they have less work instead of blaming the firm.

‘We love our firm!’

The summer of 2022 was pretty exciting for summer associates — and not just because they were able to spend more time in the office in our “post”-pandemic world. Of course, law students who received offers of permanent employment knew that they’d be making bank after graduation, with [starting salaries of $215,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) at firms that matched the Cravath scale. But money wasn’t the only thing summer associates were satisfied with. According to a new survey from the American Lawyer, they were quite happy with just about everything having to do with their experiences.

What matters most to summer associates, and which firms did they like best?

The majority of law firms in our survey of 5,485 summer associates scored above 4.5 out of 5 after we asked summers to give firms marks on partner access and mentorship, interactions with other associates, interesting legal work, and firms’ alignment with their own stated goals and self-image.

Before we get to the rankings, let’s discuss the methodology used by American Lawyer. Firms were ranked by their average scores based on the following categories: partner access and mentorship, interactions with other associates, interesting legal work, firms’ alignment with their own stated goals and self-image, and whether summers were concerned with their mental health or well-being as an attorney.

Without further ado, here are the Top 10 firms:

1. Blank Rome: Average score 5.000
1. Duane Morris: Average score 5.000
3. Kramer Levin: Average score 4.993
4. Paul Hastings: Average score 4.980
5. O’Melveny & Myers: Average score 4.977
6. Stroock: Average score 4.956
7. Allen & Overy: Average score 4.944
8. Day Pitney: Average score 4.935
9. Proskauer Rose: Average score 4.929
10. Akin Gump: Average score 4.915

This year, what was the most important to summers, aside from work-life balance? Mental health. Thanks to Am Law’s inclusion of a ranking on that subject, we now know that about half of summer associates surveyed are concerned about their mental health, and their emotional well-being. Here’s some additional detail from the American Lawyer:

About half of summer associates said they were concerned about mental health in the legal profession, and those who voiced concerns said students and professors at their law schools talk about the grueling nature of Big Law. “I have been told by many in the area of Big Law and by my professors that Big Law is extremely mentally taxing, demanding, high-pressure, and time consuming,” said a summer associate at DLA Piper. “I understand this and have come to terms with it.”

However, those with existing mental health issues worried how they would deal with law firm life. “I have a history of mental health challenges, and I think this profession in general rewards overworking, lack of balance and drawing boundaries between personal and professional life,” said one Foley & Lardner summer associate. “I am also aware of the staggering statistics of suicide and depression among lawyers.”

Others had specific concerns about not fitting in with the culture at their firms and others. “As a woman of color, it is my hope that I am encouraged to prioritize my mental health, as this is a new space to be in and takes time to adjust,” said one summer associate.

On a positive note, Am Law revealed that about three-quarters of summers said they felt their firms genuinely cared about mental health. Are things finally changing for the better in Biglaw? Considering the fact that these altruistic Gen Z summers ranked “helping people” just behind “high compensation” in their reasons for becoming lawyers, that change better come quickly.

Congratulations to all of the firms that earned the respect and appreciation of their summer associates.

To me, law firms are their people. And you have to take care of your people, particularly in moments of crisis. Supporting your lawyers is supporting your clients.

— Casey Ryan, Reed Smith’s head of legal personnel, commenting on the [importance of law firms investing heavily into mental health](https://www.law.com/2020/05/12/amid-the-pandemic-these-law-firms-are-sticking-with-their-mental-health-programs/). Reed Smith has expanded upon its mental health initiatives during the coronavirus pandemic, noting that it’s imperative for law firms to help their attorneys and staff in their time of need.

For those smart — and lucky — enough to land federal clerkships, things just got a little sweeter. Yes, you’ve already unlocked a major legal industry achievement, and now your chances of making bank have gone up.

Today, litigation firm Robins Kaplan announced a $100,000 federal clerkship bonus to those who have done at least a one-year district court or appellate federal clerkship. Partner and Recruiting Chair Patrick M. Arenz says it’s to recruit the best of the best to the firm:

“This bonus program reflects our commitment to recruiting the best of the best,” says Partner and Recruiting Chair Patrick M. Arenz. “Those who want to become the next generation of elite trial lawyers: excellent writers, charismatic storytellers, and resilient advocates.” Robins Kaplan will also offer credit towards partnership consideration for eligible clerkships.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While firm chair Ronald J. Schutz says the bonuses are in line with the firm’s overall mission:

“We want lawyers who won’t settle for mediocrity and who strive for the extraordinary,” says Partner and Chair of the Executive Board Ronald J. Schutz. “The Firm believes that many federal law clerks have demonstrated a track record of success and accomplishment, and we want to invite them to apply to join our ranks if they want to become high-stakes trial lawyers.”

It’s not the very top of clerkship bonuses — [that honor goes to](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/boutique-law-firm-dovel-luner-wows-with-mega-clerkship-bonuses-that-beat-the-market/?rf=1) California plaintiffs firm Dovel & Luner who offer a jaw-dropping $140,000 as a clerkship bonus. And Quinn Emanuel has a slightly higher [clerkship bonus of $105,000,](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/which-biglaw-firm-is-now-offering-105k-clerkship-bonuses/) [as does](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/another-firm-is-ponying-up-105k-in-clerkship-bonuses/) boutique Hueston Hennigan. And Fish & Richardson made headlines with an [impressive number to former clerks](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/april-brings-showers-of-115k-bonuses-for-federal-clerks/) ($115,000), but that only applies to folks with Federal Circuit experience and it requires two years of service as a clerk. But considering most Biglaw clerkship bonuses are around $50,000, that’s still a huge bonus.

Are there any other firms that are ready to make the move on clerkship bonuses? If you have information about any firm’s clerkship bonuses, you should [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Clerkship%20Bonuses) or text us (646-820-8477) with all the details. Thanks!

# Lexis Unveils New Agreement Analysis Tool
## New AI-driven tool takes aim at the most time-consuming pain point in transactional work.

As a fresh-faced summer associate, I remember one of my firm’s senior transactional partners telling the assembled class that practicing law isn’t like anything we’d done before. “Plagiarism is you friend!” he declared. It hit the ears of overachieving students like a lead pipe. No one had ever spoken warmly of the p-word before. But for a global corporate practice sitting on an internal database of prior mega deals, he wanted the team to understand that we weren’t meant to reinvent the wheel, we were meant to draw upon the firm’s amassed wisdom.

This episode stuck with me even though I went into litigation. Drafting agreements reminded me of building an elegant puzzle, scouring time-tested language to find the wording that best fit the deal at hand while getting yelled at by 24-year-old frat bros from Lehman Brothers. But it still required a strong internal database and the time and energy to parse through it all looking for the perfect jigsaw piece.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In July, Lexis+ users will get a new tool aimed at speeding up that process with [Agreement Analysis](https://cert-www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-plus/agreement-analysis.page).

Agreement Analysis uses AI to extract and recommend alternate clause language from seven million clauses publicly filed in SEC EDGAR documents, and from Practical Guidance sample clauses, templates and agreements. From there, attorneys can quickly compare alternate language for the most highly negotiated clauses in their document, and leverage drafting guidance and insights from Practical Guidance and benchmarking data points from Market Standards, to effectively customize clauses for a transaction.

Everyone is focused on generative AI as the hot new thing, but extractive AI still has its uses. The robots don’t need to write new clauses, they just need to find the right language that humans already wrote. Then rewrote. Then fought about at 3 in the morning. Then rewrote. Then threatened to walk out over. Then rewrote. Then returned to the original wording.

At launch, the tool focuses on M&A, stock purchase agreements, and asset agreements.

The user interface is straightforward. Drag the agreement over for analysis and the system detects key features and breaks down the draft into its constituent parts.



From here, the user can go point-by-point through the agreement. For every existing clause, the AI-driven tool will search both the database of nearly 7 million EDGAR filings and Lexis’s internal Practical Guidance to provide alternative wordings that the user can draw from. The algorithm is designed to provide diverse alternatives so the user isn’t getting 13 carbon copies of the same language, allowing the lawyer to see true variations.



A filtering process gives the lawyer more control over the suggestions. Limit the search to agreements involving specific firms or have it produce only options deemed “pro-buyer” language.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A different window allows an attorney to recraft the language directly within the Agreement Analysis. Or not an attorney… contract management folks do this work too without being attorneys.



After playing with the language, the user can copy and paste it back into the Word original — no changes can be made directly within Lexis to avoid all the risks that could create.

Plagiarism is still, in fact, a transactional attorney’s friend. This seems like a much more efficient way to find and evaluate the model language that best fits the client’s specific deal than reading 300 old agreements kicking around the document management system hoping to strike gold.

# Associate Compensation Scorecard: Biglaw's 2022 Bonus Bash

Since we broke the news of the market bonus scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was started by [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/) on Monday, November 21, 2022, and finally followed by [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cravath-bonuses-22/) on Monday, November 29, 2022 — firms are slowly falling in line to match the scale. When will your firm announce its bonuses?

As usual, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have already matched the new bonus scale, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if available), and the date those bonuses will be paid. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will update this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as firms announce bonus news. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, [tell us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus%20Scorecard%20Correction).

Help us help you now (and if/when you decide to make a lateral move in the future). Let us know what your firm’s minimum billable hours targets are for bonus eligibility and when your firm will pay those bonuses. You generally must remain at your firm until the payout date to receive them, as stated in most memos, which could make it all the more difficult for you to leave your job.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

Say so long to your summer associate job?

Because we are discussing mergers, there might be a situation where we don’t have [a summer program]. We wanted to give them as much of a heads up as we could and tell them that we will give you all the help we can… We know other firms that are looking for potential summer clerks and we can revert you to them. It’s not a warning, it’s a notice.

Some have pulled back [their summer programs] and others have canceled entirely.

# By Any Metric, These Firms Really Should Have Raised Associate Compensation By Now
## Behold: the Biglaw list of shame!

Ever since Milbank [shocked the Biglaw world on June 4th](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) by raising associates salaries, the rest of Biglaw has been wondering, when’s my turn?

A good chunk of the top of the Biglaw ranks have already moved base associate compensation (often with special bonuses) to match the prevailing standard. This raise cycle, firms have been slower than in 2016 to grant their associates raises, but by and large, the best of Biglaw seems to be getting in line.

Which makes the firms that haven’t bumped associate salary stand out even more.

Below we’ve compiled a list of the notable absences from our list of firms that have raised salaries. These firms are among the best of the best — [over a billion in revenue, Top 50 in profitability or Top 50 in Profits Per Partner](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100/) — that are leaving their associates hanging. While many speculate that market forces will force them to raise by the time of on-campus recruiting (lest they fall behind in that area), as of today, associates are left wondering: Where’s my money?

Firms With Over $1 Billion In Gross Revenue With No Associate Raises

# Staying Competitive: Law Firm Trends For 2016 And What We Might See In 2017

If you want to stay ahead of the game in the cutthroat law firm market, it’s crucial to keep an eye on what your competition is doing. The only effective way to do that is with the help of real-time business intelligence — information on what law firms are doing today and what you expect them to do tomorrow.

The folks at Thomson Reuters have developed a tool that makes monitoring your competition easy. With the help of the comprehensive data generated by [Peer Monitor](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/315186124;143088862;g), they shared useful insights into the biggest law firm trends of 2016 and an idea of what we might see next year.

Demand for Services

To date, 2016 has seen no uptick in the demand for services from last year. Demand performance — the overall appetite clients have for law firm billable hours — has remained flat. While certain periods saw an increase in demand, that was counterbalanced by a contraction during other periods, resulting in a year that, overall, saw no increased demand for law firm services.

This comes as no surprise, as demand performance has been flat for the last few years. There’s no reason to expect 2017 to be any different. Rather than rising, demand could contract next year, owing to companies’ growing desire to bring work in-house and the increasing reliance on alternative legal service providers.

So, how can firms remain successful in the face of stagnant demand? The answer is in adaptability. Traditional billing models are on the way out. Firms need to implement alternative billing arrangements and alter billing models to meet client preferences.

To that end, firms have shown increased willingness to negotiate and offer discounts off standard rates. In fact, the gap between standard and billed rates has tripled in the last 10 years and will likely continue to grow. There’s a logical reason for that: clients may be willing to pay a slightly higher rate if they feel the rate they’re being charged represents a healthy discount in the hourly rate.

Rates

Let’s be honest — the bottom line is what matters most when you’re trying to run a successful law firm. It’s not surprising, then, that firms try to raise their rates whenever they can.

That strategy, to a degree, has been successful. Rate growth is what has driven law firm profitability over the past decade. So far this year, the average firm has been able to negotiate a 2.9 percent increase in the average worked rate, and 2017 is likely to be much of the same, with a likely rate increase of 2.5 to 3 percent.

Relying on rate increases for profitability, however, is a dangerous proposition, especially as clients increasingly push back against high hourly rates and exorbitant legal bills.

Where does this leave law firms? While rates may continue to rise in the short term, firms need to innovate around their workflows to increase margins even if rates stagnate. Often, this means making strategic decisions about staffing and growing the firm.

Law Firm Growth

Despite unchanged demand for services, law firms continue to hire. This has led to decreased per-attorney productivity, which was down about 2 percent in 2016, a decline which is likely to continue. The average attorney in 2016 is on pace to bill 144 fewer hours per year than a decade ago.

In response, firms may increase their billable-hour minimums, especially after this year’s salary bumps, but that doesn’t offer a real solution. Since there’s no indication that demand will explode any time soon, firms will continue to struggle with overcapacity.

The focus, then, needs to be on strategic staffing. While halting hiring altogether is problematic and will lead to staffing gaps down the road, it’s critical for firms to understand why they’re hiring when they are. Rather than continuing to hire across the board, hiring should target particular practices or geographic areas where growth is expected, or certain experience levels where there’s need. The overarching goal is to have a good succession plan in place — hiring the right people now to run your firm in the future. This may mean taking a short-term hit in productivity in exchange for long-term profitability.

How [Peer Monitor](http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/peer-monitor?trkcode=726258I63249&trktype=external) Can Help

Firms need to implement a strategic vision aimed at increasing long-term profitability. In a flat market, most growth comes from shifting market share.  The only way to remain profitable is to keep up with, if not surpass, your competition. And the best way to stay on top is by monitoring what your competitors are doing right now.

Unlike much of the law firm intelligence that’s available, the data from [Peer Monitor](http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/peer-monitor?trkcode=726258I63249&trktype=external) isn’t sanitized — it’s actual data from law firms’ accounting systems used for their own metrics. That means it’s not selectively self-reported and doesn’t come with the reporting biases that you see in a lot of surveys. [Peer Monitor](http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/peer-monitor?trkcode=726258I63249&trktype=external) tells you exactly what the average law firm is experiencing.

Whether you’re looking at demand, rates, profitability, or productivity, [Peer Monitor](http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/peer-monitor?trkcode=726258I63249&trktype=external) provides up-to-date data to help you make strategic decisions for the future of your firm. With competitive, real-time legal benchmarking at your fingertips, you’ll always be one step ahead of the game.

# Vault 100 Rankings: The Most Prestigious Law Firms In America (2023)
## Money continues to matter most for Biglaw associates.

What do associates at major law firms care about more than money? Prestige, of course. But, at the end of the day, sometimes being a leader when it comes to compensation is enough to boost a firm’s prestige. As luck would have it, the closely watched Vault 100 rankings are here to remind lawyers at the nation’s largest law firms about exactly which ones are considered the most prestigious.

Members of the legal community were worried that the Vault rankings would perhaps have less of an impact in the wake of the site’s [takeover by Firsthand](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/vault-home-to-law-firm-prestige-rankings-becomes-firsthand-subsite-which-says-job-seekers-dont-care-about-prestige/), but it looks like the rankings are still going strong.

To that end, in last year’s Vault 100 rankings, Cravath — the firm that brought the associate salary scale [all the way up to $415,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) back in February — managed to retain its number 1 spot, while Wachtell Lipton reclaimed second place after being edged out by Skadden for the first time in the history of the Vault rankings. But was Cravath able to keep its cachet as the most prestigious Biglaw firm in the country in this year’s Vault rankings?

Of course it was. Here’s what Travis Whitsitt, Vault’s law editor, had to say about Cravath’s placement in the latest rankings: “Cravath is the standard against which all other firms measure themselves, with the firm securely atop the Vault Law 100 year after year and also within the top 10 of multiple practice area rankings. Cravath moves, and other firms follow. The firm has established industry standards on hiring and compensation for years, and even when it isn’t the first to move, Cravath’s decision to join influences the market—as with this year’s compensation and special bonus announcements. After all, every associate is well aware of the meaning of the term ‘Cravath scale.'”

Cravath continues to remain the namesake for salaries because of its prestigious pull, with survey respondents referring to the firm as an “industry trend setter” and a “compensation leader.”

Although Cravath stayed on top, this year, there was some movement when it came to the Top 10 in the Vault rankings. Here are the Top 10 Most Prestigious Law Firms based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2023:

- Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
- Davis Polk & Wardwell
- Latham & Watkins
- Sullivan & Cromwell
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
- Gibson Dunn & Crutcher
This is the fifth year in a row that these firms have been in the Top 10, but as you can see, there were some fluctuations in rank among them. Davis Polk — which has become known for its big-money raises and bonuses in recent years — gained three places and moved into the No. 4 spot (up from No. 7 last year), with SullCrom and Kirkland losing ground behind it (down two spots and one spot, respectively). Just outside the Top 10, at No. 11, we find Milbank, the firm that kicked off the 2022 salary wars and made a double-digit leap in the Vault rankings because of it (up from No. 23 last year).

Data science is increasingly forming the backbone of many litigation strategies — and while many were initially wary of this strange new entrant into the legal realm, delayed adoption of data science and the valuable trends and quick results it brings can lead to costly, risky mistakes.

Join our expert panelists for a 60-minute, 1.0 CLE eligible webinar, Differentiate with Data Science: A Guide for Litigators, for the latest guidance to:

- Understand recent trends in data science in recent litigation – with an emphasis on scenarios and cases where data science played a critical role.
- Evaluate the data scientists role within a legal organization to maximize ROI from analysis and modeling capabilities
- See broad applications of data science in litigation across a range of practice areas, from labor & employment, to privacy & data security, M&A, health law, and more.

# The Looming Threat For Law Firms

Ten years on, we think law firms face a different kind of threat [than the 2008 recession]. The recession was a ‘known’ event (albeit severe) to be endured and managed — as law firms have done in prior economic downturns. The threat in 2018 is broader and more nuanced, arising primarily from the sweeping force of technology evolution over the last two decades that has resulted in the commoditization and commercialization of more and more legal services. This new threat wasn’t caused by the recession, but the recession was clearly an accelerant.

—From the 10th annual Altman Weil [Law Firms In Transition survey](http://www.altmanweil.com/LFiT2018), detailing the pressure firms face from technology. The survey also posits most firms have a “false sense of security” and a “mis-direction of focus” when it comes to dealing with these challenges.

# The Cross-Selling Conundrum

Let’s start by thinking about a partner at a law firm.

A long-time, valued client calls and says, “We have a big new intellectual property matter in LA.  Does your firm have anyone who can help?”

What’s the correct response?  Perhaps the partner, being a team player, gives what the firm perceives as the preferred response:  “You’re in luck!  We have one of the world’s finest IP partners in LA!  Let me get back to you in a half hour with his name.”  The partner hangs up the phone and then sends out an email to “all partners”:  “Do we have anyone in LA who does IP work?”

Or perhaps the partner isn’t that much of a team player.  Suppose the partner is more — what’s the word?  Self-preserving?  Client-focused?  Honest?  This partner tells her valued client:  “I’ve worked with our IP partners in LA, and I can’t honestly recommend any of them to you.  Let me poke around and find you a decent referral outside our firm.”

This raises a few questions.

First, which of these two answers is best for the law firm?  I can almost hear my hypothetical managing partner bellowing, “Cross-sell!  Cross-sell!  It’s virtually impossible to bring new clients into the firm, and the road to riches requires cross-selling!”

But what if the honest partner is right?  The IP characters in LA are a bunch of bumbling fools.  Cross-selling to those clowns would ultimately frustrate a long-time client and threaten the existing client relationship.  Isn’t the honest partner doing not just herself, but also the firm, a favor by giving the client helpful advice and avoiding a future client-relations nightmare?  Maybe cross-selling isn’t always the road to riches.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Change your focus from a single law firm to one of those consortiums of smaller law firms that have grouped together to be able to provide services across the globe through “member firms.”  Do the partners at one of those firms really know anything about the partners at the others — other than that they’re duty-bound to cross-sell to each other?  (That question is actually less rhetorical than it sounds. Perhaps those consortiums actually do a fair amount of due diligence about their members and are not cross-selling beyond the limits of their knowledge.  I have no idea.)

Change your focus again, to any professional services firm.  Should a partner at an accounting firm cross-sell services that would be provided by someone with suspect abilities?  An investment bank?  A firm of investigators with offices around the world, some strong and others weak?

The folks who runs those types of places may fervently believe that aggressive cross-selling is in the firms’ best interest, and that may be absolutely wrong.

Finally, think about assigning lawyers to handle matters in-house.  All in-house lawyers are not created equal.  If you want business people to trust the law department, you must assign lawyers to tasks carefully.  And remember that there’s no need to cross-sell in the in-house environment:  If you’re launching an IP initiative and don’t have an in-house lawyer who’s up to the task, don’t fake it.  Hire outside counsel; explain to finance and the business that there’s an unmet need that requires hiring a new in-house lawyer; pick up a consultant on a part-time basis.

One of the glories of in-house work is that you’re no longer explicitly selling (or cross-selling) your services any more.  (I used the word “explicitly” for a reason.  In any business environment, you’re always selling yourself implicitly, in the sense that you’re the best advertisement for yourself.  If you’re no good, you’ll have no repeat customers, and that’s not great for advancing your career.)

Folks at professional services firms must wrestle with their consciences as they decide whether to cross-sell.  In-house lawyers on the receiving end of a cross-sale pitch must be sensitive to the seller’s conflicting interests.  And in-house lawyers who are supporting corporate clients are largely relieved of these pressures entirely.

We have some incredibly unfortunate news to report from across the pond, where the results of an investigation into the death of a young Biglaw partner have been released.

Vanessa Ford, 47, was a partner at Pinsent Masons, a highly ranked Biglaw firm in the Global 200. Ford had reportedly been working 18-hour days and even working on holidays in the lead up to the sale of the Everton Football Club to a U.S. private equity firm. Her husband, Oliver, said she was wracked with guilt over missing time with her two children. Ford died tragically a little more than a week after the deal closed.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
[Assistant coroner Ian] Potter concluded that Ford was suffering an “acute mental health crisis” and had consumed a “significant” amount of alcohol when she fell onto a railway line in east London and was struck by a train on Sept. 23. But he said he would not record a conclusion of suicide because he could not determine whether she intended to take her own life.

“There is clear evidence to suggest that, at some point shortly before going to the bridge, Vanessa was experiencing some form of mental health crisis and the levels of alcohol that she had consumed, taken together, would have affected her reasoning and her ability to make properly thought-out decisions,” Potter said as he recorded a narrative verdict.

“To that end, I conclude that she did not die by suicide,” he added.

According to British Transport Police detective Stephen Gadd, before her death, Ford left a note at home that expressed “a degree of helplessness.” Shortly before her death, she made a call to a mental health professional discussing her depression and alcohol consumption, but was unable to get an appointment.

Matt Morgan, her manager at the firm, said that Ford hadn’t raised any issues related to stress or work-life balance, and that she was aware of the firm’s mental health helpline. “Nobody had any concerns around the pressure that Vanessa was under because of [the Everton deal],” he said. “She was very positive … she was very proud of the work she had done.”

Laura Cameron, managing partner at Pinsent Masons LLP, said that Ford was “deeply missed.”

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 09.24.18
## * The Senate Judiciary Committee has reached a tentative deal with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as to when she will testify about her allegations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. The showdown is expected to go down on Thursday, pending any last-minute changes. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/22/us/politics/kavanaugh-senate-blasey-ford-testify.html)] * Judge Kavanaugh dug up calendars from the summer of 1982 to corroborate his denials of Dr. Ford's allegations. He apparently kept detailed entries as a teen, listing events like ""go to [Mark] Judge's,"" but ""drunk sexual assault fun time"" is nowhere to be found. So convenient! [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/us/politics/kavanaugh-senate-calendar.html)] * And now, a second woman has come forward to accuse Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct -- this time, during his drunken college years. Meet Deborah Ramirez, who says that when they were Yale freshmen, Kavanaugh shoved his penis in her face and as she pushed him away, caused her to touch it without her consent. [[New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez)] * Professor [Amy Chua claims](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/more-from-professor-amy-chua-about-her-clerkship-counseling/) that everything current and former Yale Law students are saying about her [Kavanaugh clerkship coaching](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/yale-law-students-protest-referring-to-school-as-model-of-complicity-when-it-comes-to-sexual-harassment/) is ""outrageous"" and ""100% false."" Perhaps unsurprisingly, those Yale Law students say Chua is lying. [[HuffPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yale-students-to-prof-who-denies-coaching-kavanaugh-clerks-youre-lying_us_5ba685dde4b069d5f9d369e6)] * ""I am resigning from the firm, effective immediately."" It may seem like former federal prosecutor Michael Bromwich quit his job as senior counsel at Robbins Russell after objections were raised by partners to his joining Dr. Ford's legal team, but they made a mutual agreement months ago about parting ways. His representation of Dr. Ford merely ""accelerated"" the departure. [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2018/09/22/veteran-prosecutor-michael-bromwich-joins-kavanagh-accusers-legal-team/)] * Will President Trump fire Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein over his reported comments about [wearing a wire](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/rod-rosenstein-offered-to-wear-a-wire-to-record-trump-according-to-the-new-york-times/) before the midterms and Kavanaugh's prospective confirmation? Trump's GOP allies want him to wait before anything else gets muddled. [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/23/politics/donald-trump-rod-rosenstein-brett-kavanaugh/index.html)]

He apparently kept detailed entries as a teen, listing events like “go to [Mark] Judge’s,” but “drunk sexual assault fun time” is nowhere to be found. So convenient!

* And now, a second woman has come forward to accuse Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct — this time, during his drunken college years. Meet Deborah Ramirez, who says that when they were Yale freshmen, Kavanaugh shoved his penis in her face and as she pushed him away, caused her to touch it without her consent. [[New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez)]


* Professor [Amy Chua claims](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/more-from-professor-amy-chua-about-her-clerkship-counseling/) that everything current and former Yale Law students are saying about her [Kavanaugh clerkship coaching](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/yale-law-students-protest-referring-to-school-as-model-of-complicity-when-it-comes-to-sexual-harassment/) is “outrageous” and “100% false.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, those Yale Law students say Chua is lying. [[HuffPost](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yale-students-to-prof-who-denies-coaching-kavanaugh-clerks-youre-lying_us_5ba685dde4b069d5f9d369e6)]

* “I am resigning from the firm, effective immediately.” It may seem like former federal prosecutor Michael Bromwich quit his job as senior counsel at Robbins Russell after objections were raised by partners to his joining Dr. Ford’s legal team, but they made a mutual agreement months ago about parting ways. His representation of Dr. Ford merely “accelerated” the departure. [[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2018/09/22/veteran-prosecutor-michael-bromwich-joins-kavanagh-accusers-legal-team/)]

# Pyrrhic Victory Or Not, O'Melveny Wants Their $139 Million
## It may have been more cost effective for everyone to settle this over a game of rock-paper-scissors.

Traditionally, law schools acted as the training ground for trial attorneys. Do you really need to know the rules of evidence if you’re going into transactional work? No, but tradition is tradition. Over time, more non-traditional classes have been added to curricula acknowledging that not all law school graduates go on to do their best Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law impersonations.

Mediation has been a significant addition to the law student repertoire. One of the big selling points of mediation is that it helps the parties recognize that court may not be the best solution to their problems; the process is costly, takes a lot of time, and you may discover that the damages you end up being awarded are nowhere near what you expected at the onset. Take, for example, an antitrust case between American Airlines and Sabre. From [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/after-1-american-airlines-antitrust-win-omelveny-wants-139-million-legal-fees-2023-06-26/):

Law firm O’Melveny & Myers has asked a Manhattan federal judge to award more than $139 million in legal fees to American Airlines after its $1 trial victory in a case accusing flight booking company Sabre of anticompetitive practices.
O’Melveny attorneys said in a filing on Friday that the court win last year “was the culmination of a risky, hard-fought, decade-long battle.” Neither side appealed the verdict.

[S]abre lost its bid to block O’Melveny from seeking any fees at all. Sabre had argued American Airlines was not entitled to millions of dollars in legal fees after winning $1 in nominal damages.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I’m no economist, but this reads as a very poor return on investment. And while they did their best to mitigate the justifications for why they should be on the hook for lawyer’s fees:

Sabre is expected to argue that American Airlines did not win on all of its claims and therefore should not be awarded all of its legal fees since 2011. In its filing, American Airlines’ lawyers said the lawsuit’s claims were “inextricably intertwined.” The attorneys also defended the reasonableness of their hourly rates.

I highly doubt that, after investing over a decade into this matter, the attorneys are going to walk away with nothing — especially after the attempt to block O’Melveny from getting anything failed. A verdict that returns pennies on the dollar would still be orders of magnitude higher than the dollar the case ended up paying out. Knowing when and why to resolve legal matters out of a courtroom is a difficult and expensive skill to develop — best to do it on another person’s dime. You might want to keep this case in the back of your mind when you ask yourself the question that more people should ask themselves when they are in the middle of a conflict: will the outcome really be worth my input?

# An 'Eye-Popping' Law School Price Tag To Match Biglaw's 'Eye-Popping' Salaries

It’s a pretty crazy large number. People will point out, ‘Well, there are scholarships.’ But not everyone gets very big scholarships, and very few get anything for cost of living.

— Professor [Derek Muller](https://law.uiowa.edu/people/derek-t-muller) of the University of Iowa College of Law, commenting in an interview with [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/price-law-school-hits-new-high-columbia-with-others-close-behind-2022-08-11/) on Columbia Law School’s cost of attendance for the upcoming academic year, which clocks in at $110,450, which includes $75,572 in tuition, plus living expenses and various university fees. Columbia is now the [most expensive top law school](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/itll-cost-a-pretty-penny-to-attend-this-elite-law-school/) in the country, with an estimated cost of $330,000 (or more) for a three-year degree. In that interview, Muller tied these “eye-popping” attendance fees to the most recent round of [Biglaw salary wars](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/), where compensation for an incoming associate was raised to $215,000. With that kind of money, elite law school graduates will be able to pay off their student loans.

# Trump Complained About Us In His Mistrial Motion And All We Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt

Donald Trump sought a mistrial in his New York trial based, in part, [on our articles](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/trump-moves-for-mistrial-in-ny-because-above-the-law-was-mean-to-him/) being “humorous, irreverent.” [The GOP frontrunner did not succeed](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/judge-denies-mistrial-motion-in-ny-civil-fraud-case-because-read-the-statute-you-dorks/). Ron DeSantis messed with the rights of professors and now has to [pick up the tab for their Biglaw lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/floridas-first-loss-was-from-the-teachers-the-second-was-from-the-attorneys-fees/). Or, more accurately, Florida taxpayers will pick up the tab. But that’s just the price Floridians have to pay to help their governor finish third in the primaries! We’re still waiting to see if more firms join the Milbank pay scale, but in the meantime [a host of anonymous naysayers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/the-insufferable-nonsense-biglaw-is-spouting-over-milbanks-raises/) are mouthing off to the press in a pathetic effort to dissuade the market from following suit.

# Judgment Or No Judgment? 
## I guess the Wild West still lives in Texas’ courtrooms, and let’s not even talk about gun laws there.

The Texas Commission on Judicial Performance has admonished a judge for conduct unbecoming, However, [what I read](https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/legal_profession/2022/05/an-admonishment-has-been-imposed-by-the-texas-commission-on-judicial-discipline-for-a-judges-misconduct-in-a-divorce-through.html) in the Legal Profession Blog would seem to require more than just a “bad boy, don’t do it again.” The judge’s behavior went off the rails both in the courtroom and in chambers. He was not happy with the presentation of a divorce case, which so irritated him that he slammed a book on the bench, lost his temper, using harsh and sarcastic language, abruptly announced recesses and walked off the bench.

But wait! There’s more! The judge had a lengthy discussion with one of the lawyers, ex parte, in his chambers, where he continued to rant and then switched gears, admitted to having a bad temper, that he had made a “terrible mess” of the case, and that it would have been better if the attorney “invited” into his chambers had “fussed” at him. Was that really an option?

Recusal followed and then the admonishment. In addition, the Commission ordered two hours of education. Wait, what? Do you think that a paltry two hours learning proper judicial conduct (don’t you think he’d know this stuff already?) is going to ameliorate his anger management issues? So, he showed no judgment as to his conduct on and off the bench, but at least some judgment when he [recused himself](http://www.scjc.texas.gov/media/46884/wells20-0873pub-adm-oae-42022.pdf) the next day.

And here’s another one from Texas — what is it with Texans? I guess the Wild West still lives in the state’s courtrooms, and let’s not even talk about gun laws there. In this case of judicial ineptness, the court decided that it was unhappy with not one, but two family law attorneys in different matters. Sanctions, you ask? [Would you believe shackling](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/texas-judge-is-reprimanded-following-shackling-of-two-lawyers-in-her-courtroom) (I am not making this up) both attorneys to chairs in the jury box while their separate proceedings continued?

Any judicial temperament issues here? The public reprimand from the Texas Commission on Judicial Performance whacked the judge, Barbara Stalder, [upside the head](http://scjc.texas.gov/media/46885/stalder20-0880pub-rep-42022.pdf) for “her willful and/or persistent failures to be patient, dignified and courteous towards the attorneys; willful and/or persistent disregard for their rights to be heard according to law; and willful and/or persistent conduct that is clearly inconsistent with the proper performance of her duties and that cast public discredit upon the judiciary.” No issue that she showed no judgment. Who said that “karma is a bitch?” She lost in her primary race for re-election.

Does anyone remember the movie “[Weekend at Bernie’s](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098627/)“? Bernie had been embezzling company funds and was murdered by his mob partners, but two of his employees prop him up as if he were alive to take advantage of a weekend at Bernie’s beach house to party.

A Chicago lawyer has done his own version of “Weekend at Bernie’s” by settling a case and not telling the insurance adjuster that the plaintiff had died. Whoops. And he did not tell the adjuster until it was time to sign the settlement agreement and it was the administrator of the plaintiff’s estate who was to sign. The Illinois Disciplinary Commission has filed a complaint against the attorney. No surprise about the lack of judgment. The [only surprised party](https://www.iardc.org/File/View/1497871?FileName=Complaint%3A%20In%20re%20John%20Paul%20Kolb%2C%20Matter%20Number%3A%202022PR00039) must have been the insurance adjuster.

Here’s where the snark ends. Now it’s Buffalo and Orange County, the latest in our never-ending series of mass shootings. And the 9th Circuit, in Jones v. Bonta, in a 2-1 decision, has [struck down a California law](https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/05/11/20-56174.pdf) that had denied those under 21 the right to buy automatic weapons on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional. Right or wrong judgment? At least there remains in place the California law that bans the sale of liquor to those under 21. Imagine, a kid (like the 18-year-old in Buffalo) who can not only purchase automatic weapons but, in some states, can buy booze at 18. Combine the two and what do you have? A truly scary notion, but not any scarier than what we are witnessing now.

So, as lawyers, what can we do or should do these days? Given the wide divergence of views among lawyers on various issues such as choice, gun control, immigration, gay rights, voting rights, and so on, lawyers don’t speak with one voice, even on basic constitutional issues, but we do express our views in vigorous debate that the framers envisioned centuries ago. However, I doubt if they envisioned social media and the hate that it spawns with some lawyers as willing participants.

Everyone spouts the same old platitudinous words; “thoughts and prayers” are with the grieving families both in Buffalo and the O.C. But contrast those words with the [hatred that some peeps aim](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/17202/texan-law-could-see-twitch-sued-for-removing-buffalo-shooters-stream) toward others who look different or who hold different beliefs. It’s a bubbling cauldron of vitriol that is constantly replenished. Where’s the outrage?

Think about this: next time, it could be one of your family, friends, or colleagues just going to the grocery store, a church lunch celebration, or anywhere else for that matter, someone who is merely in the wrong place at the wrong time. Many of you are too young (or were not yet born) to remember the 1993 mass shooting at the San Francisco law firm, [Pettit & Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101_California_Street_shooting). So don’t say it can’t happen to you. Although you may say that you don’t have a [dog in this fight](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/have+a+dog+in+the+fight), you do. We all do.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A typical day usually begins with reading daily tax publications. There are always many changes and developments to keep up with in tax law. It’s a challenge to stay on top of new regulations, IRS guidance, and other changes, but it also presents an opportunity for younger lawyers to know as much about a specific issue as more experienced lawyers.

Junior associates often spend a fair amount of time researching discrete issues. Although more senior lawyers spend less time on research, tax lawyers throughout their careers devote more of their time to research than lawyers in other practice areas. Despite the thousands of pages in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations, there are still a lot of unanswered questions about how the tax rules apply to any given situation. Associates at large firms may also spend time reviewing tax disclosures in securities offerings, reviewing and negotiating the tax representations and other tax-related provisions in merger or other acquisition agreements, reviewing and negotiating the tax provisions in loan agreements, or drafting tax opinions.

As tax lawyers gain experience, they usually become more involved in tax structuring for joint ventures, acquisitions, dispositions, investment funds, or financial products, and provide more expert advice directly to clients on discrete tax issues.

Tax is a speciality area that supports work across the firm, so a fair amount of time may be spent working with members of other groups, including corporate, capital markets, finance, private equity, and real estate. Junior lawyers often work with more senior lawyers in the tax group. More senior lawyers work directly with clients (generally in-house tax counsel) and in transactional work may also work with the client’s accountants. Both junior and senior tax associates negotiate directly with lawyers and in-house counsel representing the opposite side in acquisitions and other transactions.

Lawyers in this area also work with government lawyers and auditors. This includes IRS attorneys and auditors when representing clients in connection with private letter ruling requests or IRS audits. Lawyers may also communicate with tax counsel at the Treasury Department to provide comments on proposed Treasury Regulations, or to address questions under existing regulations.

- What does a common career path look like?
Large law firms with a varied tax practice are a common starting point for law school graduates interested in tax law. Some tax lawyers also study for an additional year to earn an L.L.M. in tax, either while working at a firm or before entering private practice. After gaining a few years of experience at a big firm, many lawyers in this area move on to smaller firms, accounting firms, or in-house positions.

Those lawyers who stay at big firms may find the path to partnership difficult, as tax groups tend to be smaller than other groups and tax lawyers often do not bill as many hours and generate as much revenue as lawyers in other practice areas. There may be many years when no senior tax associate makes partner at a firm. However, a non-partnership position as counsel may be a possibility for an experienced tax lawyer.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?
Work in this area can be quite varied. On any given day, a tax lawyer may work on many different matters, including structuring an acquisition, writing a tax opinion, or giving general tax advice. Compared to lawyers in other groups, a tax lawyer’s time is not usually consumed by one or more large matters.

As tax lawyers at large firms gain experience and move into partner roles, they often specialize and develop expertise in an area within tax (for example, financial products or M&A). Tax lawyers at firms with a relatively small tax department (or where there may be only one or two tax lawyers) must be able to handle any tax question and advise on any type of transaction, which is quite challenging given the complexity of tax law.

- How much wear and tear?
Although tax lawyers often have more reasonable schedules than corporate or litigation lawyers, tax practice at a law firm still involves long hours and unpredictable demands. Rush research assignments for junior lawyers are common. In some deals, such as mergers and other transactions meant to qualify for tax-free treatment, the tax stakes can be high. Mistakes in this area can be quite costly, and partners may rely on associates to review securities offerings or deal documents and identify any tax risks.

Tax is intellectually demanding, and it is difficult to keep up with constant changes and new developments. Besides handling the day-to-day client work, a tax lawyer has to be committed to spending time keeping up with changes in tax law and learning new areas.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
People who end up moving into different practice areas or exploring non-legal careers generally dislike the amount of research involved in tax and the length of time it takes to learn enough tax to really add value. They want to play a bigger role in whatever they’re working on at an earlier stage. It is also a challenge to keep up with the constant changes in tax law, and lawyers in this area must spend a fair amount of time on non-billable professional reading.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
Lawyers who stick with tax law enjoy the intellectual challenge of learning a very complex area of the law and providing expert advice that can help clients structure transactions or investments in a tax-efficient way or avoid costly mistakes. Tax law has many traps for the unwary, so an experienced tax lawyer who can steer clients away from these traps is of great value.

In a lot of transactions, tax structuring is key, so tax lawyers can play a prominent role and have a chance to be creative in devising new tax-efficient structures. Those interested in tax policy can become involved in organizations that comment on proposed Treasury Regulations and other government guidance. In doing this, they can influence the substance of final tax rules.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
Tax lawyers who don’t enjoy practicing in a firm but still enjoy tax law can move in-house to companies with their own tax departments or the need for in-house tax counsel (for example, banks, large public companies, hedge funds or private equity funds). Accounting firms with tax transactional and planning practices also provide opportunities for tax lawyers looking to leave law firm practice. Government work at the IRS, Treasury Department or a state revenue agency is another possibility. Tax lawyers with strong quantitative skills may move on to business roles at banks or investment funds.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
Transactional tax practice is subject to the same market forces that affect the broader economy. If the economy is slow, there are fewer acquisitions and joint ventures, and less need for tax structuring and tax review of deal documents. There may also be less demand for general tax advice as clients are more cost conscious. Any slowdown in financial markets will also affect tax lawyers who structure financial products or other securities, or review the tax sections of securities disclosures.

Tax practice is also affected by major legislative and regulatory changes. For example, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was enacted in response to concerns that U.S. citizens and residents were evading U.S. taxes by maintaining financial accounts outside the US. It created a lot of opportunities for lawyers and accountants to help clients understand their account reporting, withholding, and other responsibilities.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
Recent graduates who are analytical and academic generally find tax law rewarding. There is a steep learning curve, and U.S. tax laws are extremely complex and constantly changing. Even tax lawyers who have been practicing for 30 years don’t know everything there is to know about tax. For young lawyers who enjoy challenging themselves intellectually and mastering complicated subjects, tax law is a good fit.

# The Best Summer Associate Programs -- Both For Fun Times And For Training
## Summer programs have different purposes, and different firms excel at each.

It’s Biglaw right before the start of on-campus interview season, and there’s a whole lot of ranking going on. Yesterday we brought you rankings for [quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-biglaw-quality-of-life-rankings/) and for [family friendliness](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2016/) — to the extent that these things exist in Biglaw.

There’s no questioning the premise of this next ranking: a list of the best summer associate programs, based on both fun times and training. (Okay, I suppose one could question the “training” provided to summer associates — it’s hard to fit professional development into a busy schedule of [Taylor Swift concerts and trips to Italy](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/best-summer-associate-event-contest-2015-the-winner/) — but suspend your skepticism long enough to finish reading this post.)

The good folks over at Vault just issued their latest ranking of summer programs. Here are the [winners](http://www.vault.com/blog/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/2017-best-law-firms-to-work-for):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In addition to its top position as the [Best Firm to Work For](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-biglaw-quality-of-life-rankings/), O’Melveny & Myers is also the new No. 1 firm in Vault’s Best Summer Associate Program ranking, moving up one spot from its second place finish last year. Vault asked first- through third-year associates who had worked as summer associates at their current firms to rate the program both in terms of how well it prepared them for full-time practice and how much fun they had; the average of these two scores determined which firms ranked on the Best Overall Summer Associate Programs list. Former O’Melveny summer associates noted that the “summer program was amazing” and while it was “really fun,” the firm “also went out of its way to give summer associates meaningful assignments.”

Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe has been voted as having the Summer Associate Program that Best Prepares for Practice. One Orrick associate reported: “The work assignments slowly built up over the summer. They started as fairly discrete tasks, but by the end we were directly interfacing with clients and running deals and projects (under the supervision of our mentors).”

Shook, Hardy & Bacon repeats as the No. 1 firm with the Most Fun Summer Associate Program. One Shook Hardy associate told Vault: “Our summer program is simply unmatched,” adding that incorporate the program encourages “camaraderie among not only summer associates, but associates and partners alike.”

Congratulations to O’Melveny, Orrick, and Shook Hardy. But a question for Shook Hardy: will it be increasing the bacon that its summer (and full-time) associates take home? It’s [not reasonable](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/) to expect the Kansas City-based firm to adopt the [full Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), but some more modest pay hike might be in order. (Feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Shook%20Hardy) or text us (646-820-8477) with any info about SHB’s pay plans.)

And congrats to all the other law firms with top 10 summer programs, per [Vault](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-summer-associate-programs/?sRankID=270):

1. O’Melveny (up from #2)
2. Choate Hall & Stewart (up from not ranked)
3. Orrick (up from not ranked)
4. Foley Hoag (down from #1)
5. Kaye Scholer (up from #11)
6. Akin Gump (up from #10)
7. Fried Frank (up from #14)

9. Paul Hastings (down from #3)
10. Ropes & Gray (up from #15)

# Associate Bonus Watch: International Firm Matches The Field
## Fresh news about bonuses! And an important tax question...

In addition to inspiring the lame title above, Freshfields has matched Cravath’s bonus structure in a memo sent to associates yesterday.

It’s not a surprising move by any means, but it joins its Magic Circle colleague [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-no-chance-this-wasnt-going-to-happen/) (who we wrote about earlier today) in offering market bonuses. But Freshfields offers one small, but potentially significant deviation from its peer.

The firm will pay its bonuses on December 30, a couple weeks after Clifford Chance’s January 13 payout date.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
By the way, for all you tax lawyers out there: Is there a potential financial benefit to delaying bonus payouts this year? If Commandante Trump slashes 2017 taxes, is that going to significantly benefit firms that put off the payout until next year? I can imagine there are a lot of moving parts involved in a decision like this.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I look back on my return to work after my first baby and wish I had given myself more grace around the whole process.  The new routine, packing what felt like a zillion bags each morning, daycare drop off, remembering to tell the caregiver what time the baby woke up and ate, and finally making it to the office a mere four hours after waking up — felt like a job by itself.  Not to mention navigating a new body, managing meetings around my pumping schedule, and fielding questions about what it’s like to leave your baby with a stranger — it was no easy feat.

One of the things I was looking forward to, however, was diving back into my work and extra-curriculars — sitting on panels, presenting to groups, and organizing events.  But the invitations and opportunities that were too many to count before I had my child now seemed to come to a halt.  No more early morning and evening speaking opportunities or invitations to events that used to fill my calendar.

I felt this from my colleagues and organizations I routinely interacted with.  Looking back, I recognize it was very well-intentioned.  People did not want to “bother” me with evening or early morning commitments because I was probably occupied with my child.  While this may have seemed like the polite thing to do, it was very isolating.

Here are some ways you can support your co-workers and colleagues as they return to work from maternity leave.

- Ask, Ask, Ask
Instead of assuming a new mom doesn’t want the big project, the travel assignment, or the late-night event, ask her.  Removing the stigma from maternity leave and returning to work starts with candid conversations about each person’s expectations and goals.  This is such a personal thing that can’t be guessed, assumed, or derived from someone else’s experience.

Not sure what to say?  Here are some ideas:

“There’s a project coming up that requires three nights in Chicago.  Is that a project you’re comfortable taking on?  Feel free to think about it until tomorrow and let me know.”

“There’s an early morning pitch we need to make to a client next month.  Are you interested in being a part of it?  Think about it and let me know tomorrow.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Stating the project and requirements, then following it up with a question and time to formulate an answer can go a long way toward building rapport, establishing trust, and improving morale.

- Give Options
Be mindful of the many things a new mother is learning to manage when returning to work.  Things such as child care drop off and pick up and a pumping schedule require some flexibility — but are not impossible to navigate.  When possible, give options to attend part of an event or leave early if needed.  An all or nothing approach doesn’t serve anyone well, including your organization.

Not sure what to say?  Here are some ideas:

“We have an early meeting next week that starts at 8 a.m.  The important part that I’d like you here for is at 8:30 a.m.  Would that work with your schedule?”

“Are you able to represent us at this client happy hour?  If you could stay for just 30 minutes and say hi to Joe and Sally, I’d really appreciate it.”

- Be Clear
If a certain activity is not mandatory, be sure to say so.  There is immense pressure to juggle everything and having a clear idea if something is mandatory or not can go a long way to help a new mom prioritize.

Not sure what to say?  Here are some ideas:

“There’s a client dinner next week that I’d love for you to be a part of if your schedule allows but I want you to know that it’s not mandatory.”

“There’s a breakfast next week that I’d like you to take the lead on.  I think giving you the chance to shine in front of this client is important.”

Most importantly, remember that empathy and compassion go a long way.  These are not permanent adjustments that require a structural overhaul, they are simple gestures of inclusivity that make you a stronger leader and help retain great talent.

What is your worst story of Biglaw interviewing? Well, [we asked,](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/all-the-things-that-can-go-wrong-during-on-campus-interviews/) and you answered! (Yes, please, keep ’em coming!)

This interview horror story is a reminder to take care of yourself during the interview process. Yes, it’s stressful and the pressure of this once-in-a-career experience can be intense, but your health is more important. And you can wind up in the hospital if you don’t take care.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I wasn’t feeling well going into OCI. I had a sore throat and was tired. But I knew I had one shot with OCI and I wasn’t going to miss it. So I started downing Tylenol and powered through two days of intense interviewing, including dinner (with the firm I ultimately ended up going to) at the end of day 1.

By the end of the second day, I knew I was not in good shape and my throat was still feeling awful. I was drinking liquid Tylenol like it was water at this point. I realized pretty quickly that I was in bad shape and needed to go to the emergency room (this was before the days of CityMD in NYC).

I got to the ER and waited… and waited and waited for a few hours. And while I waited the Tylenol wore off and I slowly became delirious. I remember that when the doctor greeted me, I burst into tears. They pumped me full of fluids and antibiotics. Turns out I had a severe case of strep with a peritonsillar abscess. I was admitted to the hospital and stayed for 3 days.

I cringe now to think of the symptoms I was hiding, and I really hope I didn’t get anyone else sick!

Oof, well if there’s any upside to surviving a global pandemic, it’s that we’re all much more aware of all the germs we could be spreading.

Have a terrible tale to tell about an interview gone awry? Please send it our way [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Interview%20Stories), subject line “Interview Stories.” We’ll read all the submissions and share our favorites in these pages.

(And remember, as we’ve previously [explained](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/interview-horror-stories-what-was-she-thinking-er-drinking/), “The ‘horror’ in ‘interview horror stories’ is loosely defined. Stories that are somewhat embarrassing or mildly amusing will suffice.”)
