It was easy news to miss, since every recent headline containing the words “Am Law 100” seems to involve a story like [Am Law 100 Firm Slashes Salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-furloughs-lawyers-and-staff/) or [Am Law 100 Firm Furloughs Some, Slashes Salaries For All](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-some-slashes-salaries-for-all/). So in case you did miss it: last week, the American Lawyer issued the latest [Am Law 100 rankings](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/rankings/the-2020-am-law-100/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=amlaw100&utm_content=live350&utm_term=tal).

The annual Am Law 100 rankings represent the nation’s 100 largest law firms, ranked by revenue. The new rankings, the 2020 Am Law 100, reflect the performance of Biglaw firms in 2019 — i.e., well before the coronavirus-driven economic downturn arrived.

Some might say: isn’t it a bit frivolous to focus on vanity metrics like profits per partner during such a [time of crisis](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/) for Biglaw? But as Gina Passarella, editor-in-chief of the American Lawyer, [noted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GPassarellaTAL/status/1252355642594955264), firm finances are especially important at a time like this: they give us insight into which firms will pull through, and which ones … won’t.

So let’s dig right in. In terms of the big picture, 2019 was a very good year for the world of large law firms. Here are some metrics (noted by David Thomas in his insightful [analysis of the rankings](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-am-law-100-found-success-in-2019-will-it-be-enough-in-2020/)):

- Total revenue: $104 billion, up by 5 percent.
- Average revenue per lawyer: $1,001,289, up by 3 percent.
- Profits per equity partner: $1,967,895, up by 5 percent
These are impressive figures. As recently as [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/the-2014-am-law-100-the-super-rich-get-richer/), boasting RPL of $1 million or more and PPP of $2 million or more put a firm in an elite club that Am Law dubbed the “Super Rich.” Now, those same figures make a firm … your average Am Law 100 firm.

“Everything we heard from clients at the beginning of 2020 was that 2019 was another good year, comparable to 2018,” Altman Weil consultant Eric Seeger told Am Law. “We had quite a few clients tell us that 2019 was a record financial year for them.”

But that was then, and this is now. Not surprisingly, the experts surveyed by Thomas and Am Law are not optimistic about 2020, expecting Biglaw to take a bath.

Of course, some firms will feel more pain than others:

Generally speaking, law firms that performed well in 2019 and have been performing well for the past couple of years are better positioned to weather the economic storm the COVID-19 pandemic is causing, [Wells Fargo’s Joe] Mendola says.

Zeughauser Group consultant Kent Zimmermann shares a similar sentiment. A law firm that is profitable has greater ”flexibility in how to manage through a crisis, particularly if there’s a significant drop in revenue,” he says.

With that background, let’s take a closer look at three key metrics — gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per partner — and the top 10 firms in each category.

Gross Revenue

In one sense, gross revenue is the critical metric, since the Am Law 100 consists of the 100 largest firms by revenue. A firm can have super-high profits per partner — but if its total revenue isn’t big enough, it won’t make the Am Law 100.

Here are the top 10 firms by gross revenue. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/).



Once again, Kirkland & Ellis took the top spot, becoming the first firm to [break the $4 billion mark](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/4-billion-in-gross-revenue-is-a-crap-ton-of-revenue/) after growing its revenue by an impressive 10.6 percent. The second-place finisher, Latham & Watkins, had even stronger growth — 11.3 percent — and racked up almost $3.8 billion in revenue.

As for the rest of the top 10 firms in the 2020 rankings, they were exactly the same as the top 10 firms in the 2019 rankings, with just some (small) changes in position. No firm moved up or down by more than a single spot.

As noted by ALM, some 41 law firms grossed more than $1 billion in 2019, up from 37 firms in 2018. Again, not long ago, breaking a billion was a major achievement for a Biglaw firm. Now, it makes a firm… slightly above average in the Am Law 100.

Revenue Per Lawyer

Many industry observers regard revenue per lawyer as the best indicator of a firm’s financial health. It can’t be manipulated as easily by gross revenue, which can be goosed by growing headcount (e.g., through a series of mergers), or profits per partner, which can be supercharged by shrinking the equity partnership (e.g., through de-equitization).

Here are the top 10 firms by revenue per lawyer. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-revenue-per-lawyer/).



Wachtell Lipton retained the top spot, with RPL of $3.3 million — some $1.5 million more than the second-place firm, Sullivan & Cromwell. Who says alternative fee arrangements can’t work? (In its flagship M&A practice, Wachtell Lipton generally bills based on the size and complexity of a transaction as opposed to by the hour.)

Most of the top firms by RPL remained the same. Congratulations to Gibson Dunn and Davis Polk on making the top ten this year, coming in at #9 and #10, respectively.

Profits Per Partner

And now, profits per partner or PPP, the ranking you’ve all been waiting for.

Here are the top 10 firms by profits per partner. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-equity-partner/).



Once again, Wachtell Lipton leads the way, with a whopping $6.3 million in PPP for 2019. That represented a decrease of 3.1 percent from 2018, but it still left Wachtell more than $1 million ahead of its closest rival — Kirkland & Ellis, with $5.2 million in PPP (up by 3.1 percent from 2018).

Again, there wasn’t much movement in the top 10 firms. Skadden Arps returned to the top 10, in the #10 spot, but all of the other top 10 firms were in the top 10 last year. To make the top 10, a firm needed almost $4 million in revenue — an incredible sum.

The rest of the Am Law 100 also fared well in terms of partner profits. As noted by ALM, 24 firms had PPP of $3 million or more, up from 20 firms last year. For the Am Law 100 as a whole, average PPP increased by 5 percent in 2019.

Ah, 2019… it seems like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? Alas, 2020 is looking very, very different.

Here at Lateral Link, we believe that the current crisis presents opportunities, for both individual lawyers and for law firms. Although the associate lateral market has cooled (unless you’re in bankruptcy — in which case, please [drop me a line](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com?subject=Bankruptcy%20Associate)), the lateral partner market remains active — just as it did during the last recession.

Why? For at least two reasons. First, when firms face a shrinking pie, the way to grow revenue is by grabbing a bigger slice of that smaller pie — and the way to do that is by bringing aboard partners with big books of business.

Second, as some law firms start to encounter financial trouble, the partners at these firms with strong, portable practices will start looking around. These partners will seek more stable platforms — and might even be able to “upgrade” their platforms, since the most prestigious and profitable firms will probably weather the storm better than many others.

But a firm doesn’t need to be super-prestigious or profitable in order to benefit from the current climate. If a firm is well (and conservatively) managed — with lots of liquidity, and a war chest sufficient to ride out the crisis and lure top talent — it will also be able to get in on the lateral partner action.

If you’re a partner contemplating a lateral move or a law firm interested in lateral hiring, please feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.laterallink.com/team/) or to any of my [colleagues at Lateral Link](https://www.laterallink.com/team/david-lat/). We are ready and eager to help you navigate this rapidly evolving environment — and to take advantage of the unique opportunities that it presents.

Clark Hill Member Kara Rozin

“We be falling up, never falling down / We keep it at a higher level, elevated ground.” — [Black Eyed Peas](https://genius.com/The-black-eyed-peas-fallin-up-lyrics)

The New Year often forces us to take an accounting of our lives. Are we measuring up to the age we live in? Are we living our best lives? For Clark Hill attorney Kara Rozin, this New Year marked an exceptionally reflective time.

Rozin joined Clark Hill in September 2016 and her tenure with the firm has been quite busy thus far. Last year, Rozin’s sister had a baby and then shortly after she was diagnosed with brain cancer. Nine months later, in December, Rozin’s husband was diagnosed with bile duct cancer. Through the health scares and hospital stays, Rozin still managed to bill 1950 hours. Work became both her release from and her resource for dealing with the stresses of her family life.

Earlier this month, Clark Hill announced that Rozin was elected to membership (promoted to partner). I have known Kara ever since she became an attorney and have had the chance to witness her journey. If I had to describe her in one word, I would call her a fighter. She never backs down from and she is always willing to square up to a good challenge.

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with Kara Rozin. It has become evident that her life and career experiences have made her wise beyond her years. Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): Congratulations on being recently elected to membership in your firm. Can you tell us a little bit about your career so far?

Kara Rozin (KR): Thank you! It’s a great start to 2018. I can’t believe this year will be 10 years of practicing law for me. My practice is focused on Education and I represent public school districts across Michigan in an array of matters ranging from labor and employment to student discipline to labor negotiations. I also regularly train school district employees on recent legislation and timely hot topics such as Restorative Justice and Title IX/Title VII Sexual Harassment.

RC: Your recent promotion may have been the least noteworthy news, among all the other surprises you endured, in 2017. Can you share with us a little bit about last year’s journey and how you have dealt with or what you have learned from it?

KR: 2017 was a year of challenges, that’s for sure. In March 2017, only a few months into my new position at Clark Hill, my younger sister was diagnosed with brain cancer. Then, 9 months later in December, my new husband was diagnosed with bile duct cancer. I’m really not sure how I dealt with that, all while hitting my billing target.

I am still dealing with it actually, but I learned “not to sweat the small stuff” and to take advantage of my resources when I need to. Work has become both my release and resource, because on one hand it was nice to focus on helping clients with their problems, but I have also learned to leverage my practice group partners when I need time away for me and my family.

I am grateful to work with such amazing people in my practice group and firm who do not hesitate to step-in when called on. I LOVE what I do and the clients I serve, but it’s important to remember that family comes first, because without them, I wouldn’t be who I am or where I’m at.

RC: What professional, career, or life advice do you have for young attorneys and those currently attending law school?

KR: For those currently attending law school, my advice is don’t think you will learn anything about the “PRACTICE” of law while in law school. Law school gives you the foundation, the science of law. However, the practice of law is an art, which is only learned and mastered once out of law school. The more practical, hands-on, experience you can get while in law school, the better. Volunteer at legal aid, go and watch motion hearings in court, intern at a law office. You’ll be one step ahead of your competition.

For young attorneys, the best advice I can give is that if you think being a lawyer is a 9-5 job, you are in the wrong profession. The practice of law does not start and stop once you cross the threshold of the office. Your clients may call afterhours when they get out of work, you may have to spend a Saturday afternoon researching an issue that cannot be billed to the client, or you may wake up at 3am the day of a motion hearing and spend another few hours reviewing your oral argument because you cannot fall back asleep.

Competition is brutal and clients want the best, so you should always be available to your clients and working to increase your knowledge and expertise in your chosen field of practice. Always anticipate the next “issue” or “hot topic” so you beat your competition to the punch.

RC: What advice do you have for law firms to be more fair and inclusive in their hiring and promotion practices?

KR: Women in the law have come a long way; however, there is still work to be done. I still remember my first year of practice when I would show up to a hearing or deposition and an “old boys club” opposing counsel would ask if I was the court reporter or a law clerk.

It took time, experience and a new layer of thick skin to establish myself and my reputation. Once there, it’s been a continuous effort to maintain that reputation—often going above and beyond what some of my very dear friends and male colleagues have had to do to obtain the same recognition or results.

I am honored to work for a firm that embraces, and celebrates, women in its hiring and promotion practices. We have a Diversity and Inclusion Committee, who sponsored training at our annual firm retreat last July in our nation’s capital, “Breaking through Bias: Understanding Gender Stereotypes and How Legal Organizations Can Achieve Real Gender Diversity.”

Knowledge is power, but it doesn’t stop there. Training and education regarding gender inclusion and equality in the workplace should be incorporated into practice. This goes both ways. Women need to break the silence, along with the glass ceiling.

RC: What do you do when you are not practicing law?

KR: I spend as much time as I can with family and friends. One of the biggest blessings during my year of challenges last year was the birth of my nephew, Luke!

He actually just turned one this week. I call him “Chunker Monker” because he is so chunky. He’s brought our family so much joy and happiness. I absolutely love being an Aunt, watching him grow and spoiling him rotten!

The other love of my life (besides my husband) is our fur-child, Arnie. He’s a 6 year old chocolate lab and a BIG BABY! We spoil him so much and enjoy taking him to parks and to the lake to swim in the summer.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

KR: Thanks for having me! I’ll leave the audience with my favorite quote from Erin Hanson about believing in yourself and taking chances: “There is freedom waiting for you, on the breezes of the sky, and you ask what if I fall? Oh but my darling, what if you fly?”

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Kara Rozin for taking the time to share her story with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

- Ed. Note: As the decade comes to a close, Above the Law presents you a special [Trivia Question of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/) series in remembrance of the Biglaw firms we lost in the 2010s.
What now defunct Biglaw firm was founded in 1933 in San Francisco?

Hint: The firm’s eventual dissolution was preceded by a rash of partner defections throughout 2017 (which Above the Law covered extensively, natch), before eventually calling it quits in early 2018.

If you’re at Harvard, Columbia or NYU, you have a much better chance of landing a job at a big law firm that pays a $190,000 starting salary.

— [Matt Moody](https://twitter.com/vaultlaw?lang=en), senior law editor at Vault, explaining the very simple reason why [not every law student](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/paying/articles/2018-07-26/what-type-of-salary-you-can-expect-with-your-law-degree) who dreams of an enourmous starting salary will be able to get one. More than 75 law firms [increased their salary scales](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) this summer, but that doesn’t mean all law school graduates will stand a chance of receiving those sky-high pay rates.

# Simone Biles, Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, And Practicing Law: More Alike Than You Might Think
## ""Deliberate practice"" is what separates superstars from the merely good, as managing partner Bruce Stachenfeld explains.

Simone Biles (by Fernando Frazão/Agência Brasil)

Have you heard of the concept of deliberate practice? There is a ton of literature on it if you Google it, but the lynchpin is that you break down what you do into tiny little pieces and work on those pieces until you don’t have to think about them any more, as they are just natural things you do without thought. There are a zillion examples of how deliberate practice can improve performance in sports, music, and just about everywhere else where skill or expertise is needed to achieve high-level results.

There is an anecdote about golfer Tiger Woods; when he was at the peak of his game, he literally started all over to revamp his swing, notwithstanding that he was already the best golfer in the world. He and his coach literally went back to the basics and started from scratch.

There are also anecdotes about Michael Jordan. We all saw him floating in the air, but everything I heard said he practiced more hours a day than anyone else.

When I read about Simone Biles, she was just average until she increased her workouts from three days a week to six days a week; at which point she exploded to be a superstar.

Ultimately, my belief, which of course I cannot actually prove, is that deliberate practice is what separates those who become superstars from those who end up being merely good.

There is a quote you have probably heard: “Practice makes perfect.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It is actually an awful and incorrect quote and can mislead you terribly. The correct quote should be: “Perfect practice makes perfect.”

Otherwise, you are merely getting better at doing things wrong. Deliberate practice means dissecting what you do into details and then working on those details to hone them to perfection, thereby increasing overall skill and performance ability.

I wonder, has anyone applied the concept of deliberate practice to the practice of law?

I don’t think so, but wonder how it would be done. Let me muse a bit here…..

The analytical problem to me is that law is rather messy compared to other things. If you are playing an instrument, you have the instrument and your goal is to make great music. If you are playing a sport, you know what the goals are as well. Practicing law, however, is really a combination of intellectual skills and interacting with human beings in a manner that allows you to achieve your clients’ goals. The goals are “messy” and hard to define and differ in different circumstances. So how could you apply deliberate practice here? I think the answer is that you can’t just apply it to “lawyering” as a whole; instead, you have to pick spots in your practice and apply it there.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here is a possible example. Say you are a real estate lawyer – like me – and you do a lot of negotiating. Well, how do you do it? Do you just make up a list of issues and go into the room and “go through the list” to see which points you can win for your client? Probably that is what you do, as that is what most people do.

How about if, instead, you started by getting and reading every single “gold standard” book in negotiation ever written? There probably are only about five or ten I would guess. Read them; and, don’t just read as if it were a novel, but rather take notes as ideas are given to you by other students of the negotiating game. When you are done, you would have a list of ideas. Then sit and “think” about how you might actually apply those ideas.

And then come up with a default strategy for your “usual” negotiation. And practice that strategy – looking in the mirror – with a colleague – in a group setting – by taking a course – with a coach – or other ideas – until you have it honed really well.

And then augment your default style by collecting an inventory of potential modifications, so that when you deal with an adversary who is – friendly – nasty – stupid – brilliant – pigheaded – smarter than you – older than you – a different culture – etc. – you can vary your negotiating skills appropriately.

And then maybe you start to become a real student of the game. It becomes a hobby as opposed to just a job. Maybe you start reading books like Sun Tzu’s [The Art of War](http://amzn.to/2eFUiyw) (affiliate link) and learn cool things like why it is best to have no style at all and to be like water, which has no form. When you attack water, it gives back, and when you retreat it moves forward – it has no shape and no style and therefore is hard to defeat.

Maybe you keep on reading and learning and thinking and practicing and practicing and practicing. But you don’t just practice irrelevantly; you practice with studious intensity, so you are “practicing perfectly.”

And maybe your negotiating skills go from good to great, and then from great to exceptional.

That is how I would do it, at least….

If you’re anything like me, you need all the good news you can get. So, it’s great to hear that that the Recording Academy [announced today ](https://www.grammy.com/recording-academy/news/the-recording-academy-implement-inclusion-rider-64th-annual-grammy-awards#:~:text=The%20Recording%20Academy%20To%20Implement%20Inclusion%20Rider%20For%2064th%20Annual%20GRAMMY%20Awards&text=Today%2C%20the%20Recording%20Academy%20announced,every%20level%20of%20the%20production)that the 2022 Grammy Awards will be produced with an inclusion rider. Yay!

Inclusion riders became big news in 2018 when, at the Academy Awards ceremony, Francis McDormand called attention to it as a way to increase diversity in Hollywood during her acceptance speech for Best Actress. The contract provision details a process for hiring and casting designed to diversify the candidate pool, encourage hiring traditionally underrepresented groups, track progress of diversity efforts, and lead to increased accountability.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
One of the co-authors of the inclusion rider is Kalpana Kotagal, partner at Cohen Milstein [(and Jabot podcast guest)](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/the-lawyer-behind-hollywoods-inclusion-rider/?rf=1), who commented on the impact of the move:

“Incorporating the Inclusion Rider into the GRAMMY Awards will have an enormous impact on an industry that has a long history of exclusion and underrepresentation,” said Kalpana Kotagal, Inclusion Rider co-author, civil rights attorney and partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll. “Part of what makes the Inclusion Rider so potent is its adaptability and flexibility. The GRAMMY Awards Inclusion Rider will include the fundamental elements of the tool, including a commitment to deepening and diversifying hiring pools, setting benchmarks and targets for hiring, collecting and thoroughly analyzing applicant and hiring data and implementing accountability measures.”

Kotagal worked with co-author Fanshen Cox, head of strategic outreach at Pearl Street Films, as well as key contributors Valeisha Butterfield Jones, Co-President of the Recording Academy, and Ryan Butler, founding director of Warner Music | Blavatnik Center for Music Business at Howard University on the rider. The addition of the contract clause is part of the [#ChangeMusic initiative](https://changeindustries.org/changemusic/) and done in partnership with Color Of Change.

# Balancing Law Careers: Overcoming The Motherhood Penalty
## Exploring work-life balance in law: how the 'motherhood penalty' impacts lawyer-parents' careers.

The legal profession, traditionally known for its demanding nature, often presents unique challenges for those striving to balance the responsibilities of a legal career with those of parenthood. The stark realities presented by a recent American Bar Association Commission on Women report highlight the urgent need for industry-wide change. This report, informed by the experiences of more than 8,000 lawyers, puts into perspective the disproportionate burden borne by lawyer mothers when it comes to childcare and domestic responsibilities.

The statistics are more than just numbers—they are a reflection of a day-to-day struggle many lawyer parents face. “Balancing the rigor of a legal career with the demands of parenting is a tightrope walk many of us face daily,” shares [J’lene Mortimer](https://laterallink.com/team/jlene-mortimer/), a former attorney turned recruiter at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/). “I remember being an associate trying to figure out how to navigate my responsibilities when my toddler son was home sick and unable to attend daycare. It is not easy, especially when you do not have family or friends in the area who can step in to support you. Fortunately, I was at a firm that supported me and had given me a part-time role so I could have more flexibility. I am grateful for their understanding of my situation at that time.”

This sentiment is at the heart of our mission. It’s about understanding the personal narratives behind these figures and transforming them into positive outcomes. The “motherhood penalty”—a term that surfaces all too frequently in discussions about workplace equality—is not just a buzzword but a barrier that must be dismantled. Lawyer mothers report feeling sidelined due to the very role that should be celebrated for its skills in multitasking, leadership, and time management.

Addressing this imbalance, [Jennifer Anderson](https://laterallink.com/team/jennifer-anderson/), another [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) recruiter who combines her legal expertise with her insights as a parent, emphasizes the need for actionable solutions. “Every day we hear from parents who are striving for a workplace that doesn’t just offer lip service to work-life balance but embodies it,” she says. “Our charge goes beyond placements; it’s about shifting the narrative and creating an environment where women don’t have to justify their dual roles as mothers and lawyers.”

At [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/), the conversation around these issues is deeply personal. We understand that when lawyer parents are supported, the entire legal ecosystem benefits. It’s not just about finding a job; it’s about forging a career in a space that honors one’s full identity, both as legal professionals and parents. We’re here to guide lawyer parents to firms that will celebrate their dedication to their families as a strength and not view it as a distraction.

As recruiters, we take pride in our dual roles as career strategists and advocates for change, ensuring that every lawyer parent we work with is empowered to achieve their professional goals without sacrificing their family commitments. We stand committed to advancing a legal industry that values inclusivity and equity, one placement at a time.

In crafting a legal profession that truly respects work-life integration, we invite our peers, partners, and the wider legal community to join us in this pursuit. The goal is clear: to foster a landscape where the contributions of lawyer parents are not just acknowledged but seen as vital to the richness and diversity of our profession.

Biglaw firms across the country continue to hand out special bonuses to associates and counsel as a way to thank them for their dedication during the pandemic — and to keep them around amid an incredibly hot lateral market. Other firms are going a step further and instituting salary increases, raising those in major markets to the standard Biglaw salary scale (if they weren’t already there), and others in smaller markets by tens of thousands of dollars.

Following DLA Piper’s decision in March to [increase base pay for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/dla-piper-2021-salary-raise/) in some offices, others — including [Alston & Bird](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/alston-bird-special-bonus-2021/); [King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/ks-special-bonuses/); [Taft](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-shares-the-wealth-with-associates-by-raising-salaries/); [Troutman Pepper](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/troutman-pepper-special-bonuses-raises/); [McGuireWoods](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/mcguirewoods-raises/); [Ice Miller](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/biglaw-firm-shares-the-wealth-raises-salaries-for-all/); and [Holland & Knight](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/hk-salary-increase-2021/) — have followed in the elite firm’s footsteps, and now yet another has fallen in line.

According to a presentation made earlier this week at Nixon Peabody, a firm ranked at No. 81 in the most recent Am Law 100, with $488,753,000 in 2020 gross revenue, associates will be compensated under a new lockstep salary and bonus scale across all markets.

This is what starting salaries will look like going forward at the firm’s metro, Long Island, and non-metro offices:


 

Sources note that even in the firm’s metro offices, the salary scale is still under market for all classes (to the tune of up to $35,000) except first-years. We’ve also been told that these new salaries are not retroactive, so associates will only receive raises for half of 2021.

In terms of bonuses, Nixon Peabody still isn’t paying market on those, and doesn’t seem to be offering special bonuses either. This is what bonuses at each of the firm’s offices now look like (and while there are three levels of bonuses (one is hours-based and two are collections-based), each looks like it may be more difficult to achieve than the next):







This seems to be where midlevels and senior associates will be able to make up what they’re missing in their salaries to bring them to market — but only if they work their asses off.

Sources we’ve heard from at the firm seem displeased:

Associates are leaving en masse right now and management is patting themselves on the back for these new salary and bonus announcements saying they feel real good. Of course partners feel great, they get the benefit of underpaying us.

Eek. We sure wish associates were happier about this salary news. Look on the bright side: the firm is closer to market than ever before in metro offices. Unlike the firm’s [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SeL6i3sHM0), everyone may not be a winner, but it’s still better than nothing.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus or raise news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Harvey Not-So Marvy, Booze Lose, Fox Shox

Over 60 years ago — even more if you count the stage version — a movie called “[Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(1950_film))” told the story of a man, Elwood P. Dowd, whose sister wanted to put him in a retirement home called (and I am not making this up) Chumley’s Rest. Dowd had a best friend named Harvey, a tall rabbit that only he could see. It’s a wonderful movie with James Stewart as Dowd, and I don’t want to spoil the story for you, only to say it’s worth your time — the original, that is. Remakes are just never as good.

Why do I mention “Harvey”? Because there’s now a [brand-new AI creation](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/hello-harvey-this-elite-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-partner-with-game-changing-ai-chatbot/) called Harvey. It’s customized for every law firm user.

In his discussion of GPT-based legal app Harvey (the new AI, not the movie), Bob Ambrogi says that “Some users of ChatGPT for legal purposes have noticed its tendency to ‘hallucinate’ — to make up answers from whole cloth. Pereyra and Weinberg [the creators] say that Harvey’s method of fine tuning the AI dramatically reduces occurrences of hallucinations and, in highly context-specific applications, [eliminates them almost entirely](https://www.lawnext.com/2023/02/as-allen-overy-deploys-gpt-based-legal-app-harvey-firmwide-founders-say-other-firms-will-soon-follow.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Contrast that with the Harvey who inhabits [Elwood P. Dowd’s imagination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kR0GeKL_WQ). There are times when an imaginary rabbit might be the best friend a person has.

Dowd’s imagination could not probably compete with some of the “what were they thinking” aka stupid lawyer faux pas. They range from a paralegal punching above his weight to a corporate behemoth who seems to have adopted the approach of Mad Magazine’s Alfred E. Neuman, that is, “What, me worry?”

Rocky times in London as a paralegal poised to become an associate challenged an existing associate to fight at a Biglaw social event. There was liquor (surprise, surprise) and the paralegal who had too much to drink ripped his shirt off, spoiling for a fight while making racist comments. Would it make sense to cut off those after a certain number of drinks? Or even better, make such events alcohol-free? The latter would at least reduce [the number of embarrassing incidents](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/biglaw-associate-unsuspended-after-challenging-colleague-to-shirtless-brawl-while-making-racist-remarks/) that can adversely impact career movement.

Then there’s the issue of reputation risk, which law firms sometimes don’t consider in making good choices. An update on one from several months ago: the North Dakota firm that sued former associates for not billing enough hours won in the North Dakota Supreme Court. The firm’s employment contract permitted recovery of monies paid if an attorney did not achieve the billable hours requirement and left the firm. What does that say about the firm? What does that say about the court that ruled in the firm’s favor on summary judgment and that the state supreme court upheld that ruling and [denied the motion for reconsideration](https://www.ndcourts.gov/supreme-court/opinion/2023ND16.)?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Sure, the court shot down the various contract defenses, and the firm won, but what about reputational risk? The firm seemed to care more about reimbursement than reputation. So be it. Will any attorney go to work for that firm knowing that if they don’t bill the requisite number of hours, money will be clawed back? Based on this opinion, what do you think? Clawbacks of pay in law firms are something new, but hopefully not trendsetting.

But that’s not the end of the story. The firm took PPP loans [totaling almost $800K](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/law-firm-associates-pay-back-salary-covid-792k-ppp-loans/) that were subsequently forgiven, but still sued to recover the salaries that the PPP money had paid for. How do you say chutzpah? (And it’s not pronounced “chutz-pa.”)

Appellate lawyers often use the “straight face” approach to an argument, that is, if the argument can be made with a straight face, even if the argument is wonky, then make it. This may well be the position that the Trump Organization lawyers take when they argue that there is no such thing as the Trump Organization. [Wait, what? ](https://dealbreaker.com/2023/02/donald-trumps-lawyers-argued-there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-trump-organization-the-court-was-not-amused) There’s a saying that goes something like this: “when the facts are on your side, argue the facts, when the law is on your side, argue the law, and when you have neither, argue like hell.” Given that the court commented upon more than 300 pages of answers that the Trump Organization filed to the complaint as just a teensy bit beyond the pale, it appears it will have to argue like hell.

I wonder who instructs Fox executives and on-air talent about the perils of emails, DMs, IMs, and all the other permutations of written life today. Has anyone told them about e-discovery? About how nothing is private in the workplace anymore unless it’s written to or from an attorney and labeled as attorney-client privilege (and [even then, not always](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2cf0c04e-8d81-400c-a5c1-dd29e9dfd2d3))? Is there anything in the Fox employee handbook about employee privacy and lack thereof? A variety of cringeworthy documents are included in a now-unsealed motion for summary judgment filed by Dominion in its suit against Fox for defamation. These missives are precisely the kind of supporting documentation that plaintiff attorneys drool over. However, being the irascible network that Fox is, it’s [apparently going to duke it out](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/fox-claims-it-had-to-report-mindblowinglynuts-kraken-lies-about-dominion-for-news-value/). Just hand Fox the shovel to continue [digging a hole](https://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/dominion-voting-case-exposes-post-election-fear-17792255.php) that gets deeper and deeper.

[](blank)Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# The 2016 Am Law 200: Revenue Swirling Down The Drain
## While some firms came out on top, others were merely surviving. How did the Am Law 200 stack up?

Today, the American Lawyer released its Am Law 200 law firm rankings — a closely watched list of the law firms that are well-known in legal circles, but not quite rich and prestigious enough to become members of the elite and influential Am Law 100.

When the [Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) came out in late April, the key takeaway was that while there was growth across the board, it was weaker than it had been in years past, and there may be trouble ahead. The latest Am Law 200 rankings tell a different tale, with flat performance in metrics like average revenue per lawyer and average profits per partner being celebrated in the face of declining revenues. The deeper one dives into the Second Hundred, the more pronounced the dips in revenue become.

While some firms came out on top, others were merely surviving. How did the Am Law 200 stack up?

Before we plunge into PPP, here’s an overview of how the “Second Hundred” firms (#101-#200) as a whole performed in 2015:

- Gross revenue: $18.7 billion, down by 3.2 percent
- Average revenue per lawyer: $649,023, up by 0.3 percent
- Average profits per equity partner: $737,470, up by 0.1 percent
Focusing on the key metrics of RPL and PPP — which struggled to move in 2015 — this is an incredibly lackluster performance. Am Law has more information on the [decrease in gross revenue](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202757855359/The-Am-Law-Second-Hundred-Taking-a-Dive#ixzz49UBHcPA4) on average across the Second Hundred:

Divided into quartiles based on gross revenue performance in 2015, firms in the Second Hundred’s top two quartiles performed better than the bottom two quartiles. Gross revenue declined 1.39 percent at firms 101-125, 1.49 percent at firms 126-150, 6.34 percent at firms 151-175 and 6.50 percent at firms 176-200.

Some firms did so poorly that they fell out of the Am Law 200 entirely, such as Kenyon & Kenyon and Stevens & Lee, firms that were both victims of en masse equity partner departures. Other firms that exited the Second Hundred either fell apart (Dickstein Shapiro) or were gobbled up in gigantic mergers (Edwards Wildman combined with Locke Lord, while McKenna Long & Aldridge was swallowed whole by Dentons).

On the bright side, there were standout performances posted in 2015 by the [Am Law 200’s all-star firms](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202757855359/The-Am-Law-Second-Hundred-Taking-a-Dive#ixzz49UBHcPA4). Which ones had monumental performances?

Los Angeles’ Irell & Manella and Washington, D.C.’s BuckleySandler—both of which have fewer than 150 total lawyers and 40 equity partners—had the highest profits per partner among Second Hundred firms: $3,205,000 and $2,615,000, respectively. Both firms’ PPP also ranked in the top 20 of all Am Law 200 firms, a list dominated by The Am Law 100’s Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan; and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Choate Hall & Stewart; Munger Tolles & Olson; Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman; Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell; Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler; and Lowenstein Sandler were the Second Hundred’s next highest performers, all with PPP greater than $1.5 million.

It’s also worth mentioning that three Second Hundred firms ranked among the top 20 of all Am Law 200 firms in revenue per lawyer, a metric that’s generally relied upon to evaluate the overall measure of a law firm’s health: Irell ($1.59 million), Munger Tolles ($1.29 million), and Choate Hall ($1.265 million).

Now for the part you’ve been waiting for: gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per partner. Flip to the next page to see how the Second Hundred made out.

# Scheduling As A Secret To Success
## 'Never' is the more likely result if the goal wasn’t ever prioritized on your calendar in the first place.
By [Meyling ""Mey"" Ly Ortiz](https://abovethelaw.com/author/mortiz/)

As a busy in-house lawyer, mom of three kids (all under 7), and someone who prioritizes community involvement, who also happens to try to blog weekly — I sometimes get the question of “how do you do all that you do?”

My immediate response is candidly that my house is disorganized and a complete mess most of the time, I don’t get as much sleep as I should, I barely work out once a week, and I’m a terrible friend — but that doesn’t usually answer the “why” behind the question.

So to those of you who wonder if I have some life hack or secret to success, I don’t. But one tip that works for me regularly is using the calendar and scheduling time to work on goals or initiatives that are important to me.

In [my previous post](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/the-time-block-is-your-friend/), I shared how at work, the time block is your friend in making sure you have time to do your legal work during the workday. I didn’t mention how the time block is also crucial in my life as a tool for accomplishing my goals.

For example, if your goal has been to develop or expand a niche practice in environmental social governance or artificial intelligence, consider blocking off and calendaring 30 minutes to an hour every week to devote solely to that activity. Set a weekly reminder that you can snooze if you get busy, which is inevitable.  Even if you manage to devote only one hour once a month, and not weekly as you planned, monthly work on your professional goal is better than never. And let’s face it, never is the more likely result if the goal wasn’t ever prioritized on your calendar in the first place.

You can apply this approach to any of your professional goals. For example, I have used this approach to learn more about diversity, equity, and inclusion and for my nonprofit board work. Currently, I block off time weekly for mentoring (mentoring Mondays), networking (including LinkedIn posts), and gratitude (thankful Thursdays, where I send an email or thank-you note).

What is also great about this practice of scheduling is that it is a terrific diagnostic tool for objectively recognizing that you don’t have the time for new activities or commitments.

Specifically, if you’re a person who can’t help but say yes when you’re asked to join a committee or a nonprofit board, with this approach, your calendar will tell you if you have capacity. Contrary to what people say about “making time,” you can’t. If your calendar is already full of commitments to other activities, you have to decline — unless you give something else up, or unless you’re willing to let something else suffer.

Finally, this practice is great for providing you a great “gut-check” on whether you are living your values. It is easy enough to tell ourselves what or who is most important to us — but do our calendars reflect what we say? Using this approach, I can see at a glance where I spend my time, what causes I support, and reflect on why — and “course-correct” as necessary.

Meyling “Mey” Ly Ortiz is in-house at Toyota Motor North America. Her passions include mentoring, championing belonging, and a personal blog: TheMeybe.com. At home, you can find her doing her best to be a “fun” mom to a toddler and preschooler and chasing her best self on her Peloton. You can follow her on LinkedIn ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/meybe/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meybe/)). And you knew this was coming: her opinions are hers alone.

With its storied history and time-honored traditions, the legal profession finds itself at a pivotal moment. The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and legal technology presents an unparalleled opportunity for transformation. Yet, this opportunity is not without its challenges. The path to integrating these innovations into the fabric of legal practice is fraught with obstacles rooted in the profession’s innate characteristics and its cautious approach to change.

Understanding the Legal Mindset

Lawyers, by training and temperament, are guardians of precedent and procedure. This conservatism ensures stability and reliability in legal outcomes but can also hinder the adoption of new technologies. The challenge lies not in the technology itself but in aligning its capabilities with the core values and workflows of the legal profession.

Legacy Systems: The Anchors of Tradition

The reliance on established processes and legacy systems in law firms is both a strength and a stumbling block. While providing a sense of security and continuity, these systems can also impede innovation. Transitioning from these entrenched practices to more agile, tech-driven methodologies requires a careful balance between respecting tradition and embracing progress.

Bridging Worlds: Lawyers and Technologists

One of the most significant hurdles in legal tech adoption is the cultural and linguistic divide between legal professionals and technologists. This gap can lead to misunderstandings, misaligned expectations, and missed opportunities. Overcoming this challenge necessitates a concerted effort to foster mutual understanding and collaboration.

A Strategic Framework for Tech Adoption in Law

A strategic, purpose-driven approach is essential to navigate legal tech adoption’s complexities successfully. Here’s a blueprint for the future:

- Prioritize Human-Centric Solutions
Every technological initiative should start with a simple question: “How does this enhance the practice and delivery of legal services?” By focusing on solutions that augment human capabilities and address real-world needs, technology can become a powerful ally in the pursuit of justice and efficiency.

- Foster a Culture of Innovation and Adaptability
The legal profession must cultivate an environment where curiosity, experimentation, and lifelong learning are valued. This cultural shift can demystify technology and empower legal professionals to leverage new tools confidently.

- Encourage Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration
Creating platforms for dialogue between legal professionals and technologists can bridge the knowledge gap. Through collaboration, both groups can develop solutions that are innovative, practical, and grounded in legal realities.

- Center the Client Experience in Technological Innovation
Technology should be employed not as an end in itself but as a means to enhance client service. A client-centered approach ensures that technological advancements contribute to more accessible, transparent, and responsive legal services.

- Adopt a Broader View of Success
The impact of legal tech should be measured not just in financial terms but also by its contribution to access to justice, client satisfaction, and the well-being of legal practitioners. This holistic approach to evaluating success can guide the development of technology that truly serves the profession and society.

The Road Ahead: Embracing the Possibilities

The integration of AI and legal technology into the legal profession is a journey filled with potential. By navigating this path with intention, purpose, and a commitment to core values, the legal community can harness these innovations to create a more efficient, equitable, and accessible legal system.

In this era of transformation, the legal profession stands at the threshold of significant change. By adopting a strategic, client-focused, and collaborative approach to technology, we can move forward with confidence, ensuring that the legal profession not only adapts to the times but also shapes the future of justice. This journey requires us to embrace new tools and technologies and do so with a clear vision of how they can enhance the noble pursuit of law.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 07.13.16
## * NO-NO-NO-NOTORIOUS! Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg continued her verbal assault against presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, calling him a ""faker"" with ""no consistency,"" even after the would-be world leader [referred to her](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/donald-trump-angered-by-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-saying-shell-move-to-foreign-nation-if-hes-elected-president/) as a ""disgrace to the court."" [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/12/politics/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump-faker/index.html)] * The only person who's a winner at Nixon Peabody right now is this former associate: After 7 years of litigation, Noah Doolittle, an ex-associate who [sued the firm over the size of the less-than-lucrative bonus](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/08/12/associate-helps-land-client-firm-bills-client-associate-sues-over-bonus/) he received after landing a major client, has finally won his case. The firm could now be forced to make a payout of close to $1 million. Ouch! [[Daily Record](http://nydailyrecord.com/2016/07/12/former-associate-wins-lawsuit-against-nixon-peabody-that-could-cost-the-firm-1-million/) (sub. req.)] * We could be wrong, but something tells us associates at this firm probably won't be receiving the $180K salaries they might have been hoping for. Dan Radler, the incoming managing partner of Quarles & Brady, says he's ""not a proponent of giving across-the-board raises to associates"" -- he thinks raises should be earned. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/quarles-bradys-new-managing-partner-isnt-a-fan-of-across-the-board-pay-raises/)] * Cosby sweaters didn't fit in with this firm's flip-flops: Contrary to prior reports, Quinn Emanuel left comedian Bill Cosby high and dry after withdrawing from his defense in the civil suits that have been lodged against him as well as his criminal case. Los Angeles-based Liner will take over Cosby's civil cases. [[The Recorder](http://www.therecorder.com/home/id=1202762352668/Quinn-Emanuel-Withdraws-From-Cosby-Criminal-Case?mcode=1202617072607&curindex=4) via [Philadelphia Inquirer](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160712_Source__Cosby_splits_with_LA_defense_lawyers.html?mobi=true)] * Albany Law School has announced a new program that will allow students to receive their law degrees in two years.

* NO-NO-NO-NOTORIOUS! Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg continued her verbal assault against presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, calling him a “faker” with “no consistency,” even after the would-be world leader [referred to her](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/donald-trump-angered-by-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-saying-shell-move-to-foreign-nation-if-hes-elected-president/) as a “disgrace to the court.” [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/12/politics/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump-faker/index.html)]

* The only person who’s a winner at Nixon Peabody right now is this former associate: After 7 years of litigation, Noah Doolittle, an ex-associate who [sued the firm over the size of the less-than-lucrative bonus](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/08/12/associate-helps-land-client-firm-bills-client-associate-sues-over-bonus/) he received after landing a major client, has finally won his case. The firm could now be forced to make a payout of close to $1 million. Ouch! [[Daily Record](http://nydailyrecord.com/2016/07/12/former-associate-wins-lawsuit-against-nixon-peabody-that-could-cost-the-firm-1-million/) (sub. req.)]

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

* We could be wrong, but something tells us associates at this firm probably won’t be receiving the $180K salaries they might have been hoping for. Dan Radler, the incoming managing partner of Quarles & Brady, says he’s “not a proponent of giving across-the-board raises to associates” — he thinks raises should be earned. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/quarles-bradys-new-managing-partner-isnt-a-fan-of-across-the-board-pay-raises/)]

* Cosby sweaters didn’t fit in with this firm’s flip-flops: Contrary to prior reports, Quinn Emanuel left comedian Bill Cosby high and dry after withdrawing from his defense in the civil suits that have been lodged against him as well as his criminal case. Los Angeles-based Liner will take over Cosby’s civil cases. [[The Recorder](http://www.therecorder.com/home/id=1202762352668/Quinn-Emanuel-Withdraws-From-Cosby-Criminal-Case?mcode=1202617072607&curindex=4) via [Philadelphia Inquirer](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160712_Source__Cosby_splits_with_LA_defense_lawyers.html?mobi=true)]

* Albany Law School has announced a new program that will allow students to receive their law degrees in two years. Unlike many of the two-year law degree programs that are being offered at other schools, Albany Law is only charging prospective students for two years’ worth of schooling, not three. Congratulations on making sense! [[ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/new_two_year_program_will_get_law_school_graduates_in_the_job_market_quicke)]

Firms, especially big, global Am Law firms, try to think about how to be recession- and downturn-proof with more balanced practices.

—David Walden, managing director of legal recruiter E.P. Dine, [tells Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/01/02/mirror-image-in-2020-the-busiest-practice-areas-may-be-more-of-the-same/) what he believes Biglaw’s strategic vision will be for the coming year. He says corporate restructuring, bankruptcy, finance, some litigation and intellectual property will be the hot practice areas in 2020. He said, “These all tend to be, as far as practice areas, in even higher demand now than they have been in the last 10 years due to expansive economies.” He also pointed to health care, data privacy and insurance spaces as areas with room for growth. Walden also noted that the practice areas likely to see a slow down are transactional and M&A.

# Protests And Boycotts Come To Jones Day's Doorstep

I’ve, erm, written a lot about [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jones-day/) over the last few days (and I’ll probably write more!). But, by far, my favorite bit is running down the deluge of shit that’s been heaped upon them since Donald Trump lost the election.

There was the New York Times [article blowing up](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/even-jones-day-lawyers-are-giving-trumps-election-lawsuits-some-serious-side-eye/) Jones Day (and Porter Wright) over their election litigation representations. Then there was Jones Day’s anemic [response to the controversy. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/)The Lincoln Project also promised to spend $500,000 on [an ad campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) going after them — and, importantly, their clients — over the representation. But the MeidasTouch PAC actually beat them to the punch by releasing a [Jones Day attack video](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign) first. All the while, other Biglaw firms [have been fleeing](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-before-they-get-jones-day-ed/) the election litigation like[ rats from a ship](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/another-biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-no-not-jones-day/).

And now the people have taken the controversy to Jones Day’s doorstep — literally.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But first let’s talk about the organizing that people are doing to hit Jones Day where it really hurts — their [ability to recruit](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-biglaw-firms-doing-trumps-election-bidding/) the best and brightest lawyers. The People’s Parity Project is [circulating a petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/lawstudentpledge) asking law students to refrain from interviewing at any of the law firms implicated in Donald Trump’s effort to undo the results of the election by court fiat:

Our democracy is under attack. President Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee have filed frivolous lawsuits in states across the country in an attempt to overturn the results of a fair election and undermine our democratic process. These lawsuits are failing and have received vehement criticism for their meritless attempts to sow discord and distrust.

Yet, attorneys from Jones Day, Porter Wright, King & Spalding, and Consovoy McCarthy are leading the charge. They are not just complicit – they are enabling despotic attempts to threaten our election integrity and the future of our nation. This is unethical, plain and simple.

Proving great minds think alike, [a separate petition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWx9uLgV7sWr1gaVV6bmzhKZILmITWVGSS7ppyq4xwk/edit) is also circulating asking law students to refrain from interviewing with Jones Day. They’ve made a similar pitch as PPP, but have limited their scope of firms to just the headline-grabbing Jones Day:

President Trump’s reelection campaign, state Republican parties, and other associated groups have filed lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit across the country in a dead-end attempt to overturn the results of a free, fair, and democratic election. Jones Day, which has taken over $4 million this year alone to represent Trump and the RNC, is lending those lawsuits a false sheen of credibility. The firm is thereby complicit in the Trump campaign’s efforts hinder the proper functioning of American democracy.

Law students, and particularly 2Ls engaged in the firm recruiting process, wield substantial power right now. Across the country, we are asked to rank and interview with firms seeking the best-trained legal minds our schools have to offer. We are a small pool of talent in high demand, and the list of firms in contention to employ us is long. We therefore call upon law students across the nation to refrain from participating in Jones Day’s recruiting process–to make clear that our names will not be used to launder the firm’s negligent self-interest.

But that’s not all. Direct action group [Rise and Resist](https://www.riseandresist.org/) has organized picketing in front of Jones Day’s New York office, as well as phone campaign at the D.C. outpost of Jones Day (they also organized phoning against Porter Wright, but it’s unclear how that proceeded given [the firm’s withdrawal from that representation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/another-biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-no-not-jones-day/)):

“Jones Day is participating in a process designed to delegitimize the electoral process and cast doubt on whether Biden is in fact the President-elect,” said Jamie Bauer, a member of Rise and Resist. “This effectively instills the belief in voters that all elections that Republicans lose are rigged, and that all outcomes where Democrats win are suspect. This is one of Trump’s consistent lies going back to the 2016 election, and Jones Day should be ashamed that they are repeating it.”
“No law firm has done more than Jones Day LLP to promote Donald Trump’s bigotry, corruption, and authoritarianism — but these frivolous election lawsuits are a new low, meant to undermine confidence in our democracy. New York’s “elite” law firms must end their profiting off hate: Jones Day must cut its ties with Donald Trump, or New Yorkers should cut their ties with Jones Day,” said Janos Marton, civil rights lawyer and candidate for Manhattan DA.

UPDATE: Check out images from the protest:

While another action group, [Shutdown D.C.](https://www.shutdowndc.org/calendar/stop-the-lawyers-destroying-democracy) is organizing against King & Spalding and Porter Wright for their representations:

Over the last several days, Donald Trump and his allies have doubled down on their false claims that Trump won the election – and they are continuing to undermine democracy by giving credence to absurd conspiracy theories and impeding the future Biden administration.
But they’re not alone in this exercise. They’re getting support from two law firms – King & Spalding and Porter Wright – that are helping to litigate Trump’s groundless claims. These firms are complicit in helping Trump bully and cheat in his desperate effort to take votes away from Black, Indigenous, and brown people in this country. These lawyers took an oath in support of the Constitution, but now they are violating it with these unethical actions.

UPDATE: From the protests at King & Spalding’s office:

Between the picketing and boycotts and attack videos, the pressure is really on at Jones Day, and others representing Trump and his allies. So far, Jones Day has doubled down. But we are hearing constant rumblings about dissension in the ranks from inside the firm. So, Jones Day attorneys, how do you feel about the firm’s representation? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=JonesDay), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)).

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

After two years of a pandemic, it’s hard to put the horse back in the barn on this issue. The pandemic complicated things in the sense of—and this is what the challenge continues to be—getting people to realize the benefits of in-person culture and collaboration.

— [Michael Schmidt](https://www.cozen.com/people/bios/schmidt-michael), co-managing partner of Cozen O’Connor’s New York office, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/20/to-mandate-or-to-suggest-law-firms-weigh-hybrid-policy-approaches/) on the firm’s hybrid work policies. Cozen is currently “recommending” that associates spend at least three days each week in the office, rather than requiring their presence. “We are trying to come up with different ways to incentivize our people. We have an obligation to promote the virtues of coming into the office,” he said. “On the other hand, we are professionals. It’s incumbent on professionals to realize that they are not solo practitioners. The challenge this year and beyond is where to strike that balance.” Two-thirds of firms are “strongly” recommending that employees come to the office two to three days a week, while one-fifth require the same.

# Minding the Gap, Finding the Bridge, and Taking the Longview
## As a former Biglaw attorney, I can tell you, this thought most certainly crossed my mind.  But as a legal recruiter, I have a whole new appreciation for what I call “minding the gap.”

The Lateral Link team recently held our company retreat in Las Vegas, and it occurred to me that law firm life can sometimes feel a little like being stuck in a Vegas casino. You are in a place where you can make really big money, but it can require working around the clock, even to the point where you aren’t even sure what time of day it is.  The upside is really good, but after a while you may start to feel an overwhelming desire to find an exit, get outside, breathe some fresh air, and regain a sense of balance in your life.

During these times, it can feel tempting to just draft your dream resignation email and press send!  In these moments, all of the good advice you have heard to never give up and push through the pain flies out the window.  Adding fuel to the fire, you may be at the point in your career where you have some savings built up so economically you can afford a break. You hear a little voice inside saying, “How great would it be to just quit and have time to figure out my next move without the constant stream of responsibilities and due dates hanging over me?”

As a former Biglaw attorney, I can tell you, this thought most certainly crossed my mind.  But as a legal recruiter, I have a whole new appreciation for what I call “minding the gap.”  As tough as it may be, there is undoubtedly value in avoiding any unnecessary employment gaps in your resume.

There is, of course, a huge carve out for time off for mental and physical health issues.  I am a strong advocate for mental health awareness and am in no way suggesting that sticking it out is the answer in all cases as everyone has their own particular mental health and/or medical considerations.  But barring these and other such extenuating circumstances, the simple truth is — it is significantly easier to get hired if you are currently employed.

Being employed gives you leverage — mind the gap.

In an ideal world, one would like to think that firms give candidates the benefit of the doubt when it comes to employment gaps in evaluating interview invitations.  Sadly, though, that is not how the process usually works.  Like many large companies, law firms sort candidates based on the limited information in their resumes and inevitably make assumptions based on this information.  And gaps in your employment timeline can unfortunately raise questions of reliability, focus, and drive.

Of course, you can overcome this presumption by telling a compelling story about the reason for your gap.  But, given the high volume of applicants for any one role, a firm may pass on your resume before even hearing the explanation.

Conversely, if you can manage to stay in your current role, you are only increasing your chances of getting an interview and avoiding unfair judgment.  This will let you walk into your interviews with greater confidence knowing that you can focus on your relevant experience and how you will make a seamless transition into the practice group given this background. 

And even if you are switching careers entirely, the fact that you are currently working will be reassuring to any potential new employers. Bottom line – this strategy allows you to play your strongest possible hand.

What happens when you are handed a gap you can’t mind? Build a bridge.

You might be thinking as you are reading — that is all fine and dandy when you are in control of minding the gap, but what happens when the “gap” is handed to you on a layoff platter??  This is where the story of the candidate who can’t be in the room to tell his/her/their story can have a different ending.  Enter stage left – your trusted legal recruiter.  

I know when some attorneys think of recruiters they think of stereotypical cold calls and emails that interrupt the workday, but one of my favorite parts of recruiting is being my candidates’ advocate and a source of career support for them.  I love getting to know each of my candidates personally so I can present her/him/they to a firm in a compelling way that paints a detailed picture of why this candidate — gaps included — would be an asset to that firm.  A gap can be an unknown, but when it gains a story bridge, it can transform into a stepping-stone to the candidate’s next destination.

Take the longview – it’s all part of the career journey.

I realize that all of this may be easier said than done. When you are feeling overwhelmed – whether it be from unrelenting work, roadblocks to business development, endless roads to partnership, or gaps handed to you — it can be really hard to focus on the bigger picture.  I too have felt lost in the chaos of the moment, but I have also learned over the years how important it is to try to take the longview.  In these times, I turn to my trusted friends and family to help me re-center and remember that my career is a marathon not a sprint.

Another way to help maintain perspective is to discuss your situation with your trusted recruiter.   A recruiter can develop a strategy for you to find your next role and counsel you as you go on the path together to get there.  Another favorite part of my job is that I get to be a legal industry data nerd.  Everyday my colleagues and I read and share intel from trusted legal news sources as to what is happening in the market.  We are also meeting with firms regularly to understand their specific needs each quarter.  We witness the trends unfold in front of us in real time and have all of this information to share with you to help you figure out your longview.  

For example, we are seeing and hearing about an uptick in hiring in the secondary markets right now.  You might be staring down a layoff in New York City, but it has been your longtime dream to move to Denver. Now might be the time!  How does dawn patrol skiing and logging into Citrix by mid-morning sound?  Carpe diem!  Feeling like you are ready for warmer weather?  Try Austin, another booming secondary market.  Whatever your frustration is – it might just be the path to something better.  All you need to do is figure out what that bridge is for you and how to get there.  We work with firms in all of these markets and can help you figure out what would be the best fit for you given both your legal and lifestyle interests.  

Your recruiter will also be able to advise you on which firms might be a better platform/culture match for you and your practice. Maybe you need a firm with less hours or a more flexible schedule? Maybe you need more billing rate flexibility? Maybe you need a more international platform to grow your book of business?  Maybe your business would thrive better at a boutique?  These are all questions that can be a fork in the road that leads to a new and exciting career trajectory for you.  Your recruiter can advise you on how they have helped past candidates in similar situations who have found success on a new path. 

Hearing about other lawyers who have made a change and ended up thriving in their new geographic market, tripling their book of business at their new firm, making non-equity partner from a counsel role, or overcoming an unexpected gap may help you see the light at the end of the tunnel you are in and help give you courage to embark on that next phase of your career path.  Mind as well have some fun and embrace the possibilities of where the path might lead you next!

# Donald Trump's Legal Team Decides Not To Ask Permission OR Forgiveness

Donald Trump’s legal team informed Justice Arthur Engoron that their client would deliver closing remarks in violation of basic New York rules, [setting off a series of decreasingly coherent emails](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/donald-trump-closing-argument-comedy/) with the judge over Trump’s willingness to abide by the constraints of a closing argument. He was not willing to… but he went ahead and did it anyway. Meanwhile, Slaughter & May joined the ranks of firms trying to crack down on lawyers ducking the office [using all its surveillance powers](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/another-major-law-firm-goes-full-big-brother-to-enforce-office-attendance-policy/) and another firm that announced matching bonuses has instituted a retroactive hours requirement to [bait and switch its attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/is-a-biglaw-firm-pulling-a-bait-and-switch-on-associate-bonuses/).

# More Associate Salary Craziness: A New York Mainstay Gets On Board
## With more money comes more billing requirements.

If you were taking bets on which Biglaw firms would inevitably move to the new market reality of the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale, a safe bet would be that Cadwalader — the oldest firm in New York City — would move. Not necessarily a flashy firm when it comes to associate compensation, they still do what they have to do to keep up with the Joneses (or Milbanks, as the case may be).

Today, Cadwalader made it official, announcing they were increasing associate salaries between $10,000 and $25,000, depending on class year. Below is the new Cadwalader scale, and you’ll note, they provide a scale for the super senior associates, instead of leaving themselves to the murky waters of individualized compensation:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And associates there will also be receiving special bonuses:



Associates need to be on track to bill 2,000 hours to receive this bonus. If associates miss the mark mid-year, they’ll have an opportunity to make it up by year’s end and receive the special bonus in addition to year-end bonuses. One interesting note is that the 2,000-hour threshold for the special bonuses appears to be a bump up from the standard 1,800-threshold Cadwalader usually employs.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Did Labor Day Make A Difference For The Legal Profession?
## Times change, and the profession needs to be able to change with these times.

For many people, Labor Day was a day off, a day away from the workplace environment. And given various labor strikes and disputes presently underway (strikes here in Tinseltown are ongoing), threatened, or resolved, it was a day to think about how work fits into life. For too many of us, it’s all about how life fits into work, and maybe that’s not the paradigm for many people anymore.

The pandemic put a pause button, if not a full-stop button, on how people view their work, and that hasn’t been limited to hourly, nonexempt workers. It’s been a time of reflection for our profession too. And the lingering question is how to better integrate work into life instead of the other way around.

WFH has been the buzzword (buzz initialism?) for many people over the past several years, and people who have learned, to their delight, that they don’t need to be in the office five days a week, or perhaps any day of the week. No stress about commuting, no worry about childcare or elder care arrangements, and being able to do the same amount of work, if not more, without needing to physically be in the workplace. Granted, there aren’t any “water cooler” conversations, and for some there’s the fear of missing out. Some firms think that physical presence is necessary, but others don’t. A [hybrid work arrangement](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/to-hotel-or-not-to-hotel-biglaws-latest-return-to-office-struggle/) is something that some employers are starting to embrace, stating that there should be a certain amount of time on site, but it doesn’t have to be all the time.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As a recent Bloomberg report noted, law firms of the future are going to be different in [three critical ways](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/law-firms-of-the-future-will-be-different-in-three-critical-ways?source=newsletter&item=headline&region=digest). [   ](blank)

The first is AI and how it is already impacting law firm practice. The second is how lawyers will be trained and utilized. If AI can correctly draft documents and pleadings (assuming facts not in evidence, given that public snafu of several months ago), then the skills that lawyers need will be different, with an emphasis on critical thinking (we should already have that) and the effective use of the AI technology.

The last difference that the Bloomberg report mentions is law firm structure. Does anyone envision that law firm structure will morph into something different (e.g., that nonlawyers can be a part of that structure)? Given the reluctance of law firms and the bar associations regulating them, any change in structure seems unlikely any time soon, experiments in Arizona and Utah notwithstanding. Do law firms have sufficient financial resources to invest in AI and other technologies needed in the future on their own? To be determined.

So, how are law firms and corporate legal departments going to handle the reluctance of some lawyers (maybe not all, but at least a goodly handful) to return to the office? It’s the RTO versus WFH conundrum. One way could be to adapt technology that the younger lawyers prefer to use — texting, as opposed to the old emails that we dinosaurs grew up on, for example. I remember when email was the [new way to communicate](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/biglaw-chair-recommends-partners-start-texting-associates/). Even if texting doesn’t prompt a return to work, it does show that there’s an understanding of younger lawyer preferences. It is a start, albeit a slow one.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One Biglaw firm is implementing a tool called “Colleague Connect,” which [allows people to know where colleagues are](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/goodwin-office-tracking-technology/). Although it seems a little Big Brother-ish, the goal is to help lawyers connect in real time, regardless of whether they are working a hybrid schedule, working from home, or working in the office all the time. Sure beats that demeaning “bed check” we dinosaurs had and the creative(?) steps we all took to thwart it.

Productivity is down, but rates are rising. According to [this report](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/biglaw-firms-have-too-many-lawyers-with-attorney-productivity-at-an-historic-low/), the annualized average of billable hours for lawyers for the first six months of 2023 is under 1,550 hours. Cringeworthy? Depends on your point of view.

For partners whose income depends upon associates churning hours and hours of billable time, that number is troubling. But for those associates, who may well want to have a life outside of the law firms, that number may signal that it is possible to have a work-life balance.

Remember that we dinosaurs are from a different time (maybe even a different planet), and what has mattered to us during our careers may not have the same value that the younger lawyers prize. There’s nothing wrong with that. Times change, and the profession needs to be able to change with these times. Change is never easy, and our profession is loath to change unless forced to do so.

In a classic Jack Benny skit (Google him) whose comedic persona was a skinflint, he was confronted by a robber who demanded, “[Your money or your life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tVzdUczMT0).” Benny paused for some seconds (audience in hilarity) before responding, “I’m thinking it over.” And that’s what a lot of the younger lawyers are doing: they are thinking over the tradeoffs between the profession and the personal. There’s been an explosion of stress-related mental health issues. Changing how work happens may be one way to help.

# Circuit Court Nominees In The Trump Administration: The Latest News And Rumor (Part 2)

The James R. Browning U.S. Court of Appeals Building, the Ninth Circuit’s headquarters in San Francisco.

Last week, I provided an overview of [circuit court nominations around the country](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-the-latest-news-and-rumor-part-1/) — well, at least part of the country. My earlier story covered the D.C. Circuit, the Federal Circuit, and the regional circuits up to the Sixth Circuit. (If you missed my prior post — which also discussed the nominations process more generally, including the Democrats’ use of blue slips and possible Republican responses — read it [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-the-latest-news-and-rumor-part-1/).)

The post you’re now reading constitutes the sequel, focused on the Seventh Circuit through the Eleventh Circuit. Let’s jump right in.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Seventh Circuit

The Seventh Circuit — one of my favorite federal courts, thanks to intellectual heavyweights and colorful personalities like Judge Richard Posner, Judge Frank Easterbrook, and Chief Judge Diane Wood — now has three vacancies (up from two vacancies as of my [earlier report](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-a-nationwide-round-up/)). The seats belong to — or, to be more precise, are currently associated with — the states of Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois. (For detailed discussion of whether circuit seats can — or should — be “moved” from one state to another, see my story from last week.)

For the Indiana seat, I correctly predicted the nomination of Professor [Amy Coney Barrett](http://law.nd.edu/directory/amy-barrett/) of Notre Dame Law School. I’ll call her the Above the Law readers’ “fan favorite” or “people’s choice,” because I’ve received more praise for her than any other actual or prospective nominee (which is saying a lot, given the impressive nominees being fielded by the Trump administration). Correspondents have shared with me the many enthusiastic letters filed on her behalf, including ones signed by [NDLS faculty](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amy-Coney-Barrett-NDLS-faculty-letter.pdf) (the entire full-time faculty), [NDLS alumni](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amy-Coney-Barrett-NDLS-alumni-letter.pdf) (from across the ideological spectrum), [fellow law professors](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amy-Coney-Barrett-Professors-Letter-of-Support.pdf) (including prominent progressives like Neal Katyal), and [fellow Supreme Court clerks from October Term 1998](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Amy-Coney-Barrett-OT-1998-law-clerks-letter.pdf) (every single living clerk from that Term, also from across the ideological spectrum).

Now, the love for Professor Barrett is not universal. She has come under fire from liberal groups like the [Alliance for Justice](https://www.afj.org/our-work/nominees/amy-coney-barrett) — which shouldn’t be surprising, given that she’s a young female conservative (read: a possible future SCOTUS nominee). But given the robust support for Professor Barrett from both sides of the aisle — just click on the letters linked in the prior paragraph, which are positively glowing — the AFJ and similar groups face an uphill battle.

I’m predicting that Amy Barrett will win confirmation. Word on the street is that Senator Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and his staff grilled Professor Barrett during her interview last Thursday, but she won them over in the end — and Senator Donnelly returned his blue slip earlier this week. Indiana’s other senator, Todd Young, is a Republican, so it should hopefully be smooth sailing for Professor Barrett from here.

For the Wisconsin seat, the oldest circuit-level vacancy in the entire federal judiciary — unfilled since 2010, partly due to partisan wrangling — I’ve heard of two possible (and strong) contenders: [Misha Tseytlin](https://www.doj.state.wi.us/solicitor-general/solicitor-general), a former SCOTUS clerk (Kennedy) and the current Wisconsin solicitor general, and [Michael Brennan](https://www.gwmlaw.com/lawyers/brennan/), a former judge now back in private practice at Gass Weber Mullins. Republican Senator Ron Johnson and Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin have also agreed to [work together](http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/02/finalists-named-us-attorney-milwaukee/101212202/) on recommending possible judicial nominees to President Trump, so their commission could generate additional names.

The Illinois opening is new, created last month when Judge [Ann Claire Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Claire_Williams) took senior status. I’ve heard of at least three high-powered lawyers who have interviewed with the White House for the spot:

- [Dennis Murashko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-murray-bb780b3/), general counsel to Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner;
- [Brian J. Murray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-murray-bb780b3/), a former SCOTUS clerk (Scalia) and former partner in the Chicago office of Jones Day, who recently assumed the role of Deputy Associate Attorney General at the Department of Justice; and
- [Michael Scudder](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/s/scudder-michael-y), a former SCOTUS clerk (Kennedy), former White House and DOJ lawyer, and current partner at Skadden Arps in Chicago.
All three are excellent contenders, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see all three on the federal bench eventually. I also wouldn’t be surprised if the White House sends multiple names to Illinois’s two Democratic senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, and basically says “dealer’s choice.”

My personal guess for who gets the nod? Mike Scudder. He’s held in pretty much universal high regard, he’s extremely well liked, and he’s the oldest of the three — so the time to put him on the bench is now.

Note that there are also [two vacancies](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/current-judicial-vacancies) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). These could be nice consolation prizes for whoever doesn’t make it this time around — and launching pads for a future Seventh Circuit nomination.

Eighth Circuit

There are three open judgeships — a Minnesota seat, a North Dakota seat, and a Nebraska seat — and two have nominees.

As previously reported, Justice [David Stras](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/more-judicial-nominations-from-the-trump-administration/) of the Minnesota Supreme Court has been nominated for the Minnesota seat. Senator Al Franken hasn’t turned in his blue slip — and we hear that Senator Amy Klobuchar is holding on to hers as well, mainly to see what Senator Franken does — but I suspect that Senator Franken will go along in the end.

Justice Stras, a member of Minnesota’s high court since 2010, is amazingly qualified — which might explain his presence on then-candidate Donald Trump’s [Supreme Court shortlist](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/?rf=1). He enjoys what the [Minneapolis Star Tribune](http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-justice-david-stras-trump-s-pick-for-eighth-circuit-ejnoys-broad-swath-of-support/421642283/) describes as a “broad swath of support,” and he won reelection to his current office by a large margin.

On the bench, Justice Stras has sided with liberals as well as conservatives over the years — so although he does move in Federalist Society circles, he is not an ideologue and “not beholden to anyone,” in the words of Faegre Baker Daniels partner [Chuck Webber](https://www.faegrebd.com/chuck-webber). This might explain why three of Justice Stras’s former colleagues on the Minnesota Supreme Court — who could all be [described as “liberal,”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/07/president-trump-continues-to-make-sterling-judicial-nominations/?utm_term=.41b80bed5669) according to Professor Jonathan Adler — wrote a [letter in Stras’s support](http://www.startribune.com/the-case-for-the-nomination-of-david-stras-to-the-federal-courts/426026503/).

Even Senator Franken acknowledged that Justice Stras is “a committed public servant whose tenure as a professor… underscores how much he cares about the law.” The senator did complain that Stras’s selection was “the product of a process that relied heavily on guidance from far-right Washington, D.C.-based special interest groups — rather than through a committee made up of a cross-section of Minnesota’s legal community.” But I think it’s hard to argue that a state high court justice who was reelected in his last race with almost 60 percent of the vote doesn’t enjoy the support of the “Minnesota legal community” — or the people of Minnesota, period.

For the North Dakota seat, the nomination went to U.S. District Court Judge [Ralph R. Erickson](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-latest-legal-luminaries-nominated-for-federal-judgeships-by-president-trump/?rf=1). His Senate Judiciary Committee hearing took place yesterday, and it was nothing short of a [lovefest](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-appeals-court-nominee-wins-bipartisan-praise/article/2629616). The state’s Democratic Senator, Heidi Heitkamp, offered her “highest recommendation,” saying that Judge Erickson “is widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans in my home state.” So expect him to join the Eighth Circuit any day now.

(Also, kudos to Judge Erickson for having the courage to talk openly about his [success in overcoming alcoholism](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-appeals-court-nominee-wins-bipartisan-praise/article/2629616). As we’ve discussed extensively in these pages — see especially the work of columnist [Brian Cuban](https://abovethelaw.com/author/bcuban/), author of [The Addicted Lawyer](http://amzn.to/2sU387y) (affiliate link) — alcoholism and addiction are serious problems in the legal profession. People struggling with these issues should know that there’s nothing wrong with seeking help — and that seeking help won’t prevent them from someday taking the federal bench.)

Finally, for the Nebraska seat, among the three possibilities I previously reported — [Brian Buescher](http://www.kutakrock.com/brian-buescher/), a Georgetown Law grad and partner at Kutak Rock in Omaha; [Steve Grasz](http://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/steve-grasz), a Nebraska Law grad and senior counsel at Husch Blackwell in Omaha; and [Jonathan Papik](https://www.clinewilliams.com/attorneys/jonathan-j-papik.html), a Harvard Law grad and former Silberman/Gorsuch clerk, now practicing at the Cline Williams law firm — it seems that Grasz has the edge right now.

Ninth Circuit

There are four vacant seats — Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Oregon — and no nominees for any of them yet. Let’s go state by state.

Arizona: The onetime frontrunner, former federal prosecutor [Kory Langhofer](http://statecraftlaw.com/attorneys/#kory-langhofer) (who also served as the Trump campaign’s general election lawyer in the state), appears to no longer be the frontrunner — and might even be out of the running altogether, at least for now. It’s not clear why, but it might relate to a controversial matter he’s currently handling that could complicate his confirmation. The complication might go away eventually, and Langhofer’s supporters view the situation as unfair to him, but for the time being, it’s too… complicating.

Will the White House pick someone else from the list generated by Arizona’s (two Republican) senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake — namely, Magistrate Judge [Bridget Bade](https://ballotpedia.org/Bridget_S._Bade), AUSA [Dominic Lanza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-lanza-a8b7265/), or Justice [Ann Scott Timmer](https://www.azcourts.gov/meetthejustices/Justice-Ann-A-Scott-Timmer) of the Arizona Supreme Court? It’s possible, although right now unlikely; the White House isn’t in love with any of them. (Bade or Lanza could get appointed to the district court, which has two open seats.)

With Kory Langhofer out of the running, some new names have emerged. Leading the pack is [James Burnham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-burnham-2368b89/). He currently works in Washington, where he serves as senior associate White House counsel, but he grew up in Arizona, where his parents are both [prominent practicing lawyers](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/fashion/weddings/18Mittelstaedt.html). He’s at the top of the list, thanks to the White House colleagues’ trust in him and his gilded résumé: U. Chicago Law, a Ninth Circuit clerkship with Judge Alex Kozinski, and several years at Trump’s go-to firm of Jones Day (where he [earned more than $800,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-trump-white-house-lawyers-how-much-are-they-worth-part-2/) in his last year or so, while still an associate).

Burnham is young, still in his 30s — but so was his former boss, Judge Kozinski, so that’s not a dealbreaker. It’s his current position in the White House Counsel’s office that could pose the biggest obstacle; Democrats will take full advantage of the chance to interrogate a White House lawyer, under oath, about Russia, the travel ban, or any other legal bees in their bonnet. But Burnham should be able to invoke various forms of privilege to dodge any questions not to his liking.

Some might detect shades of “Dick Cheney” in terms of Burnham overseeing the selection and vetting of Ninth Circuit candidates, as a White House lawyer, only to become a nominee himself. But Burnham didn’t suggest himself for it in the first instance; after Kory Langhofer fell out of the picture, other players in the process drafted Burnham, aware of his credentials and Arizona ties. So while he certainly faces challenges — his youth, his work generally in the Trump administration, and his work specifically on judicial nominations — Burnham should be confirmable. (As I noted on Friday, if John K. Bush could win confirmation to the Sixth Circuit, despite a Louis Vuitton steamer set of [baggage](https://thinkprogress.org/senate-set-to-confirm-unhinged-right-wing-blogger-to-powerful-court-fbcf89511efd), it’s hard to imagine who can’t make it through — setting aside blue slips, which shouldn’t be a problem for Burnham in a state with two Republican senators.)

Besides James Burnham, here are three other options:

- [Dominic Draye](https://www.azag.gov/press-release/ag-brnovich-appoints-solicitor-general): Like Burnham, Draye has a strong CV. He currently serves as state SG, a favorite hunting ground of this White House for judicial nominees, and he previously worked at Kirkland & Ellis. He’s a graduate of Penn Law and a former law clerk to a conservative stalwart, Judge Edith Jones of the Fifth Circuit
- [Michael Liburdi](https://apps.law.asu.edu/Apps/Faculty/Faculty.aspx?individual_id=394): Now the general counsel to Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, Liburdi was previously a partner at Snell & Wilmer. He has strong Arizona ties: he graduated from Arizona State for both college and law school, and he clerked for the Arizona Supreme Court.
- [John R. Lopez IV](https://www.azcourts.gov/meetthejustices/Justice-John-R-Lopez-IV): Justice Lopez, Dominic Draye’s predecessor as Arizona SG, joined the Arizona Supreme Court at the start of this year. Like Liburdi, he graduated from ASU for law school and clerked for the Arizona Supreme Court.
So that’s the Arizona situation. But don’t expect a nomination anytime soon. The selection and vetting process take time under normal circumstances, and in light of Senator John McCain’s recent diagnosis of brain cancer, nobody is rushing things, out of deference to the state’s senior senator.

California: I previously [mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/circuit-court-nominees-in-the-trump-administration-a-nationwide-round-up/2/) noted appellate lawyer [Jeremy Rosen](http://www.horvitzlevy.com/index.cfm/attorneys/bio/?id=40) of Horvitz & Levy and prominent prosecutor [Kathryn Haun](https://law.stanford.edu/directory/kathryn-haun/) as two possibilities. Both interviewed for the post with the White House — which apparently has interviewed as many as two dozen people for this judgeship.

Upon information and belief, the following individuals have also interviewed for the spot: [Kenneth K. Lee](https://jenner.com/people/KennethLee), a partner at Jenner & Block in Los Angeles and former associate White House counsel; [Paul J. Beard](https://www.alston.com/en/professionals/b/beard-paul-j), a counsel at Alston & Bird in Sacramento and former principal attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF); and Judge [James Rogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Rogan) of the California Superior Court (and formerly of the U.S. House of Representatives).

[World Net Daily](http://www.wnd.com/2017/07/trump-expected-to-name-rogan-to-9th-circuit/) identifies Rogan as the frontrunner, but… the site [has its detractors](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/07/20/senate_confirms_john_k_bush_anti_gay_blogger_to_the_6th_circuit.html). Also, Rogan turns 60 next month, and as I’ve observed repeatedly in these pages, this White House is youth-focused in its judicial appointments. On the other hand, given California’s two Democratic senators, Rogan’s age might not be as disqualifying as it would otherwise be — and could even be a plus. Note how Judge [Carlos Bea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Bea) joined the Ninth Circuit at age 69 — and is still going strong, as an active rather than senior judge. So World Net Daily might actually be right here.

Personally speaking, however, I favor someone more in the mold of the other four possibilities mentioned here — Paul Beard, Katie Haun, Ken Lee, or Jeremy Rosen. They fit the White House playbook: youthful, well credentialed, and conservative but not off-puttingly so (but again, even the arguably off-putting, like controversial blogger [John K. Bush](https://thinkprogress.org/senate-set-to-confirm-unhinged-right-wing-blogger-to-powerful-court-fbcf89511efd), can still win confirmation). Any of the four would be a fine addition to a bench that, despite some [movement to the center](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/is-the-nutty-ninth-circuit-coming-to-its-senses/) in recent years, often finds itself far out in left field.

Would California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris return their blue slips for one of these individuals? It’s tough to tell, but one can hope. The four lawyers I’ve mentioned above are all outstanding, and many are diverse as well. (Paul Beard is Latino — note his [membership](https://www.alston.com/en/professionals/b/beard-paul-j) in the Hispanic National Bar Association — Kathryn Haun is female, and Ken Lee is Asian-American.)

Senator Feinstein has been reasonable on judicial nominees in the past, even nominees whose views she might disagree with — note Judge Leslie Southwick’s admiring discussion of her in his (fascinating) memoir, [The Nominee](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/give-this-man-a-federal-judgeship-a-review-of-the-nominee-by-leslie-southwick/). And Senator Harris, if she has aspirations for higher office, would want to develop a reputation as a reasonable legislator who can work across the aisle. But Democratic senators face heavy pressure from left-wing groups when it comes to judicial nominations, so we shall see.

Hawaii: I previously praised the frontrunner (or only runner?) for this seat, Carlsmith Ball partner [Michael Purpura](http://www.carlsmith.com/pages/michael-m-purpura), as a great pick. The Trump administration did in fact offer the nomination to Purpura, but he declined it for personal reasons, choosing to remain in private practice. It’s not clear who will take his place — but there should be no shortage of takers for a Ninth Circuit seat in the tropical paradise of Hawaii.

Oregon: I’m not aware of any new developments since I [identified](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/some-possible-nominee-names-for-the-ninth-circuit/) [Ryan Bounds](http://pioneercourthouse.org/board-members-bios.html), a current federal prosecutor and former Main Justice official, as the likely pick for the seat held by his (and my) former boss, Judge Diarmuid F. O’Scannlain. Bounds has a superb CV, a long history in government service, and the [enthusiastic backing](http://cni.pmgnews.com/documents/artdocs/00003582721950.pdf) of Representative Greg Walden, the only Republican in Oregon’s congressional delegation.

Some have [speculated](http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/365939-246838-uncertainty-swirls-around-trump-nominations) whether the apparent delay in nominating Ryan Bounds might mean the administration is having second thoughts on his selection. But I’m aware of no such change of heart at the White House, and the delay is not unusual; more than a dozen circuit court seats, including all four Ninth Circuit spots, still need nominees. (And remember the point I made last week, citing [Ron Klain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-one-area-where-trump-has-been-wildly-successful/2017/07/19/56c5c7ee-6be7-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.html?utm_term=.a5cb1f700541): when you look at the numbers, this White House compares favorably to prior ones regarding the pace of judicial nominations.)

Oregon has two democratic senators, Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden. Will they use their blue slips to obstruct a Ryan Bounds nomination? I hope not, given Bounds’s longstanding public service, especially his work prosecuting environmental crimes. If the senators were to try and stop an immensely qualified nominee who has spent most of his career in government service, then it speaks volumes about the state of politics in our nation. As our president might tweet, “Sad!”

Tenth Circuit

There’s one current vacancy on the Tenth Circuit in Colorado, the former seat of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, and one anticipated vacancy in New Mexico, the seat to be vacated by Judge [Paul Kelly](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b5f52821-424a-42cd-897a-ebd01664f01a).

I’m not aware of any new developments since my last reporting. As I predicted, Justice [Allison Eid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_H._Eid) of the Colorado Supreme Court was nominated to fill the Gorsuch seat. She’s incredibly qualified — note her presence on the [Trump SCOTUS shortlist](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/?rf=1) — and very popular in her home state. She has been a member of Colorado’s high court since 2006, and she won her last election with a whopping [75 percent of the vote](http://data.denverpost.com/election/results/supreme-court/2008/).

Will she get confirmed? My prediction is yes. Republican Senator Cory Gardner strongly supports Justice Eid, whom he has known [for almost two decades](https://coloradopolitics.com/allision-eid-michael-bennet-court/), so it all comes down to Democratic Senator Michael Bennet and whether he’ll return his blue slip.

On the nomination of Neil Gorsuch, a fellow Coloradan, Senator Bennet took a compromise position: he opposed a filibuster, but ultimately voted against the nomination. But that was a national position, and Senator Bennet confronted tremendous pressure from his fellow Democrats to maintain a united front. For a regional position like a Tenth Circuit seat, it will be very difficult for Senator Bennet to come up with a reason for opposing an obviously qualified, exceedingly popular, longstanding member of his own state’s highest court.

As for the New Mexico seat, my understanding remains [unchanged](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/more-judicial-nominations-from-the-trump-administration/): it’s between Judge [James O. Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_O._Browning), of the U.S. District Court for New Mexico, and Judge [J. Miles Hanisee](https://ballotpedia.org/J._Miles_Hanisee), of the New Mexico Court of Appeals. Both enjoy strong support from the local bar; Judge Hanisee is younger. (If you’d like to learn more about Judge Hanisee, see these interviews of him conducted by Emil Kiehne of the New Mexico Appellate Law Blog, in [2012](http://nmappellatelaw.com/interview-with-judge-j-miles-hanisee-of-the-nm-court-of-appeals/) and again in [2014](http://nmappellatelaw.com/interview-with-judge-hanisee/).)

Eleventh Circuit

For the current vacancy, out of Alabama, [Kevin Newsom](https://www.bradley.com/people/n/newsom-kevin-c), chair of the appellate group at Bradley Arant in Birmingham, should be confirmed very soon. He got voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by an overwhelming [18-2 margin](http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202792946776/Judiciary-Committee-Advances-Newsom-Nomination-to-Full-Senate) — an especially impressive feat given our polarized times, but not surprising given his reputation and credentials.

There’s a new anticipated opening out of Georgia, the seat being vacated by Judge [Frank Hull](http://sdfla.blogspot.com/2017/07/judge-frank-hull-to-take-senior-status.html). Judge Hull announced her — yes, [her](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2004/07/_general_commen.html) — retirement plans just this month.

It’s still early in the process, so I’ll be brief. There are many names in the mix — including, but not limited to, Justices [Keith Blackwell](http://www.gasupreme.us/court-information/biographies/justice-keith-r-blackwell/), [Britt Grant](http://www.gasupreme.us/court-information/biographies/justice-britt-c-grant/), and [Nels Peterson](http://www.gasupreme.us/court-information/biographies/justice-nels-s-d-peterson/), of the Georgia Supreme Court; Chief Judge [Stephen Dillard](http://www.gaappeals.us/biography/bio_judges.php?jname=Stephen%20Dillard) and Judge [Elizabeth (Lisa) Branch](http://www.gaappeals.us/biography/bio_judges.php?jname=elizabeth%20l.%20branch), of the Georgia Court of Appeals; and Dean [Peter B. “Bo” Rutledge](http://www.law.uga.edu/profile/peter-b-bo-rutledge), of the University of Georgia School of Law.

UPDATE (7/28/2017, 11:55 p.m.): I accidentally omitted Justice [David Nahmias](http://www.gasupreme.us/court-information/biographies/justice-david-e-nahmias/) of the Georgia Supreme Court from my list of Eleventh Circuit possibilities (although whether he or any of the others are interested is a separate question; for now I’m just identifying “names in the mix,” opposed to candidates going through the interview and vetting process).

Have you heard any other names for this vacancy, or any other vacancy throughout the federal judiciary? Might you have interesting comments or important corrections to any of my reporting? If so, please reach out [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Judicial%20Nominations) (subject line: “Judicial Nominations”) or by text message (646-820-8477, including the words “Judicial Nominations” somewhere in your text, so it will come up when I search my (clogged) inbox). Thanks!

UPDATE (7/27/2017, 12:50 p.m.): Two additional items:

1. On the issue of “moving” a seat, I previously wrote, “circuit seats are regional positions — circuit judges hear appeals from multiple states throughout their circuit, and no statutory or constitutional provision allocates judgeships on a state-by-state basis.”

This is true, insofar as no statute specifies how many circuit judges each state gets, but it is subject to a constraint. Per [28 U.S. Code § 44](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/44), “In each circuit (other than the Federal judicial circuit) there shall be at least one circuit judge in regular active service appointed from the residents of each state in that circuit.”

As a practical matter, it’s not much of a constraint — but it should be kept in mind, especially for states with small populations and few circuit judges.

2. For detailed bios of the nominees and analysis of their judicial records (where applicable), check out [The Vetting Room](https://vettingroom.org/about/), “a project dedicated to examining and analyzing the records of President Trump’s judicial nominations.”

# Layoff Season Rears Its Ugly Head Across Biglaw
## How will your firm handle the turmoil of sluggish demand?

It all started with news of [hiring freezes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/) and [waves](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-junior-associates-top-20-biglaw-firm-cooley/) of [stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/) at some of the most successful Biglaw firms before stories of outright layoffs began to emerge, [one](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) after the [other](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) after the [other](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/stroock-layoffs/). What does this mean for associates in the first quarter of 2023?

It’s officially layoff season.

Top Am Law firms are looking to “rightsize” their firms and control attorney headcount and costs during a time of sluggish demand for legal services, but they’d like to avoid the bad publicity that goes hand in hand with conducting layoffs en masse. After all, no Biglaw firm wants their brand name to become a layoff-related verb (this happened to Latham when the firm [laid off 440 people](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/06/how-did-latham-become-the-poster-child-for-layoffs/) in February 2009). What’s a financially struggling firm to do?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Biglaw firms must now decide whether they’ll attempt to save face by offering complete transparency when announcing open layoffs or conduct stealth layoffs in secrecy. It can be a difficult decision for law firm leadership to make.

On one hand, law firms that have recently announced large-scale layoffs have been lauded for their honesty, putting a somewhat positive PR spin on what would otherwise be terrible news. On the other hand, conducting stealth layoffs means never having to say you’re sorry — to employees or the press.

That being said, help us help you. Now that layoffs are trending among top Biglaw firms, we expect there may be many more to come. Please keep Above the Law in mind when attorneys are suddenly let go and the firm insists there’ve been no layoffs. Please report outright layoffs to Above the Law as soon as possible so we can keep tabs on the Am Law 200 and beyond.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477).

Flame. On.

Bob Seely is a Tory member of parliament from the Isle of Wight and — taking advantage of the parliamentary privilege shielding members from defamation to allow a fulsome debate — Seely went OFF on lawyers representing organs of the Russian government and padding Putin’s pockets.

Not just “firms.” This guy names INDIVIDUAL LAWYERS!

Well. This is spicy. Conservative MP Bob Seely makes the most of parliamentary privilege to name individual London lawyers working for Russian oligarchs and questions their morality. [pic.twitter.com/Cq6XoNvBLR](https://t.co/Cq6XoNvBLR)

According to our mates at Legal Cheek, who are [all over this from the UK perspective](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/03/legal-twitter-defends-law-firms-called-out-by-mp-over-alleged-russian-links/), these attorneys are all “CMS, Carter-Ruck and Harbottle & Lewis, as well as a barrister from Matrix Chambers.”

Oligarchs, Putin’s henchmen… teaming up with amoral lawyers. These firms set up a one-stop corruption shop to offer a form of legalised intimidation to silence their rivals but also journalists and authors, but also an unstructured and unregulated private eye business which is now collecting kompromat on people in this country.

I don’t blame lawyers for seeking money in happier times. But the failure here, as Seely explains, is with the government. There were opportunities to block this kind of work and no one wanted to take them. Part of that is the thought that — like with China and Iran (pre-Trump) — intertwining the economy with Europe and the United States can be an instrument of containment if not reform. But with the global liberal order all blown to hell under Trump, Putin’s clearly decided to try to cash in on Western goodwill and found it lacking.

From the Legal Cheek article:

Barrister Vishal Misra of Great James Street Chambers said naming the lawyers and their law firms in this way was “reprehensible behaviour”.

Oh, fuck you.

Mishra himself is pretty young, but there’s a cult of attorneys — skewing a little old — claiming that the new generation is soft but this is the snowflakiest stuff ever. If you don’t want to be called out for representing a war criminal, and I say this with all respect, don’t represent war criminals. Analogies to criminal defendants are such bunk. Representing a defendant against the awesome power of the state has detached nobility. Signing off on oil futures so a dictator can build hypersonic nukes doesn’t. It’s an insult to the profession to pretend these are the same.

# How Generative AI Works (Part II)
## Some key concepts related to Generative AI and ChatGPT to help attorneys grasp the essential concepts that make it work.

[Last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/how-generative-ai-works-part-i/), I discussed how important it is for attorneys to understand the inner workings of Generative AI tools, including ChatGPT.

I compared how the index at the back of a book is a great metaphor to explain how full-text search engines work, and I covered how incorporating structure within a search index improves search results. Defining terms such as “compensatory damages” in the search index provides better results, as does adding other intelligence to the text, such as incorporating synonyms from a thesaurus.

And lastly, I explained how “plain English” searching was an early application of natural language processing, pioneered in the legal industry.

This month, I’ll walk through more analogies to explain some key concepts related to Generative AI and ChatGPT to help attorneys grasp the essential concepts that make it work.

Note: Generative AI is well nuanced. A data scientist steeped in machine learning and artificial intelligence can provide deeper and more technically accurate explanations.

Type Ahead On Your Smartphone And ChatGPT

Who has ever received (or sent) a funny or perhaps embarrassing text message in which a smartphone autocorrected a word? Most everyone who texts has pushed send a moment too early!

In addition to autocorrect, most smartphones also have a “type ahead” feature that provides three suggestions for the next word in a text message. It’s  also often the source of many autocorrect errors.

So what does “type ahead” have to do ChatGPT?

Both are Generative AI. They both generate content.

When someone texts their spouse and says, “Hey, I’m out walking the <______>”, the smarthone may suggest:

“Dog”

“Daisy” (if your dog’s name is Daisy)

“Kids”

The smartphone is simply guessing, based upon probabilities, the likely next word to be typed.  My dog was named Daisy, so “Daisy” would come up as a suggestion for me in the context of texting my wife to explain that I was walking.

ChatGPT is also a Generative AI that creates content. When you type a question into ChatGPT, it behaves like type ahead on a smartphone, but at massive scale. It generates the first word, then the second word, and so on until it answers the question. ChatGPT does this based upon probabilities and vectors that form a set of connections similar to neurons in a brain — a neural network, if you will. And because the AI has been trained at such massive scale, it “guesses” extremely well.

To oversimplify, an attorney can first visualize a massive decision tree. But rather than a decision tree, the attorney should think about the tree having many decision points that are interconnected so the path navigated is not linear.

The result is a striking ability to generate content that is a meaningful to a human and that can be remarkably accurate.

GPT 3.5 Turbo has over 175 billion parameters (GPT-4 is measured in trillions of parameters). A parameter can be loosely thought of as a decision point in the neural network. And the parameters help ChatGPT create language similar to the way a smartphone can suggest three-word options in the type-ahead feature.

Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models use billions of examples of language to extract and catalog greater intelligence and relationships between words. Similar to the earlier mention of how a search index can be enhanced with synonyms from a thesaurus, LLMs are enhanced with many other attributes that provide additional intelligence and relationships between words. An LLM catalogs items including:

- Grammar and language structure. Sentences have a subject and a predicate, adjectives typically precede nouns in English and describe the noun. Multiple sentences form a paragraph.
- How a word is used in language. Is a word a noun? A verb? An adjective? All of the above?
- Word meaning. The word “green” for example has many meanings. It can be a color, it can mean “inexperienced,” etc.
- It understands context. The word green may mean a color when it is closely related to a word like “paint,” “art,” or “grass.”
- Proper names. Microsoft, Bill Clinton, Shakira, Cincinnati, and Veuve Clicquot are all recognized as proper names or “entities.”
- Emotions like frustration or infatuation, positive or negative feelings, or types of humor such as sarcasm, are discernible and categorized.
The result is the ability to mathematically relate the meaning of a plain language questions entered into ChatGPT (Input) and construct a response that comes across as a meaningful answer (Output).

Tokens

Unlike the smartphone analogy, ChatGPT actually works on parts of words. The parts of words are called “tokens.”  It is another simplification, but think of a token as the root of a word.

“Creat” is the “root” of many words including Create, Creative, Creator, Creating, and Creation. “Create” would be an example of a token. For real examples of tokens, click [here](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer).

When a user inputs a question into ChatGPT, the question is broken down into tokens for processing.  Those word parts are then compared to the LLM that contains the billions of parameters (neural network) to create the Output.

GPT Defined

The “GPT” in ChatGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. In this article, I’ve covered the Generative aspect of ChatGPT; ChatGPT generates content.

I’ve also covered in a simple way, the idea of the Transformer in ChatGPT. The LLM, neural network of parameters, and the concept of tokens provide a basic understanding of the components of the Transformer that takes user Input and transforms it into Output.

I have yet to cover the “P” or Pre-Trained aspect of ChatGPT. Without training and the ability for the algorithm to learn, Generative AI systems like ChatGPT would answer many questions incorrectly, spew nonsense, hate, and hallucinate.

The training of ChatGPT is what really separates it from other Generative AI solutions.

Few people have heard of Meta’s Galactica LLM, even though it was released in demo form two weeks prior to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Why? Because it was pulled down just three days later, after its responses exhibited bias and spewed nonsense. Galactica’s AI training was not as good as ChatGPT’s, and consumers of Galactica got to see the nonsense firsthand.

Next month, I’ll cover the techniques of training Generative AI, and how training made ChatGPT the fastest-growing consumer application in history.

# Barnes & Thornburg Partner From Loony MyPillow Suit 'No Longer With The Firm'
## Live by the pillow, die by the pillow.

Barnes & Thornburg appears to have wasted no time in trying to repair its reputation after a Minneapolis partner dragged the firm’s name into Mike Lindell’s latest round of nonsensical legal ranting.

The firm says partner Alec Beck, who signed on as local counsel in the suit, is “no longer with the firm,” figuratively smothered out of his job by firm leaders wielding the unparalleled comfort and softness of a pillow not made by a recovering crackhead with a questionable grip on reality.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Late last night, firm management became aware of the filing of the complaint, which was done without receiving firm authorization pursuant to internal firm approval procedures,” a Barnes & Thornburg spokesperson said Friday. “While the firm cannot comment substantively on pending matters, the firm is immediately taking the requisite steps to withdraw as local counsel in this matter and end the client relationship. The attorney representing the client in this matter is no longer with the firm.”

Whether he was fired or resigned isn’t spelled out but we don’t really need a lot of help to read between the lines of this statement.

It may be unfair to tie this whole affair to broader themes of law firm management, but events like these make one wonder about the transition of law firms from collegial, lockstep partner compensation models from yesteryear to the more complex, performance-linked models of today. The latter have made firms more competitive and almost assuredly more profitable, but it also invites the sort of “fiefdom” approach that leads to satellite office partners throwing the firm into lawsuits to earn some cash for themselves even if those suits are damaging to the firm as a whole. Internal control measures can never perfectly police the divided loyalties that come with worrying about your own pocket and the firm’s at the same time.

That’s not to say that firms should turn back the clock necessarily. Paying partners what they’re worth improves the firm over the long haul. But it’s just a reminder that modernization is not without its downsides.

# Milbank Proves The Only Thing Better Than One Raise Is Two Raises
## Every Biglaw associate who gets a raise this year should say thank you to Milbank.

No one puts Milbank in a corner. After starting the latest round of Biglaw raises [almost a full month ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/), Milbank has made it clear — [repeatedly ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/)— that they are committed to paying their associates at the very top of the market (and pushes the rest of Biglaw to pay associates what they deserve). That hasn’t changed just because Cravath took the Milbank raises and came over the top for some classes of associates.

So of course Biglaw’s first mover is re-raising the salaries of midlevel and senior associates to the new market level. Effective January 1, associates at the firm will be paid on the updated Milbank/Cravath scale as follows:



You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/milbank-re-raise-23/2/)

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Virtually every firm that I’ve spoken with has pegged three [days in the office] as their ideal and they’re all really struggling. They’re finding that their partners especially really do not want to come back into the office and they’re not quite sure what to do with it.

— [Jeffrey Lowe](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/jeffrey-lowe), global practice leader of the law firm practice at Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/06/14/big-law-firms-in-dc-struggling-with-how-to-approach-in-office-policies/) on the resistance Biglaw partners have been showing to office attendance mandates.

When people think of financial claims, breaches of contract, and celebrities courting trouble, they usually think of lawsuits. Outside of trial by combat — [and his mommy telling him to stop](https://bloodyelbow.com/2023/06/28/elon-musk-wants-to-fight-mama-hates-it/) — we usually think of Elon settling his legal troubles in court. This time, he may have to settle matters in a different way. From Reuters:

A $90 million legal clash between Elon Musk and the law firm that helped force him to complete his $44 billion buyout of Twitter should be heard by arbitrators rather than in court for now, a California state judge said in a ruling on Tuesday.

Judge Richard Ulmer of San Francisco Superior Court agreed with law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz that “the parties clearly and unmistakably” agreed to let an arbitrator decide which claims, if any, are subject to arbitration.

I am sure that this decision rests purely on the facts of the case and is not Judge Ulmer’s polite way of saying, “I don’t want to deal with this shit.” I’d do the same if I were asked to preside over two parties fighting to the death over pennies. Sure $90 million sounds a lot in the abstract, but this a firm asking for a pittance for work they did on a $44 billion dollar deal from a man with a net worth of [$255.7 billion ](https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/?list=billionaires&sh=327608247999)according to Forbes. That $90 million is either ~.20% of the Twitter deal or .0351974971% of Elon’s net worth. Here’s further context — if you’re some entry-level Biglaw associate making $200,000 a year, being sued for .0351974971% of your net worth would be about $70. You going to court for that? I doubt it.

But hey, this is the guy who got his sycophants to cheer him on [for misquoting someone trying to put a dent in world hunger to own the libs](https://futurism.com/elon-musk-world-hunger-tweet). Talk about a penny pincher.

# Global Strategies For Returning To Work Post-COVID
## PLI is addressing many of these pressing issues in a riveting and fast-paced session.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forever altered the way we do business around the world. Among the biggest changes has been the shift in both where employees perform their work and how they interact with their employers. In many places, remote work is now the norm, even in industries that never considered it a viable option just a few years ago.

Now, as the dust starts to settle and we slowly emerge from pandemic-related restrictions, some multinational organizations are starting to backtrack on remote work. Some are revisiting the mechanisms they put in place at the height of the pandemic, altering their stance on telecommuting or eliminating the option entirely, while others are adopting hybrid approaches that involve some amount of in-person work.

As employers implement the transition back to the physical workplace, employees understandably have a lot of questions. PLI is addressing many of these pressing issues in a one-hour program, [Worldwide Return-to-Work Initiatives After COVID: Global Strategies for Multinationals Reintegrating Staff Into Their Workplaces](https://www.pli.edu/programs/worldwide-return-to-work-initiatives-after-covid--global-strategies-for-multinationals-reintegrating-staff-into-their-workplaces?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

The session will tackle some hot-button questions related to the return to physical work on a global scale, including:

- Should employees returning to physical worksites be able to telecommute more than they did prior to the pandemic?
- How can an employer revamp or relax height-of-the-pandemic workplace safety precautions, such as vaccine screening, mask mandates, and exposure notifications?  
- How should an employer communicate in order to convince staff that the workplace is safe?
- How does a multinational employer align its return-to-worksite initiatives across borders?
This riveting and fast-paced session will offer global strategies for multinational employers looking to get staff back to the workplace post-pandemic, including a discussion of the potential legal risks involved.

It is recommended for HR professionals at multinational employers, workplace safety professionals, and in-house and law firm lawyers who advise multinational clients on employment law and HR compliance.

# Is It Doom and Gloom For the 2024 Legal Market?
## Market and political forces, such as elections and peer firm hiring, play a role in law firm hiring.

With the experiences of the 2020 pandemic, and 2009, still situated in the back of the minds of many seasoned recruiters, a quarterly retraction of lateral moves can often elicit a knee-jerk response to start prognosticating the next legal market crisis before it even happens. As we’ve often pointed out in the past, these downturns are part of a complicated calculus of law firm hiring that involves the entanglement of market and political forces, including elections, peer firm hiring, internal productivity, and a vast array of other inputs. Moreover, the lateral market itself is an imperfect indicator, often lagging months and months behind true market trends.

These forces tend to balance themselves out in the long run as well, global market disruptions notwithstanding. For example, as [one article ](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1824310)noted, litigation hiring dropped precipitously from Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, by 24%. However, if we look at lateral demand in Q1 of 2024, litigation is trending up in “public” demand over the last three years. Publicly posted jobs did dip by 10.7% from Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, but using this data to estimate the full extent of lateral demand is problematic for several reasons.

Chief among these reasons is that many lateral opportunities are not publicized. Firms may be willing to be opportunistic for the right candidate, but not willing to expend the effort and manpower to wade through hundreds of lateral candidate resumes. They also may not want to be inundated by emails from recruiting firms they’ve never worked with and don’t know their track record of success. This gap between public job listings and true market activity highlights the indispensable role of a reputable and well-connected legal recruiter who can find these opportunities and advocate on your behalf, to get your resume in front of the firm’s key decision-makers.



Litigation aside, overall market conditions have macroscopically continued to improve over the last nine years. The data is noisy given the comparative dearth of lateral moves during the pandemic and the subsequent feast, and we expect a somewhat contemplative period as firms ensure stability after an unprecedented period of lateral movement. Associate movement is often a more sensitive barometer for market conditions as associate laterals take less time to execute and associates represent relatively fixed costs compared to their partner counterparts, who represent profit centers.

Nonetheless, in the first quarter of 2024, there were 1,578 associate moves, maintaining a level of stability that closely mirrors the 1,618 movements from last year’s first quarter This consistency allays some immediate concerns of a market slowdown and instead points to a robust demand for legal talent that has continued unabated. The first quarter of 2024 saw an impressive 809 partner moves, an increase from 721 in the same period the previous year. This trend is a strong indicator of ongoing strategic growth within law firms and a continued valuation of experienced legal expertise and new business.



Promotional trends within firms only further underscore this optimistic outlook. In early 2024, a striking 1,897 associates were promoted to partner, closely aligning with the 1,958 promotions from the year before. Additionally, a record 1,039 attorneys were promoted to counsel roles, the highest number recorded in the six years.



Another reason we expect 2024 will continue to grow at a sensible pace, is the upcoming election. Firms with entrenched corporate practices will likely be looking for post-November clarity on market conditions before committing to expansive hiring. Should firms feel optimistic, this will likely lead to a cascade of lateral movement after the election – all the more reason to get started now before you get lost in the shuffle.

With such granular demand that differs by specialty, market conditions, and experience, your best bet for making a lateral move is to team up with an experienced recruiter who can help you optimize your chances of success. At Lateral Link, we specialize our deep connections, our extensive track record of success, with profound market insights to give you a competitive edge in achieving your goals in career success.

Associates who are two to three years out of law school are lovely people, and their mothers are very proud of them, but they’re not terribly helpful to me.

— An [in-house lawyer](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/in-house-counsel/) during a panel on [ediscovery](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/tag-ediscovery/) at the [2016 Annual Meeting](https://www.accmeetings.com/am16/agenda.aspx?_ga=1.190435179.1789950044.1474032089) of the Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC), explaining that good paralegals are often more useful (and cheaper) than junior associates when it comes to document review and document production in litigation.

We want it to be fully reflective of what the law school population is, so there’s more work to be done. But I think we have reached the point now—and I think you are seeing the fruits of that effort over a 20- or 25-year period—in terms of now seeing more women in our partnership classes year in and year out. We’re talent driven. We want to bring in the best people.

— [Faiza Saeed](https://www.cravath.com/fsaeed/), the first woman to serve as presiding partner of Cravath, commenting on the progress the white-shoe firm has made when it comes to [promoting women and ensuring that diversity is present](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/22/high-end-ma-meets-a-new-challenge-too-many-white-men/) among its associate and partnership ranks. In November 2018, Cravath announced an [all-women partnership class](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/cravath-announces-all-women-class-of-new-partners/).

# Bridging The Well-Being Gap From Law School To Lawyering
## Attorney well-being has been in crisis for decades, even before the pandemic. Happily, our profession finally is making a broader push to address well-being in a more comprehensive way.

“Change will require a wide-eyed and candid assessment of our members’ state of being, accompanied by courageous commitment to reenvisioning what it means to live the life of a lawyer.” – [ABA National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/ThePathToLawyerWellBeingReportRevFINAL.pdf)

Attorney well-being has been in crisis for decades, even before a pandemic forced us to Google “Zoom fatigue” to understand the novel forms of exhaustion we experience daily. Happily, our profession finally is making a broader push to address well-being in a more comprehensive way, starting in law school and continuing through practice. Practising Law Institute (PLI) is proud to be part of that effort with our inaugural [Professional Development Appreciation Month](https://bit.ly/3ncPrZu) and additional new programs focused on attorney well-being.

Until recent years, attorney wellness often meant little more than practicing unimpaired. Informal efforts to address attorney substance use [go as far back as the late 1960s](http://www.nylat.org/publications/articles/documents/HistoryofLAP.pdf), with the ABA beginning to call for what would later become state Lawyer Assistance Programs in the late 1980s. Today, there are bar dues-funded Lawyer Assistance Programs in [all 50 states and D.C.](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state/) It wasn’t until well into the 2000s, however, that bar associations, law firms and law schools also began to address well-being for the broader population of law students and lawyers facing life challenges other than substance use disorders.

This timeline matches my personal experience. In the late ‘90s and early 2000s, associate well-being in Big Law was measured almost exclusively by whether we billed our hours, produced good work, made our bonuses, and didn’t burn out and quit. Substance use and mental health issues were discussed only if they impacted the quality of our work, and those conversations came with a healthy dose of shame.

In other words, the reward system was frequently centered around whether you were meeting external, firm-centered goals rather than your own internal career and life goals. This conflict too often resulted in the worst of both worlds – neither attorney well-being nor long-term retention and development of highly competent practitioners.

Even when some firms formalized associate development, taking steps to track career milestones and create mentorship programs, those metrics and relationships were centered around helping associates get training in the technical aspects of lawyering appropriate to their seniority. It was too often luck of the draw whether you happened to work for a partner who cared about anything beyond whether she could trust you to take a deposition or create a deal checklist. Goals like a sustainable work-life balance and healthy stress management were wholly up to the individual to pursue – or, all too often, to simply ignore.

That approach is changing with more systematic efforts in recent years by law schools, bar associations and the Professional Development community to address well-being for all attorneys and law students. [Efforts include](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/ThePathToLawyerWellBeingReportRevFINAL.pdf) “eliminating the stigma associated with help-seeking behaviors [and] emphasizing that well-being is an indispensable part of a lawyer’s duty of competence.” These efforts also recognize the unique challenges faced by lawyers who are members of communities impacted by systemic racism and other forms of discrimination.

The link between well-being and competence is particularly relevant to the transition from law school to practice. As a new attorney, it can be far too easy to get caught up in those firm-centered goals and metrics for success and neglect your own well-being, to the detriment of both your long-term career and personal life. As executive coach to lawyers (and former Big Law partner) [Rudhir Krishtel](https://www.krishtel.com/) [says](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications/after-the-bar/personal-life/to-young-lawyers-practicing-mindfulness/), “As lawyers, we will drop everything to service our clients. Do we do the same for ourselves? My advice: Put the oxygen mask on yourself before others. It could save your life – and it will definitely make you a happier and more successful lawyer.”

PLI’s mission is to keep attorneys at the forefront of legal knowledge and expertise. That will never change. But what is changing is the legal profession’s broader understanding of a well-trained lawyer: someone who can remain healthy and productive for the long term.

At PLI, we are working to fulfill this goal, as well. Our Bridge-the-Gap programs cover the ethics and skills CLE training that new attorneys need. New and upcoming programs focused on attorney well-being include the upcoming live webcast [Taking Control of Your Well-Being: Mental Health and Wellness for Attorneys](https://bit.ly/38A70yn); the on-demand roundtable programs [Mental Health and Wellness for Litigators](https://bit.ly/38LLYNJ) and [Addressing the Perceived Stigma – A Discussion About Attorney Mental Health](https://bit.ly/2UkA6K1); and our free webcast [Empowering Professional Development Series 2020: Well-Being in the Legal Industry](https://bit.ly/3eQAglH), recently launched for PD Appreciation Month.

# Top Biglaw Firm Impacted By Data Breach
## The breach was tracked back to a vendor.

If you need even more proof (and really, [at this point, it should be obvious](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/cybersecurity/)) that Biglaw firms with their treasure trove of high confidential information on all manner of clients are a target for cyber attacks, well, here you go. Goodwin Procter, a firm ranked No. 22 in the latest Am Law 100, recently found themselves dealing with the fallout of a cybersecurity breach.

According to [a report at Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/goodwin-procter-says-it-was-hit-by-data-breach-of-vendor), one of the firm’s vendors that is used for large file transfers reported a hack. The firm’s managing partner, Mark Bettencourt, sent an internal memo outlining the scope of the issue:

Goodwin’s breach investigation revealed that a “small percentage” of the firm’s clients “may have experienced unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential material” on Jan. 20, Bettencourt said. He said that potentially impacted clients were notified, and all of the firm’s clients were told about the breach.

Internally, “only a few Goodwin employees were affected,” and have been notified as well, according to the memo.

“At this time, we have found no evidence that any Goodwin resources were affected other than the file transfer service, and our business operations have not been affected,” said Bettencourt, whose memo said Goodwin had been running the most current version of the vendor’s service, conducting maintenance, and using security patches.

# No. 2 Biglaw Firm In America Finally Announces Market-Beating Bonuses
## That's a lot of money! (But it was even more money last year.)

Good things come with patience, and if you’re an associate at Latham who was waiting for a bonus, your patience has been rewarded with pretty good things.

Latham & Watkins — a firm that brought in $5,488,778,000 gross revenue in 2021, placing it at No. 2 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — is known for announcing its year-end bonuses in January, and they usually beat the going market rate. Today, the firm finally announced its bonuses, and even though associates had to wait for the cash, they’re probably pretty happy about what’s getting deposited into their bank accounts.

Bonuses at Latham come with a billable requirement of 1900 hours, but they also give extra money for those who are billing above that threshold. And, from the looks of it, Latham associates have been busy — but perhaps not as busy as they were last year. The base bonuses are at market levels, but the median bonuses for every class year (sometimes just barely) beat the market rate. And the top bonuses are way, way over what the market gives out.

The firm circulated the below chart internally, and you can get a sense of just how generous bonuses are at Latham (full memo on the next page):



(It’s worth mentioning that last year, top bonuses at Latham were a bit higher than the 2022 bonuses the firm is offering. For the 2021 bonus cycle, the top bonus for first-years was $32,000, while the top bonus for seventh-years was $184,000. Take from that what you will about the available hours associates at the firm were able to bill.)

Bonus-eligible associates at the firm will receive their payouts on January 31. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Latham & Watkins.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# Are Stealth Layoffs Ahead? Firms Are Threatening To 'Rightsize'
## Beware performance reviews this year.

We do see firms, now that demand isn’t quite as high, are looking at how to rightsize a bit.

It’s not a last-in, first-out kind of approach. It’s who is the best talent? And being maybe a bit more deliberate about performance management in an environment where demand isn’t quite as high as it was.

— Lisa Smith, a principal at Fairfax Associates,[ told Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/26/big-law-will-likely-right-size-attorney-ranks-through-attrition-performance-reviews/) with demand for legal services slumping, firms are looking to cut some weight. One strategy Smith predicts is using performance reviews to let go of some associates. Which sounds a lot like the disturbingly popular[ stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stealth-layoffs/), frequently couched in performance review terms, which allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that they were financially based layoffs.

# 5 Biglaw Firms Make Working Mother’s List Of The ‘100 Best Companies To Work For’ (2019)
## Which law firms made the cut this year?

For more than 30 years, Working Mother has released a list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For (i.e., companies that help women thrive and become successful in their fields). Each year, a few law firms manage to sneak their way onto a list that includes employers like IBM, Johnson & Johnson, and Deloitte. With companies like that on the list, we wonder how a law firm could possibly perform on a similar level.

In 2018, just two law firms made the list: Arnold & Porter and Katten Muchin. This year, five Biglaw firms made the list. Which firms are the best for working parents?

Before we name the firms on this year’s ranking, let’s take a look at the [methodology](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190924005340/en/Working-Mother-Reveals-100-Companies-2019):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The 2019 Working Mother 100 Best Companies application includes more than 400 questions on leave policies, workforce representation, benefits, childcare, advancement programs, flexibility policies and more. It surveys the availability and usage of these programs, as well as the accountability of the many managers who oversee them. All applicants receive feedback showing how they compare with other applicants; however, the names of applicants that do not make the list are kept confidential. Company profiles and data come from submitted applications and reflect 2018 data.

Congratulations to these firms for meeting [Working Mother’s](https://www.workingmother.com/sites/workingmother.com/files/attachments/2019/09/100bestchart.pdf) standard of excellence:

- Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer
- Dechert
- Finnegan Henderson Farabow Garrett & Dunner
- Katten Muchin Rosenman
- Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman
Arnold & Porter has been included in this ranking at least 15 times, and Dechert was the highest-ranking Am Law firm (No. 36) to make this year’s list.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/09/24/5-law-firms-crack-working-mother-top-100-companies-list/) provides some highlights from Working Mother’s findings:

- The average number of fully paid weeks of maternity leave for listed companies was 11 weeks, compared with an average of four weeks nationally (according to the Society for Human Resource Management).
- Fifty-seven percent of companies on the list offer the same number of weeks for maternity and paternity leave.
- Thirty-one percent of women employees participate in a leadership-development program; 33% of their women employees participate in one-on-one formal mentoring.
- Ninety-eight percent offer flextime, with 79% of employees using it; 99% offer telecommuting, with 54% of women employees taking advantage of it.
- Seventy-five percent offer sick-child care, and 94% have backup/emergency childcare.
Once again, congratulations to the firms that made this year’s list. Can you think of a firm that deserves to be recognized, but hasn’t been? Feel free to let us know.

# Cravath Makes History In Diversity With Its New Partnership Class
## This class includes the firm's second and third Black partners -- ever.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to recruit, retain, and promote more minority attorneys. Despite these continued assurances, there are still Am Law 100 firms out there that have [no Black equity partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/the-am-law-100-firms-with-no-black-partners/). The most offensive name to be found on that list is that of Cravath, one of the most prestigious firms in the nation. The 201-year-old firm has fewer than 100 partners, but its first Black partner left in 2017 to become a judge. Yes, the firm has announced two all-women partnership classes in the past (in [2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cravath-names-new-partners-and-all-three-are-women/) and [2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/cravath-announces-all-women-class-of-new-partners/)), but Black lawyers seem to be all but ignored.

How could the firm that typically leads all others when it comes to compensation and bonuses fail to lead in an important area like diversity?

Cravath just announced its latest partnership class, and it looks like the firm has finally decided to step up when it comes to creating an inclusive workplace. Not only is this the firm’s largest class in recent memory, but it also includes not one, but two Black women. Here’s a memo that was sent out yesterday afternoon at the firm:



Here are the 11 lawyers who will become [partners at the firm](https://www.cravath.com/news/cravath-announces-new-partners-10-29-2020.html) as of January 1, 2021:

[Helam Gebremariam](https://www.cravath.com/people/helam-gebremariam.html) and [Heather A. Benjamin](https://www.cravath.com/site-search.html?q=heather) are now the second and third Black lawyers to ever become partner at Cravath. Making partner is a wonderful achievement, but making history is even better.

Faiza Saeed, Cravath’s presiding partner (and the first woman ever to lead the firm), had a statement in support of the firm’s newest members:

“We are pleased to announce the election of eleven exceptional lawyers to Cravath’s partnership this year,” presiding partner Faiza Saeed said in a statement. “Each of our new elects has made substantial contributions to our firm, serving as trusted legal advisors to our clients and demonstrating the character and collaborative spirit that we want to define our partnership. We are delighted to welcome them as partners of the firm.”

Congratulations to all of the talented lawyers selected to join the firm’s partnership, but especially to Helam and Heather. Your names will be rememberd forever as part of this elite firm’s history. Kudos to Cravath for actually making breaking barriers for Black attorneys at the firm. Hopefully, other firms will follow suit.

Has your firm recently announced its new partners? If so, what do the selections — in terms of number, practice areas, diversity, or other considerations — say about the state of your firm? Feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20New%20Partners) (subject line “[Firm Name] New Partners”) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks.

Winter is creeping up on us, Hanukkah and Christmas are nearly upon us, and everyone in the legal profession ready to ring in the New Year, so it’s finally time to reveal the NINE finalists for our fourteenth annual holiday card contest. But first let’s give shout-outs to some honorable mentions (click on each firm’s name to see its card):

1. [Buchanan Firm](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/12/Buchanan-Firm-Card-2022.pdf): Have you ever seen a law firm holiday card that needs a [secret decoder](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/12/Buchanan-Decoder-for-2022-Card.pdf)? Now you have!

2. [Lang & Associates](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/12/Lang-Holiday-Card.pdf): From “three gals and an office dog” who just “discovered the boundless possibilities of stock photography websites and Photoshop,” we found ourselves chuckling after taking a look at this card.

3. [Rakower Law](https://createsend.com/t/j-7943D846A9E5D5882540EF23F30FEDED): We thought this card was “SIRI-ously” cute, plus, the firm will make a donation to a worthy charity of your choice at the click of a button.

And now, the nine finalists, in alphabetical order. Again, click on each firm’s name to view its card. Please note that most of these cards have SOUND, so you might want to turn your sound off or down, or use headphones. Explanatory comments come from firm representatives unless indicated.

1. [Butler Snow](https://vimeo.com/butlersnow/holiday-magic): If we’re being completely honest, this holiday card kind of reminded us of a law school’s law revue video contest submission. “This year’s card is a deeply retrospective, yet entertaining, look at Frosty the Snowman’s life had he gone to law school. Our snowman’s name is Butler, of course. Butler the Snowman.” You’re going to love the song, and you’re going to laugh at the letter this snowman lawyer tries to send to a client. Fantastic work!

2. [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://www.dwtholiday.com/): This law firm has a little holiday spirit for all. “Everyone talks about diversity but, apart from a little menorah next to the giant Xmas tree in the lobby, who’s really showing it? Our card walks the walk by showcasing the diverse holiday traditions that some of our lawyers and staff observe with their friends and family in a fun and charming way. As in past years, this card was conceived and created entirely in-house.”

3. [“Lambert & Lambert”](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/12/Lambert-Holiday-Card.pdf): The quintessential lawyer’s holiday card: a threat to sue Santa Claus. We love it! From the nominator: “It’s not a traditional card, and I work in-house for a technology company (Trimble Inc.) and send the card to my colleagues and legal contacts, but I think it is a worthy contender, and the rules don’t limit entries to law firm cards. It celebrates the season as only an attorney can, shows that even little brothers can be nice (with a little help from a demand letter written by savvy counsel), shows Hermey decided to branch out from dentistry, and finally reveals Santa’s real name.”

4. [McBrayer](https://youtu.be/R1CaT0yrm3o): “Our cards reflect the personality of our firm – one that will do a serious job for our clients without taking itself too seriously. We wanted to shoot a holiday movie this year, but we couldn’t decide on just WHAT movie. So we just did all of them. We hope you enjoy this sojourn through our holiday message to clients and friends as told through our favorite holiday scenes. And yes, THAT one is in there.” Yet another excellent entry from McBrayer.

5. [Morse](https://readymag.com/MBBP/2022holiday/): Who doesn’t appreciate a good book during the winter months? Let this law firm help you line your bookshelves. “Grab a warm beverage of your choice, throw on your comfy slippers, and give the Morse Book Nook a browse in the 2022 Morse Holiday E-Card! Sticking with our tradition of creating a card that truly gives something to the recipient (see recipes and holiday traditions [in years past](https://www.morse.law/news/morse-holiday-greetings-through-the-years/)), this year we grabbed our toolbelt and built the Morse Book Nook. Including book and podcast recommendations from all around the firm (staff, paralegals, and attorneys), the Morse Book Nook offers suggestions that will leave you inspired, entertained, and perhaps even well-traveled (trip to space, anyone?). Motivation for your New Year’s resolution run? We’ve got that too!”

6. [Sturgill Turner](https://sturgillturner-4594884.hs-sites.com/we-are-thankful-for-you): This law firm’s holiday card has really got some heart. They’re doing their best to help a community that was devastated by a natural disaster. From the nominator: “Last summer, Eastern Kentucky suffered some of the worst flooding in its history. Sturgill Turner has numerous clients throughout the region and decided to send our annual holiday donation (in lieu of printing cards) to the Hindman Settlement School, which had been hit hard by the floods, but had stepped up in a big way to help and is on its way back to providing great educational, cultural, and other services to the area. In keeping with a theme of gratitude (we send our card and donation at Thanksgiving), we decided that rather than simply talking about ourselves or about the year in review, we wanted to accomplish two goals: show our connections to and solidarity with Eastern Kentucky clients and their communities as they recover, and bring notice to all our clients and colleagues about the great work of the Settlement School. Some of the responses we received included ‘What a heartwarming video!’; ‘This video is wonderful and brought tears to my eyes.’; and ‘So thankful for you and your team for supporting Hindman!'”

7. [Venable](https://www.venable.com/happy-holidays-2022): Who doesn’t love an a cappella rendition of Frosty the Snowman? An absolutely amazing job by the singers, with captions that poke fun at Venable lawyers’ apparent inability to harmonize. “Since our founding, Venable has supported the economic and social vitality of the communities in which we work and live. By helping individuals and organizations meaningfully connect with opportunities, resources, and each other, we ensure that our firm’s impact reaches far beyond our day-to-day business operations.”

8. [Waldrep Wall Babcock & Bailey](https://6c49d3aa-c9fb-4a92-a6f3-f72fc6a29338.usrfiles.com/ugd/6c49d3_8cc2a315e56940ef91b8c0aae4274776.pdf): “Our firm predominantly focuses on Business Bankruptcy and Corporate Litigation, so this card portrays our firm, in jest, capitalizing on Santa Claus’ business model (or lack thereof). Tom Waldrep, the attorney ‘speaking’ in this card, is a partner at our firm and the Bankruptcy Practice Department Head. From 2004 to 2013, Tom was a United States Bankruptcy Judge with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of North Carolina — and the only judge in North Carolina history to return to private practice after serving as a judge.” His Honor certainly has a good sense of humor. We think this card will make you giggle.

9. [Wolf Greenfield](https://vimeo.com/779010378): Yet another quality submission from the perennial winner of our holiday card contest. Get your tissues ready — this one is a tearjerker. From the nominator: “HATS OFF TO HOLIDAY MEMORIES! Memories are a big part of what make the season bright. Whether you’re creating new ones, or enjoying traditions passed down from generation to generation, we hope you’re able to take a step back from the holiday bustle and enjoy the simple things that make this time of year so special. Like sitting by a toasty fire, flipping through old photos, or donning your favorite seasonal attire – perhaps a cherished family heirloom. Nothing makes the heart warmer than reminiscing with loved ones. Last year’s holiday card, while futuristic in nature, brought with it a feeling of nostalgia. For 2022, we decided to leap into that nostalgia even further by reminiscing on simpler times. We went pre-computers, pre-digital storytelling, to a fully handmade flipbook. How many pages did it take to make the Wolf Greenfield holiday card? More than we ever expected! What started out as a one paragraph idea, turned into a one page storyboard, then a nearly 400 page flipbook. Don’t miss our [behind-the-scenes look](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/go-behind-the-scenes-of-our-2022-holiday-card)!”

Now it’s time for our audience to vote. We’ll keep the polls open through SATURDAY, DECEMBER 31, 2021, at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time). This gives you ample time to campaign for your pick over the holidays (but please don’t cheat).

VOTING HAS ENDED. HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Thanks to all the entrants and nominators, good luck to the finalists, and happy holidays to all! Above the Law is happy to celebrate holiday cheer with you!

If they try to get me back in the office[,] I will 100% leave.

— An anonymous associate at White & Case, in response to an [American Lawyer survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/05/want-to-thin-your-law-firms-head-count-mandate-3-or-more-days-of-office-attendance/) that asked Biglaw attorneys to describe their firm’s return-to-office policy and offer comments on how they felt about it. Per Am Law, a White & Case spokesperson said associates are expected to spend about 60% of their time in the office. Sixty percent respondents said their firms were asking them to work in-office three days per week. The majority of lawyers who were talking to recruiters about a search for a more flexible firm came from this group of respondents.

# LA County Fires Lewis Brisbois Over Racist Emails... From Lawyers Who Left The Firm... That The Firm Disclosed To The Public
## Query: Should the client punish the lawyers' prior firm for this?

According to a [report from Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/la-county-cutting-ties-with-lewis-brisbois-after-racist-emails), Los Angeles County has dumped Lewis Brisbois over [racist, sexist, antisemitic, and all around gross emails](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-offensive-emails/) exchanged by former Lewis Brisbois partners.

Which got us thinking… is this the right outcome?

After all, the partners at issue have already left Lewis Brisbois, decamping for their own firm which very rapidly [ceased to be their own firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-daugherty-lordan-new-name/) after [they resigned](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-resign-racist-sexist-antisemitic-emails/). In fact, this all came to light because Lewis Brisbois released the emails, claiming that they only learned of the emails recently. Assuming that’s true… should Lewis Brisbois be penalized here?

On the other hand:

“Our office expects that law firms with whom we contract actively promote and practice inclusion, diversity, equity, and anti-racism, and treat everyone in their workforce with dignity and respect,” [LA County Counsel Dawyn Harrison] said. “It is critical that firms handling our most sensitive matters are empathetic to and compassionate toward the constituents we serve,” she said.

The highest levels of the firm might not have known what was going on in this group, but the fact that it happened at all speaks to a breakdown in firm culture. As a client, LA County is distancing itself from a place where emails like these could ever happen.

What is a law firm? If it’s a collection of partner fiefdoms, then the current version of Lewis Brisbois doesn’t have anything to do with what Barber and Ranen did. If it’s a unified entity, then it has to treat oversight of its constituent practice groups seriously and accept responsibility when this happens on its watch. The latter seems like the better model.

# Are Smaller Market Lawyers Actually Better Than Major Market Biglaw Lawyers?
## A new study suggests clients have discovered the value of a smaller market lawyer.

The most consistent complaint about Above the Law’s coverage of associate salary increases is our perceived explicit bias against firms fully matching the top-of-market scale in every city across the country. It’s not uncommon to receive two or three irate emails every week calling us out for “disrespecting” the hard-working associates of… some random American city… who are just as smart and capable as any Cravath recruit, all because we’ll say that we don’t really think firms should be paying first-years $190K to live in Charlotte.

And the rub of it is, we’re still right about this. It has nothing to do with the number of hours lawyers put in across the country or even the level of skill out there. Major market attorneys should be paid more because recruiting attorneys to work in these markets has to respect the cost of living issue. Full stop. New York has more open jobs to staff with talented attorneys than Minneapolis and getting lawyers to come to New York and stay here requires more cash.

It’s not disrespect, it’s economics. We still want you to get your due for the work you put in and we consistently note that law school debt respects no geographic boundaries. We just don’t think it’s fair that people toiling away in Midtown to spend 80 percent of their income between debt and rent for the cause of pay parity across markets.

So while this may not salve anyone still angry over our coverage, those mid-market lawyers should be excited to hear about a new study suggesting that attorneys in smaller cities are not only on par with their major market peers but actually providing superior legal services.

In an article appearing at American Lawyer, AdvanceLaw CEO Michael Williams and managing director Aaron Kotok outline the results of [their study](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/07/18/how-good-are-lawyers-in-mid-market-cities/) of the 40 major metropolitan areas with the most attorneys — 36 domestic, 4 international — and find that clients are more ever so slightly more willing to recommend lawyers in smaller markets than larger ones, citing no real difference in the quality of service, but a major difference in cost and efficiency:

For all the talk about prestige locations and how mega cities attract all the best talent, there is no real performance difference. In fact, as the slight downward slope of the best-fit line shows, the largest cities in the data set have marginally lower performance scores than other locations, though this is not statistically significant. (And again, the result is largely the same across various client-service metrics.)

Great news for smaller market lawyers. One has to imagine this trend toward service parity is in no small part due to upward pressure on salaries throughout the country, prompting more and more elite law school graduates every year to say, “wait a minute, perhaps I don’t have to live in a studio with 3 roommates?” But there’s more than a recruiting coup or two at play here. Technological advancements have given firms the opportunity to keep pace with their more staid competitors and the explosion of startups in smaller markets has created more demand — and therefore more opportunities to garner experience — for local players. Add in the fact that national megafirms are increasingly [bringing name-brand practices to smaller markets](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/how-global-biglaw-titans-are-demolishing-local-firms-and-how-to-survive-the-onslaught/) and the reasons why clients are increasingly happy with their smaller town lawyers become pretty clear.

And, before you ask, the authors did check the substance of the work involved and these smaller market teams were receiving “significant high-stakes work.”

That said, the authors do note some important caveats. The highest in finance work flows to New York because that’s where centuries of combined expertise choose to practice. The same can be said of government work heading to Washington:

Note that we are not saying there isn’t an incredible amount of elite legal talent in the largest cities that should be tapped—there is. Likewise, we are not saying that clients can or should send all their work to the so-called “mid-to-large” cities—there are obvious limits to this. But we are saying GCs and their teams should resist defaulting to the usual locations out of habit or history. The data suggests there is a major opportunity here, under current market conditions, to get great talent at lower cost, working extra efficiently.

The crux of all this is that clients need to embrace labor arbitrage. If your company has a matter that can be handled out of Portland, go ahead and handle it out of Portland. The old adage is that no one is going to fire you for hiring Cravath, but that sort of “management from fear” is what rightly gets NFL coaches fired for kicking field goals from the one. Get sophisticated in your vetting and start taking advantage of the quality lawyers in small markets.

# Biglaw Firm Takes On The IRS
## Just as the IRS is turning its enforcement efforts to partnerships....

In one corner, we have one of the largest law firms in the world, with 4,800 attorneys, the firm that puts the Big in Biglaw, taking down more than $3.3 billion in revenue: Baker McKenzie! In the other, we have a 161-year-old federal agency, with a $14.3 billion budget, and able to strike fear into the hearts of the likes of Al Capone: the IRS! Who will win this battle of the titans?

Earlier this week, Baker McKenzie sued the Internal Revenue Service in[ federal court ](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zjpqwdrampx/Clarke%20v%20IRS%20-%20DCD%20-%2020240318.pdf)under the Freedom of Information Act. The plaintiff is the head of the firm’s North America tax dispute group, [George Clarke](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/c/clarke-george-m), and the suit alleges the agency failed to disclose memos, policy statements, and training materials related to their increased focus and audits on partnerships and other pass-through entities. One example of[ the materials sought ](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/baker-mckenzie-partner-sues-irs-for-disclosure-of-partnership-audit-strategies)is a paper discussed by an IRS employee at a November 2023 ABA Section of Taxation conference, which was described in a write-up on the event as “IRS Taking Partnership Audits to New Level.”

Hmmmm, I wonder why a Biglaw PARTNER would be interested in the IRS’s enforcement of PARTNERSHIP agreements…. Oh, and I guess Clarke also said in the complaint, he wants “to learn more about the Internal Revenue Service’s practices so that I can better represent my clients.” Which, you know, also sounds pretty necessary for his job.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The heat is already on for partnerships. The IRS has already[ reportedly](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/law-firm-baker-mckenzie-sues-irs-details-partnership-tax-crackdown-2024-03-19/) opened up 75 examinations on large partnerships including hedge funds, real estate investment partnerships, and… law firms. The IRS also plans to send compliance letters to an additional 500 partnerships.

# Morning Docket: 04.26.17
## * Can you hear me now? Modern marvels of technology like cellphones and other electronic devices are barred from the Supreme Court during oral arguments, but yesterday, justice was interrupted by the ringing of... a Justice's cellphone. Who was the culprit? The offending phone belonged to Justice Stephen Breyer. Oopsie! [[AP](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPREME_COURT_CELLPHONE?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT)] * After a week charged with sexual harassment allegations and the ouster of Bill O'Reilly, just when Fox News thought its troubles were over, a group of current and former employees filed a class-action lawsuit against the network alleging ""abhorrent, intolerable, unlawful and hostile racial discrimination."" The plaintiffs' lawyers got in this zinger of a statement: ""When it comes to racial discrimination, 21st Century Fox has been operating as if it should be called 18th Century Fox."" [[DealBook / New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/business/media/fox-news-racial-discrimination-lawsuit.html)] * Ever since it dumped Eversheds, Milwaukee-based Foley & Lardner has been out on the prowl for another merger partner, and it looks like the firm has finally found its ideal mate in New York boutique Friedman Kaplan Seiler & Adelman. The whole thing seems to be a bit ""incestuous"" if you ask us. We'll have more on this later today. [[Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784349808/Foley--Lardner-Explores-Union-With-New-Yorks-Friedman-Kaplan)] * Ahead of his confirmation hearing todays, Makan Delrahim, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the antitrust division of the Department of Justice who's been called a ""centrist nominee,"" has pledged to recuse himself from all matters involving his prior work as a lobbyist, including the merger between Anthem and Cigna. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/justice-antitrust-pick-pledges-anthem-recusal-ahead-of-hearing/)] * At some firms, like Ballard Spahr, senior partners must ""transition[] their practices"" by age 60, but at other firms, like Cozen O'Connor, age is nothing but a number. ""We have so many lawyers who are extremely productive and terrific lawyers and if they want to work well into their 70s, God bless 'em,"" says CEO Michael Heller.

# For Some, Getting Laid Off May Yield Financial Benefits

It appears as if some law firms have begun mass layoffs as law firm managers expect an upcoming recession and shops experience various economic pressures. Of course, getting laid off is a very traumatic experience for the people who are laid off, for those who remain at firms, and for the individuals who have to terminate workers. I know from firsthand experience how getting laid off stinks; I was laid off from a job at the beginning of my career. Before I get trolled on the internet for seemingly not understanding the pain of layoffs, let me be extremely clear that for many people, getting terminated from a job is one of the worst things that can happen. I have incredible sympathy for people who are laid off, and I vividly remember the sleepless nights and shame I felt at being laid off myself. However, in certain situations, getting laid off can have some benefits and can even help people achieve certain financial goals.

Many lawyers and staff who are laid off receive severance payments to help them during their transition to a new job. In the legal industry, employees commonly receive three to six months of severance payments during which they are still on the payroll of their old firms receiving pay. Even if the worker finds a new job, they are typically entitled to such payments, and workers will essentially earn two salaries while they are working at another job and receiving severance payments. Moreover, in some states, workers are sometimes entitled to unemployment benefits even though they receive severance payments.

The total amount of severance payments someone receives can be substantial. Indeed, some attorneys may receive six figures worth of severance payments. Of course, severance payments are usually taxed just like all other wages, so a sizable chunk of this money goes to the tax man. However, this still leaves a substantial amount of money in the pockets of those who are laid off. If individuals have a plan, they can use their severance payments to accomplish a number of goals.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
For instance, after someone gets laid off, they may qualify for unemployment benefits. If that worker subsists on unemployment benefits (which might be difficult since the benefits are usually nowhere near a person’s salary) they can pocket all of the money they receive in severance. If that person is able to find a new job in a month or two, they will stop receiving unemployment benefits if they received it while getting severance, and then they will effectively earn two salaries. So long as people do not burn through the extra money, they should be able to use these funds to pay down student loans, save for a down payment on a home, or achieve a number of other financial goals.

From my own experience, getting laid off and receiving severance had a positive financial impact on my own life. I am fortunate to live in a state that permits workers to receive unemployment benefits while also receiving severance payments in most circumstances. At the time I was laid off from my job earlier in my career, I lived on a shoestring budget, and I was basically able to cover all of my expenses on my unemployment benefits alone. Of course, I had to be creative and not splurge on anything big, but I was basically able to pocket all of my severance payments.

I was able to find a new job only a few months after I was laid off, well within the timeframe that I was entitled to unemployment benefits. The new job paid less, but I was still comfortable with the income, and after the end of the year, I received a huge tax refund since my severance payments included withholding for my old salary and were not based on my new income.

Even after paying taxes on my severance payments, I had a substantial amount of money that I completely poured on my student loans. I think that I was able to pay off a third of my remaining student loans with the severance payments I had saved up, and with this high-interest debt gone, my student loans became much more manageable. I do not think that I would have been able to pay off all of my student loans by the age of 30, which was a long-time goal, if I had not been laid off and given severance payments.

All told, again, being laid off is a traumatic experience, and my months between jobs were filled with restless nights, feelings of shame, and a host of other issues. In addition, some terminated workers do not receive severance payments. However, if you worked at a law firm that provides severance, and you are financially responsible, getting laid off can sometimes lead to some positive financial outcomes.

# How Do You Avoid The Stress Of A Biglaw Job?
## In-house columnist Mark Herrmann, who was a partner at a Biglaw firm for nearly two decades, explains how to minimize the pressure of Biglaw life.

I recently blew the dust off the “book talk” that I give about [The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590316762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590316762) (affiliate link) and delivered the talk to a group of international law students here in London.

I predictably get very different reactions when I give the talk to different groups.  Partners think the talk’s a riot.  They laugh out loud when I’m speaking.  I have to wait for the laughter to die down before I can go on to the next sentence.  “You’ve been a fly on the wall of my office for the last 20 years!  How’d you know?”

Associates don’t laugh as much.

And then there are law students.

When my daughter was six years old, and all of her classmates were losing their baby teeth, I held up one of her arms and felt around in her armpit:  “Have any of your classmates lost their baby arms yet?”

She gave me a look that said, “I’m pretty sure that he’s kidding.  But, if he’s not, this is really gonna suck.”

That’s how law students typically respond to my Curmudgeon talk:  “I’m pretty sure that he’s kidding.  But, if he’s not, this is really gonna suck.”

Anyway, during the question and answer period at the end of my recent talk, one student asked a very Millennial question:  “Do you have any ideas for how you can avoid the stress of working at a Biglaw firm?”

Sure I do.

In fact, in a sense, my entire book is aimed at that question.  When the book first came out, my mother-in-law told me that, “Some people who read this book will love what they read and decide to go to law school.  Others will hate what they read and choose not to go to law school.  And you’ve probably done a service either way.”

I hope so.

My mother-in-law’s language was actually imprecise:  Curmudgeon isn’t really about going to law school.  It’s more about how to succeed in a Biglaw firm.  (I was a partner in one of those puppies for 17 years.)  But you get the drift.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
And that answers the question posed by the law student in my audience:  How do you avoid the stress of working at a Biglaw firm?  Don’t work for a Biglaw firm, of course.

No one says you have to.  And you may hate it.  So don’t do it.

Some people read about the Biglaw environment and love it:  Intense pressure.  A real desire to create error-free perfection.  Hard thinking about tough issues.  Constant deadlines, and long (and unpredictable) hours to meet them.  No praise. 

Sounds great!

Other people read those same words and are nauseated.

Why would anyone choose to do that with their life?

So:  If you don’t like it, don’t do it.  Do trusts and estates work at a small firm.  Go in-house.  Teach.  Many (indeed, the vast majority of) career paths in the law do not involve working at a big firm.  There’s no shame in taking another route.

I suppose my only advice for reducing pressure if you do choose to work at a big firm is this:  Don’t put pressure on yourself unnecessarily.  When a big case settles after you’ve been working on it for three years, there’s going to be a gap in your schedule.  Don’t continue to show up at the office just for the sake of showing up.  This is one of those rare moments when you’ll get to relax.  So do.  When the pressure’s off, wallow in its absence.

And remember that life isn’t really that hard:  You’ll never lose your baby arms.

# New York Mainstay Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses

Milbank [opened the dam](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/), then Cravath[ seconded that bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/). Now it’s a free for all as the elite Biglaw firms are throwing around cash to show they have the pocketbooks big enough to match.

The latest firm to announce bonuses is Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. This afternoon, the  venerable firm sent around a memo announcing the expected match of market bonuses. I guess they’re particularly eager to show the [recent partner defections](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/major-lateral-moves-its-open-season-on-cleary-partners/) won’t be having a negative impact on the firm’s prospects.

For those that need the reminder the scale is as follows:

# Baking Up Some Delicious Raises
## After cutting back last year, the firm is moving ahead with the rest of Biglaw.

No word from the butcher or the candlestick maker, but these Baker Botts associates are pleased today to learn the firm will be joining the Biglaw salary tidal wave with a DPW match (I’m going to start using that terminology instead of “full” to differentiate between the firms offering either $205K for the class of 21 or $375K for the class of 12).

Baker Botts was one of the [early adopters of COVID cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-botts-cuts/), pulling back salaries across the board to deal with the pandemic. It left a bitter taste with a lot of attorney tipsters. But since 2020 ended up being an incredibly lucrative year for Biglaw, it’s good to see the firm reflect the good times.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Effective July 1 and including a summer associate bump. As per standard Biglaw operating procedure, counsel are shunted off into “communicated individually” limbo. It’s hard to get info on counsel because, at many firms, sharing their individual details with us might out them as a source. But it would be nice if folks could share broadly what they’re making after this round of raises so we can ballpark the market.

You can check out the [full memo here](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/06/Baker-Botts.pdf).

Please help us help you when it comes to salary news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Salary) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Salary”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Are You There Cravath? It's Me, Milbank.
## Where this raise goes from here is in one firm's hands.

Listen, [Milbank’s done everything it can](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) from its own, vulnerable position.

It stuck its neck out there as the firm willing to embrace a cost of living increase for its associates and only [Proskauer](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-match-the-new-associate-raises/) and [Winston](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/let-the-salary-wars-commence-another-biglaw-firm-has-matched-the-190k-scale/) — another pair of powerful but not quite elite players — have matched. (And litigation boutique [Hueston Hennigan,](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-firm-has-matched-the-new-milbank-scale/) but no one is looking to them to set the market rate.)

The silence from the rest of the field can only be chalked up to the industry’s cartel-ish impulse to follow Cravath’s lead in all things compensation. There’s a somewhat cynical view circulating in Biglaw that Proskauer and Winston moved when they did in a desperate bid to set the market before Cravath goes over the top and creates a $200K scale.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But will they? We’re just in this eerie holding pattern right now, waiting on Cravath to set the market. No one seriously believes Proskauer is going to be paying associates more than Cravath in New York when it comes time for on-campus interviews. So Cravath has to at least match… but if that’s the plan, why have they kept mum for two days?

Right now, the whole industry seems to be waiting on Cravath to make the call. Will this round of salary wars be the modest cost of living adjustment that [every firm should join](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/) or the start of the market fragmentation that Cravath thought it was buying two years ago?

The legal world is waiting.

# Top 50 Am Law Firm Announces Reduction In Force, Will Cut 6% Of Global Workforce
## The firm is also deferring its incoming associates.

Layoffs and deferrals within Biglaw are far from over.

The leaders of Orrick — a firm that brought in $1,379,702,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 32 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — just announced a global reduction in force. It seems that about 6% of the firm’s workforce, including attorneys and staff members, will be let go.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson from Orrick offered this statement on the firm’s behalf:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“The action is a response to a convergence of market forces: reduced client demand in some areas related to market uncertainty and the impact of technology, data and the evolving workplace on the type of support we need to serve our clients and operate our firm.

Affected colleagues have contributed meaningfully to our firm — this is not a reflection on any individual — and we will support them with a transition package.”

As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/06/13/orrick-lays-off-attorneys-and-staff-defers-incoming-class/), it’s estimated that the firm’s cuts will affect about 40 associates and 50 staff members, with a greater impact on the firm’s corporate transactional teams. Orrick will be offering a benefits package to those impacted, including salary, COBRA reimbursement, outplacement services, and wellness resources. “We believe this action is the most fair and transparent way to advance our strategy and ensure we have ample work opportunities for our team,” Orrick’s spokesperson said.

On top of today’s reduction in force, the firm is also deferring its incoming associate class to January 16, 2024. Orrick is now the fourth firm to delay the start date for its entry-level associates. Affected first-years will receive a stipend of $15,000, as well as an additional stipend to purchase health insurance and early access to the firm’s wellness resources.

Best of luck to those who are being let go or deferred from Orrick.

Would a relative charge for legal services? Did we charge Two Slices of Pie Lawyer over there for this lovely meal that we’re all enjoying despite that lawsuit? (Image via Getty)

Every lawyer at some point in their career has likely been asked to perform legal work for friends or family members. Most of the time, friends or relatives just have a quick legal question that does not require too much time or effort. Other times, family and friends may have a full-blown legal matter for which they need to retain counsel, and these matters can often get heated. Although it is easy to let tensions rise when representing family and friends, lawyers should try their best not to get too emotional since this could cloud their judgment and negatively impact a representation.

The first time I ever represented a close family friend was early in my career when I was working for a midsized regional firm. A close family friend and his children, who were also friends with my family, owned a company that was being sued in an emergent matter that needed to be decided on an expedited basis. The outcome of this matter could have had a substantial impact on this family’s business, and I knew the pressure was on to get the best result possible for my client.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I worked extremely hard for my family friends and put in numerous hours during nights and weekends to crank out solid work product on an expedited basis. Within a few weeks of accepting this matter, we needed to go to court for an order to show cause hearing, and my client wanted to appear at the hearing to see that everyone was going well in court. When I met the client in court, I could tell that this family friend was weary from this matter, and it was tough to see him seem tired by all of the legal hurdles he needed to face.

I was extremely animated in court and was not as amicable as usual with my adversary because of the tension that my client was facing because of this lawsuit. This could have made it harder to reach a resolution with my adversary since it is usually best to have a solid relationship with an adversary so that deals can be struck to avoid parts of the litigation process. In the end, I was able to obtain a very favorable result for my client, but after some reflection, it was obvious that I let emotions related to representing a close family friend get to me during the representation.

At another time in my legal career, I had to represent some of my relatives who were being threatened with a (no pun intended) relatively meritless lawsuit. There was a release that clearly precluded the claimant from pursuing the claim, but the claimant’s lawyer made all kinds of threats against my relatives, likely in order to use aggression to shake us down for some quick money. As negotiations got more heated, the other lawyer started threatening me by saying that he would subpoena various family members and make their lives miserable if we did not settle his client’s claim.

It was difficult not to get too passionate about this situation. The lawyer was threatening people who were very near and dear to me, and the thought of my relatives being faced with the stress of litigation did not sit well with me. To some extent, the passion helped me out in the representation. I was able to channel some of the anger of this annoyance in communications with my adversary, and this likely helped me resolve the matter at minimal cost to my relatives. But my judgment was definitely clouded by the passion of representing family, and this could have negatively impacted the services I rendered.

Lawyers are usually able to provide the best legal services possible when they are objective and are governed by reason and not by emotion. In many situations, lawyers need to be the voice of reason while clients are the ones who make decisions out of passion and emotions. Lawyers need to be able to objectively size up the merits of a case and whether claims and defenses will succeed in court. In addition, lawyers need to be able to accurately evaluate the value of a case when it is time to settle a matter. When lawyers act emotionally, there may not be a core of reason guiding a representation and ensuring that strategies are based on what objectively is positive for a representation and not what is governed by emotion. In certain situations, representing family may even be unethical since the representation might be materially limited by the circumstances of the case.

All told, friends and family members often turn to lawyers they know in order to handle their legal work since they naturally trust a lawyer who is close to them than other attorneys. Lawyers should not let emotions get the best of them during such representations to ensure their friends and relatives get the best representation possible.

# What Millennial Lawyers Want From Their Careers
## A majority would trade compensation for more time off.

Work-life balance and remote work policies have become rallying cries among many young attorneys in the last few years, and a recent ATL survey bears out the importance of these elements in today’s workplaces.

In the [latest of our series of millennial surveys](https://info.abovethelaw.com/searching-for-balance-millennial-lawyers-perspectives-on-the-legal-industry) conducted with Major, Lindsey & Africa, we asked lawyers about dozens of topics, including their priorities, career aspirations, and perspectives on law firm culture. According to the respondents, most of whom work in Biglaw, the two most important factors when evaluating a potential employer are compensation and work-life balance. 

At the same time, over half of the lawyers surveyed said they would trade compensation for more time off or reduced billable hours. And nearly everyone — almost 90 percent of respondents — would like to work from home at least a few days a week. Although more associates than partners expressed a desire to work remotely full-time, 84 percent of partners said they want to work from home at least part of the time.

In fact, with respect to work-from-home policies, the gender disparities are more striking than those based on the attorneys’ positions. Almost 30 percent of women would like to work entirely from home; among men, the most common preference was two remote days per week. Twenty percent of male respondents said they would prefer to work full-time in the office, compared to just 6 percent of female respondents. 



The survey, which received more than 1,500 responses, underscores other differences based on gender, race, position, or generation — while also revealing areas in which lawyers were largely unified in their views.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Attorney Benchslapped Over 'Hubris,' Told To Open Checkbook To Personally Pay

Oof, this has got to sting.

No one *likes* being benchslapped by a federal court, but getting called on the carpet for your “hubris and disregard of procedural rules” and ordered to “personally pay” opposing counsel costs? That’s… no bueno.

But that’s exactly what happened to Cooley attorney[ Jon Graves](https://www.cooley.com/people/jon-graves). Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Michael M. Baylson[ did not take kindly](https://assets.law360news.com/1518000/1518288/https-ecf-paed-uscourts-gov-doc1-153120551536.pdf) to Graves’s behavior in his representation of Medical Technology Associates in a case against former top executive Carl W. Rausch. Specifically, the judge was peeved over his filing of 61 pages of evidence, after discovery deadlines.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1518288) Law360:

Graves was ordered to “personally pay” the lawyer representing Rausch and his company for all the legal fees incurred following Graves’ decision in May to file “a 61-page ‘submission’ that included 7 pages of legal argument, citing testimony and documents, and ten exhibits.”

Discovery had already ended in the case. None of the filings were presented during depositions in the case and Rausch’s lawyer called the move a blatant attempt “to evade the page limits set by this court.”

And he’s also headed to extra CLE classes:

“The court orders Mr. Graves to attend six hours of continuing legal education courses on the subject of federal practice and procedure, to be completed within six months of this decision,” Judge Baylson added in his ruling on the matter. Graves would have to submit “certificates of attendance for each course, to include the name of the course, sponsoring organization(s), date of attendance, and length.”

And the the judge reminded Graves there’re more consequences he can dish out, noting, “Furthermore, Mr. Graves is reminded that appearing pro hac vice is a privilege.” And even though Graves’s client has “filed for bankruptcy,” that “does not prevent this court from imposing sanctions for prior conduct of counsel.”

In opposing any sanctions, Graves hired ethics expert Gregory P. Joseph, who wrote:

“In light of the damaging effects sanctions would have on a lawyer with no history of sanctionable conduct, in my opinion, to a reasonable degree of certainty, the court should decline to impose sanctions of any sort on him, his law firm, or his client,” Joseph had implored. “Sanctions of any sort imposed on a lawyer are devastating. They live forever on the Internet.”

Awww, that sure feels like [an Above the Law ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/benchslap/)shout-out.

# Scheduling A Meeting When You Have Nothing To Say

“First there was his self-pity — everything was someone else’s fault — and then there was his self-will — no one must oppose him on anything at any time ever.”

I just finished reading Antonia Fraser’s 1994 book, The Wives of Henry VIII, and I found that description of King Henry VIII — he of the six wives, two beheaded, and the English Reformation) on page 336. I just had to share it with you.

But that’s an aside showing how our zeitgeist infects even my recreational reading. (It may also show more than you care to know about my idea of recreational reading, but I suppose that’s another story, too.)

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The substance of this post is about the cadence of meetings.

Cadence is a communications concept. If a group is working on a project, the group should meet frequently to make sure the group maintains its momentum. If a group does general oversight — the board of directors — then the group should meet less frequently.

The desire to set a cadence means, I fear, that people frequently set meetings for no reason at all.

“The appropriate cadence for this team to meet is once per month. That’s about enough for the nature of the work that the group performs.”

“Oh, my God! The next meeting in the cycle is set for this Wednesday! We had forgotten about that. We don’t have an agenda. Can anybody gin up a few speakers to talk about something that’s arguably relevant to the group so that we fill the time?”

That conversation is routine. You hear it before many, many meetings.  And it’s an admission of defeat: “We don’t really have anything to talk about, but we have to gin up irrelevant crap to fill the time.”

At the end of the meeting, of course, everyone will praise the meeting: “Great meeting! Good speakers! Glad we did it!” Praising the meeting is no skin off the attendees’ teeth, and it’s better for your career to praise meetings than to criticize them (or to say that the meetings were entirely unnecessary). But don’t ignore the truth, despite what people say: People (or at least the people you’d like to retain) couldn’t have helped noticing that there was no reason at all to hold the meeting, no one learned anything of importance, and everyone just lost an hour out of their day.

I’m not opposed to all meetings.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Sometimes you meet because a project demands that people discuss what’s happening. That’s an extraordinarily good reason for a meeting.

I don’t mind quarterly oversight meetings. If all the group is doing is oversight, then surely some things that require oversight have occurred in the prior three months.

Sometimes scheduling meetings regularly serves a purpose, even when the participants really have nothing to discuss: “We have 1,000 illegal contracts!  We’d better get them corrected pronto. We must assign someone to be responsible for this task, and we must then schedule weekly meetings between (1) the person responsible for the task and (2) a very important person in the firm, at which we’ll discuss the progress being made on the task.” Those meetings serve a purpose: The person doing the task understands that he’s under the gun and, more importantly, he understands that God is watching him. “God is watching” meetings serve a purpose, even if the job could be accomplished without them.

In a world when we’re allowed to meet in person, meetings can improve collegiality, even if the agenda is light.

But please consider canceling meetings when you realize that you have a meeting scheduled for next week and nothing to communicate. Canceling the meeting is an entirely legitimate alternative to burdening your audience with drivel because you have nothing to say.

# Early Mover On Biglaw Bonuses Is Back At It
## Top 20 firm is handing out even more money.

Back in the early days of December, Mayer Brown [announced ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/mayer-brown-bonus/)its year-end bonuses for associates. And, at least for associates in major markets, it was a match of the — then –prevailing market standard. However, the market has changed since then. Beginning with Davis Polk’s [announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-biglaws-new-compensation-champion/) of additional special bonuses on top of the annual ones, the market standard increased since those early days.

And now Mayer Brown has matched those special bonuses, as per the below scale:



Unlike the first round of bonuses that had different scale for different offices, these special bonuses apply to all U.S. associates who meet their bonus hour threshold.

You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/mayer-brown-specials-21/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Davis Polk Responds To The New Associate Compensation Scale
## More money ahead!

There was a brief, shining moment when Davis Polk & Wardwell [ruled the Biglaw compensation world](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/), when they not only gave associates raises but came over the top of the[ Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/). But what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, and [Cravath came over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) of that DPW scale earlier this week.

So how would DPW respond to no longer being the clubhouse leader?

Well, yesterday the firm announced they were matching the Cravath scale. Which is good news for those midlevel and senior associates who will see some extra cash with this new comp grid.

The new scale is as follows:



Like the last round of raises, these increases are retroactive to January 1. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/dpw-re-raise-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Bonuses keep dropping across the Biglaw landscape, and associates seem to be enjoying the annual holiday cash grab. Earlier this week, Simpson Thacher & Barlett, one of Biglaw’s premier firms, got in on the action.

Simpson Thacher brought home $2,224,191,000 gross revenue last year, putting it in 13th place in the most recent Am Law 100. Now, the firm is coming in hot with a bonus match.

Here’s the STB scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500

# Why Scale LLP Is Driving A ‘Great Redefinition’ Of Attorney Success
## These lawyers built a practice that benefits the pocketbook — and the soul. Here’s how they did it.

[](http://bit.ly/3WpIWng)The 2020s have already proven to be one of the most consequential decades in recent history, bringing generational change to how professionals live and work. Now more than ever, people are questioning what work means for them in the larger context of life.

Rise of the “great redefinition”

Attempts to identify and define this change came first from the tech world, with industry experts dubbing it the “great resignation,” “great reset,” “great awakening,” and ultimately, the [“great redefinition.”](https://www.inc.com/arianna-huffington/people-arent-just-quitting-their-jobs-theyre-redefining-success.html) The movement is characterized by a desire for greater professional fulfillment, purpose, and meaning, and a will to assert greater ownership and autonomy over one’s career.

In a recent article for Inc. entitled [“People Aren’t Just Quitting Their Jobs. They’re Redefining Success,”](https://www.inc.com/arianna-huffington/people-arent-just-quitting-their-jobs-theyre-redefining-success.html) Arianna Huffington opines that although most stories cite burnout as the reason, burnout alone “doesn’t fully explain the phenomenon … What the pandemic did was give us time to think about what we really value, and the place of work in our lives. Which is to say, there’s something deeper at the heart of this great awakening: a collective redefinition of success.”

Huffington frames this as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to redefine the way we work, keeping the parts that make us thrive, and leaving behind the parts that don’t.

The spread to the legal profession

The “great redefinition” is industry-agnostic, and the legal industry has been one of the most affected, likely due to the high levels of job dissatisfaction that existed pre-pandemic. In [Axiom’s 2022 In-House Counsel Survey Report](https://www.axiomlaw.com/2022-in-house-talent-survey-report) conducted among 300 in-house counsel between May 23 and June 3, 2022, a whopping 93% say that they’ve recently re-evaluated what’s important in their legal careers as a result of the pandemic.

On the law firm side, the [Wolters Kluwer Future Ready Lawyer Survey 2022](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/know/future-ready-lawyer-2022) of 751 legal professionals reports that 57% of law firm attorneys are very to somewhat likely to leave their position in the next year, and 72% expect to work remotely all or part of the time.

In [Above The Law’s Associate Perspectives on the New Normal](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/what-do-associates-think-of-the-new-normal/) report, a survey of 500 associates at law firms, more than 40% plan to leave their firms within the year or within the next 2 years. A majority (69%) stated a desire for better work-life balance is a primary factor. Associates overwhelmingly want to keep working remotely and 40% don’t see partnership as their future path.

A new definition of success & the rise of a new practice model

While some law firms doubled-down on the model that led to so much dissatisfaction in the legal industry, others have proven more nimble by allowing attorneys to work from home at least a few days a week. Others have gone further, reevaluating work location, billable minimums, and the economic model that drives high rates and long hours.

Six years ago, after practicing in Biglaw and serving as GC for a fast-growth fintech startup, Adam Forest wanted to go back to private practice. Looking at the legal market, he didn’t see the kind of firm he wanted to join, so he built one.

[](https://bit.ly/3CXGpK3)
Founding Partner, Adam Forest, collaborating with a team of Scale LLP attorneys.

As [Scale’s](http://bit.ly/3wu6flz) Founding Partner, Forest says, “When we set out to build Scale LLP, we asked ourselves this one question, ‘What if we built a law firm with lawyers in mind? One that empowers lawyers with an economic model that is more favorable, one that lets them take home more of the value they create, one that allows them to work when and where they want.’”

Scale attorneys can work less than they would at a traditional firm yet keep more of the revenue they generate, all while providing more responsive, cost-effective service to clients. “The flexibility and the time that attorneys get back results in a more fulfilling, sustainable practice for the long haul. One that is a better experience for both attorneys and clients,” says Forest.

When the pandemic hit, Scale experienced a flood of applications: more than 5,000 in two years. It turned away the vast majority, inviting less than 2% to join the firm. “We wanted to build the first truly prestigious ‘virtual’ firm,” Forest said, “and debunk the notion that in order to practice with the best attorneys and clients in the world, you have to give up everything to do it.”

Forest partnered with David Reidy, a former McGuireWoods equity partner and General Counsel at fintech company Payactiv. As Managing Partner, Reidy sets the firm’s vision. “Scale’s philosophy is that happy lawyers make happy clients. We are experiencing a generational change in the way people work and in the way lawyers want to work. Scale was built for this moment.”

In the traditional law firm model, attorneys give up 60 to 70% of their fees to cover the equity partnership structure, expensive office space, and other overhead. With remote work here to stay, that traditional model is getting harder to justify.

[](http://bit.ly/3GRSWQA)
Managing Partner, David Reidy, speaks to Scale attorneys at the 2022 Firmwide Retreat in Denver.

“More attorneys are realizing that model doesn’t fit with their practice or with their lives,” says Reidy. “We’re competing for the best talent in the country. We believe the best way to attract that talent is to create an environment where those lawyers can build, grow, and thrive by defining success on their own terms.”

“We define success differently, by reference to the individual successes of our attorneys,” says VP of Talent, Jessica Sisco. For some attorneys, success is building a more fulfilling practice with flexibility to be able to be a more present parent. For others, it’s growing a high-quality practice to better serve clients and make more money from the value they create. Finally, those who have achieved building and growing are getting to the next level – thriving in all areas with greater purpose in service of the larger community in work and in life.

Building a more fulfilling practice that’s family-friendly

With a decade of legal experience under his belt, Doug Mitchell knew that the work he was doing could be done remotely, without the expense and effort associated with a physical office, and without sacrificing the quality of his work. Mitchell, who had already been working remotely prior to the pandemic, found that he was able to build a fulfilling practice where he had more time for what he values most in life – his family.

“Family is being part of your children’s life and being there. I took that into my career as an attorney of what’s important to me,” says Mitchell. “I think there’s always the image of attorneys that work at Biglaw that they are grinding out 2200 hours. They hate their life. They have no work life balance. All they do is work. If you’re talented and efficient in the legal field where it’s about the experience and skill of the individual, you can take that talent somewhere else. Look for what you want and go for it!”

Realizing that the pandemic would forever change the way business and legal work was done, Mitchell joined Scale to be at the forefront of that change.

“I now work when, with whom, and where I want,” says Mitchell. He further adds, “the culture just fits – it’s a group of highly-talented attorneys that have their priorities straight. We pride ourselves in providing top-tier quality legal service, value our clients, believe in what we’re doing – and on equal footing with all of the above – we value our lives outside of work. We also firmly believe that none of those things are dependent on having an expensive office lease.”

Growing a high-quality practice within a more efficient model

Eric Blatt worked at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and a highly-regarded IP litigation firm in Washington, DC prior to becoming a Partner at Scale. Combining expertise in intellectual property law and government contracts, he developed a unique practice focused on venture-backed startups conducting high-impact R&D funded by the Department of Defense and other federal agencies.

Eric Blatt, Partner at Scale, speaking at a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) event.

Blatt realized his high-growth startup clients needed a different type of mindset and broader capabilities than his prior firm could provide. He was introduced to Scale by a friend at a startup accelerator, and, after researching and speaking with attorneys at the firm, he concluded that Scale offered a better fit for what his clients needed: efficient and skillful attorneys who can address the full range of startups’ legal needs and are driven to provide actionable advice at a lower price point.

“I put adding value for clients first,” says Blatt. “If you focus on helping people, the money takes care of itself. Scale eliminates the ‘tax’ that traditional firms place on both clients and attorneys. If you do that, everyone wins.”

When asked what advice he would give to other attorneys, Blatt responds, “If you’re where I was and you have clients who will move with you, it’s an easy decision – you will make more money on the other side. The economics are better for your clients and for you, and you will have fantastic colleagues to support you.”

Growing a practice to fit your life values

After serving as an Administrative Law Judge and in-house counsel at five different companies, including Coinbase, Maribeth Bushey wanted to build a new type of legal practice built around the things in life that are important to her – serving in public office, raising successful kids, gardening, traveling the world, and even climbing the highest mountain in the US. All while curating a portfolio of intellectually challenging matters with entrepreneurial clients she loves.

“It’s possible to make your practice and your life what you want it to be,” says Bushey, Counsel at Scale based in San Rafael, CA. “I’d just come off of four years in a tech startup and was not looking for a traditional law firm – 14 billable hours a day, all of that grind. I wanted to have a practice that was right for my life now.”

For those who come from in-house and may be concerned about not having a sufficient book of business, Bushey says, “I started with one primary client but was able to grow my practice by collaborating with other Scale attorneys.”

“If what you want for your practice is to maximize personal revenue, go for it. There’s a whole range of options. If you want other things in your life, then you can do that as well. That’s the beauty of Scale – it can change as your life changes.”

Thriving with purpose in all areas of life

Scott Wiegand left behind both a Biglaw partnership and senior in-house roles at Fortune 500 companies, including Caesars Entertainment, to build a new type of practice.

“As an in-house lawyer, you have exposure to every kind of law there is. I was able to steer my practice in a direction that worked for me. But I was working long hours in very stressful environments, and it made me stop and think about what I wanted next for my career.”

Scale Partner, Scott Wiegand, off-roading in the Colorado mountains.

After 18 years in-house, Wiegand realized that he enjoyed the greater autonomy of a law firm and variety of working with multiple clients. He also wanted to move his practice from Las Vegas to Denver to enjoy the Colorado outdoor life with his family.

After three years with a large Denver-based law firm, Wiegand realized he wanted to spend more time working with startup founders while maintaining his existing practice with institutional casino gaming industry clients. The Scale model gave him the autonomy and flexibility to pursue that direction. “I’ve been really, really happy with that choice,” says Wiegand.

When asked what success means, he responds, “For me it means working with clients I enjoy, with lawyers I enjoy working with. I’ve found Scale’s model to be incredibly liberating. It frees me up to focus on being a lawyer and not worry about all of the office politics and things that so many law traditional firms experience. The way Scale is structured fosters happy people, and I think life is just too short to work with grumpy people.”

As he sets off in his jeep to go offroading in the Colorado mountains, Wiegand smiles and says, “I’m at a point in my career where I have the luxury of choosing to work on things that are lucrative for the soul as well as for the pocketbook.”

The winning formula for “lawpreneurs”

Modern practice models like [Scale](http://bit.ly/3wu6flz) may not be for everyone, but for the growing group of entrepreneurial attorneys who are redefining success in the practice of law, it seems to be the winning formula.

# A (Moderate) Defense Of Biglaw From The Political Left
## For the left to ostracize those who ever deigned to work in a for-profit legal entity is to cast out many of the attorneys who will help transform, for the better, the judiciary and the legal profession.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/). Generally speaking, it is terrible. One would not think that 280 characters would be enough to reveal an individual’s depraved mind/heart/soul, and yet such revelations seemingly happen every minute on the platform frequently described by users as a [#hellsite](https://twitter.com/hashtag/hellsite?lang=en). And yet despite frequent tweaks by Jack Dorsey and the rest of the Twitter braintrust, it seems as if the most basic requests from users are being ignored, such as “When are you going to implement an edit feature?” and “Can you please get rid of the Nazis?” One would think the fact that I feel like I am walking into a cesspool of hatred each time I go to the site would curb, or at the very least deter, my usage. That would be incorrect. I, shamefully, admit that Twitter is basically an appendage at this point. Rare is the quiet moment when I don’t instinctively reach for my phone and see what has changed in the world over the past fifteen seconds.



Now in my defense, for all of its numerous, well-documented, flaws, if used properly, Twitter is the best news aggregator on the planet. As someone who consumed news online prior to Twitter’s advent, I would have a hard time explaining to anyone under the age of, say, 29 what it was like to keep abreast of the day’s events in the early 2000s. “So first you would go to the New York Times website, read something there, then try to remember that the URL for ESPN included [go.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go.com), for some reason, and several hours later, you would have read three stories and been done for the day.” In addition to its positive attributes as an aggregator, Twitter is probably the only place on the internet, or really in the world, where you can watch real-time de-escalation of armed conflict between highly militarized nation-states.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Iran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense under Article 51 of UN Charter targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens & senior officials were launched.

We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.

— Javad Zarif (@JZarif) [January 8, 2020](https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1214736614217469953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Not to mention how there are few other platforms, social media or otherwise, where one could parlay a reputation as a troll to not just an ambassadorship to a major ally, but to the Director of National Intelligence despite having [no real qualifications for the job](https://www.salon.com/2020/02/21/trump-names-right-wing-troll-richard-grenell-to-run-national-intelligence-what-could-go-wrong/).

And while we can debate if Twitter is, in fact, [reflective of real life or, instead, it’s own bubble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/opinion/twitter-debates-real-life.html), I think few would argue with the idea that many big issues are being debated and new ideas being offered up in 280 character chunks. This is especially true on the political left, which tends to dominate my own Twitter feed. In a since-deleted tweet, [Vox Senior Correspondent Ian Milhiser](https://www.vox.com/authors/ian-millhiser) said that one of the “stories in liberal politics right now is that jobs like banking, consulting, and big law that used to be viewed as morally neutral are increasingly seen as immoral.”[[1]](#f1) Before diving into these comments, let me start by saying I am a great admirer of Milhiser’s work and his [writing on the Supreme Court](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/ian-millhiser/injustices/9781568585857/).  In addition, a circumspect view of Biglaw by political liberals is not just limited to this tweet. The progressive organization [Demand Justice](https://demandjustice.org/) (full disclosure: Senior Counsel Katie O’Connor is a friend a former colleague) released [a sensational list](https://demandjustice.org/supreme-court-shortlist/) of potential Supreme Court justices for a Democratic administration [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/liberals-could-have-this-list-supreme-court-potentials-or-they-could-be-scared-like-always/) — give me Karlan, Krasner, and Stevenson, and American jurisprudence would be fundamentally transformed, for the better, in short order — but absent from the list was anyone who had been a Biglaw partner[ [2]](#reff1) or served as corporate in-house counsel. This was not an oversight or a coincidence, but rather purposeful as the organization seeks to end the appointment of “[corporate judges](https://demandjustice.org/no-more-corporate-judges/).”

I understand the impulse with such a stance. A bipartisan trend in recent years has been the path to the bench, or even the popular definition of “success” in the legal profession, has been singular: attend an elite law school, clerk for a federal judge, work in Biglaw, and if you leave the private sector, become a prosecutor or go in-house. To be clear, that is a perfectly acceptable, and likely highly profitable, legal career. But it is not, and should not, be the only path for young attorneys. Plus, a judicial branch stocked to the brim with homogenous professional backgrounds — not to mention the more recent phenomenon of [homogenous personal traits](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/747013608/trumps-impact-on-federal-courts-judicial-nominees-by-the-numbers) — leads to worse judicial outcomes. The bench needs more jurists like [Jane Kelly](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/kelly-jane-louise) of the Eighth Circuit (also on the Demand Justice shortlist), who attended Harvard Law and completed not one, but two, federal clerkships, but who then spent 19 years as an assistant federal public defender. A diversity of professional experience will better inform the judiciary and the opinions it renders.

But while I get the impulse, deeming Biglaw and in-house opportunities as intrinsically immoral is a bridge too far for me. There are a couple of reasons why liberals should not shun these attorneys. First and foremost, doing so is a form of economic privilege. As even nonlawyers/law students who have spent approximately 30 seconds on [this website](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/law-school-tuition/) will know, law school is a rather expensive proposition. The majority of law students, especially those at “top” schools, take out six-figure loans in order to earn their J.D. While [loan forgiveness](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) is an option for those who go the public interest route, its requirements can be onerous and lock you into a certain career path without allowing much deviation. And oh, by the way, the current administration would like to [end the program](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/trump-proposes-end-to-student-loan-forgiveness-program.html). Without loan forgiveness, the only option most students see to avoid several decades of debt is to pay off their loans with a Biglaw salary. If the political left is telling these law students that they will be persona non grata, in essence, the message is that only those who come from money are welcome into liberal legal circles and feted for judicial appointments. This strikes me as anathema to everything that political liberalism stands for.

Second, young attorneys can gain outstanding experience from even a short stint in Biglaw that is difficult to replicate elsewhere. I have [said before](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/to-clerk-or-not-to-clerk-its-actually-not-much-of-a-question/), and still maintain, that pound for pound, the best experience a young attorney can get is via a clerkship. But the level of experience one gets in Biglaw is not that far behind. They are a litany of matters one will work on and large firms wouldn’t be paying top dollar to junior associates if they were expecting poor work product, so the standards that young attorneys have to meet are quite high. In addition to paying clients, there can also be a litany of pro bono matters that allow junior associates to not only work on matters that are of personal interest, but to perform tasks that are typically reserved for more experienced members of the firm, e.g., take depositions, examine witnesses, etc.

All of this is not to say that Biglaw or other corporate legal positions are the path for every law student. In fact, for some students it is absolutely the wrong path. But for the left to ostracize those who ever deigned to work in a for-profit legal entity is to cast out many of the attorneys who will help transform, for the better, the judiciary and likely the legal profession writ large.

[ [1]](#reff1) Since nothing ever dies on the internet, I was able to capture the bulk of this deleted tweet and quote it here, however, there is language preceding “stories” in the tweet at issue that I was not able to find. If I recall correctly from when the tweet initially popped up on my feed, the full tweet referred to it as the biggest story or the most undercovered story. Either way, the thrust of the tweet is unchanged.
[ [2]](#reff1) Important to note that Demand Justice does not categorize those who worked in Biglaw as an associate, rather than a partner, as someone who would be disqualified under their standard.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Will Not Require Full-Time, In-Office Work For Associates In 2022
## The end of the five-day, in-office work week starts soon at this firm.

Associates are on pins and needles as more and more firms roll out return-to-office plans in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. After all, some top firms have yet to announce what they’ll be expecting of associates in terms of their in-office presence, leaving attorneys in limbo. One firm just salved its associates’ anxiety by announcing that they would not be required to return to the office on a full-time basis next year.

Willkie Farr — a firm that announced quite early on that it would [not require any of its attorneys to return to the office](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/neither-of-these-top-biglaw-firms-will-require-attorneys-to-return-to-the-office-in-2021/) for in-person work in 2021 — has now revealed its plans for its return to the office in 2022. Here are the details on the firm’s plans for a hybrid work environment (emphasis added):

Building on our earlier announcement that attorneys will not be required to return to the office through the end of the year, the Firm has determined that it will not require full-time, in-office work for attorneys in its US offices in 2022. Starting in January 2022, we will implement a hybrid work model that allows attorneys to work in the office at times and remotely at others, with the guideline that attorneys work in the office on average three days per week.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Due to the “growing number of attorneys in the offices” law firm leaders have seen this fall, Willkie is encouraging others to consider working from the office before year-end so they can reaquaint themselves with their routines and their friends. The firm will have technology on hand to “allow (without requiring)” associates to indicate whether or when they plan to be in the office. This new technology will first be made available in the firm’s New York office.

“It’s great,” one chipper associate said of the firm’s new in-office work policy. We agree. Only having to commute to the office three days a week, on average, does sound pretty great. Hopefully other Willkie associates are just as happy.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# 8 Signs That You Are Not On Your Way To Success
## Sorry, but it may be time to reconsider what success means to you.

Success is a relative thing.  To some it’s the corner office, more money, and professional recognition.  To others its living a peaceful life next to Walden Pond, or traveling and working odd jobs all over the world, or devoting life to people, animals, or a cause.

But today, let’s stick to making it as a lawyer, that is, making partner and earning a ton of money.

You studied hard all through school, got accepted to an Ivy League school, and still working your tail off were accepted into a top-10 law school — where you worked even harder still.   It paid off — you slave now at a top-tier firm, having formerly clerked for a federal judge.

Now what?

By now you should know the drill — work your tail off for another 8-10 years and maybe – maybe — if the stars align (and, especially, if you are a white male), you will be made a PARTNER!  Success!!

Not. So. Fast.

I said “if you’re lucky.”  And if you work your tail off for another 8-10 years.  It’s not automatic or a slam dunk.  In fact, the odds are slim.  And now you have a spouse, maybe a kid on the way (maybe twins!), and other obligations that take up some (or a lot) of your valuable success-time.  Life balance is not so easy anymore — gotta give up yoga, happy hours, poker nights.  Or else work twice as hard — you know, put a cot in your small, windowless office and when the light’s out at 4 a.m. pretend you’re camping at Yosemite.

But let’s assume that you are doing your darnedest to make it, to achieve success — the Holy Grail.   How do you know if you are on the right track?

One key fact: remember that it’s a zero-sum game — if others make it you don’t.  So, you may be running hard, but if you are not ahead of the pack you’re nowhere.  You’re engaged in more cutthroat competition; and don’t get too chummy with that associate down the hall — she may stab you in the back.

Let’s recap what we now know.  You have worked diligently and relentlessly, harder than the other seven people on your corridor.

But how do you know how you’re doing?  Are there milestones or markers along the way?  Point totals that you can constantly check?  Big data or metrics that you can consult?  ANY objective factors?

Ummm … no.  You have to rely on your instincts and observations, so develop your 5+ senses and keep a keen eye out.  Imagine that you’re a predator — or prey — in the jungle and sleep with one eye open.  And never, NEVER, let down your guard.  As Satchel Paige said (never mind who he was — for all you know he was a disgruntled office seeker), “Don’t look back, something might be gaining on you.”   (He also presciently said: “How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you are?”)

But as always, I can help.  I have some heretofore well-kept double secret tips that, now that I am of a certain age, I feel free to make public.  So here it is: how to tell that you’re not making it; that your path has some kinks in it; that, maybe, after 20 years of school and in the midst of long and grueling hours you may be working your way outta there, and maybe it’s time to cut your losses (nah, it’s not happening to you!).

- You are a fifth-year associate and still lugging the books around. Sorry — forgot what year this is.  You’re still doing basic legal research on your desktop.  Which you still have to submit to a seventh-year. And which is no different than when you were a first-year.  And is no different than current first-years.  And you are never — NEVER — permitted to speak with a partner without a senior associate chaperoning you. Not a good sign.
- You try to suck up to who you think are the right people but you see others sucking up to more senior people, who don’t even know who you are.  One even asked you if you were a paralegal, and walked away as you were explaining who you were.   Know that the suckees talk among themselves and know who’s who among the suckers and where in the pecking order they fit even if they pretend they don’t.
- You seem to be the last one out — if you leave at all — while others skip out at 3 a.m. The cleaning person leaves and bids you good morning by name.  Why is this always the case?  Why you?
- You are instrumental in winning a big case, or closing a big deal, and the Grand Exalted One thanks everyone on the team by name but forgets yours — or calls you “pal” or “Big Guy.”  Or even skips over you.  Not a positive sign.
- You seem to be the only one in your class who has never met a client. Or has never been in court — even as a second chair on a motion (first chair does not even come into the picture with you).  Or has never been asked to lunch by any of the Grand Exalted Ones.  Hmmm.
- The firm has purchased a table for 10 at a big client’s favorite fundraising event — a charity to save the endangered dung beetle — and you volunteered to go and even got to go (boy, the other associates will be envious!).  But you were the only one at your table.  Besides the two mail room clerks who dressed to the nines for the occasion, one of whom fell over dead drunk midway through the speech of by the guest of honor, The Grand Beetle Wizard.
- Although you are indeed working your tail off, you seem to be getting less work. Forget about getting less interesting work — but getting less work, period.  Are they telling you something?  Most likely.
- Finally, the dead giveaway. You arrive one fine morning — assuming that you actually left the night before — and find that your desk has been moved to the file room behind the spare copy machine. And your former office is occupied by the main copy machine.
It’s now time to reconsider what success means to you.

# Elite IP Litigation Boutique SHATTERS The Market, Leaves Cravath Raises In The Dust!

It was just yesterday when we lamented the fact that aside from [McKool Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-member-of-the-160k-plus-club-raises-associate-salaries-nationwide/), we had yet to hear from other members of the [$160K-Plus Club](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-160k-plus-club/), a group of elite firms that we’d previously highlighted for paying their first-year associates more than $160,000. As you may recall, $160K was the prevailing market salary for first-year attorneys for almost a decade prior to June 6, 2016, when it was [raised to $180,000 by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). For a full business week, associates hoped — nay, prayed — that any firm would be daring enough to raise the bar, and raise their first-year associates’ salaries over the $180K mark.

Associates, your prayers have finally been answered. [Desmarais LLP](http://www.desmaraisllp.com/) has officially blown the new Cravath salary scale (or the [“MoneyLaw” scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/), if you prefer) completely out of the water. Here’s an excerpt from the email Desmarais associates and summer associates received early this morning from founding partner John Desmarais (emphasis added):

Over the course of the last few days, several of the leading law firms in the New York market have announced an increase in their associate salaries — finally coming up to match what we at DLLP had been paying our associates all along. On behalf of the partnership, I am pleased to announce that Desmarais LLP has decided to adhere to its philosophy of paying above-market compensation to its associates.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Desmarais may have only 36 attorneys, but John Desmarais’s little dig about salaries finally coming up to his firm’s level must still burn for managing partners and chairpersons at other firms — especially other firms that have been too afraid (too cheap, or too financially unsound) to announce a move on market salaries for associates.

In the past, all class years at Desmarais made $20K more than the prevailing market rates at the time. First-year associates at the firm were paid $180K, second-year associates at the firm were paid $190K, and so on and so forth. Now that the prevailing market rate for first-year associates is $180K, Desmarais first-year attorneys will earn a whopping $200,000. All other class years at the firm have received the $20K bump as well. The full Desmarais salary scale in all of its majesty is available on the next page.

What’s also super impressive is the fact that on top of these huge salaries, Desmarais contributes 4 percent of associates’ salaries to their 401Ks, covers their health insurance costs in full (for both single associates and associates with families), and pays above-market bonuses each and every year. What a magical place to work!

Will your firm dare to match the beautiful new Desmarais salary scale? If Cravath wasn’t willing to go to $190K, then associates at other firms may be out of luck. But if your practice consists of high-stakes IP litigation, it may be time to consider a lateral move.

# Some Biglaw Staff Seem Pretty Pissed About The New Associate Salary Scale
## It's like 'a slap in the face' to staff at all law firms.

I understand the economics and how much our lawyers bring in. They keep the firms alive and they should be paid properly. But my salary was cut last year. My bonus was cut. I didn’t get a COVID-19 bonus. You see a third-year associate getting a $30,000 bonus, it is a slap in the face to staff. The idea that barriers between attorneys and staff are down … not true. It isn’t an even playing field at all.

My team got cut last year. My salary was eventually restored and I got my bonus late, but for several months [due to the cuts] I was doing two people’s jobs. I didn’t get anything extra for that.

— an anonymous staff member at a large law firm, commenting on the [raises that have spread like wildfire](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/) across the Biglaw landscape, and acknowledging that while younger associates are important, it still [stings that they’re paid inordinately higher salaries than staff](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/15/slap-in-the-face-how-law-firm-staff-feel-about-associate-raises/) who contribute and sacrifice just as much.

# David Boies Takes Responsibility For Enabling Harvey Weinstein

There are lots of reasons why Harvey Weinstein was able to allegedly sexually harass and abuse so many women for so long. His money and power provided a natural defense to women speaking out against him, but more and more details are emerging that he also used those tools to go on the offensive against women who might dare to tell their stories. He used [Biglaw firms and non-disclosure agreements](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/are-lawyers-perpetuating-a-culture-of-silence-surrounding-sexual-assault/) to silence some. And now comes a story from [Ronan Farrow writing for the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies), about Weinstein’s network of “spies” — Kroll, a corporate-intelligence company, and Black Cube, an investigative company run by former Israeli intelligence agents — and respected litigator David Boies’s role in keeping the allegations against the Hollywood mogul under wraps.

Black Cube’s engagement was explicitly intended to prevent the publication of abuse allegations — the ones that eventually exploded with a[ New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html). They were charged with creating profiles on each of their “targets,” often using false pretenses to gain access. Black Cube’s work included psychological profiles and sexual histories of potential Weinstein accusers, and that engagement was run through Boies Schiller Flexner, likely to bring the investigation under the patina of attorney-client privilege.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Boies personally signed the contract with Black Cube. The New Yorker reports the engagement was to “provide intelligence which will help the Client’s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper” and to “obtain additional content of a book which (sic) currently being written and includes harmful negative information on and about the Client.” The “leading NY newspaper” was the New York Times, which was investigating the allegations against Weinstein at the time of the Black Cube engagement. That’s the same New York Times that Boies was simultaneously representing the Times in other matters, including a libel case.

Boies denies the engagement of Black Cube was a conflict with the representation of the Times. He told Farrow he never tried to pressure reporters, and that any effort to do so would be inappropriate:

From the beginning, he said, he advised Weinstein “that the story could not be stopped by threats or influence and that the only way the story could be stopped was by convincing the Times that there was no rape.” Boies told me he never pressured any news outlet. “If evidence could be uncovered to convince the Times the charges should not be published, I did not believe, and do not believe, that that would be averse to the Times’ interest.”

….

“Given what was known at the time, I thought it was entirely appropriate to investigate precisely what he was accused of doing, and to investigate whether there were facts that would rebut those accusations,” he said.

According to Farrow, Black Cube’s list of “targets” that they were gathering information on included journalists.

As one may imagine, the New York Times takes a very different view of Boies’s work for Weinstein.

NYT statement on David Boies’s involvement in the effort to undermine its reporting on Harvey Weinstein [https://t.co/IyqwYgihhi](https://t.co/IyqwYgihhi) [pic.twitter.com/z684NI86kB](https://t.co/z684NI86kB)

— The New York Times (@nytimes) [November 7, 2017](https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/927886127142404098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

But Boies hasn’t washed his hands of all responsibility. He admits his firm did not direct the investigation, and that it was an error in judgment:

Boies said that his firm’s involvement with the investigators was a mistake. “We should not have been contracting with and paying investigators that we did not select and direct,” he told me. “At the time, it seemed a reasonable accommodation for a client, but it was not thought through, and that was my mistake. It was a mistake at the time.”

He goes on to to acknowledge his role in perpetuating the cone of silence that allowed Weinstein to operate unencumbered for so long:

Of his representation of Weinstein in general, he said, “I don’t believe former lawyers should criticize former clients.” But he expressed regrets. “Although he vigorously denies using physical force, Mr. Weinstein has himself recognized that his contact with women was indefensible and incredibly hurtful,” Boies told me. “In retrospect, I knew enough in 2015 that I believe I should have been on notice of a problem, and done something about it. I don’t know what, if anything, happened after 2015, but to the extent it did, I think I have some responsibility. I also think that if people had taken action earlier it would have been better for Mr. Weinstein.”

Even smart people with strong liberal bona fides can enable sexual harassment and assault. Boies’s admissions are a small, but vital, step to begin the process of fixing the problem. Hopefully, as awareness of the issue grows (#metoo), future lawyers who find themselves in the position of covering for a sexual predator remember the (bad) example of David Boies and take action to stop them.

Effective February 1, a month later than most of Winston’s peer firms, the following will be the salary scale at the firm:

One after the next, Biglaw firms keep falling in line to announce when their offices will fully reopen in the wake of employees’ prolonged absence due to the pandemic. In this post-COVID world, the majority of large firms have announced a September return, with varying levels of flexibility for remote work. Now, yet another Am Law top 10 firm will throw open its doors after Labor Day, but with tons of flexibility involved — including only a two- or three-day in-office workweek.

White & Case, ranked No. 8 on the most recent Am Law 100, with $2,387,800,000 in 2020 gross revenue, made this welcomed announcement earlier this week, and to say associates are quite pleased would be an understatement. Here’s a relevant excerpt from the email sent by Steven Petrie, W&C’s Americas Chief Operating Officer (emphasis added; full email on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/white-case-reopening/2/)):

[W]e will continue to support remote working in all of our U.S. offices through Labor Day. This means that if you are able to do your job remotely, we will not ask you to return to the office until September 7. Starting September 7, we will offer a flexible approach to remote working through the end of 2021, asking that you spend two or three days per week in the office.

Petrie noted that additional details on the reopening would be provided by the end of the summer, and that the firm’s Agile Working Task Force would be thinking about a “longer-term approach to remote work,” with further information to come.

“[L]et’s think about how we can go back to the office in a manner that makes sense for each of us,” Petrie wrote, “and then do so in a gradual and comfortable way.” Flexibility continues to be the key to the successful Biglaw firm of the future, and White & Case is sounding all of the right notes in its messaging here.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# HOLY CRAP: Dewey Know Who Was Convicted Of Felony Charges?

Steven Davis, Joel Sanders, and Stephen DiCarmine

I bet it isn’t who you think it is….

Well, perhaps it is. The retrial of former Dewey & LeBoeuf executives Joel Sanders, former CFO, and Stephen DiCarmine, former Executive Director, on fraud and conspiracy charges has fueled a lot of speculation — and [criticism](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/yes-prosecutors-are-still-trying-to-hold-someone-accountable-for-dewey-leboeufs-failure/). And the voices of dissent were supercharged when former Dewey Chairman Steven Davis negotiated a deferred prosecution agreement. But it seems as though the doggedness of the prosecution was worth it — today the jury returned a guilty verdict. But it isn’t an across the board victory for the people; DiCarmine was acquitted of all charges. As Law360 [reports](https://www.law360.com/bankruptcy/articles/919702/breaking-jury-convicts-ex-dewey-cfo-frees-exec-director):

On its fifth full day of deliberations, the jury of eight women and four men found former CFO Joel Sanders guilty on two felony fraud charges and a misdemeanor count of conspiracy but acquitted former Executive Director Stephen DiCarmine of all charges.

The fall of the former Biglaw giant forever changed the firm landscape. Even amid the jubilation of an associate pay raise ten years in the making, the specter of the Dewey downfall cast a pallor. Today a jury decided who was criminally responsible.

Update: The New York Times has [additional details](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/business/dealbook/dewey-leboeuf-verdict.html?smid=fb-share&_r=0) on the jury charge:

The jury convicted Mr. Sanders on charges of securities fraud, scheme to defraud and conspiracy.

In his charge to the jury on May 1, Justice Robert M. Stolz told the jurors that Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders were on trial not for the financial collapse of Dewey but on charges that they sought to conceal the severity of its financial situation.

# Am Law 20 Firm Begins Layoffs

[UPDATE: Memo provided on the next page]

Unfortunate news to kick off 2023.

Goodwin Procter, positioned at 17 in last year’s Am Law 100 with just a shade under $2 billion in revenue, appears to be in the early stages of a layoff.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We’ve already had layoff news [out of Cooley LLP](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) and [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/) and [even Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/). While the nation’s financial outlook is still dodgy, encouraging economic developments and a vivid memory of the Great Recession appear to have [stayed the pink slip hand of most firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/why-arent-more-biglaw-firms-conducting-layoffs-now-because-the-recessions-layoffs-punished-them/), firms with [substantial tech work](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firms-with-tech-centric-clients-may-soon-face-financial-difficulties/) seem to be getting hit a little harder than the rest of the market.

We’ve now learned that Goodwin is joining the list of firms cutting back on lawyers. Tipsters from multiple offices have reached out to report that the firm is communicating layoff news to attorneys over the course of the day. No word yet on the scale of the cuts or whether only specific groups or offices are involved. As details emerge, we’ll update.

It’s hard to find a silver lining in any layoff, but according to one tipster:

It sounds like a broad reduction in force based on anticipated need in the future. This was specifically not tied to any review or performance evaluation.

In an industry that has embraced the “stealth” layoff where leadership tries to make individual lawyers feel like it’s the associate’s fault they’ve been let go, we appreciate firms that are straightforward about employment decisions.

No firm wants to be known for layoffs, but if it’s happening, a reputation for transparency matters over the long-term.

# Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firm Reverses Pay Cuts For Associates

The Biglaw good news keeps on coming. We are seeing more and more firms that slashed salaries in the early days of COVID-19 do an about face and restoring compensation levels to where they were before the pandemic. The latest firm to do that is Squire Patton Boggs.

[Back in May, Squire Patton Boggs announced a ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/despite-a-billion-dollars-in-gross-revenue-squire-patton-boggs-cuts-salaries-amid-covid-19-austerity-measures/?rf=1)20 percent salary cut for all associates. Staff saw a range of cuts, between 10 and 20 percent, depending on salary. And partner distributions were adjusted to shoulder the largest financial burden.

Effective in October, the salary cuts for all associates will end and their compensation is going back to pre-pandemic levels. For support staff and other non-partners, if their salary was originally less than $75,000, then their compensation will be full restored; for others, their salary cut will be halved. The firm indicated the partnership will continue to shoulder the largest financial burden to meet any future issues, and distributions will be adjusted accordingly.

Squire Patton Boggs is also considering discretionary bonuses for extraordinary performance during COVID-19. But this will not impact the existing end-of-year bonus program.

Chairman/Global CEO of the firm Mark Ruehlmann had the following statement on the rollbacks:

“Thanks to the hard work and shared sacrifice of our attorneys and global staff, the impacts of the global pandemic on our business have been less severe than we reasonably anticipated. While demand for our services has remained strong, we recognize that a fair amount of uncertainty remains in the months ahead.  We will  monitor circumstances closely to continue to act in the best interests of our clients and the firm.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Layoffs Come To The Am Law 100 As Biglaw Firm Eliminates Jobs
## Best of luck to those who were let go.

Amid a technical recession and legal recruiters saying that “demand for associates no longer exceeds supply,” we’d been cautioning that outright layoffs (and perhaps stealth layoffs) may soon be on the way. Unfortunately, that has officially come to pass, with an Am Law 100 firm pushing employees out the door during a time of “transition.”

As first reported by the American Lawyer, Fish & Richardson — a firm that brought in $467,064,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it at No. 94 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — has eliminated its litigation secretary role across all 14 of its offices. The firm offered this comment on the reductions:

“Recently, we internally announced our plan to evolve our litigation practice support from a traditional litigation secretary role into positions that better align with the advanced skillsets of our talent and the way we practice law today,” the firm said in a prepared statement to The American Lawyer.

“This shift supports our practice goals to meet the current needs of our internal and external clients and further defines the skillsets and expectations of our support roles,” continued the statement. “Our traditional litigation secretary role was eliminated and we transitioned those roles to other litigation practice support roles.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Per Am Law, at least nine litigation secretaries were impacted by this move, and while some were offered other positions at Fish, the rest were let go.

We wish all those impacted by the firm’s layoffs the best of luck as they attempt to find new employment, in the legal sector or otherwise.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Let’s face it: everyone who goes to law school — just everyone — longs to land a job in Biglaw, right?

You passed through law school, the first phase of the law-hazing process, and passed the demanding entrance exam to become … a lawyer! And now, Biglaw!

As I noted [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/new-grads-bound-for-biglaw-do-you-know-what-youre-getting-into/) some time ago about Biglaw:

Besides the money, you will learn every possible way of carrying voluminous litigation files up and down courthouse stairs, and reviewing millions of documents — useful skills if you later want to become a paralegal. And maybe — just maybe — by your fifth or sixth year you will be permitted a front row seat at a real trial!

And if you’re really lucky, maybe after you become a partner, you will be allowed to second seat a trial! (You gotta be a partner first — sorry, you 90 percent who will never make it.)

Did I forget to mention the money?

Great pay — if you have the time to spend it, and don’t try to compute your income on a per hour basis, which would be too depressing (what is the current minimum wage, anyway?).

Great working conditions — heat in the winter and air in the summer, your own chair and desk (an office, maybe, after four or five years!), and even a car home after midnight!

And no worries about having to rent or live in an expensive apartment — there’s really no need! Since you will spend only about five hours a day there, just rent the use of a cot in a time share communal arrangement. You might even be able to pay off your law school loans within your lifetime!

But seriously — if you survive the life to get within striking distance of — dare I say — partnership!!! — what any sane person around yearns for, you should be prepared for that final push; that last gun lap; that final hundred yards into the “death zone” of Everest; that last bit of selfless obsequiousness which would make a beet turn red.

What to do? What not to do?

Well, the good news is that it’s easier not to make partner than it is to make partner! And with these 10 easy tips I will (almost) guarantee that you won’t make it!

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Let’s begin:

- Be a woman, or a member of a minority group. Yes, it’s that easy! Despite numerous surveys over decades, sworn oaths by Biglaw managing partners to increase diversity, and mandatory weekly kumbaya sessions, the sad truth is that Biglaw is still a white man’s game.
- Work less than 2300 hours per year. The exact number of hours is a judgment call. Some firms require more, some less. But whatever they require, if you bill less than 150% of the number, forget about partnership. This commandment should be etched in stone: the next six are simply corollaries.
- Resist working 100 days straight, without a break. In fact, a better idea is to resist virtually anything inhuman that you are asked to do — why limit it to consecutive number of days worked? If you show even a hint of resistance you’re a shoo in not to make partner.
- Be unavailable on a holiday, religious or otherwise. That’s right — be faithful to your religious beliefs at the expense of a partner’s whim or caprice. Celebrate a religious holiday or your child’s birth and ignore the random midnight request to alphabetize all of the statutes of your state by the last name of the legislation’s sponsor.
- Make your family a priority — works comes second.   This is, of course, related to number 4, supra, but the difference is your attitude. Even if you jump through every hoop and obey every command, if you even hint that your family comes first — forget it! See, e.g., number 3, supra.
- Call in sick when you your appendix bursts. Related to number 4 and 5, supra, in that you are demonstrating that (a) you are unavailable, and (b) you are selfishly thinking of yourself first.
- Tell the boss that you’re exhausted and need an hour off or ask to take a couple days off sometime within the next year.  After reading the tips above, this needs no further explanation. However, you may email me with any questions or clarifications — I’ve been there.
- Appear as if you have not slept last night at the office. That is, wear a fresh set of clothes every day, look chipper and well-rested, or otherwise don’t look like you’ve slept under your desk for three days. This is key — be disheveled, but carefully put-together disheveled.
- When a client tells you in front of the partner that you did a great job, take the credit and say thanks before the partner (who knows nothing about the task) can steal the credit. Also self-explanatory.
- Complain or inquire when the partner steals your billable hours. A partner stealing your billable hours when s/he is on vacation for two weeks and has not billed any time at all may not seem like a common practice and maybe it isn’t, but I’ve heard the woeful stories more than once. Complain about this improper practice or otherwise ask why it is happening — you can then kiss partnership goodbye!
Takeaway

Yes, it is far easier not to make partner – it’s really just a matter of being yourself! But despite all of your efforts, if you do make partner, you at least have the satisfaction and comfort of knowing that, at the end of the day, all of your loyalty and backbreaking work will be matched by the firm’s loyalty to you!

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Trans Biglaw Partner Says Her Book Of Business Plummeted When She Transitioned

Prior to my transition, I had typically a seven-figure book of business and kept [two or] three lawyers busy. When I was in my prime, so to speak, I had an eight-figure book of business and kept many, many lawyers busy. Since I’ve transitioned, within about 12 months, my book of business went to zero and I had to scrape for billable hours.

— [Danielle “DJ” Healey](https://www.fr.com/team/dj-healey/), a senior principal at Fish & Richardson in Houston, Texas, commenting on the negative impact her transition had on her book of business, during a [Law.com roundtable discussion](https://www.law.com/2021/03/11/they-certainly-dont-see-trans-people-as-people-trans-lawyers-discuss-their-fight-for-acceptance-in-the-legal-industry/) on discrimination in the legal profession. Healey is now incorporating contingency fee work into her patent litigation practice because “people without money are much less picky about their lawyers.”

# Biglaw Office Policies: You Catch More Associates With Honey Than Vinegar
## Latest podcast also talks about ranking the best law schools the worst way possible.

With March upon us, we created our our bracket-based challenge to rerank the top law schools based on… nothing. If the law schools don’t want to provide data to ranking services, we’ll show them what that looks like. [It’s pretty bad](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/top-4-law-schools-bracket/). Speaking of bad, a litigant got [a bit of a lecture](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/federal-judge-rebukes-lawyer-over-the-tone-of-brief-filed-with-potshots-and-hyperbole/) from a federal judge who cautioned for more civility in filings and let’s just say he did not get it. Finally, we return to the hybrid work model with a study in contrasts. One firm announces that it’s going to [close up the office for the month of August](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/law-firm-closing-up-its-offices-for-the-month-of-august/) while another puts [bonuses in jeopardy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/davis-polk-associates-bonus-office-attendance/) if an associate prefers to work in the office on different days. One of these firms will have a happier roster before this is all said and done.

# International Biglaw Firm To Roll Back Salary Freeze, Hand Out Bonuses
## In just a few months, salaries will go up and bonuses will be paid.

Biglaw firms across the country have decided to partially or completely roll back their COVID-19 austerity measures, and this new trend has now been picked up across the pond.

Over in the United Kingdom, Kennedys — a UK top 50 firm that has one office in the U.S. and increased its gross revenue by 9 percent to reach a record £238 million ($312,313,358.00) in 2019 — deferred its performance-based salary increases and bonus payouts earlier this spring thanks to the coronavirus crisis. Staff members were supposed to have their salary reviews in May, while attorneys were supposed to have their salary reviews in September. Thankfully, the firm has decided to “press ahead and reward staff for their work.”

All employees at the firm, both lawyers and staff members, will have their salary reviews in November. [Legal Week](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2020/08/24/kennedys-to-pay-out-salary-increases-and-bonuses-after-covid-19-delay/) has additional details:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Nick Thomas, senior partner of Kennedys, said in a statement: “It gives me immense satisfaction and pride to lead a partnership which chooses to reward our staff during what is a challenging time for so many businesses. But the reality is that they’ve earned it and deserve it having demonstrated their ability to maintain productivity remotely, helped by our robust IT platforms.

“As a business we live and breathe by ‘doing the right thing’ for our people and our clients, and we will never lose sight of the fact that our success is down to our people.”

The firm continued in a statement that it would be honouring all staff bonus commitments this year, adding that they had not made any redundancies, pay cuts, or furloughing arrangements during the last few months.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm. Let’s hope more firms get on board with this salary restoration movement — and soon.

# Cravath Breaks Silence On Associate Raises
## But what did the traditional compensation leader have to say?

Ever since [Milbank announced associate raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) last Thursday and then[ Davis Polk came over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) of those numbers, Biglaw watchers have been waiting and wondering — what will Cravath do?

Now, Cravath isn’t the only firm that can push the market forward (see, e.g., Milbank and Davis Polk), but they’re definitely big players. And after the glut of raises announced this week (we are already at 30+ firms on the new scale), whatever Cravath decides is probably the last chance to move the compensation grid. [Like in 2018,](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) when they came over the top of that year’s Milbank raises for midlevel and senior associates. So in 2021, will Cravath play spoiler again, or was that role already taken by Davis Polk’s announcement?

# Working With A Coach For Transformation And Empowerment
## Lawyers should consider working with a coach to find success and happiness.

Ed. note: This post is by [Jeena Cho](http://jeenacho.com/), a Legal Mindfulness Strategist. She is the co-author of [The Anxious Lawyer](http://amzn.to/1YprE5Y) (affiliate link), a book written by lawyers for lawyers that makes mindfulness and meditation accessible and approachable. She is the creator of [Mindful Pause](http://jeenacho.com/mindful-pause/), a self-paced online program for creating a more sustainable, peaceful, and productive law practice in just six minutes a day. Jeena offers actionable change strategies for reducing stress and anxiety while increasing productivity, joy, and satisfaction through mindfulness.

Diane Costigan is a seasoned executive and career coach. She currently serves as Winston & Strawn’s Director of Coaching. I recently had the opportunity to sit down with her to discuss why lawyers should consider working with a coach for finding success and happiness.

Jeena Cho: Can you talk a little bit about what coaches do?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Diane Costigan: Coaching at its root is focused on helping you achieve goals that you set that are meaningful to you. And, it’s a process. It’s a process of both transformation and empowerment.

Transformation meaning, you’re going to have goals and something will always be different by the end of your time in coaching. It might be you’ve developed a skill, or that you have changed or enhanced a way that you’re approaching something. It could be accomplishment-based, making partner in a law firm for example, or bringing in a certain amount of business. It could also be changing your mindset around something, or changing beliefs that you have, limiting beliefs that might be getting in the way.

It’s also a process of empowerment in that coaches don’t tell you what to do; they don’t give you the answers. It’s not advising or mentoring or counseling. It’s really working with you to pull the information from you, as coachee, to reach your goals.

Jeena Cho: I’ve worked with various coaches over the course of my career, I love working with a coach because they don’t have their own agenda; they’re fully focused on you and what your goals are. The coach listens to you, asks really great questions. When I first started working with a coach, I said, “Okay here’s my problem, go solve it.”

Diane Costigan: Coaches ask questions. Sometimes they ask one right question and you see the problem in a completely different way and I think that’s where the magic in coaching happens.

For a mentor, the best compliment you can give is, “Wow, that was really good advice.” And I think for a coach, the best compliment you can get is, “Wow, that was a really great question.”

# Associate Bonus Watch: How To Keep Your Associates Happy
## It's really not that hard, partners.

I was a bit surprised earlier this month when I learned that [WilmerHale](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/wilmerhale/) and one its top partners, [Jamie Gorelick](https://www.wilmerhale.com/jamie_gorelick/), are representing Jared Kushner, in connection with nepotism and conflict-of-interest concerns related to his serving in the administration of his father-in-law, Donald Trump. Although WilmerHale has some [prominent conservatives in its ranks](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/wilmerhales-warm-welcome-for-conservatives/), its overall reputation is left of center — thanks in part to prominent partners like Gorelick, a top official in the Justice Department during the Clinton Administration (and someone who surely would have snagged a major post in a second Clinton Administration, had she wanted one).

But at the end of the day, a client is a client — and people go to WilmerHale precisely in order to work on sexy, headline-making matters like the Kushner case. And we suspect that Kushner is paying the firm handsomely for its effort (well, at least if he’s better than his father-in-law when it comes to [paying legal bills](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/)).

Paying clients are what make bountiful bonuses possible. WilmerHale bonuses are out, and we’re hearing good things. For example:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- “Lockstep NY salary and bonus at Wilmer, in non-NY office. Midlevel to senior associate. Same hours requirement as last year. I’m pleased in light of mid-year base salary increase.”
- “It’s market bonuses for anyone who made hours at least in the D.C. office. Bonuses to be paid on January 31. Associates are happy.”
It’s possible that the folks we’re hearing from are non-representative, but assuming they are a fair indication of associate sentiment, it seems that WilmerHale lawyers are pleased to be [rid of “merit-based compensation.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-very-satisfying-bonuses-plus-a-pay-scale-overhaul/)

No muss, no fuss: lockstep base salaries on the market scale, and market-level bonuses for everyone meeting their hours. It’s an easy way to keep associates happy, especially if they’re pleased with the other aspects of the firm, such as their cases and colleagues.

UPDATE (1/26/2017, 10:09 a.m.): It turns out that some WilmerHale lawyers received above-market bonuses. A tipster explains:

1. A third of bonus-eligible attorneys got above market bonuses, apparently. So while we’re lockstep, it seems like we also have the benefit of “merit-based” without as many downsides — and we must have had a good year.

2. The email explicitly said that awarding above market is not intended to incentivize working extra hours, but rather to recognize and express gratitude for the personal sacrifice made when unexpected client needs arise. I do think some got extra even without far exceeding the minimum hours.

I’m sure it might sound like bulls**t to an outsider, but I believe these two pieces of info are very good signs for the firm and another step away from the more opaque merit-based comp model it used to follow. That they awarded above-market bonuses to a third of us and explicitly addressed their intentions is really appreciated and hopefully a good sign going forward.

Congratulations to WilmerHale associates on the nice bonuses!

There are, by our count, still a fair number of firms that haven’t announced 2016 bonuses yet. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

[Back in April,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/norton-rose-fulbright-lays-off-associates-cuts-salaries-amid-covid-19-upheaval/?rf=1) megafirm Norton Rose Fulbright announced a bunch of austerity measures thanks to the economic upheaval cause by COVID-19. And it wasn’t just the salary cuts that lots of other firms also instituted — associates were also laid off as part of the measures.

Those who were left at the firm in the U.S. saw a 15 percent salary cut for all those making over $50,000. Now the firm has announced the end of those compensation hits, and their salaries will be returned to full, pre-pandemic levels.

Jeff Cody, Norton Rose Fulbright’s US Managing Partner, had this statement on the firm’s reinstatement of salary cuts:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Based upon the firm’s performance through August, Norton Rose Fulbright US will end pay reductions for lawyers and staff and return them to full compensation on September 30. The partners are grateful for the commitment and loyalty demonstrated by all of our lawyers and staff during these difficult and uncertain times. These reductions were made in response to the pandemic, as our goal has always been to take care of our people while maintaining the firm’s health. We appreciate the ongoing commitment and loyalty of our people during these unprecedented times.”

When the firm announced its salary cuts in April, they indicated they’d only last through the end of September. Insert[ Wake Me Up When September Ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulRXvH8VOl8) joke here. Now that you’ve got that song stuck in your head, it’s good to see the firm’s financial performance is progressing as expected.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Look out D.C., West Coast mainstay Fenwick & West is here to play!

Yesterday, Fenwick announced they’re opening a new Washington office, their sixth in the U.S., and that location will a focus on the antitrust and trade needs of their clients. At the office’s launch, partners Thomas Ensign (formerly of Freshfields) and Melissa Duffy (formerly of Dechert) will be joining Steve Albertson, who joined Fenwick from Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom earlier this month. Ensign works with technology and life sciences clients and works on pre-merger notification requirements in U.S. and international jurisdictions. Duffy’s practice focuses on international trade matters, including those related to trade controls and national security requirements for cross-border transactions. Albertson counsels technology and life sciences clients in mergers and acquisitions and other antitrust compliance and merger enforcement issues.

As [reported by ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/fenwick-west-opens-d-c-office-eyeing-trade-antitrust-work)Bloomberg, antitrust and trade regulation are areas of focus for the firm:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We currently represent many of the most significant tech and life sciences companies that there are in the world,” Fenwick chair Richard Dickson said. “Their needs are definitely broad” in antitrust and trade.

This growth opportunity for Fenwick makes a ton of sense as antitrust is in the news in ways we haven’t seen in 20+ years. A sampling of recent developments in the space:

*Lina Khan’s elevation at the FTC will [“mean a flood of business for antitrust practices and opacity for clients,” as a D.C.-based IP trial lawyer told ALM.](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/18/how-lina-khan-may-change-business-prospects-overnight-and-bring-a-flood-of-business-for-antitrust-practices/)

*The DOJ recently confirmed a change in IP antitrust enforcement which will mean [“a significant change in the volume and nature of business for IP trial lawyers and their clients,” one lawyer told the National Law Journal.](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/06/15/as-doj-confirms-a-change-in-antitrust-patent-policy-lawyers-prepare-for-shifting-demand-403-62719/)

*Bloomberg Law reports we should expect [criminal antitrust prosecutions to increase](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-are-criminal-antitrust-prosecutions-set-to-rebound).

*Healthcare antitrust cases are also expected to spike over the next year, as reported by National Law Journal quoted a Biglaw partner saying [“Antitrust is in the news more than I have ever seen in my entire 14-year career at the DOJ, and that attention translates to enforcement.” ](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/07/why-antitrust-health-care-lawyers-are-set-for-a-big-year/)

*A number of prominent private antitrust actions right now (against Apple, Visa/MasterCard, Zillow) that Connecticut Law Tribune describes as an [“emerging litigation trend.”](https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2021/06/15/big-tech-in-crosshairs-antitrust-suit-against-zillow-is-part-of-emerging-litigation-trend/)

So, yeah, beefing up your firm’s antitrust practice seems super smart ATM.

The firm hasn’t, as of yet, decided on a physical location for the office. Though with the pandemic, this isn’t too much of an issue:

# Take Your Firm’s Work To The Next Level With Neos
## With endless customization options and a robust suite of integrations, Assembly Software’s Neos is a powerful, cloud-based platform ideal for today’s forward-thinking attorneys.

Robb Steinberg, Esq., founder of Trialworks (one of the pioneering case management platforms) and Cloud Migration Lead at Assembly Software, has been making attorneys’ lives easier since early in his legal career when he successfully argued for his firm to be allowed to use electronic document storage and retrieval during the discovery process for a major Ponzi scheme matter.

“Computers were basically just word processors for law firms,” Steinberg recalls. “That’s the only thing they knew they could do.”

Steinberg entered the world of legal software while still an attorney himself, developing the on-premises case management software Trialworks before eventually leaving his legal practice in 1999.

Almost two decades later, Trialworks merged with Needles, another on-premises case management product, to form Assembly. The company then created [Neos: a cloud-based practice management solution](https://bit.ly/3PnC1v2) that combines the best features of both programs to drive productivity and support workflows.

The Best of Trialworks and Needles Available in the Cloud

With the merger of Trialworks and Needles, Steinberg and his colleagues had an opportunity to build on each program’s greatest strengths in a new [case management software](https://bit.ly/3PnC1v2) that works on any device with access to a modern browser.

“We already knew that we needed to make the move to the cloud, and we immediately started taking the best features of Trialworks and the best features of Needles and putting them together,” Steinberg says.

When moving to the cloud, Steinberg and company looked to one of the most powerful resources available for secure cloud-based business tools: Microsoft’s Azure platform. 

For users, this comes with a slew of perks. For one, Neos’ integration with Microsoft 365 makes it effortless for firms to tag emails into cases, access Calendar from Neos, and leverage SharePoint for easy document storage and retrieval. 

[](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/Assembly%20Legal%20Product%20Review%2006_2023/Document_Management_1.png)

Using Azure also creates storage redundancy across five data centers, ensuring that firm data won’t be lost. 

“All five of those data centers would have to go off in 15 seconds for us to really have an outage,” Steinberg says. “If one goes off, we just spin up another one automatically by code.”

Operating in the cloud frees firms from the performance limitations of on-premises systems, which are often slowed down by too many users or might only allow a single user to work on a document at a time.

This freedom enables firms to scale their team size without having to worry about whether their system can take on the additional demand. Even better, the entire office can work from anywhere with an internet connection (no VPN needed!)

Automated Convenience for All Your Workflows

Neos is populated with clever automations targeting common speed bumps in attorney workflows, and its developers are always looking for new opportunities to cut down the number of clicks required for getting from one screen to another, Steinberg says.

It is programmed to automatically track your time for any and all billable tasks completed within the software, catching even quick tasks like drafting and sending an email — something Steinberg says many attorneys forget to record.

Other features serve to catch duplicate contact entries during intake, help attorneys quickly understand an unfamiliar matter at a glance via the Activity Feed, seamlessly record client communications, set up repeating automated workflows, and more.

Steinberg recalls a client firm that, before moving to Neos, needed one of its employees to show up at 4 a.m. every Monday to assemble a series of reports for the firm’s attorneys. 

With automation through Neos, the firm was able to set up each custom report that would be generated and delivered each week without human intervention. This not only made that employee’s life better but also eliminated the potential for human error when generating the reports — after all, who among us can consistently function at full capacity every Monday before dawn?

Endlessly Customizable Functions and Integrations

Nearly every aspect of Neos’ interface is customizable, from an individual attorney’s dashboard and the information and types of cases included in a particular report to practice-specific workflows and case-specific documents. 

“You could have two firms doing the same type of law in the same office building, and they won’t practice law the same way,” Steinberg says. Neos’ customizability makes it an excellent tool for any firm, regardless of the differences in their approach to legal matters.

Virtually every aspect of the 600+ reports Steinberg says Neos can produce can be modified to fit the unique needs of the attorney accessing the report. 

User dashboards are also entirely customizable in terms of the information they display and how they display it. Users can even share dashboard set-ups if they notice a colleague using a dashboard they’d like to try.

In addition to customizing Neos itself, users have massive leeway to [integrate their other favorite software](https://bit.ly/46hwzjl) — think Quickbooks, DocuSign, Zapier, LawPay, and other popular tools — with Neos thanks to the program’s use of APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces. 

[](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/Assembly%20Legal%20Product%20Review%2006_2023/Integrations_Zapier_2.png)
“The product is very API-friendly, which means that if a customer needs something done that our product cannot do, we can give them an API key so they can do it themselves,” Steinberg says. 

APIs function essentially as translators for software, he explains. By building robust documentation for Neos’ APIs, Assembly opened the door to a huge number of potential integrations between Neos and other software.

He gives the example of Neos’ integration with RingCentral, a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) communication platform, to illustrate just how effective and easy these integrations can be. 

[](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/Assembly%20Legal%20Product%20Review%2006_2023/Communications_RingCentral_3.png)

If an attorney using Neos and RingCentral gets a call, the program will automatically pull up the information for the matter associated with that call. Neos will also track calls through RingCentral directly in the relevant matter, saving attorneys from having to manually input data.

Similar automations apply for many integrations, all to cut down on the time spent on busy work while maximizing the time available for what attorneys really need to do: deliver results.
