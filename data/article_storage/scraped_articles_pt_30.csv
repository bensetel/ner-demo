# The Best Law Firms To Work For In America (2018)
## Did your law firm make the cut this time around?

Last week, Vault released the [2018 edition](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2018/) of its closely watched law firm rankings, proving that money — in the form of Cravath’s new $180K pay scale — can buy prestige.

But can that money buy happiness?

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to their overall quality of life, including satisfaction, firm culture, hours, compensation, substantive work, business outlook, career outlook, associate/partner relations, transparency, formal/informal training, and diversity. This may be surprising for some, but almost none of the firms that made the Top 10 list for being the most prestigious made the Top 10 list for being the best firms to work for.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“As law school enrollment has dropped over the last decade, law firms must compete even more fiercely for the top candidates, and this generation of law school graduates care about more than just prestige,” said Matt Moody, Vault’s Senior Law Editor. “The associates currently working at a law firm offer the best window into what life is really like at any particular firm, and Vault’s Quality of Life Rankings and firm profiles summarize this information so that law students and laterals can carefully weigh their options.”

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms to Work For](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-to-work-for/?sRankID=27&pg=2) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2018:

# Executive And Partner Salaries Are On The Chopping Block At This Am Law 200 Firm
## Partners are the first to have their salaries cut at the firm.

As more and more Biglaw firms announce their COVID-19 austerity measures, it’s tempting to lump all cost-cutting together but there are important distinctions to be had. There is a big difference in asking a secretary to take a 10 percent pay cut as your first move, versus furloughing wide swaths of staff, versus slashing partner compensation. The latest firm to announce cuts is making sure the top of the firm is being cut from first.

Husch Blackwell, a firm knocking on the Am Law 100’s door (they come in at the 101st spot), is also making cost-cutting measures to keep cash a-flowin’ during these rough economic times. But unlike other firms that have taken an across the board approach to the cuts, at least for now, those at the top of the law firm food chain are the ones impacted. Equity partner draws were cut by 15 percent and all managing directors and c-level executives had their salaries cut by 10 percent.

A firm spokesperson confirmed the cuts and said, “Like all companies, we continue to monitor the pandemic’s impact on our business and that of our clients.”

# U.S. News Best Job Rankings: Being A Lawyer Is Now A T14 Career
## Sure, the hours are 'grueling,' but this job is so hot right now.

Each year, U.S. News and World Report comes out with a ranking of the 100 best jobs in the nation, based on important factors like median salary, employment rate, growth over the next 10 years, future job prospects, stress level, and work-life balance. With criteria like that, it makes sense that in 2022, the job of “Lawyer” is ranked quite highly on the list of the Top 100.

While U.S. News once ranked Lawyer as a [worse job than Nail Technician](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/the-2014-u-s-news-job-rankings-being-a-lawyer-is-worse-than-being-a-nail-technician/) in the wake of the Great Recession, in the pandemic era, being a lawyer ranks as one of the best jobs of all. To keep this ranking familiar for lawyers who love the U.S. News law school rankings, check out the [Top 14 Best Jobs for 2022](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-jobs):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Congratulations, [lawyers](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/lawyer)! In 2022, there are literally not enough of you to go around to complete the legal work that needs to be done, so the job market is hot, and salaries are even hotter. Not only is Lawyer ranked #9 in the Top 100 best jobs, but it came in at #1 in [Best Social Service Jobs](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-social-services-jobs) and at #18 for [Best Paying Jobs](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-paying-jobs), with a median salary of $126,930. (Your mother was right — you should’ve been a doctor. Outside of working in Biglaw, the pay is much better.)

But please be careful when pursuing this career, because there is a major downside to being a lawyer that current attorneys already know far too well. “A lawyer’s work is often grueling, involving long hours at the office,” notes U.S. News. Now, thanks to COVID-19, when your home is your office and your office is your home, the concept of work-life balance is no more, and it can make the life of a lawyer even more stressful than it was pre-pandemic.

Mental health concerns aside — heh, aren’t those always an aside for lawyers? — the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, about 71,500 jobs will open up for lawyers. You spent all of that money on a law degree, so come grab a job while the market is hot (before all those who decided to go to law school during the pandemic graduate and gum up the works).

Way to go for having such a prestigious career, lawyers!

# Authenticity And Motherhood

Like any superhero, lawyer-moms sometimes feel like we live a double life. In one moment, we are patient and nurturing, and, in another, we are zealous advocates who won’t take no for an answer. Sometimes it seems the two responsibilities are entirely at odds. We might wonder if the identities themselves are irreconcilable, each defined by a warring set of skills and demands. We wonder if we could ever integrate the two — or just be ourselves.

Authenticity is immensely important to our performance and our satisfaction in work. We need to feel like we know who we are, we understand our strengths and values, and that we can make traction toward our own meaningful goals. We need to feel like we can BE who we are at work, bringing our wide range of talents and experiences to the table in addition to the legal skills we’ve honed. And, of course, within the boundaries of professionalism, ethics, and effective representation for our clients.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Lawyer-moms are tired of the old models. The archetype of the “man to see,” which looks nothing like us and serves almost none of our clients. The billable hour standard, which doesn’t reflect the value that we add. The expectation of shadowing a role model who lives a life we don’t want to emulate. The myth of a flat structure that rewards seniority rather than accomplishment and innovation. Those standards do not serve authenticity, and they make us miserable more often than not.

All lawyers need honesty and integration to show up authentically. We need margin and recovery to show up authentically. And we don’t need to give up professionalism — or boundaries — to accomplish this worthy goal.

Authenticity makes room for leadership without title, authority, or direct reports. When we show up authentically as ourselves, we are holding space for others to do the same. When we speak honestly about our skills and expertise, we can also be generous in lifting up other women. Just like we know our kids learn best when they see us model a behavior, so do lawyers.  Our kids are watching. So are our colleagues and our clients. Show them courage. Show them diversity. Show them compassion. Show them struggle.  Show them honesty. Show them grit and determination. Show them resilience.

Authenticity also leads to connection. There’s something about “we’re in this together” instead of pretending like we all have it together. We can have real conversation about priorities, strategy, and realistic expectations for productivity and results. After nearly a year of pandemic life, many of us are still holding ourselves to the standards of what we could accomplish in the old days. It’s unpopular to say, but lowering the bar can be a healthy step, acknowledging we can’t accomplish what we used to in a week. There is a way for us to add value and produce incredible results — high quality, lower quantity — alongside motherhood and self-care. When we have a real conversation about it, and allow some growth and variation from outdated standards, then there is room for progress.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The truth is, there are things about my life as a lawyer that make me a better mom. (At this point we’ve all been reassured of the benefits of being a working mom, yes?) But after months of doing both jobs with razor-thin margins, I’m equally convinced now that my life as a mom also makes me a better lawyer.

I’m not going to give you a list of “feminine qualities” and skills that translate well to compassion for our clients. The skills you bring to life as a mom and lawyer are unique to you and not universal. (True story: I’m empathetic but I suck at teamwork.). But I will encourage you to consider what they are, when they overlap, and when they are at odds.

There are times when the skills align beautifully. In my experience preparation, creativity, quick thinking, resilience, optimism, and patience have served me very well as a mom and as a lawyer. My clients appreciate that I am not quick to lay blame or point fingers. I’m ready to reframe and find a solution. I don’t get disappointed when it doesn’t go right the first time. We’ll try again! I know I have the legal chops, but I have so much more to offer. It feels good to let all of that goodness to the surface with confidence.

A simple step toward being authentic is to make a list of some of the strengths and tendencies that show up in your life: one column as a mom and another a lawyer. Maybe some things make both lists. Maybe some feel ugly, and others feel beautiful. But if all are true to you, you’ll be ready to more mindfully choose the energy you bring to each situation. And more courageously choose to show up authentically as a one whole, amazing lawyer-mom.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Biglaw Firm Touts Successful Year, But Doesn't Thank Associates With Special Bonuses
## And associates are NOT happy.

This year, Biglaw bonus season generally consists of two components — the traditional year-end bonus and special bonuses given in appreciation of associates’ hard work during this particularly challenging time. And if the total bonuses don’t add up to those combined numbers, well, then a firm is below market.

At Alston & Bird, the year-end bonuses are individualized and tied to hours, not class year, as at most Biglaw firms. But even beyond that issue, tipsters at the firm are reporting that the bonuses are only year-end money with no special bonus money. And insiders are pissed. Take a look at some of the comments we’re getting:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In an extremely short-sighted decision and despite constant reassurances that the firm performed remarkably well during the pandemic, Alston & Bird refused to match any COVID special bonuses, full stop. Associates are justifiably livid and I’ve heard rumors of people already seeking out opportunities elsewhere.

Alston & Bird bonus announcements official. No special 2020 bonus. Hours bonus scale the same as prior years (not pegged to class).

Word across the firm is that despite high bonus thresholds to get NY market (2150 with max 150 pro bono hours), no one got a covid bonus. No explanation given, but associates were told the firm is having one of their best years ever. No one is happy.

No covid bonuses after repeatedly hearing about how the firm is having an incredible year. Very, very angry.

No covid bonuses at Alston & Bird. I. I billed in the 2200-2400 range and didn’t even get anything above regular market. I’m fuming

No special 2020 bonus.

Ordinary bonus still pegged to hours, not class. Hours tiers same as last several years. Dramatically below NYC market.

Very disappointing for 2400+ hrs.

Oof. It stinks to bill that much for the firm and feel unappreciated.

# Asking About Brown v. Board Is 'Gutter Politics,' According To Senate Judiciary Official

Brown v. Board is one of those opinions that’s reached Ghostbusters status. To paraphrase: “if someone asks you if you think Brown was right… you say YES!” It’s really not that hard. Unless the next words out of your mouth are going to be a Derrick Bell-inspired critical deconstruction of Brown as a dispiriting half-measure that undermined grassroots movements, there is never a scenario where your answer shouldn’t be a full-throated affirmation of the landmark opinion.

But Michael Davis, last seen bragging to the press about [all the people he fired so he could clerk for Gorsuch](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/law-clerk-explains-to-reporter-that-he-really-is-kind-of-a-jerk/), doesn’t think it’s right that people ask Trump’s nominees about Brown. In his role as chief counsel for nominations on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Davis took questions over the phone from advocacy groups in Iowa earlier this month, giving us his earnest thoughts on raising Brown v. Board at hearings:

I think it’s cheap political games and cheap racial politics going on with the Brown v. Board of Education discussion . . . It is gutter politics that should not be involved with judicial nominations.

It strikes me that there’s really no reason why asking a judicial nominee about one of the most famous opinions of all time would constitute “politics” of any sort. Is it because Davis feels the issue is so well-settled as to be irrelevant? There’s a school district in Mississippi [that only desegregated last year](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/03/a-mississippi-school-district-is-finally-getting-desegregated/519573/). It would seem that this is very much a live legal issue. The only scenario where talking about Brown could ever be embarrassing for a nominee is if staying truthful under oath would require them to say, “no, I think segregation is good.” Which, Occam’s Razor and [Wendy Vitter’s hearing](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/originalists-do-not-think-segregation-was-unconstitutional-and-wish-youd-stop-bothering-them-about-it/) would suggest, is the real problem Davis has here. Because if telling the truth under oath allowed a nominee to say, “of course the famous, unanimous Supreme Court ruling was correct,” then this wouldn’t be an issue at all.

But let’s explore this “gutter” language a bit more. This isn’t some obscure “gotcha” precedent like Senator Kennedy’s dumb refresher on [outdated abstention doctrine cases](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/senator-embarrassing-judicial-nominees-with-remedial-law-school-questions/). This is front and center of every Con Law course. Hell, this is front and center of every Middle School civics course. But even if one labored under the delusion that this wasn’t a “fair” question, where does that make the leap to “gutter” language? There’s a long history in this country of using [“garbage” and “sewage” analogies for race](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/you-should-absolutely-read-this-insane-law-school-event-promo-calling-immigrants-toilet-people/). It’s shameful.

Davis serves as chief counsel for nominations, placing him in charge of shepherding the bucket of deplorables that make up Trump’s judiciary nominees to confirmation. In fairness, there have been several competent conservative judges nominated by this administration — but that’s been far overshadowed by the cynical drive to pack the judiciary’s ranks with questionably qualified and troublingly retrograde warm bodies. While [Brett Talley: Kid Ghosthunter](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/brett-talley-being-withdrawn-good-night-sweet-prince-and-flights-of-ghosts-sing-thee-to-thy-rest/) is the most infamous example, he’s hardly alone. John Bush made it on the Sixth Circuit on a résumé consisting primarily of “lawyer who blogs about hating gays,” and Steve Grasz landed on the Eighth despite earning a [“not qualified” rating from the ABA](https://www.bna.com/trump-nominee-pressed-n73014472645/), which is almost impossible to earn. Toward the end of the video, Davis is actually asked about Grasz’s rating and sluffs it off as the ABA overreacting to “anonymous hearsay drive-by shootings” that Grasz is “gratuitously rude.” Apparently, the whole bit about Grasz [supporting gay conversion therapy](https://www.bna.com/trump-nominee-pressed-n73014472645/) didn’t register a mention.

But he’s the point person on these nominations. He has to be ready to put lipstick on some of the more porcine elements of this cadre of nominees. Perhaps he’s got better answers on the subject of diversity? Well… no. When asked about that subject:

This is a terrible cheap shot against Chairman Grassley and it doesn’t surprise me that you would say that.

It doesn’t surprise me that he’d say that either because it’s an empirical fact.

Professor Carl Tobias has a breakdown of Trump’s nominations and, when he published this review, Trump had put up [113 nominations and only 10 are people of color](https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1099&context=wlulr-online). That’s a lower representation of diversity than any administration since Reagan (when the pool of diverse attorneys was markedly smaller).

But when Jamal Watkins of the NAACP asked about diversity, Davis explained that he’s got diversity covered, pointing out that Amy Coney Barret is “[a Catholic mother of seven, she’s adopted two of those children from Haiti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9bdJxEHn-Y&amp=&feature=youtu.be?t=35m35s).”

Wow. Note, this is the first example he manages to come up with. First! In a speech that sounds suspiciously like “I know black people,” his first example of diversity is someone whose racial diversity bona fides are that she knows black people.

Davis continues naming the handful of diverse judges coming out of this administration, until Watkins interjects that this is basically [an “I have black friends” speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9bdJxEHn-Y&amp=&feature=youtu.be?t=37m08s). Davis responds, “Well, I’m sorry if what I just said doesn’t fit into your narrative.”

Numbers aren’t really a “narrative,” Skippy. The question on the table was about the data point that diversity among federal judges is going down, and your answer was a bunch of anecdotes about exceptions that prove the rule because they’ve adopted kids from Haiti. Look, I don’t expect an honest answer because we’re all adults here and know the truth is the administration is more interested in activist right-wing judges than diversity and, for some crazy reason, it’s hard to find minorities queuing up for the “Make America Antebellum Again” agenda. But at least have the basic respect to not slime the question as if it’s some kind of conspiracy theory.

And, if we’re going to go down the “I have black friends” trail, let’s consider another anecdote from the administration’s nomination process.

When he was nominated, David Lat noted that “[The main problem for Farr is age (he’s in his 60s)](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/more-judicial-nominations-from-the-trump-administration/),” which seems so long ago now. Since then his “main problem” has rolled through [being accused of misleading the Senate by a former DOJ official](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/judicial-nominee-may-have-lied-to-senate-about-role-in-racist-voter-suppression-effort/) and “ties to white supremacists.” Davis addressed the latter charge:

To say that someone is a white supremacist is a serious allegation and it sounds to me like you don’t want to have a serious conversation.

Well, Farr’s partner was on the board of the Pioneer Fund, an organization that funded eugenics research into attempts to [prove that African Americans are genetically inferior](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/he-defended-north-carolinas-voter-suppression-law-now-hes-set-to-become-a-federal-judge-there/), which seems like the most literal possible definition of white supremacy. Now maybe he shouldn’t be his law partner’s keeper, but it’s not an unfair area of inquiry. Davis said this is the first he’d heard about this and that it was not raised at his committee hearing (it was) and that no one submitted any letters on this subject (they did) because otherwise he’d have read about this because he reads all the letters (he apparently doesn’t).

Taking questions from aggrieved groups is a difficult task, but that’s where a seasoned spokesperson is supposed to warmly dissemble and fill an hour saying nothing. Davis went with the alternate “blithely dismissive” approach. It’s refreshingly more befitting the nature of the current process of filling the nation’s judiciary — a judiciary riddled with openings because Davis’s bosses spent years blocking judicial nominees and now cry about [a crisis entirely of their own making](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/when-you-hear-whining-about-judicial-vacancies-dont-get-played/). Just accept the nominees as they come. Don’t ask questions, don’t poke into their past, there’s a judicial crisis after all!

And certainly don’t get into irrelevant “gutter” issues like race.

# Beyond Biglaw: Closing The Pay Gap
## The challenge of closing this gap is an acute one, according to former Biglaw partner Gaston Kroub.

There have been a number of articles that have sprung out of the [latest report](https://www.mlaglobal.com/publications/research/compensation-survey-2016) demonstrating a pretty significant pay disparity between female and male partners at large law firms. While various reasons have been floated from the punditry to explain the situation, one theory in particular appears to have generated some traction. According to this line of thinking, large law firms have effectively migrated towards an “eat what you kill” model that rewards origination of client work (similar to the model used at many smaller firms, and of course by all solo practitioners). In contrast, lockstep pay models that reward partners based on seniority have become disfavored, except perhaps at the most elite firms with the deep institutional client relationships that can support such a model.

Under this new pay regime, the theory goes, female partners may be disadvantaged because on average their originations are lower. As Jeffrey Lowe of Major, Lindsey & Africa [notes](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/from-the-obvious-files-male-biglaw-partners-make-more-than-female-ones/), origination and working attorney receipts have become the main determinants of partner compensation.

“That’s the crux of the issue: Why are men generating more business than women?” Lowe said. “Is there some boys’ club aspect or not?”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I personally am nowhere near an expert on partner compensation, despite my experience as a partner at two large law firms (and now a boutique). At one firm, the compensation system was “closed” so that only the firm executives knew what each partner made. At the other, there was an “open” system where partner salaries were published and disseminated to the entire partnership. Yet even at the “open” firm, it would have been very difficult to tease out — without knowing the underlying numbers for each partner, such as origination, collections, and realization — whether female partners were being systematically paid less for equal production than their male colleagues. While I doubt that they were, I was never in a position to really confirm that assumption. Considering the recent coverage of Biglaw female partners suing to end gender-based compensation discrimination, there is a decent chance that at least some firms engage in such abusive behavior.

While illegal discrimination should never be tolerated, my current sentiment is that partner pay at many large law firms is a broken system — irrespective of gender, and particularly for younger partners. At the same time, I think that Lowe’s question as to whether there is a “boys’ club” suppressing the ability of female partners to originate business is an interesting and important one.

As an initial matter, any Biglaw firm (or firm of any size) that explicitly or implicitly decides to hinder the ability of female lawyers to solicit and retain business is taking a huge risk. Both in the short term, with respect to the likelihood that they are losing out on potential business and courting liability for their discriminatory practices, as well as in the long term, in terms of their industry reputation and ability to retain talented women partners. One would hope that in this age of greater transparency — including through the work of this website — any such “boys’ clubs” have run well past their expiration dates, and will be rooted out by firms forthwith. In light of this pay disparity study, perhaps more law firms should look inward, and evaluate honestly whether or not they are living up to their end of their partnership agreement with their female partners — while making clear that they will embark on corrective action immediately, especially if any bad practices or behaviors are uncovered.

In some respects, a firm working to clean up its own act may be an easier fix than addressing the other potential “boys’ club” implied by Lowe’s question — that on the client side. On the one hand, many corporate legal departments proclaim their interest in spreading their business to female (and minority) partners. But the statistics on origination performance for female law partners apparently tell a different story — or at least those statistics suggest that progress is being made more slowly than perhaps desired. The question then becomes: what can firms and individual partners do to market their female partners better? Presumably there are more female in-house lawyers with “buying power” nowadays as well. So do firms need to market differently to those lawyers, as opposed to their male counterparts? The answers are not so readily apparent, though I suspect any legal marketing department worth its salt or individual business generator is at least considering them.

The challenge of both supporting female lawyers looking to sell legal services, and effectively targeting female lawyers or businesspeople in a position to purchase legal services, is an acute one. One would think there would be more discussion on this topic — particularly in this age of “gender-based marketing,” where large corporations seeking to sell staple products such as shampoo, or deodorant, or even laundry detergent have moved toward marketing variants of those products directly to members of a certain gender. For example, drugstore shelves are replete with hygiene products “designed solely for men,” and those products are advertised differently than their counterparts that are targeted at women. Yet, I for one don’t really hear much about firms undertaking initiatives to boost the sales performance of their female lawyers, or specifically tailor their marketing towards female consumers of legal services. I am not sure if they should be, but I guess the sentiment in some corners is that action along these lines is warranted.

I can definitely see why law firms may be reluctant to publicly announce that they are considering gender-based sales and marketing initiatives, and that espousing a gender-blind sales and marketing approach may be the best way to avoid any gender discrimination. For example, it is always best for any service business to know its customers, and address their needs with the appropriate personnel — without favoring either gender unless there is a compelling business reason to do so (such as the approach taken by the large product companies, which sell discrete items to address the different needs of their different customers).

At the same time, there is only so much utility that can be gained by generally identifying the problem of lower female partner originations. At minimum, it seems to me at least that this is a good time for a more open and frank dialogue on what both firms and clients can really do to root out any bias, while not sacrificing their standards or patronizing female lawyers who simply deserve the chance to succeed or fail just like their male colleagues. As with any complicated issue, the answers are not readily apparent, nor will there be a single approach that works for all firms, much less all partners, regardless of gender. Of course, for any law firm, the only club worth perpetuating is the one where quality legal work is performed at a price that demonstrates value to the client. When that goal is kept in mind, helping lawyers of any gender flourish becomes a much more likely prospect.

Writing about all the interesting twists and turns in the recent spate of Biglaw partner gender-discrimination cases has become its own cottage industry. Not that I am complaining — anything that shines light on the closed-door partner compensation process that, coincidentally, winds up with women partners making [44 percent less](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/from-the-obvious-files-male-biglaw-partners-make-more-than-female-ones/?rf=1) than their male counterparts seems like a good thing to me.

Now comes word that the[ $100 million purported class action lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1) against Chadbourne & Parke has gotten another named plaintiff. This is especially important since shortly after Kerrie Campbell, the suit’s original sole plaintiff, filed the complaint, a slew of current and former women Chadbourne partners came out of the woodwork to [claim there was no discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/these-biglaw-partners-are-super-pissed-someone-filed-a-class-action-lawsuit-on-their-behalf/?rf=1) at their firm.

But now Jaroslawa Zelinsky Johnson, a former Chadbourne equity partner who headed up the firm’s Kiev office, is backing up Campbell’s claims. As American Lawyer [reports](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202770213905/ExChadbourne-Partner-Discusses-Decision-to-Join-Gender-Bias-Suit):

“I read [Campbell’s suit] and it brought back a flood of memories—the disparity in compensation continues,” said Johnson, noting that she does not know Campbell personally. “I’m not by nature a litigious person, but [joining this case] was an opportunity to help the next generation of women lawyers. That’s why I’m doing this.”

That is certainly lofty language, but even Johnson admits she wasn’t much of a rainmaker at the firm. We’ve seen repeatedly that getting origination credit for clients is key to a big payday. But Johnson says overall the compensation criteria were inequitably applied:

“There was definitely favoritism in how [compensation] was determined,” said Johnson, noting that she was frequently ranked as one of the top Western lawyers in Ukraine. “You had five men on the management committee making all the decisions and never explaining them. I would never get a rate uplift.”
Several female partners were also de-equitized in recent years at Chadbourne, Johnson said. The American Lawyer reported in late 2013 on a suit against Chadbourne filed by former arbitration partner Melanie Willems in London over the return of $127,000 in capital.

As with the other allegations in this suit, the firm denies the allegations:

Chadbourne claims that Johnson’s allegations are without merit and that the firm’s decision to exit Ukraine was the result of a deteriorating situation in a country where the demand for high-end legal services had shriveled, a development previously covered by The American Lawyer.

“Ms. Johnson was the equity partner in charge of our office in Kiev. Chadbourne closed its office in the Ukraine in 2014 after a number of money-losing years made worse by political turmoil and a challenging economic climate,” said a statement by a firm spokesman. “As previously stated, Chadbourne categorically denies all of the suit’s allegations against the firm, including the charges of gender discrimination.”

As the case is still in the very early stages, it’s impossible to yet discern what actually happened. But getting to look at the making of the Biglaw partner compensation sausage sure is fascinating.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Lays Off 10% Of Its Workforce, May Defer Incoming Associates
## The firm is attempting to ‘right-size’ itself in response to market conditions.

Hot on the heels of[ stealth layoffs at Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/stealth-layoffs-strike-once-again-at-worlds-wealthiest-biglaw-firm/), earlier this afternoon,[ we wondered](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/are-more-layoffs-ahead-industry-expert-says-biglaw-is-in-wait-and-see-mode/) when the next round of layoffs would occur. As it turns out, it’s happening today.

Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer is conducting a reduction in force that will affect about 10% of its workforce, including attorneys, paralegals, and other staff members across its U.S. offices. The firm has also notified its incoming associates that their start dates may be deferred. In addition, we’ve heard that the firm has reportedly cut some of its first-year associates (outside of those who failed the bar exam or had visa issues).

This is Gunderson’s [second round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/) in six months. The firm also [deferred its last round of incoming associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/gunderson-deferred-associate-start-dates/) back in the fall of 2022.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
According to a memo (available on the next page) sent by [David T. Young](https://www.gunder.com/david-t-young/), the firm’s managing partner, those affected by the layoffs will receive severance payments as well as out-placement support.

We have reached out to the firm for comment, and will provide an update here if and when we hear back.

Best of luck to those being let go from Gunderson.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Michelle Obama

I hated being a lawyer.

— Michelle Obama in her new memoir, [Becoming](https://becomingmichelleobama.com/), opens up about how miserable she was practicing law at Sidley Austin. In [an interview with Oprah Winfrey](https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a24691478/oprah-michelle-obama-becoming-interview/), she preaches about the soul-crushing nature of document review, “I was doing document production in Washington, D.C., and I was like, ‘I can’t do this for the rest of my life. I can’t sit in a room and look at documents.’ I won’t get into what that is, but it’s deadly. Deadly. Document production.” Oh, we understand, Michelle, [we understand.](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/6-types-of-document-reviews-that-every-reviewer-has-seen/)

# An Early Adopter Of The Milbank Scale Finally Comes Around To Announce Cravath Raises For Associates
## Better late than never!

Now that Cravath has announced its salary scale and umpteen firms have already matched, others that announced salary increases in the early days of the 2022 raise race are finally coming around to meet the prevailing market standard.

One of those firms is Choate Hall & Stewart, a firm that took in $274,746,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it #119 on the Am Law 200. Yesterday afternoon, the firm notified associates that they will be receiving Cravath-level salaries. If you recall, the firm [matched Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/choate-match-22/) back in mid-February.

This is what the new salary scale looks like at Choate:



Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Choate.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Big firms are experimenting with hybrid and flexible office models in the hopefully waning days of COVID. And there’s a lot of momentum behind transitioning this into a permanent 3- or 4-day workweek long term. Except there are some of you out there screwing this up for the rest of us and intentionally not getting the vaccine in an effort to stay home thereby confirming why some firms think everyone needs to be forced back to the office. We also discuss the sentencing — if you can even call it that — of the South Dakota AG who killed a man several months ago. And Joe talks about legal technology and Las Vegas for a bit.

What the hell? (h/t Roll on Friday)

Womble Bond Dickinson is working on a rebrand and that rebrand sucks.

Our friends across the pond at [Roll on Friday gathered images from the new WBD](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-womble-bond-dickinson-rebrand-hurts-peoples-eyes) and they should drop a WMD on this campaign from orbit. It’s the only way to be sure.

# Boutique Firm Announces 'Kind Of, Sort Of' Milbank Match
## First-year associates will be making $190,000, and that's what this firm wants you to know.

Remember back in 2016 when there was a mad dash to match Cravath’s $180K pay scale? Some firms were quick to jump on board the bandwagon to claim that their first-year attorneys were being paid $180,000, compression at the top of the salary grid for senior associates be damned.

[Barack Ferrazzano](https://www.bfkn.com/), a Chicago boutique firm that [did just that](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/well-at-least-first-year-associates-will-be-happy/) two years ago (but weeks after Cravath first made its move), is back in the game with what we’ll refer to as a “kind of, sort of” Milbank match. Sources report that effective July 1, the firm will be increasing every associate’s salary by $10,000. In case you’ve somehow forgotten, this is the [new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) that was announced by Milbank on June 4:

- Classes 18/17 $190,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2016 $200,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2015 $220,000 (+10,000)
- Class 2014 $250,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2013 $275,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2012 $295,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2011 $315,000 (+15,000)
- Class 2010 $330,000 (+15,000)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As a firm representative explained back in 2016, when the announcement was made that they were going to [pay first-year associates $180K](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/well-at-least-first-year-associates-will-be-happy/), management was unsure what the salary scale would be for second-year associates and above. “We don’t follow market for upper class years, but this keeps us in range,” said one of our sources. That being the case, even if all associates at Barack Ferrazzano receive a $10,000 raise, they may still be lagging behind the new Biglaw salary scale. But money is money, and who’s really complaining? Congratulations to all associates at the firm!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important salary updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Finally Joins The MoneyLaw Club, Raising Associate Salaries
## All 13 U.S. offices are getting a salary bump.

Dechert has finally announced that they are increasing associate compensation to the MoneyLaw scale, established by Cravath last week. Associates were definitely sweating this one out, worried that the firm would try to save money on their salaries. But the firm came through with the raises, and with [profits per partner of over $2.5 million](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755653273), it certainly seems like they can afford it.

The new compensation scale was announced this morning, and it is a lovely way to start off a Thursday. The raises are effective July 1 and are for all [13 of Dechert’s U.S. offices](https://www.dechert.com/locations/?qs=North-America) — yes, even Philly as a tipster wryly pointed out. And summers will also be seeing a raise.

# The Evolving Law Firm Partnership: Divergent Perspectives
## Should Biglaw firms become more like corporations, or should they return to their roots as partnerships?

What’s the best way to structure a law firm? I fall back on the lawyer’s favorite answer: “It depends.”

The optimal structure for a law firm turns on a whole host of factors, including the size of the firm, its goals, its culture, and the market segment it belongs to. But even if there’s no one-size-fits-all answer to firm structure, it’s still fun to argue over the different approaches.

That’s what five experts did this morning at the [Thomson Reuters Law Firm Leaders Forum](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/events/21st-annual-law-firm-leaders-forum-and-dinner/). The panel, “Long Day’s Journey into Night: The Evolving Law Firm Partnership & Strategic Models,” featured the following participants:

Beau Grenier, visiting New York from Birmingham, Alabama, kicked off the discussion with a folksy quip: “Saying that managing lawyers is like herding cats is an insult to cats everywhere.” Given the challenges facing the large law firm today, what is the best governing structure for a firm?

Bruce MacEwen, a longtime observer of the legal profession and author of [Growth Is Dead: Now What?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465058779/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465058779&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20) (affiliate link), said that he’s never been so worried about the legal industry — and he placed much of the blame on the partnership model. It’s a good model for maybe 10 or 15 large law firms — places like Slaughter and May, where each partner has a [cubbyhole for her napkin](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/chris-saul-interview-slaughter-and-may-purrs-like-a-porsche-but-that-doesn-t-mean-we-re-run-by-buffy-9878727.html) in the firm dining room — and bad for the rest.

Partnership “deludes equity partners into thinking they have a veto over almost everything,” MacEwen argued, even though large firms with multiple offices really need strong, top-down management. His solution: law firms should follow the lead of Wall Street investment banks, many of which have evolved into C corporations.

Steven Harper, a former Kirkland & Ellis partner as well as an author, staked out the opposite position. Echoing themes from [The Lawyer Bubble](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/an-interview-with-steven-harper-former-kirkland-partner-and-author-of-the-lawyer-bubble/), he cited the many virtues of the partnership model — teamwork, collegiality, a sense of ownership a dedication to excellence — that so many firms have sadly moved away from. While acknowledging that large law firms with thousands of lawyers across dozens of offices may need to adopt some attributes of a corporation, he argued that the partnership model still has much to recommend it.

Harper recalled wisdom that he received as a summer associate from legendary litigator [Fred Bartlit](http://www.bartlit-beck.com/lawyers-FredBartlitJr.html), back when Bartlit was a K&E partner (before he left to start Bartlit Beck). Beck explained to Harper that under Kirkland’s compensation system at the time, which had a [partner pay spread](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/the-haves-and-the-have-mores-partner-pay-spreads-at-leading-law-firms/) of around 3 or 4 to 1, Bartlit was effectively maxed out (i.e., at the top of the pay scale). “So the only way I can make more money,” he told the young Steven Harper, “is to make you a better lawyer.” That’s what true partnership is about — improving one’s individual lot by growing the pie for everyone.

Alas, that’s not how so many Biglaw firms work today. Partner pay spreads [have exploded](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/06/which-firms-have-the-biggest-gaps-between-their-highest-and-lowest-paid-partners/); at some firms, such as Dewey & LeBoeuf before its collapse, the highest-paid partner earns twenty times as much as the lowest-paid partner. That’s not a real partnership, Harper argued, but a partnership within a partnership. (Fun fact: Harper mentioned his next book will discuss the rise and fall of Dewey & LeBoeuf, a cautionary tale about what happens when a firm abandons its partnership ideals.)

Another problem with the structure of many Biglaw firms today: super-high [leverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-an-addendum-on-leverage/) (i.e., “the ratio of all lawyers (minus equity partners) to equity partners”). Decades ago, most firms had leverage in the 1.5 to 1 range; now the average is around 3.5 to 1, with some firms going as high as 8 to 1. The message this sends to the next generation of lawyers, according to Harper, is that they’re not as deserving of partnership as their forebears.

Roger Meltzer of DLA Piper offered a qualified defense of the status quo. He noted that he, unlike MacEwen and Harper, still toils in the trenches of Biglaw, and it’s a lot easier to offer criticism from the outside than to deal with problems from the inside. He pointed out the many challenges facing large law firms today, including anemic demand, a shift in leverage from firms to clients, and a dramatic rise in lateral movement (i.e., the “free agency” model of partnership). The golden age for law firms, in which demand growth concealed a whole host of weaknesses, ran from about 1985 to 2007; it has been over for almost a decade.

Meltzer still believes in the partnership model, “with tweaks.” With [more than 3,000 lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2016/2/), DLA Piper can’t function as a pure democracy. Instead, it needs strong leadership — but those leaders, Meltzer included, rule by the consent of the governed. If they lead their firms well, they will remain in power; if they stumble, they will be removed.

A major challenge for law firm leaders right now, according to Meltzer, is the sense among many lawyers that the social contract has been broken. Many partners feel that their firms won’t stand by them in tough times, and many associates feel that they don’t have a path to partnership, to say nothing of firm leadership.

For a partnership to work, Meltzer argued, partners need to feel they have “skin in the game.” This is why DLA Piper [revamped its partnership](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/11/dla-piper-changes-partnership-structure/) about eight years ago, requiring income partners to put capital into the firm. Some observers at the time viewed this as a cash grab by DLA during the downturn, but that wasn’t it at all, according to Meltzer; it reflected his belief, from his years at Cahill Gordon before joining DLA, that a single-tier partnership better aligns the interests of individual partners with the interest of the firm (as opposed to a two-tier partnership in which income partners get guaranteed salaries, regardless of firm performance).

Bruce MacEwen agreed that it’s important for lawyers to have “skin in the game,” but partnership isn’t the only way to do that. Law firms can and should structure themselves more like corporations or consulting firms like McKinsey, where employees can, over time, move up through a series of tiers (e.g., analyst, associate, vice president, managing director). This incentivizes lawyers better than the current binary system, where — here MacEwen seemed to channel Donald Trump — “you’re either an equity partner or a loser.” A more flexible organizational structure also appeals to millennials, a growing segment of the law firm workforce.

Ah, millennials. At this point in the discussion, Roger Meltzer went into curmudgeon mode: “I question whether millennials are prepared to do what I had to do.” There’s a huge amount of sacrifice that’s required in order to succeed in Biglaw, and Meltzer said he’s not convinced that millennials are prepared to make the same commitments to the practice of law and the legal profession that he and his contemporaries made back in the day.

(Meltzer sounded a bit worried before he launched into curmudgeon made — he asked if any members of the press were in the room — but I wasn’t shocked or troubled by his comments. Complaining about millennials is a favorite pastime of baby boomers, and Meltzer did so in entertaining fashion. I’ve seen him on a number of panels over the years, and he always brings a refreshing candor to bear on discussions. Also, he was looking impressively tan for a law firm leader.)

Do millennials have enough “fire in the belly” to succeed in Biglaw? Dr. Larry Richard, a psychologist as well as a lawyer, shared some research he conducted while at the Hildebrandt law firm consultancy. Back in 2007, Hildebrandt conducted a study and concluded that only 23 percent of associates would qualify in psychographical terms as willing to do whatever it takes to succeed at their firms. The number today is probably even lower, he added, because most millennials don’t want to become “lifers” in their organizations.

What can firms do to retain their millennial lawyers? According to Larry Richard, millennials (and employees in general) look for four things from their jobs:

- Autonomy: On a day-to-day basis, people want to have discretion in terms of how they perform their jobs; they don’t want to be micro-managed.
- Meaning and purpose: People want to feel that their work makes a difference, that it matters — and this is doubly true for millennials.
- Social connection: People want to build friendships in the workplace, and they want to feel included in a larger enterprise.
- Achievement, competency, and mastery: People want to feel that they are good at what they do and continuing to get better.
Bruce MacEwen agreed that law firms need to give their people, regardless of role, a sense that they are building something together. Yes, the Biglaw bucks are nice — and you need to pay your best performers what they’re worth on the market, or else they’ll leave — but while undercompensating your people can kill your firm, paying people properly isn’t enough to keep your firm alive and thriving.

Surveying the Biglaw graveyard — Dewey, Howrey, Bingham, Brobeck — MacEwen noted a common thread. At firms that have failed, at some point key people woke up and asked themselves, “What am I doing here?” The inability to come up with a good answer spelled doom for their firms.

Winter is creeping up on us, and with Hanukkah almost behind us, Christmas nearly upon us, and everyone in the legal profession ready to ring in the New Year, it’s time to reveal the eight finalists for our twelfth annual holiday card contest. But first let’s give shout-outs to some honorable mentions (click on each firm’s name to see its card):

1. [Brown & Bouchard](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2020/12/brown-bouchard-holiday-card-scaled.jpg): Pandemic-related bingo? This is actually pretty funny and completely relatable. From the nominator: “We sent these out to some colleagues as a little lighthearted holiday joke and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. One of them suggested we submit to ATL. This is our Telephonic Hearing Bingo Card holiday card. It definitely helped us laugh and blow off some steam. We have a tough area of practice and we are passionate about what we do. Sometimes, though, you just have to laugh about it a little.”

2. [Kramer Elkins & Watt](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2020/12/KEW-2020-Holiday-Card.pdf): From the nominator: “We are a small law firm in Madison, Wisconsin, with three partners, an associate, and two (soon to be three) staff members. We opened in the fall of 2015. Beginning in 2016, we have crafted creative holiday card messages designed to poke fun of legalese. Please enjoy the 2020 version.” Who doesn’t love making fun of legalese? Check it out.

And now, the eight finalists, in alphabetical order. Again, click on each firm’s name to view its card. Please note that most of these cards have SOUND, so you might want to turn your sound off or down, or use headphones. Explanatory comments come from firm representatives unless otherwise indicated.

1. [Conn Kavanaugh](https://www.connkavanaugh.com/happy-holidays-2020/): “This is our take on the 2020 viral TikTok trend,” says the nominator from this Boston-based firm. You know what they say about the law firm that drinks together… they make great holiday cards!

2. [Harness Dickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tLheV8-vQk&t=5s): IP comes alive at this firm, and they’re on a mission to help Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer adjust to a COVID Christmas. “We realize 2020 is not a typical year. We could have easily gone with a very traditional ecard with a simple ‘Happy Holidays from Harness Dickey’ message,” said Bryan Wheelock, a Principal in the firm’s St. Louis office. “Instead, we wanted to acknowledge it hasn’t been a normal year and provide a quick smile and maybe a chuckle, even if it only lasts a minute or two. We all deserve a break this year.”

3. [Lane Powell](https://vimeopro.com/lanepowell/holiday2020): This year’s holiday card from Lane Powell has that touch of humanity everyone needs after a year of being apart. From the nominator: “This card manages to toe the line between acknowledging the year’s eventfulness while also making a moment for lightness and smiles. 2020 made me tired so I want familiarity and warmth, not a flat joke from a committee of lawyers. In my mind, Lane Powell delivered here.”

4. [McBrayer](https://www.mcbrayerseasonsgreetings.com): “We started planning and scripting this card featuring the founder of our firm in the late summer, but unfortunately — heartbreakingly so — we lost him in October after an extended illness,” says the nominator. “As with all our cards, we try to put our personality into them, and this year that takes the form of a winter visit with our late founder, Terry McBrayer, as he and our Managing Member James H. Frazier, III, discuss the origins of our firm in the form of a familiar poem.” Our condolences to the firm, and may this card serve as a lasting memory.

5. [Morse](https://readymag.com/MBBP/2020Holiday/): We truly enjoyed this card because it was such a creative idea. This firm decided to highlight their client’s creations during the pandemic, and it really came out wonderfully. “A representative from the firm says, “We presented all employees with a challenge: nominate a client that is either giving back to their community, is a small business that offers a service or product that might make a good holiday gift (and could use a boost during these times), or has pivoted their business to provide pandemic support in some way. The response was awesome! We had room to feature 20 clients on our e-card but we just couldn’t leave anyone out, so we added an ‘honorable mention’ list at the bottom too! From combatting loneliness in the elderly and virtual tutoring, to ‘bookends for wine’ and a manicure featured on Time’s 100 Best Inventions of 2020 list, our clients are truly doing amazing things. And they absolutely deserve the spotlight this year.”

6. [Rumberger Kirk](http://ecards.brandoraecards.com/ecard/5fb617fca0664): This is a sweet holiday card that really captures the feeling of the season. “Our animations take at minimum 2 weeks to produce and this one was just over that time frame. The mask cloth simulation was quite challenging but I think we pulled it off,” says the nominator. “Attention to detail and a unique story is what makes this really stand out from the other holiday ecards. For example, the magazine on the desk is 22 pages (front and back) of Rumberger branded law content, even though you can’t really read or see much of it.”

7. [Wolf Greenfield](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/happy-holidays-from-wolf-greenfield-2020): This card comes from a two-time winner of our holiday contest, and of course the perrenial finalist made the finals once again. “We broke away from the stop motion style that led to us winning the 2017 and 2018 ATL Holiday Card Contests and placing second in 2019, and leapt into the magical and immersive world of animation,” says a representative from the firm. “We didn’t abandon our old holiday card stars altogether though! If you look closely, you’ll see nods to Wolf Greenfield cards of the past with the gingerbread cookie from 2019, the snowman from 2018, and the robot from 2017.”

8. [Venable](https://www.venable.com/happy-holidays-2020): This card reminded me of what life has been like working from home for almost a year (with kids yelling the background and competing for attention during calls). “Since our founding, Venable has supported the economic and social vitality of the communities in which we work and live,” says the nominator. “By helping individuals and organizations meaningfully connect with opportunities, resources, and each other, we ensure that our firm’s impact reaches far beyond our day-to-day business operations.”

Now it’s time for our audience to vote. We’ll keep the polls open through SUNDAY, DECEMBER 27, 2020, at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time). This gives you ample time to campaign for your pick over the holidays (but please, please, please don’t cheat).

Michael S. Caccese and James R. Segerdahl of K&L Gates (K&L Gates via Law.com)

That was fast. Just two weeks after we learned that Peter Kalis would [not run for re-election](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/peter-kalis-wont-run-for-re-election-as-chair-of-kl-gates/) as head of K&L Gates, the firm he has helmed since 1997, the firm has announced its new leaders — plural. From the K&L Gates [press release](http://www.klgates.com/kl-gates-announces-new-firm-leaders-effective-march-2017-09-19-2016/):

Global law firm K&L Gates LLP has selected Michael S. Caccese and James R. Segerdahl to succeed Peter J. Kalis in the positions of Chairman of the Management Committee and Global Managing Partner, respectively. Caccese and Segerdahl will assume their responsibilities on March 1, 2017, upon the conclusion of Kalis’ term in February, and will work with Kalis to ensure a smooth transition in leadership during the coming months.

The selection of Caccese and Segerdahl doesn’t come as a huge surprise. Both are close to Kalis, and both were [on the shortlist](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/kl-gates-after-peter-kaliss-reign/?rf=1) of Kalis successors (along with Michael Zanic, a longtime management committee member). Caccese currently serves as vice chairman for practice management and leads the financial services practice area, which includes the firm’s successful investment funds practice. Segerdahl, who right now holds three titles — vice chairman, general counsel, and secretary to the management committee — was a co-founder of the firm’s insurance coverage practice.

Like Kalis’s recent re-elections,[[1]](#f1) the selection of Caccese and Segerdahl was unanimous:

After a two-month deliberative process commencing in early July, K&L Gates’ 75-partner global Management Committee unanimously recommended Caccese and Segerdahl during a period of partner consultation. With a positive response from partners in the firm’s offices on five continents, the Management Committee then finalized the appointments through a unanimous vote.

Note the reference to a two-month process. Even though the outside world has known about Kalis’s departure for just two weeks, succession planning has been taking place internally for quite some time.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And note the divvying up of Kalis’s two titles, with Caccese becoming chairman of the management committee and Segerdahl taking over as global managing partner — a sign that, as Julie Triedman [puts it](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/19/kl-gates-picks-leadership-pair-to-take-reins-from-kalis/), “Kalis’s role had grown too large for one person to fill.” In terms of the difference between the two positions, Triedman explains that Segerdahl’s role as CEO and global managing partner is more inward-facing and management-oriented (a logical fit for Segerdahl given his service as the firm’s GC).

Congratulations to Michael Caccese and James Segerdahl on their new roles, which they will assume in March. K&L Gates faces a number of challenges — as do all major law firms — but these two seem well-equipped to tackle them.

[ [1]](#reff1) Critics of Kalis used to complain that this unanimity was like that of the [Politburo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union). But it’s worth noting that several anti-Kalis partners were part of the wave of partner defections that we’ve covered previously (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/why-are-so-many-partners-walking-out-the-kl-gates/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/the-latest-departures-through-the-kl-gates/), and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/more-departures-from-the-kl-gates-do-they-matter/)). It’s possible that Caccese and Segerdahl could benefit from the departures of these dissenters, at least in terms of exerting their will over the firm.

Let me start by admitting my bias:
I don’t often feel Jewish.

My father escaped from Vienna at age 15, about six months after the [Anschluss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss).  His sister, parents, and one aunt escaped with him. Everyone else on that side of the family was exterminated; I have only my mother’s side of the family.

Some people in my father’s situation became more religious; some became less religious. My father fell into the latter category: He had seen what religion could do, and he had no use for it. So, although I was technically Jewish, I was raised without any religious upbringing.

I thus rarely feel Jewish. I feel Jewish only on the days when I’m seeing that people who slaughter Jews would like to slaughter me, too. I’m predisposed to dislike people who want to kill me.

I felt Jewish on the day I visited Auschwitz.

Our guide said that we were standing in the world’s largest cemetery. The ashes of a million Jews burned in the crematoria had settled onto the ground on which we were walking.

I also felt Jewish last Saturday, October 7, 2023, a day that will live in infamy.

That’s my bias.

But I’m also a lawyer. So the question naturally is this: What hypothetical question will permit me to think clearly about the events of last Saturday?

When I started thinking about this, I thought about other surprising events that killed many people:  How did the United States react after Pearl Harbor? (If you missed [this spoof](https://babylonbee.com/news/emperor-hirohito-calls-for-ceasefire-after-bombing-of-pearl-harbor) at the Babylon Bee, look now.) How did the United States react after 9/11? Did anyone call for restraint after those mass murders? Or did an overwhelming majority of Americans think that declaring war on Japan and invading Afghanistan were appropriate reactions?

But those questions might not properly frame the issue.

Many people say that the Palestinians have been brutalized for decades and that the pent-up rage caused by the mistreatment must be taken into account. Let’s assume this is true.

This forces me to change my hypothetical question. I have to think about someone who has been treated terribly unfairly for many years and then committed an atrocity in response to that brutality.

How about this one?

A witness lies on the witness stand, causing a person to be wrongfully imprisoned for 20 years. (Is that a fair analogy to the Gaza Strip? Folks call Gaza an “[open-air prison](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/11/what-is-gaza-strip-the-besieged-palestinian-enclave-under-israeli-assault).”) The wrongful imprisonment is finally corrected, and the prisoner is released. A month later, he murders the accuser who had lied on the witness stand two decades earlier.

I bet a prosecutor still brings charges, and a jury convicts, on those facts, although perhaps the judge shows a little bit of leniency in sentencing. No?

This hypothetical, however, doesn’t fairly capture the events of October 7.

Suppose instead that my wrongfully imprisoned guy is released and then looks up where the daughter and grandchild of his false accuser live. My hypothetical prisoner goes to that house, rapes and murders the daughter, beheads the grandchild, and then finds the accuser and shoots him dead.

Is there any doubt about how the criminal justice system would treat that person?

If anyone thinks my hypothetical question is wrong, I’m all ears.

And I certainly don’t think Israel should now engage in war crimes in retaliation for Hamas’ war crimes.

Whether or not Israel’s response is appropriate, however, can anyone really suggest in good faith that Hamas’ conduct on October 7 was permissible?

Or am I thinking too much like a Jew, or too much like a lawyer?

(People who simply want to kill me need not respond.)

What is the culture like at your Biglaw firm? Does everyone seem happy, or are they just pretending and putting on brave faces because they’re being worked to the bone? Do you genuinely like your colleagues and work well with them, or do people feign niceties and communicate with snide remarks, or worse yet, yelling? Thanks to the [BTI Consulting Group](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/10-1-of-attorneys-report-toxic-culture-how-many-are-great), we now know what the culture is like across the Biglaw legal community — and at some firms, it is not good.

BTI recently conducted its workplace and attorney satisfaction survey, and after evaluating results from more than 1,000 respondents, the company found four cultures that are prevalent across Biglaw firms. Do any of these cultures sound familiar to you?

The Toxic Workplace
Trust is scarce. Attorneys keep their distance. Partners work together only if they have to — the same goes for associates — they don’t trust each other to help with work or share stresses and experiences. Partners resent firm interference with their clients. Fortunately, only 10.1% of firms receive this distinction from their attorneys.

The Well-Oiled Machine
At the other end of the spectrum — 12.1% excel with seamless collaboration and information sharing. Partners are in synch — so associates feel in synch.

You find ongoing information sharing about client, legal, and workplace issues — all serving to build attorney knowledge bases they can use in client work and business development. Attorneys offer up thoughts and ideas routinely — it’s part of the DNA.

The Machine
The largest group at 47.5% leans towards working together — but often needs a catalyst to make it happen. These catalysts include transactional work, large litigation, a partner seeking another out, pitches, and large client defections.

This group of firms has the building blocks to become a well-oiled machine.

The Siloed
30.3% report uneven cooperation. There is little in the way of active sharing between practice groups. Some attorneys in this cohort report being envious of the groups with more sharing than their own.

The majority of attorneys are working at firms best described as “machines,” while just over 12% of lawyers are working at “well-oiled machines.” Thankfully, only about 10% of attorneys find themselves working in truly toxic environments.

Which of these cultures describes your law firm?

# One Of World's Best Law Firms Pays Back Half Of COVID Comp Cuts, Keeps Full Cuts Going Forward
## This is likely the first Biglaw firm to do such a thing.

Another day, another Biglaw firm taking steps to walk back some of the austerity measures it put into place thanks to the havoc wreaked by the novel coronavirus upon the world’s financial markets. This time, the firm in question is introducing an interesting little twist into the equation.

Back in May, the U.S. branch of Eversheds Sutherland — an international firm that was declared the 10th best legal practice in the world in Law360’s most recent [Global 20](https://www.law360.com/articles/1181369/law360-reveals-the-global-20-firms-of-2019) rankings — slashed salaries across the firm and furloughed employees. Both lawyers and staff faced a 10 percent pay cut on average (including bonuses), and about 40 staff were furloughed.

Now, instead of doing what most firms are doing and reducing or ending its pay cuts completely, Eversheds is partially paying its employees back and keeping the 10 percent salary cuts in place going forward.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Per an email from Eversheds Sutherland’s U.S. CEO Mark Wasserman, the firm will be [retroactively paying back half](https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2020/09/08/eversheds-sutherland-partially-pays-back-cut-comp-but-pay-cuts-will-remain/) of the salary cuts lawyers and staff sustained from May through August. Employees at the firm may be able to see more of their expected pay returned at the end of 2020. “With all of the uncertainty remaining for the pandemic and the economy, we will keep our compensation reductions in place going forward and reassess further restorations at the end of the year,” Wasserman said.

Here’s hoping that lawyers and staff at the firm get their salaries restored — sooner, rather than later, and in full.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Alex Jones Stomps Out Of Bankruptcy After Failing To Scare Off Sandy Hook Plaintiffs

Alex Jones’s companies are exiting bankruptcy exactly the way they entered it: with maximum histrionics and accusations of bad faith.

In April, Jones, a professional shitposter, placed three LLCs associated with his Infowars company [in bankruptcy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/alex-jones-pays-himself-18m-declares-bankruptcy-offers-sandy-hook-plaintiffs-change-he-found-in-couch-at-infowars-studio/). The companies were named defendants in tort suits brought by survivors of the Sandy Hook shooting who’d suffered years of harassment after Jones called them “crisis actors” and accused them of lying about their dead children.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Jones spent years flouting discovery orders, going so far as to earn himself [“death penalty” sanctions](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/alex-jones-gets-death-penalty-sanctions-again/) in Connecticut and Texas, leaving only the issue of damages to be assessed by a jury. He did everything he could to get out of answering for his conduct in court, even going so far as to tell a judge that he was too ill to be deposed at the very moment he was [in-studio broadcasting his show](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/alex-joness-lawyers-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day/), eventually netting himself a contempt finding. On the eve of his trial in Texas, Jones raced into the bankruptcy court, declared three companies with no substantial business or assets “bankrupt,” and successfully halted both Sandy Hook cases in their tracks.

If it wasn’t clear from his prior bad conduct that Jones was simply using the bankruptcy court to evade trials in Connecticut and Texas — without having to put his personal assets and those of his main company Free Speech Systems at risk — his filings made no bones about it. Jones’s lawyers [set up](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsb.455827/gov.uscourts.txsb.455827.7.0_1.pdf) a Litigation Settlement Trust to “provide a mechanism for the payment in full of the litigation claims,” promising to fund it with $10 million cash from Jones, provided that the Sandy Hook plaintiffs accepted the money as payment in full and dropped their claims against FSS and him personally.

And in case there was any remaining ambiguity, Jones’s lawyer Norm Pattis flapped his yap to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/infowars-bankruptcy-delays-upcoming-sandy-hook-trial-11650494400), bragging that, “We’re turning to the bankruptcy courts to compel the plaintiffs to estimate the value of their claims in open court by discernible evidentiary standards. The plaintiffs have turned this litigation into a macabre morality play and have refused to negotiate in good faith. We hope they will show respect to the federal courts.”

At which point, all hell broke loose. The US Trustee filed a [furious motion](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsb.455827/gov.uscourts.txsb.455827.18.0.pdf) accusing Jones of acting in bad faith, the Sandy Hook plaintiffs dropped the worthless LLCs as defendants in their state suits, and they all descended on US Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez’s courtroom to yell about it.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
At the hearing, Jones’s bankruptcy lawyer Kyung Shik Lee proved that he’s no more susceptible to shame than his client, [excoriating](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/alex-joness-bankruptcy-lawyer-indignant-that-sandy-hook-plaintiffs-arent-grateful-he-spared-them-their-day-in-court/) the Sandy Hook plaintiffs for their ingratitude that he was finally putting some money on the table, and all he’d heard was complaints. For comparison, FSS made $56 million in 2021 alone, and Jones was attempting to fob off the plaintiffs with an amount that wouldn’t even cover their accrued legal fees. Nevertheless, Lee huffed that there were “limited funds and we’re trying to maximize it so it goes to the plaintiffs.”

And after all that drama, the gambit didn’t even work. Once the LLCs were dismissed as defendants in the state suits, the tort cases were remanded back to Texas and Connecticut for trial. Which left the more-or-less worthless LLCs in a bankruptcy with virtually no creditors and only a super pissed-off US Trustee.

Which brings us to yesterday, where the LLCs made a [great show](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txsb.455827/gov.uscourts.txsb.455827.112.0.pdf) of withdrawing from bankruptcy with the greatest reluctance in the world, protesting loudly about the scurrilous, untrue, not to say hurtful allegations that they had acted in anything less than good faith. The best faith! And they weren’t tapping out because the jig was up — they were being forced out virtually at gunpoint by the mean old Trustee.

“The Debtors’ former link to Alex Jones is too great a sin in the U.S. Trustee’s eyes for the Debtors to overcome,” the motion practically hyperventilates, adding later that “apparently the U.S. Trustee does not believe that paying creditors more than they would receive in a liquidation is a valid reorganizational purpose.”

The Sandy Hook plaintiffs are similarly to blame because they “decided that a jury verdict against Alex Jones and FSS was more important to them than maximizing their recovery.” Bookmark that one and see whether the jury awards them more than the piddling $10 million on offer here.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The motion also makes some truly strange assertions, such as that the LLCs were “not contemplating any third-party releases” and “did not intend to deprive the plaintiffs of their jury trial rights.” Which is an odd way to describe a proposed Litigation Settlement Trust that was premised on the plaintiffs releasing Jones and FSS from all claims and not going to trial.

Indeed the motion concedes at multiple points that the primary purpose of the bankruptcy was to resolve the tort litigation: “Perhaps the U.S. Trustee believes that Jones should have been willing to contribute $7.7+ million for nothing, but that is not the way the world works outside of government,” his lawyers snark.

And so this entire sordid exercise is coming to an end, albeit after an extended display of weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.

“Nonetheless, the Debtors, under the management of their independent [restructuring officer], recognize that the dismissal is in the best interests of the Debtors and their estates because the U.S. Trustee continued opposition to the cases,” they sigh.

Yeah, yeah, tell it to the jury.

# Biglaw Firm Drops Sponsorship After Golfer Joins LIV Tour

In the world of law firm marketing, is there a lot of ROI in golf sponsorships? Other than Nike’s relationship with Tiger Woods, I’m not sure I could correctly match any golfer with their sponsor. That seems like a problem with this advertising strategy.

Anyway, Cozen O’Connor used to sponsor professional golfer Jason Kokrak, but that’s [come to an end](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/07/21/cozen-cuts-ties-with-pro-golfer-who-joined-saudi-funded-liv-tour/) after he took his talents to Saudi-funded sportswashing outfit LIV Golf.

The firm cited its 9/11 litigation efforts, which pit it against the Saudi government, for the decision. Though it seems like “we want no part of the journalist murdering business” played a role in the move as well.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
From the American Lawyer:

Cozen executive chairman and CEO Michael Heller, speaking to [Law.com](http://law.com/) on Thursday, said the firm’s ongoing litigation against the country was a factor in the firm’s decision. “The LIV tour is inconsistent with the mission and values of our firm,” he said in a brief interview. “Jason is a terrific young man and we wish him and his family well.”

The firm says that it’s looking to get back into the PGA or LPGA tours.

# What Is Your Firm Doing On Christmas Eve?
## Sheppard Mullin is giving the staff a holiday -- everyone else is doing this too, right?

Last week, we pointed out that Sheppard Mullin is — [in our view, correctly](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/biglaw-firm-lets-bob-cratchit-take-christmas-eve-off/) — giving its staff Christmas Eve off. There’s no real work being done that requires staff to work that day and forcing them to either come in and twiddle their thumbs for eight hours or burn a vacation day, a precious commodity for staff that attorneys take for granted, is a waste and fundamentally disrespectful of the staff’s time.

That said, last week’s article also objected to the idea that this positive move should be lauded. Reaching the bare minimum is nice in an industry that rarely manages to make it there, but let’s not set the bar too low. For all the performative old man takes out there about participation trophies, there’s no confusion over what those trinkets reward. The real scourge is giving out meaningful trophies for vague accomplishments that amount to the bare minimum of effort.

And, in case you haven’t looked ahead on your calendar yet, Christmas Eve is a Monday this year. That means firms that don’t adopt this policy this year are asking staff to come into the office for one day before a recognized holiday. As bad as it may be to have the staff come in on the 24th generally, the calendar makes the most compelling case imaginable for offering a paid day off this year.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But this whole thing got me thinking: how many firms out there give Christmas Eve as a paid holiday for the staff? Attorneys are a whole other question, but how many firms are asking secretaries and paralegals and clerks to come all the way into the office on Christmas Eve? Is Sheppard Mullin’s move truly unique or are other firms already on board?

Here’s a quick poll, but given the nuances of a policy like this — for example, if this is a long-standing policy or just a quick fix given the calendar this year — you can hit me up directly to explain what’s going on. Send your intel (they will be kept anonymous, don’t worry) about what your firms are doing on December 24th to joe@abovethelaw.com.

What Is Your Christmas Eve Staff Policy?

- Full holiday for everyone
- Holiday for non-attorneys
- Mostly a holiday -- we maintain a skeleton crew of staff
- Bah humbug.

# How To Stop Outside Counsel From Mishandling Enforcement Matters
## One way to guarantee that outside lawyers aren't secretly antagonizing regulatory agencies or otherwise mishandling the investigation.

Pick an agency, any agency.

Let’s say you picked the Securities and Exchange Commission.

You receive a subpoena from the SEC.  You hire Bigg & Mediocre to handle the matter for you.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The SEC requested the production of documents on May 15, three weeks after the day the subpoena was issued.  So Bigg & Mediocre waits until May 14 to pick up the phone, introduce itself as outside counsel, ask the SEC to explain each request in detail, and ask for an extension of time to respond.

Sound familiar?

Of course.  It’s the usual way firms operate.

But your firm has already annoyed the SEC, because the firm is demonstrating that it didn’t even start gathering documents until the date the documents were due.  (If Bigg & Mediocre didn’t understand the requests on May 14, it sure wasn’t doing any work before then.)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Instead, how about picking up the phone immediately — say, on May 1 — introducing yourself, and asking the SEC to explain each category of documents?  You’re then at least bluffing that you’re actually starting to collect documents before the due date.  You can then call again, on May 14, to ask for more time to respond, which would still get you the extension, but not let the SEC know how irresponsible you are.

When Bigg & Mediocre finally responds to the document requests, it retypes request number 5:  “All documents concerning or reflecting BigCo’s decision to keep elephants in the lobby.”  Bigg & Mediocre types its response:  “The enclosed DVD contains all significant documents concerning or reflecting BigCo’s decision to keep elephants in the lobby.”

The SEC will properly scratch its head:  Are you producing all documents?  Or are you producing all “significant” documents?  If “significant,” then what gives you the right to do that?  And please don’t tell the SEC that you’re just helping the SEC to save time; the SEC will think that you’re probably hiding something.

Bigg & Mediocre of course produces some documents, but — like certain lawyers for political players who will go unnamed — screws up the redactions.  For example, Bigg & Mediocre redacted the privileged parts of documents in the TIFF images, but forgot to redact those portions in the accompanying metadata text files.  The SEC is thus both reading privileged communications — “In the future, we should try to avoid breaking the law!” — and thinking that Bigg & Mediocre has lived up to its name.

The SEC decides to interview BigCo’s general counsel about matters relevant to the investigation.  When the SEC has the general counsel, along with outside counsel, on the phone, the SEC says that it has no intention of asking the general counsel about the inadvertently produced documents.  The GC is shocked:  “WHAT inadvertently produced documents?”  The B&M partner explains meekly:  “Well, uh, we didn’t want to bother you with minor details . . . .”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What do I suggest?

From the corporation’s point of view:  Insist that outside counsel send to the in-house lawyer responsible for the investigation a copy of every piece of correspondence to or from the SEC.  Indeed, the in-house lawyer should consider introducing himself to the SEC staff as another lawyer representing the company and inviting the SEC to call the inside lawyer, as well as outside counsel, as needed throughout the investigation.  That would guarantee that the outside lawyer isn’t secretly antagonizing the SEC or otherwise mishandling the investigation.

From outside counsel’s point of view:  Don’t be a stereotypical jerk.  Be conscientious.  If you make a mistake, disclose it to your client.  Don’t antagonize the SEC staff; don’t withhold responsive documents; don’t mislead the SEC staff; don’t fail to return phone calls; don’t explore whether you could represent multiple parties in ways that obviously create conflicts of interest.  I understand that all of these things are tempting — because no one taught you how to be a lawyer — but they’re not the way you gain an agency’s trust.

Yes, yes:  All of this is obvious to good lawyers.  But why do I keep hearing about this stuff from people on the staff of regulatory agencies?  Or does that question answer itself?

[They] can pretty much go wherever they want on whatever terms they want. I have not seen a [signing] bonus lower than $15,000 and I have seen as high as $75,000. In some cases, people are asking for specific bonuses. For example, the amount that would extinguish their student loan debt.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kate-reder-sheikh/), a San Francisco-based recruiter for Major Lindsey & Africa, commenting on perks that corporate, capital markets, and M&A associates have been able to [ask for and receive during their lateral searches](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-laws-associate-appetite-means-new-perils-for-regional-firms). Sheikh also said she’s seen Biglaw firms offer higher base salaries outside of the regular class-year lockstep formula for some associate job candidates.

# Top Takeaways From LMA 24: Small-Firm Troubleshooting, Finding Success With Client Teams
## Insights from the Legal Marketing Association’s annual conference.

While many of the education sessions at the LMA’s annual conference centered on technology — AI, Google Analytics and more — two key panels took a more analog approach, focusing on problem-solving and client service. 

There’s a key reason for it: Without systems for diagnosing firm issues or cultivating client relationships, marketing technology solutions are just tactics in search of strategy. To go “all in,” as the conference theme emphasized, legal marketers must nail the fundamentals.

Here are select takeaways for law firm marketers from the panels I attended.

Learn to Speak Non-Marketer

During the session titled “Navigating the Marketing Maze: An Open Exchange Program for Small to Midsize Firms,” presenters guided the audience through some pitfalls of small-firm marketing.  

The panel facilitated some group work (and a little group therapy), as attendees broke into small groups to share their struggles and success stories, before reconvening to report back. 

One breakout group noted that lawyers do not often speak marketing jargon; they are unlikely to value metrics like “engagement” or “click-through rate.”

Instead, marketers should speak with attention-getting language and metaphors that help to put the tactics into context. 

One small-firm marketer said she launched an internal campaign at the firm to “feed the beast” of content creation; her lawyers now regularly cite the motto back to her when they submit blog posts and social media ideas.

Set Up Clear Metrics

Consistency counts — especially when metrics are being tracked by different humans, different practice areas, potentially different offices. 

Kate Schenkel of Pond Lehocky Giordano LLP  shared that she struggled to generate a report of matters directly tied to marketing efforts.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The number felt low, but it wasn’t until she investigated the data entry itself that she found the issue: At the intake stage, one team was using a different tracking field than the rest of the firm. 

“Because I didn’t have standard set metrics across the firm, we weren’t looking at accurate clean data,” she said. “Set up clear metrics across the firm, what every department will use. That solved the issue.”

Drum Up the Data

Moderator Wayne Pollock of Copo Strategies and the Law Firm Editorial Service encouraged small and midsize firms not to be daunted by the concept of “competitive intelligence.” 

Instead, he said, they should look for straightforward and objective data that could inform marketing decisions (and prove or disprove lawyer assumptions). 

For example, he said, if the firm has seen a drop in work for a particular type of suit, resist the urge to conclude, “We’re not getting the cases.” 

That need not be Big Data; courtroom records can show what’s happening. 

“Are you not getting cases because your competitors are getting them, or is the volume down?” he said. “Did the law change? It may not be marketing’s fault. What’s going on?”

Learn From the Restaurateurs  

A more Biglaw-focused panel, “From Key Account Management to Client Teams — Insights for Stronger Client Relationships,” was all about deepening relationships with key clients.  

The panel focused on practical tips for creating and deploying client teams — groups of lawyers and other professionals, sometimes across practice areas, focused on one major client.  

One general theme that emerged: begin with small victories. 

While there are complicated account planning templates in the marketing ecosystem, start your client teams out with straightforward plans. 

“Let’s track some goals and action items, and measure what matters,” said Kelly Harbour, chief business development officer at Goulston & Storrs PC. She emphasized that “what matters” will vary from client to client. 

For example, one of her firm’s clients was a real estate company that only operated in one major city. While the firm tracked matters that originated from various offices for other client teams, it made no sense for this one.

Some other helpful guidance comes from the food service industry. 

Just as restaurants do “soft openings,” if your law firm does not yet have client teams in place, start slowly and quietly with a few test cases. 

“If it fails, it should be like the tree falling in the forest that no one hears,” Harbour said. “Then pivot and reboot.”

Raise the Army of the Willing

Similarly, it’s essential to choose relationship partners who are friendly to the concept when building and deploying a client team. 

“Even if it goes well, you may have to climb some difficult mountains,” Harbour said. “For the first foray, swim with the current, choose an anthill, and save the mountains for later.” 

Look for partners who already collaborate with other practice areas or offices – the lawyers who already show the behavior needed for successful client teams.

Client teams will only be successful in law firms with cultures that support them, noted Linda Sanders, the director of client experience at Troutman Pepper. 

Compensation structures are one key element; client teams work best when relationship partners share credit with team members. 

Put Your Focus Squarely on the Client

While client teams are a law firm initiative, marketers should remember that a key account program should not be done to the client, but with the client. 

Mark Young of Vox Actio, the session’s moderator, emphasized the theme of “collaborative planning”: “Let them have a voice and feel some ownership.”

The clients identified as “key accounts” should also be those that advance the firm’s strategic plan. 

Give oxygen to the clients that complement the firm’s priorities, whether that’s market share in a given industry, expansion into a new region, or so forth. 

Once a team is established, it’s important to anticipate challenges — succession planning chief among them. 

Goulston & Storrs’ Harbour said she likes to prompt the teams with questions like: “What happens if the general counsel wins the lottery? What does our relationship look like?”

Client teams should also focus on client pain points. 

Young, the session moderator, shared five trending areas of insights from his recent client feedback interviews. Consider what your firm can do to improve on:

- Knowing the business, including the culture.
- Defining (and tracking!) value.
- Getting ahead of succession planning.
- Using legal technology effectively.
- Listening well.
Bonus Takeaway: A Draft Agenda

So you have a team up-and-running. What now? 

Sanders shared a typical meeting agenda.

This includes:

- Recent interactions with the client.
- Personnel changes at the client; are there opportunities to help during departures or leaves?
- Meaningful touch points on the radar (example: inviting clients to partner retreat).
- Significant matter updates.
- Analysis of engagement; who from the client is reading and interacting with firm marketing? 
- Potential introductions.

# Separating Men From Women Isn't The Solution For Sexual Harassment In The Legal Profession

The obligation should not be on women to avoid harassment, but on the profession and individual workplaces to stamp out these forms of misconduct. For example, organisers of work social events need to take additional steps to prevent harassment in those contexts, including by reminding attendees of the expected standards of behaviour.

— Kieran Pender, a member of the International Bar Association’s (IBA) research team, explaining why women in the legal profession must [continue to socialize with their male colleagues in an effort to stop the normalization of sexual harassment](https://www.law.com/2019/05/17/outside-the-office-they-want-inside-your-pants/) and do away with the practice for good. According to the IBA’s recent survey on sexual harassment in the legal sector, [36.6 percent of women say they’ve been victims](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-look-at-the-staggering-sexual-harassment-numbers-in-the-legal-profession/), with harassment being most prevalent for women in the 25 to 29 age group (19.4 percent), followed by the 30-34 age group (16.1 percent).

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

Last week, Vault released the [2021 edition](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2021/) of its closely watched law firm rankings, proving that money — in the form of Cravath’s perennially competitive pay scale — can buy prestige.

But can that money buy happiness?

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to their overall quality of life, including satisfaction; firm culture; hours; compensation; quality of work; business outlook; career outlook; associate/partner relations; transparency; formal and informal training; pro bono; and overall diversity. Fifty firms were ranked for Vault’s 2021 Best Law Firms to Work For survey (up from 25 in its 2019 ranking). Once again, and this may be surprising for some, but almost none of the firms that made the Top 10 list for being the most prestigious made the Top 10 list for being the best firms to work for.

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms to Work For](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-to-work-for) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2021:

- [O’Melveny & Myers](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/omelveny-myers-llp) (no change)
- [Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe-llp) (+2)
- [Ropes & Gray](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/ropes-gray-llp) (+3)
- [Clifford Chance US](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/clifford-chance-us-llp) (-1)
- [Eversheds Sutherland](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/eversheds-sutherland-us-llp) (+10)
- [Paul Hastings](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/paul-hastings-llp) (+1)
- [Latham & Watkins](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/latham-watkins-llp) (-5)
- [Gibson Dunn & Crutcher](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/gibson-dunn-crutcher-llp) (+16)
- [Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/patterson-belknap-webb-tyler-llp) (not ranked; first time in Top 10)
- [Willkie Farr & Gallagher](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/willkie-farr-gallagher-llp) (+4)
Latham and Gibson Dunn are the only law firms that made it into the Top 10 on both of Vault’s rankings. Kudos on keeping your associates so happy.

It’s also worth noting that O’Melveny made history again, as the first firm to ever earn the No. 1 spot in the overall ranking for each major category (Overall Best Law Firm to Work For, Overall Diversity, and Overall Best Summer Associate Program) for two years in a row. That said, here are the No. 1 firms in each Quality of Life category:

# Law Firms Should Not Grant Mercy Interviews
## The horrible feeling of not getting a job far surpasses any benefit of securing an interview.

When most people are invited to interview at a law firm, they believe that they will be seriously considered for employment at a shop. Job candidates usually need to make significant preparations to interview at a firm, and may need to take time off from work, research a firm, and take other steps to prepare for an interview. Even though the vast majority of interviews are scheduled to determine if someone would be a good fit for a firm, law firms sometimes extend interview invitations even if candidates have a low chance of being hired. For a variety of reasons, law firms should refrain from extending so called “mercy interviews” to job candidates and should only invite people to interview at a shop if there is a real chance of the candidate being hired.

As mentioned in previous articles, there are a variety of reasons why a law firm will interview job candidates even if there is little chance a candidate will be hired. For instance, sometimes clients try to exert influence over a firm by asking that a connection be interviewed by a shop. In certain instances, such connected candidates may be hired, especially for summer jobs or positions that are not too consequential at firms.

If a firm is unable to hire connected candidates, they may extend an interview to the candidate to show that the firm is supposedly taking a candidate seriously, and to show a client that the firm is taking action based on a client’s request. When I was working in Biglaw, I am pretty sure I participated in a mercy interview after a client asked that a connected job candidate be interviewed, and the firm acceded to this request even though we dd not have any open positions. Sometimes, law firms will interview job candidates to show attorneys at other firms that they are taking their recommendations to interview a job candidate seriously. Indeed, I am pretty sure I was once interviewed even though I had little chance at being hired so that a firm could show to a partner at another shop that their input was valuable.

There are a variety of reasons why law firms sometimes justify such mercy interviews that do not have a real expectation of leading to a job offer. Some partners may say that all interviews are important since they allow job candidates to hone their interviewing skills. Indeed, it is true that interviewing well is an acquired skill and more interviews can lead to more success at interviewing. However, job candidates can practice interviewing rather than participating in an interview that they believe may be real.

Some might also say that interviewing for a job, even if there is not a bona fide chance that a job candidate will be hired, can help boost a job candidate’s morale. To a certain extent, this is true. As someone who has interviewed for work at various parts of my career, it felt good just to get an interview sometimes, even if there was little prospect to securing a job. In addition, people can sometimes use the fact that they got an interview to make it look like they are a hot commodity to other employers.

However, the horrible feeling of not getting a job far surpasses any benefit of securing an interview. Indeed, after I interviewed for a job that would be difficult to get and heard that I did not get the position, the negative feelings I experienced definitely made me take a few steps back in my job search. Even if law firms think they are doing a good deed by offering a mercy interview, they could actually be hurting a job seeker’s prospects, especially when such interviews might take attention away from more serious interviews.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It should be noted that none of the above analysis applies to so-called informational interviews, which are getting pretty common in the legal industry. From my experience, informational interviews are when a job candidate meets with a partner at a law firm and has a conversation about the law firm, the partner’s career, and the candidate’s aspirations. The job candidates get to ask the partner questions about the firm and the practice of law, and the partner gets to ask the candidate questions of the candidate so that if there is ever an open position, the candidate might be considered for the role. Since everyone goes into the informational interview process open about how there is no job on the table, and expectations are aligned, such interviews can be a solid way to learn about a firm and a job candidate.

All told, law firms may sometimes grant mercy interviews to job candidates, either because of office politics or compassion for the job candidate. However, outside of the informational interview context, it is usually best to refrain from offering mercy interviews.

William D. Zabel (via Schulte Roth & Zabel)

When we last checked in with [William Zabel](https://www.srz.com/lawyers/william-d-zabel.html), founding and name partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel, the [“bow-tied superlawyer”](https://therealdeal.com/2019/01/21/madoff-settlement-lawyer-lists-longtime-ues-co-op/) had just put his Park Avenue pad on the market for [$4.2 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/lawyerly-lairs-biglaw-name-partner-lists-longtime-home-for-4-million/).

Why was he selling his longtime family home? Because he had traded up — to a $7.9 million co-op, also on the Upper East Side.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The new building of Bill and Deborah Zabel, 10 Gracie Square, has a distinguished pedigree — even more distinguished than that of their former home, 850 Park Avenue.

A 1985 article by Tom Wolfe for Esquire listed 42 residential buildings as [“Good Buildings,”](http://www.frontporchllc.com/2008/09/what-are-new-yorks-good-buildings/) the most desirable and exclusive addresses. Ten Gracie Square made the list, while 850 Park did not. And yes, the “Gracie” in Gracie Square is the same Gracie family of [Gracie Mansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracie_Mansion), the official residence of the Mayor of the City of New York (a short stroll away).


10 Gracie Square

As one might expect from a “Good Building,” 10 Gracie Square has top-tier amenities and an impressive slate of former residents. Per [StreetEasy](https://streeteasy.com/building/10-gracie-square-new_york):

From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Located on 84th Street between the East River Drive and East End Avenue across from Carl Schurz Park, 10 Gracie Square is one of Manhattan’s most prestigious addresses. Built in 1930, this white glove full-service pre-war building has 15 floors and 43 apartments. Notable former residents include Gloria Vanderbilt, conductor André Kostelanetz, Alexander Woolcott and Madame Chiang Kai-Shek who lived in an 18-room duplex until her death in 2003. Amenities in the building include a full-time doorman, attended elevator, driveway, garage, garden, basketball court, laundry room (W/D allowed in apts.) and storage. The building originally had a private club below that offered yacht mooring which was demolished for the FDR. The club is now a fitness center. Pet friendly. 30% financing permitted. 3% flip tax.”

Thirty percent financing “permitted” means that buyers need to make a down payment of at least 70 percent — so the Zabels coughed up at least $5.5 million in cold, hard cash. Their new home also comes with monthly carrying costs in the five figures — a maintenance tab of $10,674, according to the [listing](https://streeteasy.com/sale/1336824), not including taxes. [UPDATE (3/4/2019, 3:45 p.m.): I momentarily forgot, but an observant reader reminded me: this is a co-op, so taxes are included in the maintenance.]

What did the Zabels get in exchange for their millions? Let’s poke around….

Last week, I took a break from chronicling [Biglaw pay raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) to attend the second annual [Big Law Business Summit](http://www.bna.com/big-law-business-summit-2016/). Like last year’s conference, the 2016 Summit was an excellent event, in terms of both the content of sessions and the networking.

A highlight: hearing from [Brad Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp.aspx), who has served since 2008 as chair of [Paul, Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison-llp/). He delivered a keynote address and then sat for an interview with Matthew Winkler, editor-in-chief emeritus of Bloomberg News.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Karp opened with a few fast facts about the firm:

- It has an all-equity, single-tier partnership (one of just [18 firms in the Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/stats-of-the-week-the-last-of-the-true-biglaw-partnerships/) with this structure).
- More than 85 percent of the firm’s partners are homegrown (including Karp himself, who started his PW career as a summer associate).
- It has approximately 140 partners and 800 other lawyers (counsel, associates, and staff attorneys).
- It is headquartered in New York, with other offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, Toronto, Washington, and Wilmington.
- In 2015, the firm had total revenue of $1.1 billion, operating income of $533 million, and profits per partner a shade over $4 million.
- The firm’s partner compensation model is modified lockstep, with more than 90 percent of the partners on the lockstep, and a 4:1 ratio between the highest- and lowest-paid partners (aka the [partner pay spread](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/the-haves-and-the-have-mores-partner-pay-spreads-at-leading-law-firms/)).
- A bonus pool amounting to approximately two percent of total firm revenue is used to compensate top performers.
- A ten-partner management committee runs the firm; a six-partner compensation committee sets partner pay.
- The committee members, including the firm chair, are elected by secret ballot.
- Brad Karp continues to practice while running the firm as chair (the “player-coach” model seen at several other elite New York firms, like Cravath and Wachtell).
“We are operating in a period of unprecedented turbulence and instability,” Karp [noted](https://bol.bna.com/paul-weiss-chair-warns-about-challenges-for-legal-profession/). In an effort to resist disruptive forces, some firms are sacrificing culture and values in favor of the bottom line. That’s not the approach followed by Paul, Weiss — and so far, it has worked out well for the firm. PW has enjoyed a twenty-year stretch of growing revenue, profit, and pro bono hours.

Can Paul, Weiss maintain such success? Karp described himself as “cautiously optimistic,” as long as it stays true to its own values. He laid out the following keys to the firm’s success (a list of 13 that I distilled it down to ten, eliminating some overlap between factors):

1. A careful curation of clients and matters. PW has upgraded its matter intake process so that it’s more selective about what engagements it accepts. Today, 80 percent of its clients and matters are strategic in nature. Ten years ago, the figure was around 50 percent. Twenty years ago, strategy wasn’t really on the firm’s radar screen; it didn’t turn down work back then, focusing on doing high-quality work for any client that happened to retain it. But what worked two decades ago doesn’t really work today, at least for a firm of PW’s caliber.

2. Solid diversification of clients. The firm’s top 25 clients are responsible for about 50 percent of revenue. That’s more diversification than many other firms, but PW continues to diversify further, adding what Karp described as “superstar laterals” who have relationships with “marquee clients.” (Examples include [Scott Barshay](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/) and [David Bernick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/musical-chairs-leading-litigator-david-bernick-leaves-dechert-to-join-paul-weiss/) — but note that the firm might take a bit of a breather from lateral hiring, with Karp describing himself as “a little fatigued” on that front.)

3. An investment in top practice areas. “We understand who we are and are not,” Karp said, which means not trying to be “all things to all clients in all jurisdictions.” PW focuses on a handful of key practices — public M&A, private equity, bet-the-company litigation, critical regulatory and white-collar defense work, restructuring — and consciously steers clear of non-core practices and jurisdictions.

4. A cultivation of client relationships. PW seeks to broaden and strengthen its client relationships. “There’s nothing strategic about one-off clients,” Karp said. (The counterexample that popped into my head: my former firm, Wachtell Lipton, which does a fair amount of one-off work representing targets in M&A. But that’s [not a model most firms can follow](http://adamsmithesq.com/2012/11/growth-is-dead-part-11-granting-your-wish/3/).)

5. A continual focus on talent. As clients engage in a “flight to quality” and hire star lawyers rather than law firms, hiring the most talented individual lawyers is “an indispensable ingredient” for PW’s success. It’s no surprise that the firm pays top dollar to [lateral partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/anatomy-of-a-deal-the-backstory-behind-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/), [associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-another-big-new-york-firm-matches-cravath/), and even [summer associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-raises-spread-to-summer-associates/).

(Funny aside: Karp’s daughter is an associate at Simpson Thacher. When Paul, Weiss matched Cravath, he shot her a note: “you’re welcome.”)

6. A recognition that we are in a service, results, and value business. It’s not just about the talent, but about what that talent can do for clients, and at what price. In a bygone era, clients focused on service and results, with value in distant third place; that’s no longer the case, according to Karp.

7. A focus on culture, values, and partnership. Culture and values attract promising law students, enable PW to retain star associates and partners, and help the firm attract great laterals.

“Money is no substitute for enjoying the work you do, surrounded by great colleagues, in a culture that prizes teamwork,” Karp said. He didn’t name names, but he pointedly noted that if you look at recent law firm collapses, you’ll see a lack of cohesion, unchecked greed, and sharp elbows between partners.

Every firm boasts about its values. What does that mean in a concrete sense, Winkler asked Karp during Q&A?

“If you see a partner acting badly, treating a colleague inappropriately, you have to take immediate action,” Karp said. What might such action include? “I chair the compensation committee,” he said with a smile.

(Some say that Scott Barshay, recently lured to Paul, Weiss from Cravath, can be a bit of a taskmaster. But we suspect that his PW payday, said to be close to $10 million (see the various [updates to this post](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/)), will keep him in line.)

8. A compensation system that incentivizes the right behaviors. PW’s “modified lockstep” system has remained largely unchanged since the 1950s. The lockstep aspect encourages teamwork and collaboration, instead of partners vying with each other for credit, while the modifications and bonus pool allow for recognition of extraordinary contributions in a given year.

Maintaining a lockstep system isn’t easy, Karp said. When Winkler asked him in the Q&A if lockstep was dying, Karp said, “It has been — each and every year for 30 years.” He cited the rise of the [Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) and their [profit-per-partner rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/) as a major factor: “if the compensation of the person across the table from you is triple yours, but you think you’re triple them in talent,” it’s only a matter of time before you start seeking greener pastures.

9. A focus on high-quality work and risk management. The legal world is, per Karp, increasingly punitive and unforgiving. Clients will replace law firms based on a single misstep, and law firm partnerships are fragile in an age of increased lateral movement. Ensuring top-notch work product and minimizing dangers to the firm are key considerations.

10. An emphasis on pro bono and community engagement. Paul, Weiss has a rich pro bono tradition, ranging from working with Thurgood Marshall in desegregating schools to advancing LGBT equality by winning the Windsor case in the Supreme Court (for which partner Robbie Kaplan won ATL’s [2013 Lawyer of the Year honors](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/above-the-laws-2013-lawyer-of-the-year-competition-the-winner/)). In the wake of the Orlando shooting, the firm is considering [litigation to promote gun control](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-tragedy-in-orlando-the-legal-community-responds/). Paul Weiss partners serve on many boards for charitable, educational, and cultural organizations.

These efforts are good for the community and the legal profession, and they’re also good for the firm. PW’s robust pro bono work helps it attract great lawyers (such as Jeh Johnson, whom I [previously profiled](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/07/an-afternoon-with-jeh-johnson-general-counsel-of-the-defense-department/)). Partners serving on boards get to spend quality time with wealthy individuals and corporate leaders who then end up retaining Paul, Weiss.

So this is what has worked over the years for PW. But it won’t work for every firm; instead, Karp counseled, your own firm’s strategic vision must reflect its particular culture and strengths. And then you then you have to execute on that vision. As a client told Karp recently, “Strategy without execution is a daydream; execution without strategy is a nightmare.”

During the interview with Matt Winkler, Karp noted that law firm life has changed significantly since he started at the firm back in the 1980s. The main difference: lawyers are on call 24/7, thanks in large part to technology. But the work at Paul Weiss remains fascinating and the firm traditions remain the same, for which he’s grateful.

What would he have done differently coming up the ranks? “I would have smelled the roses more,” he told Winkler. “I was a machine when I was an associate — but you don’t have to be a machine to succeed.”

And what advice would Brad Karp give to young lawyers like his daughter?

“Work hard, but not too hard. Make sure you feel passion for what you’re doing. And remember it’s never too late to change.”

# More From Professor Amy Chua About Her Clerkship Counseling
## And an update on the Tiger Mother's health as well: she has been released from the hospital.

Professor Amy Chua

The past few months have been difficult ones for Professor Amy Chua, the prominent Yale Law School faculty member most famous outside academia as the author of [Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202842/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594202842&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20) (affiliate link).

In July, she wrote a [Wall Street Journal op-ed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/kavanaugh-is-a-mentor-to-women-1531435729) about Judge Brett Kavanaugh that generated significant (and perhaps surprising) [controversy](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/yale-prof-promotes-brett-kavanaughs-extraordinary-ability-to-hire-her-daughter/). In late August, she was admitted to the emergency room as a result of a massive internal infection; she underwent major surgery, then spent three weeks in the hospital. (She is now thankfully out of the hospital, but [won’t be returning to the classroom this semester](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/controversial-yale-law-school-professor-hospitalized-out-for-the-semester/)).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Earlier this week, Professor Chua came under fire for [allegedly advising law students](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/no-accident-brett-kavanaughs-female-law-clerks-looked-like-models-yale-professor-told-students/) applying to clerk for Judge Kavanaugh that it was “not an accident” that his female law clerks all “looked like models” — and she would counsel students on optimal attire for Kavanaugh interviews. In a brief statement to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/20/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-yale-amy-chua), which covered the story, Professor Chua wrote that Judge Kavanaugh’s “first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence. He hires only the most qualified clerks, and they have been diverse as well as exceptionally talented and capable.”

Today we received a more detailed statement from Professor Chua, pushing back strongly on the earlier reports and outlining what she does tell students when it comes to the clerkship process:

Everything that is being said about the advice I give to students applying to Brett Kavanaugh — or any judge — is outrageous, 100% false, and the exact opposite of everything I have stood for and said for the last fifteen years.

I always tell students to prep insanely hard — that substance is the most important thing. I advise them to read every opinion, including dissents, the judge has ever written as well as important recent cases from the circuit and Supreme Court. I tell them to review all the black-letter courses they’ve taken and to be prepared to answer hard questions about their writing sample. I tell them to be courteous to everyone, including the staff and clerks. I advise students, male and female, to dress professionally – not too casually – and to avoid inappropriate clothing. I remind them that they are interviewing with a member of the judiciary.

As a former law clerk and author of a clerkship-focused [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1627220461/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1627220461&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=IZ4F6OEG3TXLASWC) (affiliate link), I’m often asked for advice about applying for clerkships. I agree with pretty much all of Professor Chua’s sage counsel (although I might add the qualifier that, depending on how long a judge has been on the bench, it might not be realistic to read every opinion she has ever written; in that case, focus on the most important ones — en banc opinions, opinions in cases that wound up before the Supreme Court, opinions that received a lot of media coverage or scholarly attention, etc.).

Back to Professor Chua’s statement:

I always try my best to be frank and transparent, and to hold students to the highest professional standard, and every year for the last decade I have been invited by affinity groups like Yale Law Women, the Black Law Students Association, and Outlaws to host clerkship advice sessions. My record as a clerkship mentor, especially for women and minorities, is among the things I’m most proud of in my life.

Thanks to Professor Chua for reaching out, and best wishes to her for a swift and strong recovery.

UPDATE (9/23/2018, 11:05 a.m.): Here are [additional thoughts from Professor Eugene Volokh](http://reason.com/volokh/2018/09/22/yale-law-prof-amy-chuas-statement-on-her) on Professor Chua’s statement.

# Firm Makes Up BS Cover Story About Shafting Attorneys On Technology Stipends
## Cutting the stipend isn't the worst offense here.

Look at all the tech that you now have to buy yourself!

Technically, firms aren’t obligated to pay attorneys to purchase the tools of their trade. Law firms weren’t covering dry cleaning all those years when a suit was de rigueur. But keeping a clean suit isn’t the same as keeping plugged into the law firm matrix. Tech stipends guaranteed that associates would stay available around the clock and purchased top-of-the-line tools. It’s a relatively cheap perk that law firms can offer that has the added benefit of helping the firm. That’s why so many [top](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/biglaw-firm-blows-competition-out-of-the-water-with-tech-spending-stipend-for-associates/) [firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/actually-this-tech-stipend-blows-the-competition-out-of-the-water/) do it.

But once a firm offers a stipend, it’s functionally increased the associate’s salary by taking a key expense off the lawyer’s plate. So when it tries to cheap out, it’s a real slap in the face. Days after learning that [Womble was cheaping out](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/wither-the-law-firm-technology-subsidy/) on associates, Venable is following suit.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


This is pure bullshit. “voice and data plans have become even more competitive”? Only in finding new fees to add. In 2010, [Verizon’s unlimited data plan was $29.99/month](https://bgr.com/2010/01/14/verizon-wireless-to-overhaul-its-phone-and-data-pricing-plans/). By 2018, [Verizon’s unlimited data plan started at $75/month](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/unlimited-data-plan-caps-verizon-att-tmobile-sprint.html). Today the company boasts multiple “unlimited” plans banking on consumers too stupid to understand the definition of the word “unlimited.” The closest thing to an actual unlimited plan from Verizon right now [is going for $70-$90/month](https://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/verizon-wireless-plans-1321179). If anything, costs are going to keep going up as carriers package the same service under new brand names to justify charging more and more.

The loss of the stipend is bad, but the disingenuousness is so much worse. Trying to pawn this off by straight up lying about the price of data shows a profound disrespect for the firm’s workforce. The reality is, the firm is betting that associates will probably buy state of the art phones and the biggest data plans anyway. Smartphone culture is ubiquitous and the population of lawyers willing to buy a flip phone just to get out of responding to 2 a.m. emails is almost non-existent, making this an easy place to cut expenses. And they’re probably right about that.

But it’s still a pay cut and it’s still a raw deal for folks who’ve relied on that money for the last few years.

# Biglaw Firm Inundated With Rambling, Genius Conspiracy Theory Memo
## NYU Law and Satan all in one letter? Sure, why not?

Attorneys at Cadwalader are receiving, in alphabetical order, a magnificently deep email that is either complete drivel or high abstract comedy (chose any definition of “high” that you want). Personally, I think it’s the latter, but make up your own minds.

The message, from someone identified only as “Real Sneaky,” offers insights into “‘Forward Thinking’ ‘Thought Leadership’ in Hebrew Prophecy,” which is, at least at the outset, framed around the upcoming election before it veers wildly off the rails and delves into hallucinogens, coffee enemas, and Nietzsche.

I have for you something like an unorthodox CLE. It is important because Hillary Clinton believes in loving-kindness and Donald Trump venerates the Bible. The presidency is expected to understand a very traditional religious issue. President George Washington the Mason was a mystic. Bill Gates the dropout and Steve Jobs the charismatic cult leader both profess to experimentation with LSD. Washington’s Masonry and Jobs’s cult leadership are substantially the same issue. For your benefit, I offer to explain it herein. Welcome!

Well, that would be pretty unorthodox, but my reporting cycle is coming up so let’s dance!

Please tolerate this pretense: I HAVE A DREAM! I have a dream that you discover state-of-the-art Holosync meditation for yourself. The coffee enema is its cousin. Each is quite the sensation. Reishi coffee is a classy touch for classy people, otherwise known as extra-strength.

We’re all about class here. That said, I’m more of a tea enema guy.

Earl Grey. Two sugars.

Let me now christen myself as a Hebrew prophet. Call me realsneaky. I was realsneaky the author of the Tactics. Such things go over well. No one expected realsneaky the Hebrew prophet. The concept may take a second or two. It could catch you off guard, at which point it becomes profound, your personal “thief in the night” moment. Gotcha! Gotcha! Gotcha! Does that count? I also go by the name His Holiness the Drama Lama in order to promote state-of-the-art Holosync meditation, but that joke is for later. Ditto the name Felonious Monk. I am a favorite in the Belmont Stakes. I am the first prophet to be minted from the Strassman mold.

“I am a favorite in the Belmont Stakes.” This is pure gold.

Each year NYU School of Law graduates 450 members per class. Columbia Law uptown graduates 400 members per class. In 1 Kings 18:19-40 the prophet Elijah assembles 450 by 400 false prophets, ridicules them, and has only the 450 executed. 666 – 6^3 = 450, which suggests the number is damned. My experience at a major firm taught me the power of a “Stop work!” directive. “Stop work” with the 450! Please insist with me on an indefinite hiring freeze on all NYU Law alumni. Below I perform for you the priceless “signs, wonders, and miracles” of a “super-apostle” (2 Corinthians 12:11-12), uniquely “sent” and yet “beyond what is written.” For example, I will carry out Tool’s song 46&2 before your eyes. I ask you, in exchange, for the small favor of ostracizing the 450. My now very successful graduating class is known for murder on the high seas. Call me realsneaky, but tell the 450 “Elijah has come!”

As an NYU Law graduate, allow me to express what a relief it is to finally have my role as a false prophet of the Beast out in the open. It’s quite the load off.

Also, I love that Tool is a revelatory musical act.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Nietzsche is interesting to the extent that the “self-overcoming” of an overcoming, transcending, transvaluating man, the Napoleonic UberMensch, might be comparable to alchemical transformation. “Is the evolution real?” should be a serious inquiry, one for which Nietzsche scholars such as Brian Leiter at the University of Chicago Law School have no frame of reference. Leiter’s blog might compare Nietzsche to post-modernism or Darwin, but he couldn’t compare Nietzsche’s search for a “life affirming” philosophy encompassing every impulse to Anton LaVey’s celebration of lust and other values denied by Christianity. Nietzsche’s own madness was not unlike an unfinished alchemical evolution. Did he drink absinthe, eat amanita (highly unlikely without an expert pied minstrel), or take LSA?

For those keeping score, we just had Nietzsche, Napoleon, the founder of the Church of Satan, and Brian Leiter in one paragraph — and I am absolutely buying whatever this cat is selling.

After a brief detour through Eric Cartman and Francis Ford Coppola — really — and the story of how the author became the subject of an NYU legal writing exercise, the author concludes with a plan to put up a shingle.

Perhaps we could take the legal industry by storm with a new subsidiary firm, Treasurestone, Wiseman, Einstein, Goldstein, and Farrow. Treasurestone Wiseman rolls off the tongue. In the alternative, “Lateral us.” I have a top-tier J.D., and I must still pay off my student loans. I envision publishing “reform-minded,” “radical” legal scholarship that inserts the coffee enema, Holosync meditation, and entheogens anywhere they contribute to the law. Perhaps such a project is accomplished today.

Perhaps. We dare to dream.

UPDATE: Some have raised the possibility that this letter is not a work of creativity — perhaps, which would be disheartening. If so, that doesn’t detract from some of the great turns of phrase the author works into this piece.

The whole essay is reproduced on the next page…

No one is shooting at me. I’m not thousands of miles from home. I’m not in a combat zone. I’m in a nice, air-conditioned office overlooking Boston. It enables you to handle it.

— [Josh Carroll](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuacarroll1/), an associate in Ropes & Gray’s Boston office, commenting on how his 12 years of military service helps him [put the burdens of long nights in the office in perspective](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/almstaff/2017/11/09/veterans-heading-to-law-schools-with-nonprofits-help/). Carroll served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force while he was on active duty, and he’s now a major in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Carroll volunteers as an ambassador for [Service to School](https://service2school.org/), a nonprofit organization that helps veterans gain admissions to some of the nation’s most elite law schools.

# Big Thoughts From An Industry Visionary
## While most companies will soon have an urgent need to review and understand their contractual obligations, far too many struggle to even find copies of the relevant agreements once they need them.

When it comes to thought leaders in the legal industry, they don’t come much bigger than Mark Harris. Twenty years ago, Harris co-founded Axiom, now one of the biggest, oldest, and heaviest-hitting Alternative Legal Service Providers in the world. These days he’s running a spin-off entity called Knowable, which is focused on contract management. Few can claim to have changed an entire industry, but he’s one of them.

So when Mark Harris pens an [open letter to the business world](https://www.knowable.com/resources/an-unsolicited-intervention-for-general-counsel), as he did this week, it merits attention. Harris generously shared a draft of the letter that he and Alec Guettel, Knowable’s CFO and Axiom’s co-founder, wrote. He also granted me an interview ahead of publication. It’s a heck of a conversation piece.

While I’d recommend reading the letter in full, its central insight is a practical one: “Large companies are constructed of hundreds of thousands of commercial arrangements in all directions[.]” In the abstract, we all expect COVID-19 to place an immense strain on those arrangements as supply and demand sharply rise and fall, as customers or suppliers go out of business, and as consumers change their basic habits.

What Harris teases out is that our responses to these changes will be dictated and constrained by the contracts our companies have entered into, but most companies have little or no idea at any given moment what’s included in those contracts. While most companies will soon have an urgent need to review and understand their contractual obligations, far too many struggle to even find copies of the relevant agreements once they need them. If the basic contract can be found, pulling together the various addenda, modifications, waivers and such that tend to accrete over a business relationship can be more difficult still.

Harris witnessed the disaster that played out in the 2008 financial crisis. As the stock market tumbled and mortgage-backed securities collapsed, “… the banks were paralyzed. It wasn’t that they themselves were in financial peril, it was that they were contractually committed to all kinds of other institutions and had obligations in this complicated web of commitments and promises and dependencies, and it was completely opaque to them… . It did get sorted out, and the regulators parachuted in for the next six or seven years, and it turns out that having more visibility into their contractual commitments made their businesses a lot better.”

Harris and Knowable are offering a solution to the problem they see coming. As a response to COVID-19, and in anticipation of the difficulties the business world is gearing up to face, Knowable is offering a basic version of its contract management software to all companies free of charge. Harris is up-front that the offer is equal parts altruistic gesture to help struggling businesses and a self-serving effort to onboard new customers. Both in his open letter and in our conversation, Harris was thoughtful about trying to combine compassion with  business-savvy. At the same time this product is being made available free of charge, Knowable has ceased sales calls to potential new customers out of the sense that doing so would be tone-deaf and off-putting. “While we’re sensitive to that, we’re not ashamed of it,” he told me. “What I believe in more than anything is a for-profit company out to do good, out to actually help and solve real problems. It’s understanding that the point of the game is to win, but to win for the right reasons and in the right ways.”

Harris’ anxiety reflects the difficult needle that business leaders are having to thread during this likely generation-defining crisis. The biggest cost of this pandemic is indisputably the human one. Keeping ourselves, our loved ones, and our coworkers healthy while caring for the sick and bereaved is, and should be, our first priority. But while the economic impacts of the crisis may not be the most damaging, they are nonetheless important to mitigate. Doing what we reasonably and safely can to keep people employed and mitigate the economic damage will help prevent second-order suffering down the road. Knowable’s free offer will, Harris hopes, help some businesses better weather the storm, better take care of their employees, and better lift the country back up once we’re through the worst of this.

Like any visionary, Harris sees the upheaval caused by COVID-19 as an opportunity for betterment. “The greatest obstacle most companies have is that they’re fighting inertia,” he told me. “In the short term, it’ll be paralysis and chaos. I think in the medium- to long-term, however, this will open hearts and minds to doing things in a different, smarter, better way… . Freelance working and virtual working are going to be far more accepted” once the world settles into its new normal.

For the founder of one of the legal industry’s biggest Alternative Legal Service Providers, Harris remains surprisingly bullish on the future of law firms themselves. “Law firms take a lot of punishment, particularly in the sort of circles I travel in, but I think the reality is they’re a pretty good business model. They’ve endured pretty well.” Harris also breaks from the convention that firms should continue to consolidate and grow into larger and larger entities. “I think law firms work better as partnerships. I think when partners feel like partners, as opposed to midlevel managers at a multinational corporation, I think they just function better, culturally and from a performance standpoint, from a customer experience standpoint. And I think they control their financial statements in a way that puts them on much better footing and leaves them less vulnerable when the world swings in violently.”

If there’s one thing that resonated for me out of Harris’ open letter and our conversation, it’s a similar theme that has been emerging out of the past few columns I’ve written. COVID-19 is making us realize how what we think of as monolithic businesses and industries are really just a series of connections between people. The contracts that define our conduct are, at heart, a group of people sitting down and agreeing to make each other better off. It’s people deciding to build something together that [make up our companies](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/what-is-the-definition-of-a-law-firm/). It’s people that [take care of one another](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/naming-names-the-unsung-heroes-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/) in times of crisis.

We are who we surround ourselves with and who we look out for during difficult times.

# Lawyer Suicides Are Becoming All Too Frequent
## No client, no case, no partnership, no failing to make partner, no promotion, no demotion is worth the price that some lawyers have paid.

Guess what yesterday (Tuesday) was. It was not National Cheeseburger Day. It was not National Apple Pie Day. Hungry yet?  It was not Set Your Hair on Fire and Run Down The Street in Your Birthday Suit Day. It was…tada…[World Kindness Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Kindness_Day). And no, I am not making this up. And it’s the 20th anniversary of this day, and I didn’t even know it existed.  Did you?  I guess it could be a kissing cousin to Love Your Lawyer Day, which Joe Patrice [thoroughly trashed](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/today-is-love-your-lawyer-day-and-its-completely-stupid/) recently.

Lawyers and kindness? An oxymoron? Another touchy-feely discussion about how we need to be supportive of each other? You betcha, and I will rant on this topic ad nauseam until we lawyers, who are supposed to be smarter than the average bear (thanks, [Yogi Bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pqyax6gwzQ)), not only get the message but act on it.

In a devastating opinion piece, the wife of a Biglaw partner, who killed himself, [takes Biglaw and the profession to task](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/11/12/big-law-killed-my-husband-an-open-letter-from-a-sidley-partners-widow/). Understand that this is the perspective of a widow who has lost her life partner and best friend and her grief is fresh and palpable, but there’s a lot of truth in what she says about how the legal practice environment fosters a climate of unhealthiness. Biglaw peeps should read this op-ed, as should every lawyer in every size firm, be it corporate law department, government, and solos. I would include support staff and every lawyer’s family and friends in the required readership as well. Family and friends may see warning signals that professional colleagues are either oblivious to or choose to ignore.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yes, Gabe MacConnaill had personal issues and personal demons (don’t we all?) but none of that takes away from the tragedy of what has happened. None of that obscures the fact that he clearly felt that he couldn’t reach out for help, for support, because as we all know, doing that is considered a sign of weakness of our profession. In fact, Gabe felt that if he went to the emergency room due to exhaustion, “it would be the end of his career.” Whether that was true or not, that was how he felt. Reaching out can be a career killer. Shame on us.

His wife, Joanna Litt, also a lawyer, in researching the unanswerable, came across the concept of “maladaptive perfectionism,” that is, unrealistic standards of achievement combined with hypercriticism of failing to meet them. Anyone reading this see herself/himself in that definition? I thought so.

At the memorial service at Gabe’s firm, so many people spoke of his kindnesses, his support, his mentoring. Was it ever reciprocated? I wonder how many people actually told him what he had meant to them. I wonder how many other partners in the firm, both in Los Angeles and elsewhere, were too busy to take the time to share words that may have made a difference, words of encouragement, words of support. We’ll never know and it’s too late now.

Stories of [lawyers killing themselves](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/business/lawyers-addiction-mental-health.html) by guns, by booze, by drugs are becoming all too frequent. What is the value of a life? We here in California are finding that out to our heartbreak both in the recent fires that still plague this state and the mass shootings at the Borderline Bar and Grill a week ago in Thousand Oaks, a community devastated by fire as well.

Kathryn Rubino has also [posted](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-widow-blames-firm-for-husbands-suicide/) about this. Perhaps repetition on this topic is a good thing if it helps call attention to this ever-growing crisis. What are we lawyers going to do about it, individually and collectively? No client, no case, no partnership, no failing to make partner, no promotion, no demotion is worth the price that Gabe and others have paid. Practicing law is not like [hazing in a fraternity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIZoVO8ZyyQ) nor should it be.

My plan had been to write about an [ABA working group](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/working-group_to_advance_well-being_in_legal_profession/) to advance well-being in the legal profession, which dovetails, sadly, with Ms. Litt’s op-ed. The working group’s purpose is to “make recommendations regarding the current state of attorney mental health and substance use issues with an emphasis on helping legal employers support healthy work environments.”  Better late than never, I suppose. And define “healthy work environments.”

The primary vehicle for this latest effort is a [pledge composed of two parts](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/aba_pledge_campaign_to_tackle_lawyer_mental_health_and_substance_use_issues): “calling upon legal employers (including law firms, corporate entities, government agencies and legal aid organizations) to first: (a) recognize that substance use and mental health problems represent a significant challenge for the legal profession and acknowledge that more can and should be done to improve the health and well-being of lawyers; and (b) pledge to support the Campaign and work to adopt and prioritize its seven-point framework for building a better future.”

A number of law firms have already signed the pledge. Among them, Sidley Austin. And at what firm was Gabe MacConnaill a partner? Need you ask?

[Mark S. Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-s-scott-57387518/), a former partner at the Biglaw firm of Locke Lord and founder/CEO of MSS International Consultants Ltd., a private equity fund headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering. According to the indictment, Scott was part of a conspiracy to conceal the source of $400 million in process from an alleged pyramid scheme involving a purported cryptocurrency, OneCoin. Prosecutors allege he transferred money in and out of the country in order to hide the origins of the money.

Before Magistrate Judge [Kevin N. Fox](http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/judge/Fox), Scott’s bail of $1 million bond was secured by $200,000 cash. As [reported](http://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20180913/cape-man-indicted-in-400m-ponzi-scheme) by the Cape Cod Times, additional conditions were placed on his bail:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As conditions of his bail, Scott also was placed on home detention; ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device; surrender his travel documents; limit his travel to within the Southern District of New York, the jurisdiction of the federal court hearing the case; submit to drug testing; remain under court supervision; and not possess firearms, according to court documents. Scott was ordered detained until all the conditions are met, the documents say.

Scott was arrested September 5th on his way to his home in Cape Cod, and a warrant was executed upon that property. In the course of serving that warrant, Scott’s wife, Lidia Kolesnikova, was arrested for reckless endangerment of a child. According to reports, while the police were at their home an officer saw an unsecured weapon on a table in the vicinity of an infant, but additional details about that incident are unclear:

Because the report was heavily redacted, the type of weapon was unclear, but unredacted sections refer to “the magazine” and “no round chambered.”

The documents also say Kolesnikova “does not have a license to carry.”

Kolesnikova has pleaded not guilty to the charge, and was released on her own recognizance provided she she surrender her firearms and not have firearms in any home where children are present.

# Biglaw Firm Reopens With Eventual Plans To Have Office As 'Primary Workspace'
## Let's just make believe the pandemic never happened....

When it comes to law firms’ reopening plans, some just wish that they could return to the way things were before the pandemic ever happened. While the majority of firms seem to be leaning into the flexibility that working remotely has introduced to employees by ending the five-day, in-office workweek, others seem to want real-life face time (not the app) — and lots of it — from their personnel.

It looks like the latter is what’s going to be happening at Cadwalader, a firm that took in $452,572,000 gross revenue in 2020, for 85th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. According to sources, during a presentation earlier this week, Patrick Quinn, the firm’s managing partner, emphasized that while Cadwalader would not forget the lessons learned during the pandemic (i.e., the firm will remain “flexibile” going forward, and no one will be required to be in the office every day in 2021), the office will be the “primary workspace” for attorneys and staffers in the new year. But which new year are we talking about? Here’s a relevant slide:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Cadwalader includes the best typo ever here, noting that “[b]eginning on Jan. 1, 2020” the firm will “[r]esume operations with the office as our primary workspace.” It’s almost as if this Biglaw firm is longing for a time machine so that everything can go back to the way it was before COVID-19. Personel at the firm may not be so eager to jump into the DeLorean to go back to the future.

Here’s what we heard from Cadwalader insiders about this plan:

• People at the firm seemed to have been looking for a stronger statement in favor of flexibility and continued WFH, but the message is pretty clear that we’ll all be expected to return back to the old way of doing things.

• According to Patrick Quinn, although the firm did hear that there were some advantages of working from home, the consensus was that the downsides (fewer mentorship/training opportunities, difficulty separating home and work lives, and fewer opportunities to be together and with our clients) outweighed the positives. But he did stress multiple times that the firm would not forget that we are capable to serving clients at the highest levels no matter where we are, and that the “flexibility” they are looking for in 2022 and beyond is still a work in progress.

Best of luck to Cadwalader associates and staffers in 2020 — er… 2022. Let’s hope some flexibility remains at the firm as it hops through time.

# Is It Time To Say Bye-Bye To OCI?
## Precruiting seems to be taking over as the way that Biglaw firms find law students to fill their summer associate classes.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

What we’re seeing in the market is this fear of missing out, if a lot of other firms are going after the top candidates early, your firm has to do that as well.

OCI likely still has a valuable role in the legal industry. The data suggests it’s going to have a valuable place. There’s a shift. Rather than being the primary source where firms are finding candidates, it’s becoming a secondary source.

— Nikia Gray, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/12/facing-overcapacity-law-firms-made-fewer-offers-for-2024-summer-associates/) on the group’s latest report on the recruitment of summer associates, which for the first time measured recruiting that took place outside of on-campus interviews. The report indicated that “firms are increasingly viewing [OCI] as a vehicle to ‘round out’ their summer programs after engaging in a vigorous round of pre-OCI recruiting to secure their ideal candidates.”

# Crowell & Moring Matches -- Wait, What In The Holy Hell Is Going On Here?
## This salary following thing is getting a little out of hand.

I’ve been really sick for a couple of weeks. Hospitals and “teams” of doctors sick. The last story I read before I went into convalescence was Cravath [finally raising associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) after nearly a decade of Biglaw salary stagnation. And now I come back to work to “Crowell & Moring Matches Cravath.” What the s***, man? This is why we can’t have nice things.

Tipsters report Crowell matched Cravath through their fifth-year associates in all U.S. offices. Sixth-year associates and those senior, including counsel, will learn about their raises separately.

This is all very nice for the Crowell people in our audience, and I don’t mean to rain on anybody’s parade, but in what freaking UNIVERSE is Crowell & Moring in the same [“MoneyLaw Club”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) as freaking Cravath? The salary raise includes all U.S. offices, which I assume must include the firm’s office in Anchorage. So now a Crowell & Moring second-year in Alaska is getting the same as a Cravath second year in New York? How does that happen? The only raise a C&M Anchorage associate needs is an extra crate of seal blubber. I know you are lawyers, but did truly nobody teach you how money works?

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been on the NY to $190K campaign [since November… 2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/new-york-to-190k-actually-its-about-time/?rf=1). But as I see middling Biglaw firm after middling Biglaw firm race to match Cravath on associate salaries, I’m forced to believe one of three things:

1. Cravath low-balled the entire market.
2. These firms have been sitting on piles of cash that they’ve just been HOARDING.
3. We’re all gonna die.

Last thing first:

3. David Lat has already thoroughly explored the “we’re all gonna die” angle. David “I want people to be happy and have nice things” Lat pleaded with firms to [halt this disastrous trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/?rf=1) of firms following the powerhouses when they can’t afford to. It leads to recession and sadness. It’s like that scene in the Dark Knight where all the fake Batmans are out there trying to fight crime, and Christian Bale has to remind them, “I’m not wearing hockey pads!”

2. Unless they can afford it. It’s entirely possible that these firms, even smaller Biglaw firms, have been raking in the profits for years and have more than enough margin to throw their associates a little bit more money. Don’t forget, it’s been almost 10 years since the associate payscale saw a bump. Thanks to the recession, and the firms right-sizing their associate forces, demand for Biglaw jobs has been so high that no firm needed to raise salaries to compete. But once CSM moved the market, sure, all these guys could find some extra money to spread around. Firms could have paid their associates more generously for years, but screw ’em. Now that Uncle Parker down the block decided to give his kid a bigger allowance, it’s not going to break your bank to give the same bump to your kid — the money was always there.

1. Which brings me to my working conclusion: Cravath low-balled the entire market. Instead of creating meaningful salary competition that would be to the advantage of the truly financially strong firms, they tried to be cheap about it and only succeeded in giving everybody a raise. Thanks Cravath. It might be a de minimis amount of money to you, but you’ve made life a little bit better for the throngs of Biglaw associates who had lost buying power relative to associates 10 years ago.

We’ll eventually know whether Cravath started a virtuous circle or a downward spiral. In the meantime, congratulations Crowell & Moring. When my parents got me a Nintendo like all my rich friends had, I wasn’t bitching.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or email (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# This Biglaw Partner's Nearly $2,500 Hourly Rate Is Raising Some Brows
## Holy cow. That's going to be a quite the costly legal bill.

It’s well known that Biglaw partners at the top of their game command high hourly rates. But how high is too high? According to a U.S. bankruptcy trustee, the answer is $2,465.

That’s the going rate for Hogan Lovells partner [Neal Katyal](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/neal-katyal), and the U.S. is objecting to Johnson & Johnson subsidiary LTL Management’s request to add Katyal to its legal team in a high-stakes bankruptcy proceeding. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/jj-bankruptcy-trustee-balks-neal-katyals-2465-hourly-rate-2022-05-23/) has the details:

The U.S. trustee in the Chapter 11 case on Friday asked a federal bankruptcy judge in New Jersey to block LTL from retaining Katyal, calling his hourly rate “significantly higher” than that of partners from the seven other law firms already involved in the case. …

Katyal’s hourly rate would rank among the highest publicly available figures in the legal industry. …

According to the trustee’s objection, the hourly rate among LTL’s lawyers from Jones Day topped out at $1,350. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom charged as high as $1,195; Weil, Gotshal & Manges’ top rate was $1,579; and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe’s was $1750. Lawyers from King & Spalding and Shook, Hardy & Bacon are also representing LTL.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here, we see the difference between “regular” Biglaw partners and Biglaw partners like Katyal, who is no ordinary lawyer. Katyal is a former acting U.S. solicitor general who’s argued many, many times before the Supreme Court.

Is this where hourly rates are headed for the most talented of attorneys? If you want brains like this on your legal team, it’s going to cost you a pretty penny.

Today’s verdict confirms what we have said from the beginning, that the claims against Johnny Depp are defamatory and unsupported by any evidence. We are grateful, so grateful to the jury for their careful deliberation, to the judge and the court staff who have devoted an enormous amount of time and resources towards this case.

— [Camille Vasquez](https://brownrudnick.com/people/camille-m-vasquez/), an associate at Brown Rudnick, in comments given outside of the courthouse following a [favorable verdict in Johnny Depp’s defamation case](https://www.eonline.com/news/1333118/johnny-depps-lawyer-camille-vasquez-reacts-to-jurys-verdict-in-amber-heard-defamation-trial) against his ex-wife, Amber Heard. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages, but Judge Penney Azcarate reduced the punitive damages to $350,000, Virginia’s statutory cap. The jury awarded Heard $2 million in compensatory damages in her defamation countersuit. She plans to appeal.

# Biglaw Firm Loses Over A Dozen Partners As More Firms Spread To Boston
## That's a lot of partners leaving.

Well, this has got to sting. LeClairRyan has lost 18 attorneys — 13 of whom were partners at the firm — to Freeman Mathis & Gary. Freeman is an Atlanta-based firm that is [joining](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-2017-boston-legal-market-and-what-it-means-for-2018/) the [trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/shipping-up-to-boston-why-biglaw-associates-should-seriously-consider-lateraling-to-boston-law-firms/) of opening up a [Boston office](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/biglaw-boom-in-beantown/), largely staffed by the fruits of the LeClairRyan talent raid.

The list of partners that moved to Freeman Mathis from LeClairRyan is: Jeff Alitz, Janet Barringer, Catherine Bednar, Paul Boylan, Ben Dunlap, Michael Giunta, Neil Hartzell, Warren Hutchison, Kevin Kenneally, Tom McCraw, Nancy Reimer, Dave Slocum, and Michael Weinberg. Kenneally, once the head of LeClairRyan’s Boston office, will take on the leadership role in the office of his new firm.

As [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/01/09/leclairryan-loses-18-lawyers-as-freeman-mathis-moves-into-boston/) by Law.com, the co-founder of Freeman Mathis, which has been in expansion mode since 2013, is excited about his firm’s latest move:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“This is an amazingly attractive group of lawyers,” said Ben Mathis, Freeman Mathis’ co-founder and managing partner. “They, from day one, are in our key practice areas and have partner-level expertise in all our key practice areas and that’s very hard to find.”

For their part, the powers that be at LeClairRyan are handling the loss with the appropriate amount of grace:

“We wish our former colleagues well at their new firm, which provides a platform that is likely better suited to support their practices,” said the firm’s New Haven, Connecticut-based litigation department leader, Elizabeth Acee. “As we did in 2018, LeClairRyan will continue to focus on growth concentrated on market segments that provide diverse business and litigation services to our clients, while generating better profits per partner at the firm.”

Best of luck to the all the attorneys lateraling onto the next chapter of their career.

# Another Biglaw Giant Goes to $180K -- For All U.S. Offices
## These Biglaw associates are getting paid accordingly.

And another domino falls. This time it is Weil Gotshal & Manges falling in line with the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), joining [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-another-big-new-york-firm-matches-cravath/) and [Cahill](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/3-makes-a-trend-new-york-market-really-is-180k/) as the Biglaw early adopters.

The scale matches the market for first year associates through the class of 2008, but like Paul Weiss they have included the base pay for the class of 2007 at $325,000. Also important to note is that the Weil memo indicates the pay raise is for all U.S. offices — sure Milbank did that too, but Weil has a lot more offices this impacts. Indeed, they have U.S. offices in Boston, Dallas, Houston, Miami, New York, Princeton, Providence, Silicon Valley, and Washington, D.C. Their generosity is sure to put pressure on these other, non-New York markets now.

Weil associates must be thrilled they are getting what they deserve — remember this is the firm that made a[ joke out of work / life balance](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/biglaw-firm-makes-big-joke-out-of-worklife-balance/). If you have to sacrifice your personal life to work at a Biglaw firm, at least you should be compensated accordingly.

Here’s the memo, sent by executive partner Barry Wolf, that puts the cold, hard cash in associates’ hands:



Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move.

# The Legal Industry Is Still On Life Support
## The legal industry continues to plod forward... but for how long?

Perhaps it’s a bit much to say a multi-billion-dollar industry handing out fat bonuses is on life support, but it’s equally important not to let appearances deceive you. The legal industry (and we’re talking specifically about law firms… not the universe of vendors) is still kicking and making gains, but growth remains sluggish, demand remains negligible, and most of the growth is coming from increasing rates. That should remain cause for concern.

The [Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group and Hildebrandt Consulting annual report](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/the-legal-industry-is-still-on-life-support/2/) is out, and the outlook for 2017 looks positively tepid. [Per Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202774520575/Citi-Report-Claims-Growth-Will-Remain-Slow-in-2017?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1&slreturn=20161113091941):

The report, which is released annually, noted that demand for law firm services grew by 0.3 percent in the first three quarters of this year, while expenses grew by 3.4 percent during the same time period, thanks in part to the rise in associate pay. Still, firms were able to raise revenue by 3.7 percent, largely because lawyer rates grew by 3.2 percent.

This stingy demand figure, which has stuck with us for awhile now because [growth is dead](http://amzn.to/2hJvJCM) (affiliate link), suggests a saturated, hyper-competitive market. Indeed, the firm leaders that spoke with the authors of the report cited intense pricing pressure and a sharp decline in client loyalty. It’s the sort of dog-eat-dog world that could produce some big losers if the winds changed a little bit. Thankfully there’s no risk of any external factors screwing with the legal market, right?

External factors, such as the ongoing impact of Brexit, the US election result, China’s slowdown, and the drop in oil prices, will likely cause law firms to continue to experience a more pronounced level of volatility from one year to the next than they are used to.

Beyond macroeconomic events, law firms will also continue to experience a shift in the competitive landscape. The growth of alternative legal service providers has had some impact, although many firms tell us that it is still relatively small. The Big 4 accounting firms will likely affect firms in their markets outside of the US. Perhaps the biggest shift will continue to come from the size and scope of corporate law departments.

Oh. Well then.

The good news, at least for now, is that firms are continuing to keep ahead of demand through rate increases. Over the summer, when firms were raising associate salaries like mad, some clients insisted that [they’d never pay higher rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/). This was always a stupid ploy — the rate increase required to cover the associate salary bump (which, again, contributed to the mere 3.4 percent growth in expenses) was minimal — but it also turns out it wasn’t true, and clients seem more than happy to pay higher rates if law firms pulled this one simple trick:

Realization declined across the industry as firms were putting through rate increases, signaling strong discounting pressure. However, we observed that this dip in realization did not deter the most successful firms from putting through higher rate increases, as shown in Chart 6. Indeed, some firms may have deliberately put through higher rate increases knowing full well that realization would take a hit. In the end, while those firms may not have realized the full benefit of their rate increases, they were still able to retain some of those increases, as shown in Chart 7, contributing to their comparatively stronger revenue growth.

There’s a sucker born every minute, and apparently all of those suckers become institutional clients. Jack up their rates and then offer a huge “because I like you” discount that still results in an increase? Brilliant. That’s probably why it’s been a staple of commerce since Professor Langundum’s Miracle Hair Tonic.

But how long can that last?

Frankly, it’s surprising it’s lasted this long. One would have figured these tactics would lose their potency in the face of alternative fee arrangements, but as the report notes, clients have stymied AFAs:

The growth of AFAs has been much slower than many predicted, remaining at roughly 16% of revenue in 2015 and in projections for 2016, according to the 2016 Citi Law Firm Leaders Survey. Some industry commentators have suggested that the problem has been law firm unwillingness to change. However, the reality is that most of the resistance has come from clients who are not comfortable with what law firms have proposed as AFAs, and would rather stay with hourly rates and discounting.

So we enter 2017, much like we’ve entered the last several years, with an industry slugging forward despite trying market conditions. It’s true that the world will always need lawyers… but how long until they realize they don’t need to spend this much on lawyers?

# Orrick Offers Big-Time Bonuses Plus Above-Market Money For High Billers
## These above-market bonuses are wow, wow, WOW!

Biglaw firms across the country are offering special bonuses to their associates, but we can’t think of any that have offered to pay even more money than the already generous amounts that have become the market standard thanks to Davis Polk — until now, that is.

Orrick — a firm that brought in $1,158,537,000 in 2019 gross revenue, placing in at No. 31 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings — has not one, but two special bonus scales (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/orrick-special-bonus-2021/2/)). One scale is for those with 1950 bonus-eligible billable hours, and the other is for those with 2300 bonus-eligible billable hours. Both bonuses are annualized, one as of March 31 (get those hours in, ASAP) and payable in April, and one as of bonus year-end (November 30 for associates and December 31 for counsel), payable with merit bonuses.

Here’s what the Orrick special bonus scale looks like for those with 1950 hours:

And here’s what the Orrick special bonus scale looks like for those with 2300 hours — which includes a 25% above-market premium for the April bonus payout. Yowza!



Remember, this is a firm that allows associates to [bill for 40 bonus-eligible hours of unplugged vacation time](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/?rf=1), and up to 100 firm billable hours are included in the 1950- or 2300-hour thresholds (including up to 35 hours of training/shadowing; up to 50 hours of innovation; up to 50 hours of diversity, equity & inclusion; and up to 50 hours of substantive business development). On top of that, Orrick will offer regular and premium special bonuses to anyone who misses their billable marks for the April payment, but meets them by the end of the year.

Woohoo! Free money from my firm!

With graduation behind you and the bar exam lurking just ahead, you’re looking forward to starting at your new law firm in a few short months. There’s just one problem: How are you going to survive the summer before you receive your first paycheck? Luckily, some Biglaw firms offer salary advances or bar exam stipends, so incoming first-year associates won’t be left in the lurch.

One law firm recently sent its incoming associates some welcome news about an increase to its bar stipend. This is the email that [Linda M. Doyle](https://www.mwe.com/en/team/d/doyle-linda-m), who serves as chief human resources officer, deputy general counsel, and hiring partner at [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/mcdermott-will-emery/), sent out to the firm’s soon-to-be new associates yesterday afternoon:

McDermott’s new $5,000 bar stipend represents an increase of $2,000 over what the firm used to offer to incoming associates preparing to take the test. Congratulations to MWE first-years on their extra cash — use it wisely as you prepare to conquer the July 2016 administration of the bar exam. We’ll also wish you luck, because with the unimpressive pass rates we’ve seen for the past several exam dates, you may need it.

If you’re unfamiliar with your firm’s policies on benefits like the one McDermott Will is offering, you may want to consult our [exhaustive list](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/law-firm-advances-bonuses-benefits-stipends-for-first-years/) of the advances, bonuses, benefits, and stipends available for first-year attorneys. If you see any information about your firm that is incorrect or needs to be updated, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=First-Year%20Biglaw%20Benefits) so we can revise the list.

# Financial 'Doom And Gloom' For Biglaw? Maybe Not!
## Let's look at these sagging profits with some rose-colored glasses.

Some people have seen the report and interpreted it as doom and gloom for the industry. I don’t see it that way. 2022 may end up being the second-best year the legal industry has ever had.

— Joe Mendola, senior director of sales for Wells Fargo Private Bank Legal Specialty Group, commenting on his group’s recent report on Biglaw’s financial results for the first half of the year, in an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-profit-plunge-looks-like-precursor-to-another-good-year). As noted in [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firm-profits-sag-amid-rising-costs-slowing-demand-wells-fargo-finds-2022-08-16/), among surveyed firms, Wells Fargo found that net income declined more than 9% year-over-year, while profits-per-equity partner fell 11%. On top of that, lawyer compensation costs increased by about 17%, while general expenses grew by more than 14% at the same time.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

In my last article, I explained that when I need to remind myself of the most important basic marketing things to do, I am mindful of the three basic items, which I call the “Threebies.” I previously discussed the first Threebie, which is to [“Get Out and About!”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/power-niche-marketing-get-out-and-about/)  In this article, I will talk about the second Threebie.

The second Threebie is very simple:  Be Enthusiastic!

Yes, just that. Be enthusiastic! That is all I am advocating here. So far these Threebies are pretty easy, aren’t they?  Just get out and about and be enthusiastic. Anyone could do that, couldn’t they?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I can tell you this — no one wants a sad sack around. Or someone that just drones on and on. Have you ever been to a party or a group setting or just gone out to lunch with friends or co-workers? Who is the guy you just don’t want to sit next to or hang out with?  Of course there are a fair number of undesirable personal traits that people could have, but someone dull and droning and boring and negative is hardly going to get you to think: “Boy, I want to talk with that guy.”

On the other hand, enthusiastic people are such a thrill. Even if the person you are with is just talking about Band Camp, the fact that he loves it beyond imagination makes people pay attention and find that person exciting and interesting, maybe to your surprise.

This second Threebie – Be Enthusiastic! – is straight out of the Dale Carnegie course I took. It is discussed in the book [How to Win Friends and Influence People](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1508569754/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1508569754&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=V4RF2XZ7VCJ4ULPO) (affiliate link), but they recognized its importance and built an entire course around this seemingly simple concept, in order to help people… well, win friends and influence people.

Let’s make time for a dorky drill here that I learned from the Dale Carnegie course. I use this often if I have a big meeting or a big pitch or I am attending something where I am on stage or have to make a strong, and good, impression on someone. It could even be an internal meeting at my law firm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I, together with my colleagues that are going to the pitch or the meeting, repeat this five times, out loud and not whispering either:

If I act enthusiastic, I will be enthusiastic
If I act enthusiastic, I will be enthusiastic
If I act enthusiastic, I will be enthusiastic
If I act enthusiastic, I will be enthusiastic
If I act enthusiastic, I will be enthusiastic

Go ahead and try this yourself now. And don’t whisper either, say it out loud, and say it five times in a row. Okay, you feel like an idiot, right?

Now, for extra credit, find someone nearby and get him or her to do it with you. I bet you are laughing at each other for being so foolish.

However, is your mood different than it was before you did this exercise?  The answer is: “Of course!”  It is just about impossible to do this drill without your mood going from whatever it was to a higher, and more enthusiastic, plane. It is just about impossible.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As stated, my partners and I do it. We start laughing at ourselves – at what idiots we are making of ourselves, but by the time we are done we are jolly and happy and loose and smiling and in the greatest of moods and – almost always – our meeting goes just great.

Go ahead and try it before you go out and about.

Back to my main point, which is about the importance of being enthusiastic.  Sometimes people say you should just be yourself and, of course, that is true in part.  You can’t fake who you are. But if you are naturally dull, boring, uninteresting and unenthusiastic, then it is time to do something about it. I bet your entire life will get a lot better.

In this regard, a woman named Amy Cuddy has an incredible TED Talk called [“Fake it Till You Make it.”](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are) This is well worth watching, as she gives one of the most inspirational speeches I have ever heard. She talks about “power poses” and other ways to rev up your enthusiasm. The point here is that even if you feel plain old stupid on this concept, if you “fake” being enthusiastic enough times, it will just happen that you will in fact become enthusiastic. That is what that silly drill above is doing; it is tricking your mind into uplifting your mood.

Even in your writing and your emails and text messages this can resonate. Consider how I am writing this article. Can you feel my passion and excitement – and enthusiasm – literally flowing through the words I am writing right to your cerebral cortex?  Sure you can feel it – I know you can!

I am a naturally enthusiastic person, so for me the Dale Carnegie course was like throwing gasoline on a flame. It encouraged me to go even further with that type of thinking and acting.

I urge you to do the same.

Stay tuned for the third and final Threebie in my next article…..

Corporate, civil rights, criminal, family, and intellectual property: These are just a few of the fields of law that you can specialize in. If you get to choose, which one would you like to focus on?

In this episode, I speak with Christi Campbell, partner at Duane Morris, and discuss the advice that Christi has for those trying to decide what practice works best for them. She also shares her advice for others on the path to partnership. Christi talks about what it was like working with clients on their brands during the pandemic, and what surprises she faced during that process. She also discusses how she balances pro bono work with her billable work.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Law Firm Data Breaches Surge In 2023
## Cybercriminals appear to be successfully hitting small and large firms alike.

Ed. note: This is the latest in the article series, Cybersecurity: Tips From the Trenches, by our friends at [Sensei Enterprises](https://senseient.com/), a boutique provider of IT, cybersecurity, and digital forensics services.

Large and Small Firms in the Data Breach Headlines
Headlines about successful outcomes in litigation are welcome. Headlines about law firms which have suffered a data breach are considerably less welcome.

No one really expected that 2023 would be a banner year for law firm data breaches (some of which were reported in 2023 but occurred earlier). Yet the number of breaches that took place in 2023 is astonishing. Even more astonishing is that cybercriminals appear to be successfully hitting small and large firms alike.

And it’s not just a U.S. problem. In the UK and France, national cybersecurity agencies issued a warning that law firms should upgrade their security, specifying security designed to defend against ransomware attacks.

Three Top 50 Law Firms Breached
In July, we learned that three top 50 law firms had been breached: Kirkland & Ellis, K&L Gates, and Proskauer Rose. All were breached by the ransomware group Clop. If these very large firms could be breached, who is safe?

Also breached were Loeb & Loeb (the incident occurred in 2022) and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe (breached in the first quarter of 2023).

Class Action Suits Have Followed
2023 appears to be the year in which class action firms have discovered fertile ground in law firm data breaches. As of July 2023, five class action suits have been filed against Bryan Cave; Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft; Smith, Grambrell & Russell, as well as two smaller firms – Cohen Cleary and Spear Wilderman. The lawsuits against Cadwalader and Smith Gambrell have since been dropped.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The basis of the suits was fundamentally the same – that the law firms did not have adequate security to protect their data from cyberattacks.

It amazed us how many smaller firms reported data breaches in 2023. They certainly need to up their cybersecurity game, especially in light of the class action suits that are proliferating. There has been a 154% increase in the last year in federal data breach class actions. Truly a surge! The pre-trend lawsuit average was 13 each month – it has escalated to 33 per month now.

Want another headache? Some federal courts are finding that post-breach security assessments may not be privileged.

Government Regulators Are Taking Action
In January of 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed Covington & Burling over a 2020 attack which may have resulted in client data being taken. While the law firm fought back and enlisted support from many other law firms, the SEC seems to have scored a partial victory. The SEC wanted the names of 298 publicly traded clients whose data may have been exfiltrated.

It didn’t get anything that broad. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ordered on July 24 that Covington and Burling give the SEC a list of seven clients whose material nonpublic information may have been accessed by Chinese hackers.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Judge Mehta wrote, “The court finds some merit to both parties’ positions, but ultimately holds that the SEC’s demand for the names of affected clients does not exceed its statutory authority or cross any constitutional lines.”

It was immediately clear that neither the SEC nor the law firm liked that ruling so the odds are high that the ruling will be appealed.

Covington argued that it has a duty to keep client names confidential. It also said that the SEC’s demand for client names could damage relationships between law firms and clients and could cause victims of cyberattacks to decide not to consult with law firms.

Covington also warned, backed by many law firms, that victims could be disincentivized from reporting breaches to the federal government. That’s critical because the U.S. government relies on voluntary cooperation from victims to comprehend the scope of hacks and respond.

Judge Mehta, in his opinion, did not disagree, writing, “The SEC’s approach here could cause companies who experience cyberattacks to think twice before seeking legal advice from outside counsel. Law firms, too, very well might hesitate to report cyberattacks to avoid scrutiny of their clients.”

Mehta noted that “[t]he court’s role, however, is limited. Its task is only to assess whether the subpoena exceeds the SEC’s statutory authority or fails to meet minimum constitutional requirements. It is not to pass on the wisdom of the SEC’s investigative approach.”

Mehta’s ruling requires Covington only to “disclose the names of the seven clients as to whom it has not been able to rule out that the threat actor accessed material nonpublic information.”

He also wrote, “In the court’s estimation, the SEC has not made the case that it needs the names of the 291 clients whose material nonpublic information Covington has determined was not accessed. Those clients, by the SEC’s own admission, are not relevant to its investigation. Therefore, the court is not prepared to grant the SEC access to a client list of nearly 300 names when only seven are actually needed to satisfy the agency’s stated law enforcement interests.”

The judge considered the SEC’s argument that it could not “independently verify” Covington’s conclusion that other clients had not had their data accessed but determined that didn’t mean that the SEC should get the full list of names.

Ugly Statistics on Law Firm Breaches
Checkpoint Research reported in April that cyberattacks rose by 7% in the first quarter of 2023 when compared with the first quarter of 2022. All sorts of organizations, in the first quarter, experienced 1,248 attacks. What caught our attention was that one out of every 40 attacks targeted a law firm or an insurance provider.

As we have often pointed out, law firms are prime targets because of the extensive data they hold of government entities as well as corporations. Experts have consistently noted that many law firms fall short of best cybersecurity practices.

Many of our clients are law firms, so we have some expertise here. Why do law firms sometimes fail to take adequate security measures? Here are the usual reasons we hear:

- It’s too expensive. Note this: IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report, released in late July, found that half of breached organizations are not willing to increase their cybersecurity budget. It also found that only 1/3 of data breaches are discovered by an organization’s own security team. 27% are disclosed by the attacker.
- It will interfere too much with our operations.
- We’re not really a target for cybercriminals.
- Our employees already have security fatigue – this will make it worse.
- Legal ethics rules don’t require this.
Short-sighted? Yes, it sure is. Several clients have paid dearly for refusing to use multi-factor authentication. And as you might guess, after they got hit, they couldn’t adopt MFA soon enough. As to ethics rules, they require reasonable cybersecurity – and what’s reasonable has changed significantly over time.

In fairness, cybersecurity can indeed be expensive – and one of our prime directives to our IT/cybersecurity team is to find affordable solutions for our solo/small/midsize clients.

Happily, such solutions do indeed exist!

Final Words
“Time is the new currency in cybersecurity, both for the defenders and the attackers. . . early detection and fast response can significantly reduce the impact of a breach” – Chris McCurdy, GM Worldwide IBM Security Services.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Firm Goes With Good News/Bad News Approach For COVID Austerity Measures
## Mostly good news... except for those laid off.

Another Biglaw firm finds itself out of the woods caused by the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. After instituting austerity measures months ago, Sheppard Mullin — a firm that placed 54th on the latest Am Law 100 ranking — is rolling back those measures. But it’s not all good news.

In the spring, Sheppard Mullin went through two rounds of austerity measures, first [furloughing staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-staff-no-other-cost-cutting-measures-for-now/) and then cutting [all of its employees’ salaries.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/sheppard-mullin-cuts/) Those cuts were initially 12 percent for associates, special counsel, and staff attorneys, while staff members making more than $90,000 had cuts of 10 percent and staff members making between $70,000 and $90,000 saw their salaries cut by 5 percent. The firm said the partner cuts would be at a “meaningfully greater percentage.” [Then in August,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/am-law-100-firm-rolls-back-its-covid-19-salary-cuts/) it began the process of rolling back the austerity measures, and the amount of the salary cuts were reduced, but, at the time, the firm anticipated those reductions would last throughout 2020.

Yesterday, the firm held a town hall meeting and announced that those existing salary cuts would be rolled back. And, in their October 16th paychecks, employees would receive make-whole payments for their lost income:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


That’s great news! But, as confirmed in a follow-up email from firm Chair, Guy Halgren ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/sheppard-mullin-rollback/2/)), the firm will also be laying off some staff members:

Due to the pandemic and limited expected office usage for a continued period into the future, we have now determined we will not have jobs for 22 of the 44 furloughed people.  These positions will be eliminated as a reduction-in-force with a severance package and medical insurance paid through year-end.  The other 22 for whom we may have a job at an unknown point in the future will be offered the opportunity to opt into the same severance package on a voluntary basis. If they would rather stay on furlough we will continue to pay for their medical insurance at least through year-end.  The severance package is one week of salary per year of service, capped at 26 weeks and with a minimum of four weeks.  The Executive Committee’s decisions regarding our furloughed staff were difficult, but we have always strived to be transparent, and it is critical folks know where they stand.

As always, best of luck to those who find themselves out of work during this trying time.

# No More Lunch With The Cool Kids: Biglaw Firm Bans Client From Its Cafeteria
## Amid legal dispute, firm takes away longtime client's lunch privileges.

Investment bank Perella Weinberg has long enjoyed a unique perk for a Biglaw client — access to the firm cafeteria. The arrangement, born out of Parella sharing a GM Building office with Weil, allowed bankers to feast upon the offerings in Weil’s 26th floor lunch spot. But now those privileges [have been revoked](https://nypost.com/2019/09/12/law-firm-weil-gotshal-bans-longtime-client-from-its-cafeteria/) amid a legal dispute between Parella and Weil over [allegations that Weil botched pay packages costing former Parella bankers millions](https://nypost.com/2019/08/22/top-firm-weil-gotshal-manges-faces-irs-crackdown-over-pay-packages/).

You know what they say, “We’ll Get You And Mangle Your Comp Package.”

The whole affair involves pay that wasn’t properly deferred to two Parella bankers who were later fired. They had sued for deferred compensation and Weil allegedly discovered four years after the fact that the deferral hadn’t been handled properly. Now the bank is understandably testy:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Last month, Peter Weinberg, one of the investment bank’s founders, and partner Robert Steele told Weil that it could be fired, according to a person briefed on the conversation.

The “not-so-veiled threat” came after The Post revealed that partners at Weil had botched the pay packages for two former Perella bankers, and had kept the bank in the dark about the mistake for years.

The error could lead to millions of dollars in back taxes, penalties and interest — and finger-pointing about who is responsible for covering the bill.

That’s why the firm pulled the plug on the cafeteria deal. But according to the Post, some people were already questioning the arrangement:

“It’s weird for a law firm to let people be in private spaces unaccompanied, because you have private and confidential concerns,” one former Weil lawyer told The Post. “Especially investment bankers, who know of deals people are on and are competing with.”

I’ve not been to Weil’s cafeteria, so I can’t speak with specificity, but if it’s anything like the Biglaw cafeterias I have seen, the 26th floor is almost certainly a public-facing floor and not one where work gets done. Still, gossiping attorneys could divulge information while waiting in line for a burger, but how many associates are really making small talk during their authorized five-minute trip down to get some food to nervously consume at their desks?

In fact, it’s not entirely uncommon for clients or opposing counsel to be escorted into the cafeteria so Weil employees should know better than to be spilling the beans on major confidential information anyway. If that’s not a lesson the firm drilled into its people from the beginning, they should do so now, regardless of whether or not Parella gets to hang out there.

Now we’ll have investment bankers who will just have to wait in line at the Cafe Metro like proles. Welcome to Elizabeth Warren’s America!

# Morning Docket: 05.26.16
## * David Mourey, the former assistant dean for bar preparation and academic success at Barry Law, was fired after students continued to fail the bar exam, but in a recently filed gender discrimination and retaliation lawsuit, he claims he was discriminated against because he was ""singled out for discipline by an all-female management team.""

According to a university spokeswoman, the school has not yet finished reviewing Pepper Hamilton's report on the matter, but Baylor will likely make an announcement by June 3. [[Associated Press](http://www.phillyvoice.com/baylor-says-ken-starr-is-president-amid-speculatio/)] * ""We are willing to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to."" Eleven states have filed suit against the Obama Administration in an effort to get around its guidance on transgender rights for children in schools, calling the policy a ""massive social experiment."" The states suing are Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. [[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-idUSKCN0YG2NT)] * Sumner Redstone turns 93 years old tomorrow, and he's been in and out of court for the past few months in a battle to prove he's mentally competent. The salacious case filed by his former female companion may have been dismissed, but now he's attempting to fend off claims from Viacom directors who were ousted from a trust that will control his media holdings if he dies or is found incompetent.

Unfortunately, the answer to this question is not much, especially when ""there is no obligation to disclose the litigation financing arrangements"" that have been made.

It’s a seemingly absurd position: You can make enough money to be in a very high-income tax bracket, but home ownership is completely out of reach. I’m saying that as someone who feels very lucky.

— [Marcella Jayne](https://www.foley.com/en/people/j/jayne-marcella-m), a third-year litigation associate at Foley & Lardner who now makes more than $215,000, commenting on [sizeable student loan indebtedness](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/debt-transformed-my-life-lawyers-weigh-student-loan-reprieve-2021-08-10/) following college and law school. Jayne, a single mother to two children, had been paying $2,200 per month on her $180,000 balance prior to the federal student loan payment moratorium. “We were headed toward the cliff,” she said of affording special needs childcare services coupled with her monthly loan payment, which was higher than her monthly Manhattan rent. While Jayne is thankful for the reprieve, she says she’s looking for something more. “I feel like it’s a band aid. I want policy changes.”

# Harvard Law School Students Organize #DumpKirkland Campaign Over Biglaw Employment Arbitration Agreements
## The battle over Biglaw arbitration employment contracts continues...

Time’s up, Biglaw.

Earlier this year outrage over mandatory arbitration agreements in Biglaw employment contracts hit a fevered pitch. It all started when [Ian Samuel](http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11599/Samuel/) leaked [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/isamuel/status/977699755605274629) the [content of](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/) Munger Tolles & Olson’s agreement that they’d asked summer associates to sign. In the face of backlash, the firm responded by backtracking on the mandatory arbitration clause for all employees. Other firms like [Orrick](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/this-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-step-forward-and-do-away-with-mandatory-arbitration-for-all-employees/?rf=1) and [Skadden](http://www.law.com/therecorder/2018/03/26/after-munger-metoo-snafu-orrick-touts-end-of-arbitration-agreements/) followed suit, changing their employment contracts with the changing times.

But the position of a handful of firms is hardly enough to hold the legal industry accountable. So a survey was sent on behalf of T14 law schools to every law firm recruiting on their campuses, asking that the firms disclose whether they require summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements and nondisclosure agreements related to workplace misconduct, including but not limited to sexual harassment. The [results of the survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/which-biglaw-firms-still-require-summer-associates-to-sign-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/?rf=1) provided essential information to law students and lateral candidates alike about the Biglaw firms, but not everyone chose to disclose the state of their mandatory arbitration agreements.

This lack of transparency is disappointing, particularly when the[ largest law firm by gross revenue](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/theres-a-new-biggest-law-firm-by-gross-revenue-in-town/) opts out of the disclosures. But this hasn’t stopped a group of Harvard Law student activists, organized as the [Pipeline Parity Project.](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/about/) They’ve been able to dig up the Kirkland & Ellis [Employment Arbitration Contract, ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaqiB8btErQno4qSQ8FCdfstGK04Qvd6sjBEzxzSQdQ/edit?usp=sharing)and as [Vail Kohnert-Yount](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/author/avk/)[,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaqiB8btErQno4qSQ8FCdfstGK04Qvd6sjBEzxzSQdQ/edit?usp=sharing) a Harvard 2L and member of the Project, notes:

Kirkland might be trying to keep its love affair with forced arbitration a secret, but we have the receipts.

So now that they’ve revealed what’s really behind the closed door of Kirkland’s employment contract they’re asking law students to #DumpKirkland until they do away with forced arbitration agreements for all employees:

[I] f Kirkland won’t stop its forced arbitration racket—and indeed, won’t even own up to it—it’s up to us to educate ourselves and our peers and take action.

That’s why we’re asking all the law students who are headed into recruitment season this year: Don’t interview with Kirkland & Ellis until they promise to stop making any of their employees—no associate, paralegal, custodian, or contractor—sign these coercive contracts.

This is our way of saying to Kirkland & Ellis and all other employers, dump your forced arbitration agreements, or we’ll #DumpKirkland and dump you too.

# Staff, Summer Program On Chopping Block At This Am Law 200 Firm
## Another firm feels the COVID-19 pinch.

Dickinson Wright, a firm that took the [128th spot](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=85&name=Dickinson-Wright) on the 2019 Am Law 200, is yet another Biglaw firm that is planning for the financial fallout from COVID-19. Like so many other of its peers, the firm has decided to institute austerity measures to minimize the harm of decreased revenues.

So what is going on at the firm? Tipsters report staff layoffs. The firm has also pulled the plug on its summer associate program (though everyone who was scheduled to participate will receive an offer). And the new batch of associates scheduled to start in the fall? Postponed until January 2021.

According to [reports](https://www.law.com/2020/04/30/pay-cuts-layoffs-and-more-how-law-firms-are-managing-the-pandemic/), the firm has issued the following statement about its austerity measures:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Our leadership has developed a tiered contingency plan for the potential of reduced revenues. This plan entails reducing discretionary spending, implementing an approximately 3% reduction in workforce, canceling our summer program yet providing everyone in that summer class an offer, and deferring our fall incoming class of associates to January.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

If you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Layoff Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the layoff alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each layoff, salary cut, or furlough announcement that we publish.

# Marc Kasowitz Writes Angry Emails And Everyone Completely Overreacts
## Kasowitz didn't owe anyone any apologies for his email.

Marc Kasowitz (screenshot via YouTube)

When a random stranger emailed Marc Kasowitz with the subject line,“Resign Now,” apparently Kasowitz knew that he had the tools and talent to discover exactly who his critic was! Even though it’s easier than ever before to anonymize oneself on the internet, Kasowitz must have had every confidence in his ability to backward-navigate all the potentially obscuring cover and make a positive identification. Then, just to show this stranger that the Kas is a master of email, he sent [a good natured reply](https://www.propublica.org/article/marc-kasowitz-trump-lawyer-threat-emails-maddow):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Oh. Well then.

It’s unclear what the most interesting wrinkle is here. It could be that before this email he sent the simple message “F*ck you,” complete with asterisk, which… why? But I think the “Watch your back , bitch,” with the unnecessary added space you’d expect from the [Predisent’s attorney](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/marc-kasowitz-takes-break-from-partying-at-trump-hotel-to-talk-to-the-press/), is the real winner here.

When this story broke yesterday afternoon, we received this statement from a spokesperson:

Mr. Kasowitz, who is tied up with client matters, said he intends to apologize to the writer of the email referenced in today’s ProPublica story.  While no excuse, the email came at the end of a very long day that at 10 pm was not yet over.   “The person sending that email is entitled to his opinion and I should not have responded in that inappropriate manner,” Mr. Kasowitz said.  “I intend to send him an email stating just that.  This is one of those times where one wishes he could reverse the clock, but of course I can’t.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
An apology? Really? I get that this is kind of pro forma in these situations, but Kasowitz didn’t owe this person anything. Oh, he was mean to someone? I can’t believe a major law firm attorney was — gasp! — mean to someone. You’re writing the lawyer for the president, put on some big kid pants! Did the guy expect Kas to respond, “Golly, I didn’t think of it that way before”?

There was some buzz about whether or not the email exchange constituted harassment, which is dumb. If Kasowitz emailed someone unsolicited and told them to “watch their back,” then that would come across as threatening, but as a response to someone calling him out — who cares? Look, we’ve had some fairly tough criticism of Kasowitz in these pages, but if we slid into his inbox and told him to resign he’d be well within his rights to hurl some invective.

Someone yapped at Kasowitz, and Kasowitz swung back. It probably wasn’t the most prudent thing to say in an email exchange because — [as the Trump administration is starting to realize](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/do-you-have-what-it-takes-to-be-a-great-defense-attorney/) — those are permanent records of one’s mistakes, but everyone needs to chill out and let a guy be human here. The only person who should care about this is Trump, who would have a legitimate complaint that his lawyer caused so much unnecessary negative attention, but Trump’s whole political strategy seems to be “create as much unnecessary negative attention as possible to numb the audience,” so he probably doesn’t even care. This Roy Cohn impersonation might even salve the reportedly [strained client relationship](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-is-waking-up-to-a-bad-morning/).

That said, Kasowitz [probably should resign](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/when-people-start-writing-about-you-destroying-your-firm-things-arent-going-well/) from this nightmare of a representation. I don’t mind being told to f*ck off on that one.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Discipline is the name of the game in most firms that outperform their peers. That means discipline in revenue generation and expense management. Given that the largest single expense for law firms is compensation, it makes sense to regularly manage capacity, and therefore control expenses, as a matter of course as demand and other drivers fluctuate.

— Kent Zimmermann, a consultant for law firm strategy and management at Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/12/18/proskauer-layoffs-underscore-string-of-big-law-cuts-in-2023/) on the reason why some law firms must conduct layoffs from time to time in order to maintain their status quo.

# First Major Biglaw Firm Matches The 2020 Cravath Bonus Scale
## It's bonus time at this leading law firm!

Less than an hour after [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) officially kicked off the 2020 bonus season by matching [Baker McKenzie’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) year-end bonus scale and sweetening the pot by matching the [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) special bonus scale, another elite law firm has jumped to match the market rate as quickly as possible.

Which firm is the first to match the official 2020 Biglaw bonus scale?

It’s worth mentioning that almost two months ago, Paul Weiss [refused](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/paul-weiss-wont-be-offering-fall-bonuses-and-associates-are-angry/) to match the Davis Polk fall bonuses because it “would not be appropriate,” seeing as the firm’s clients and others were “experiencing unprecedented economic trauma” because of the pandemic. And yet… here’s the firm, matching those very bonuses now, when coronavirus cases are worsening, all because Cravath did it first.

UPDATE: Yes, we know that in early October, Paul Weiss “pledge[d] to retain [its] position as a market leader in compensation, taking into account any special bonuses paid by [its] peer firms.” We wrote about that [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/paul-weiss-wont-be-offering-fall-bonuses-and-associates-are-angry/).

Here’s the Paul Weiss bonus scale:

Scott Barshay (courtesy of Paul, Weiss; © Matt Greenslade)

The largest story in the law firm world this week is top M&A lawyer [Scott Barshay’s](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/scott-barshay/) [surprise defection](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/) from [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cravath/) to [Paul, Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-garrison-llp/). Since the news emerged, we’ve heard different opinions about what he’s like to work for — but there’s no disagreement about his status as a leading corporate lawyer and the significance of his move.

There has been a fair amount of curiosity about how the deal for this dealmaker went down. Hence this follow-up story, peeling back the curtain a little on how the move got made.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
According to the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/dealbook/a-cravath-partner-moves-to-paul-weiss.html?ref=dealbook&_r=2), Barshay got to know PW chair Brad Karp and corporate department head Robert Schumer when he worked with Paul, Weiss defending Xerox against activist investor Carl Icahn. But according to [Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/meet-the-headhunter-who-placed-scott-barshay-at-paul-weiss/), the official overture that ultimately resulted in Barshay’s hiring came through a longtime legal recruiter, [Mark Rosen](http://www.markbruce.net/bios.htm) of [Mark Bruce International](http://www.markbruce.net/index.htm).

Rosen said that the deal came together fairly quickly as partner moves go, in about two months. As he told Casey Sullivan of [Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/meet-the-headhunter-who-placed-scott-barshay-at-paul-weiss/), in February of this year Rosen called Brad Karp and communicated Barshay’s willingness to meet up and talk transition. Subsequent meetings — some of them over meals at Le Bernardin, according to Michael de la Merced of [DealBook](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/dealbook/a-cravath-partner-moves-to-paul-weiss.html?ref=dealbook&_r=2) — culminated in Barshay’s lateral move.

Why did Scott Barshay make the move? According to Rosen, Barshay was “frustrated” or “not 100 percent happy” about some aspects of Cravath, and one of them was compensation. As we’ve [previously discussed](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/), Barshay stands to make a good bit more money under PW’s modified lockstep system compared to CSM’s pure lockstep system.

Indeed, as Julie Triedman noted in an [Am Law Daily piece](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202754085308/Rainmakers-Defection-Could-Test-Cravath-Lockstep-Model-?cn=20160405&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily%20Breaking%20News&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&slreturn=20160306170036), the Barshay move raises questions about the viability of a hard-line lockstep model in an increasingly competitive world for talent. I reached out to longtime legal recruiter [Sharon Mahn](http://www.mahnconsultingllc.com/), one of the industry observers contacted by Triedman, and Mahn had this to say of pure lockstep: “Although the lockstep model is not going away anytime soon, it is understandably hard for partners with big books of business to resist market factors that can reward them with higher salaries at competing firms. It is not always just about the money when a partner jumps ship to another platform, but eight-figure compensation is certainly a strong motivation, and that puts the lockstep model under pressure.”

Of course, Cravath and culturally similar firms like Cleary and Debevoise might turn their noses up at money as a motivator for a move. We summed up that view in a 2012 story, [Biglaw: It’s Not All About the Benjamins](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/).

In fairness to Paul, Weiss and to Scott Barshay, however, (1) PW is a fairly lockstep firm, with [90 percent of partners getting paid based on seniority](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202754085308/Rainmakers-Defection-Could-Test-Cravath-Lockstep-Model-?cn=20160405&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily%20Breaking%20News&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&slreturn=20160306170036), and (2) Barshay made his move mainly because of excitement over the PW platform and the chance to grow its practice, as opposed to comp. As Mark Rosen told Bloomberg, Barshay “felt it was a great opportunity. It was the right time, and coming up as the global head of M&A at Paul Weiss was very exciting.”

Lawyers can minimize the importance of compensation and talk about the importance of serving their clients. Legal recruiters can similarly talk about helping candidates advance their careers, but it’s probably fair to say that legal recruiting, as a sales-focused business that’s not a profession in the same way as law, is more (even if not all) about the benjamins.

So how much might Mark Rosen have made from this placement? I posed this question to [Sharon Mahn](http://www.mahnconsultingllc.com/), who as a recruiter has moved prominent partners and practice groups from firm to firm.

“The standard fee is usually 25 percent of the candidate’s first-year base compensation, although it could range to anywhere from 20 to 30 percent of overall compensation, including bonuses,” she said. “If a group moves, it could be a sliding scale of 25 percent for the first partner, 20 percent for the second partner, and so on.”

Let’s assume, on the conservative side, that Barshay is getting paid a base of $8 million and that Rosen is getting just 20 percent. That’s a cool $1.6 million. On the high end, say 30 percent of $10 million total compensation, that’s $3 million. The actual figure probably lies somewhere in between, perhaps in the $2 million range. But there are some other factors possibly at play here, according to Mahn.

“Mark [mentioned](https://bol.bna.com/meet-the-headhunter-who-placed-scott-barshay-at-paul-weiss/) that he was ‘on retainer’ for a couple of years with Paul Weiss,” Mahn noted. “Under the retainer agreement, Paul, Weiss might have paid him some money up front to conduct their searches, but might have paid less on the back end once a candidate was placed at the firm.”

“Paul Weiss may have also ‘capped’ all candidate placements,” she explained. “That’s a caveat inserted in many law firm fee agreements to ensure that the recruiter fee is not extraordinarily high when it comes to large groups, law firm mergers, or in this case, a candidate that is bringing an astronomical sum of business to the firm with overall compensation to match. The usual cap is $1 million, sometimes $2 million. But it’s also possible Paul, Weiss in this case could have waived the fee cap, as Barshay is a one of the top corporate partners in the industry with an enormous client following.”

The bottom line: it’s hard to say exactly how much Mark Rosen made from this placement, but it’s safe to say that his fateful February phone call culminated in a seven-figure pay day. That might be a lot better than billing thousands of hours over the course of a year to break the million-dollar mark as a typical partner.

But before you run off to become a legal recruiter, you should know that it’s hard work. As described in this prior post, [5 Reasons To Become A Legal Recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/09/5-reasons-to-become-a-legal-recruiter/), “Recruiting is not the easy money that it might sound like. You have to work hard every day to foster relationships and keep up with hundreds of people all the time. If you don’t like people, you won’t like recruiting. You also could go several months without a single placement….”

If you are entrepreneurial and can stomach that kind of risk, then recruiting might be right for you. But if you are risk-averse — indeed, if you went to law school precisely because of your risk aversion — you might prefer to stay right where you are, ignoring recruiters’ cold calls instead of making them.

# In-House Q&A: Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's Jennifer Lohse
## The foundation's GC weighs in on the in-house career path and the importance of making a difference.

Jennifer Lohse is general counsel at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation.

She also had the unique experience of starting in an in-house counsel role right out of law school, in order to build the legal department at a major health company from the ground up.

Lohse has a lot to share about the in-house experience, and some great advice for anyone searching for the ideal position.

(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)

Why don’t we start with a little bit about your background?

I went to St. Ben’s for undergrad and the University of St. Thomas for law school, graduated in 2005. But before I graduated, I worked for a company called Center for Diagnostic Imaging. I worked as their legislative/law intern.

The strange thing is, there wasn’t another lawyer there, but I worked in their government affairs space helping out with legislative sessions in different states, and doing some federal work. I’ve always been really interested in healthcare.

What was the genesis of that? Was there a particular event that precipitated that interest, or was it just always something you found fascinating?

Well, I had wanted to go to medical school. Then family events and life events led me to law school, which was what everyone was pushing me towards anyway.

I had done some internships, been a PCA at a group home, that sort of thing, all anticipating going to med school. But all my supervisors said I should really think about law school.

I didn’t know lawyers; I didn’t know anything about practicing law. I had experience with doctors, but I had no experience with lawyers. I was like, why is everybody pushing me this way?

Sure.

I sort of took the law school entrance exam on a whim, and actually more or less to get some people off my back about exploring that as an option. I ended up doing relatively well, well enough to apply for and get into a couple law schools. I ended up going to St. Thomas. It was probably a good move. We’re coming up on, oh, what is it, about 16 years later here?

Sometimes it’s best not to think about.

Ha, yeah. So, I started working at CDI while I was in law school. It was either my 1L year summer or just shortly after summer had ended.

I started going to committee hearings, writing different memos on pending legislation, that sort of thing. When I graduated, and passed the bar, they offered me an attorney position at CDI.

I probably should have said “no” as a brand-new baby lawyer. But I didn’t. I said “yes,” and became their first in-house lawyer. I continued to work in the government relations space, but expanded beyond that to eventually lead the legal department as we grew.

Beginning during the Recession we engaged in many years of significant acquisitions, eventually leading us to become a much larger company than when I had started. I developed the legal and compliance department along the way.

Eventually, I took over the risk management at the company as well. I got a lot of trial-by-fire experience.

It really sounds like it. That’s a very unique experience. Most in-house people come from a Biglaw firm and go in-house, you were kind of the opposite. Do you have an opinion on the biggest challenge you faced coming into an in-house position right out of law school like that?

The biggest challenge was that I didn’t have the practical knowledge that I needed. I spent quite a few years of my life completely scared out of my mind that I was going to make a huge mistake.

But I think the saving grace for me was that I had cultivated relationships with the right people, who let me vent to them, and express my concerns and my fears in a very nonjudgmental environment. They gave me the confidence to put one foot in front of the other and keep on going.

I found out I naturally like to lead. I like to lead on projects. I loved to put together the partnerships that we did at CDI.

The area of healthcare is very novel, and it’s very gray. It changes all the time. I was finding myself feeling like I needed better experience being a lawyer before putting these things together.

Then we had the new rules that came down to govern healthcare companies about that same time. I was learning this in real time with the vets. Then all of a sudden there are all these new healthcare regulations that were coming at us, and I was in the same boat that they all were in. We were figuring it out together.

As new rulings came down, we were rejiggering on partnerships and putting things together in different ways.

I bet you probably felt like you were at more of a disadvantage with the veterans than you actually were with all that new stuff coming down the pipeline. People can certainly pretend they know more than anyone else, but when it just came out, everyone knows about the same amount. At any rate, what was your favorite thing about having greater control over your department given that you were building it from the ground up?

I liked being able to keep some of the fun work in-house as my department grew. As we grew the department, another thing I really liked was working with other lawyers and helping them achieve what they wanted to do.

One of them started as a paralegal, and she earned her law degree, so we hired her as a lawyer. I loved that relationship of helping her develop, and helping her find what she really liked about her day-to-day work.

I noticed pretty early on that the legal department needed a strategic plan, along with the company’s strategic plan. I really enjoyed that planning aspect as well.

Now I understand you’re at a fairly well-known nonprofit. Why did you choose to go to Hazelden?

Yes, I’m general counsel at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation. I consternated about whether this was going backwards in my career after I had built up a department at a larger company.

Definitely I had started to think I wanted to work in a nonprofit setting though. I wasn’t actively looking when the opportunity at Hazelden came up, but this opportunity presented itself, and I thought, well, I might as well look into it and see what it’s about. It just seemed to really fit.

I’m a mom of two kids, and when I spend my time away from them, I want it to look a certain way. I certainly feel like I’m making a difference even from the legal department at Hazelden, which is absolutely saving people’s lives every day as an organization.

Feeling like you’re making a difference I think becomes more and more important the further along you get in the career. As opposed to just making money early on, or just making money for someone, anyway. Well, anything else you would like to add, or any parting advice you have to people coming up?

If I could leave them with anything, it would be to break the mold. There is no one pathway to get to your ideal position. It doesn’t have to be a big company. It doesn’t have to be the big firm to in-house pipeline.

Be open to opportunities that come up, and that fit your needs, your development needs, your lifestyle needs, that sort of thing. Because that is going to ultimately be the best test of whether that position is right for you.

I am particularly proud that many firm partners acted to support the career of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the wife of the late Marty Ginsburg, former well-known head of Weil’s premier tax department.

I knew through my practice several Senate Republicans, including Orrin Hatch of Utah, chair of the judiciary committee, and arranged for the senator to have lunch with myself and Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the judiciary committee advanced her nomination to become a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1980. I like to think I played a small part in helping the Ginsburgs navigate the arduous process of getting to the nation’s highest court. I am most proud of the fact that the firm and my partners are proud too.

— [Ira Millstein](https://www.weil.com/people/ira-millstein), a senior partner who just celebrated his 70th year at Weil Gotshal, reflecting on an accomplishment that he’s “particularly proud of,” in a recent interview with [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2021/09/23/in-70-years-at-weil-antitrust-partner-millstein-has-seen-legal-business-transform/). “I feel lucky enough to live at least to 95 years old and to look back at so many of the clients I work with and believe I helped in their own careers,” he said.

# Prestigious Litigation Boutique Announces Nationwide Salary Raises To $190K!!!
## These trial attorneys will now be earning top dollar. Congratulations!

Earlier today, we reported that [Desmarais had announced major salary moves](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/elite-ip-litigation-boutique-shatters-the-market-leaves-cravath-raises-in-the-dust/) in response to Cravath’s new salary scale. The firm was the second member of the $160K-Plus Club to publicly announce associate raises, preceded by [McKool Smith’s announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-member-of-the-160k-plus-club-raises-associate-salaries-nationwide/) yesterday. Thus afternoon, yet another member of that elite club has stepped up to the plate to announce changes to their already generous salary offerings.

Susman Godfrey, a firm known for recruiting associates exclusively from the ranks of former federal law clerks, including Supreme Court clerks, will raise salaries for first-year associates to $190,000, effective July 1. The firm’s salary scale tops out at $300K for sixth-year associates, which is $20K above the Cravath salary scale.

UPDATE (6/25/2016, 4:00 p.m.): Actually, Susman should be seen as matching rather than beating the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1). Because all Susman associates come to the firm with at least one year of clerkship experience, what Susman calls “first-year” associates in its press release are really “second-year” associates everywhere else, and Susman’s “sixth-year” associates are the equivalent of “seventh-year” associates at Cravath.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In a press release announcing the good news, managing partner [Stephen Susman](http://www.susmangodfrey.com/attorneys/stephen-d-susman/) said:

“We pay our associates top salaries and bonuses because we expect — and receive — the best from them,” said Stephen D. Susman, Susman Godfrey Managing Partner. “We are incredibly selective when hiring associates, with a talent pool hailing from the nation’s top law schools. In addition, we only hire law students who’ve clerked for a judge in the federal court system, as it’s the best training for a young trial attorney.”

Susman continued: “We’ve found that giving associates substantive responsibility, making them privy to the firm’s financials, and letting them vote — on an equal standing with partners — on virtually all firm decisions, have enabled us to recruit and retain better lawyers.”

Congratulations to all associates at Susman & Godfrey! The firm typically pays out beaucoup year-end bonus bucks that far exceed industry standards, so we’re sure your student loans will be paid off in no time!

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

Powerful legal data products hold the promise of making your litigation arguments truly hit home,
or of helping you skillfully negotiate transactions, or even of growing your firm’s business pipeline.

But how can you ensure you’re accurately discerning the stories these enormous bodies of data can tell? And what pitfalls should you be on the
lookout for in leveraging data to bolster your practice?

Join us on December 10th at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT to learn how — and how not — to skillfully integrate data analytics into your day-to-day, ultimately increasing your negotiation, litigation, and business development prowess.

The discussion will feature:

- An overview of how law firms of all sizes can use legal data to improve numerous aspects of their operations.
- Pitfalls to look for when analyzing data for use in a variety of contexts.
- An in-depth look at data-driven tools to refine your practice in state courts.

# Being Married To A Lawyer Isn't All It's Cracked Up To Be
## This lawyer's spouse said, 'I wouldn’t wish this half-life on anyone.'

Does it ever get better? [My husband is] a lovely man and he earns a good salary but I’m twenty or so years in and the work never stops. I mean never. Not on holiday. Not during births. Not during house moves. …

I am getting a bit tired of being at the bottom of the priority list which appears to be: work, children (quite rightly), dog, household necessities, life admin, wife. Except by the time he gets time to focus on me he is so tired his eyes literally glaze over when we speak. I try not to take it personally.

— a lawyer’s spouse writing a [rather candid post](https://www.legalcheek.com/2021/02/i-wouldnt-wish-this-half-life-on-anyone-mumsnet-discusses-life-married-to-a-lawyer/) about what seems to be a one-sided marriage on [Mumsnet](https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/relationships/4163205-Those-of-you-married-to-a-lawyer), a UK parenting forum. While some responded with thoughtful advice, others familiar with this woman’s plight referred to it as “the nature of the beast,” and others still called her husband a “workaholic.”

# New Biglaw Partner Class Is Pretty Encouraging
## Women face hurdles reaching partnership all across Biglaw, but White & Case's new class breaks that trend.

The legal profession is notoriously stingy when it comes to advancing women. Earlier this week, we got a look at exactly how stingy when the National Association of Women Lawyers [released a new study](https://www.nawl.org/p/cm/ld/fid=1163), summarized in [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/10/10/new-report-finds-female-path-to-law-firm-partnership-a-sluggish-crawl/), finding that among the Am Law 200, women comprise a mere 20 percent of the equity partner population despite entering the profession as roughly 47 percent of associates.

Which is what makes today’s partner promotion announcement from White & Case so encouraging. Flipping through the bios of the 41 attorneys promoted to partnership this year, roughly 46 percent of whom are women, placing the firm… right in line with the profession’s demographics. That’s not going to solve decades of underrepresentation across the entire Biglaw landscape, but if every firm could follow White & Case’s lead, it would go a long way toward setting things right.

White & Case Chairman Hugh Verrier notes that:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This year’s class is the largest in our history, which illustrates the level of talent we have cultivated within the Firm. As we grow the White & Case partnership through both internal promotions and lateral hires, we are poised to deliver on our 2020 Strategy.

The 2020 strategy involves growing numbers in the U.S. and London, and perusing the new class it appears as though around 61 percent of the new partners come from those locations so that tracks.

Congratulations to all the new partners at White & Case. You can check out the complete list on the next page.

# Lawyer Writes Epic Departure Memo... Actually Seems Happy?
## Woah, this lawyer actually seems sad to leave his job.

Like a unicorn in the wild, we have here something I never thought I’d see while working for Above the Law: a lawyer who is happy with his job. Okay, sure, this lawyer is on his way out of the firm he spent over a decade slaving away at, but he seems genuinely sad to go. Perhaps it is all the adrenaline left over from handing in his notice, but on this cold Friday morning I choose to see it as a sign. A sign that beyond all the drudgery and long hours, some people really enjoy their life in a law firm. Sure, I’ve only read about those people online, and never met one in person, but this departure memo gives me hope that it is real.

We received the email below from an attorney heading out of the door. Littered with graphics and memes, it shows law firms don’t have to be the place where humor goes to die. So while you’re busy fantasizing about your exit from your firm (flame on!), this is a nice reminder that is it possible to leave with grace and the last laugh. Enjoy!

When I received an offer 11 years ago to be a summer clerk at Bracewell (& Patterson), I had no idea it would become such a large part of my life…

 

…which has made today, my last at the firm, bittersweet.

Although I will miss working with each of you, I am looking forward to the challenge of starting a new phase of my career as a partner at Wick Phillips. 

But before I go, I want to take a moment to thank you…


First, to Special Services for your tireless behind-the-scenes support. Enormous print jobs, late-day rush requests, and my annual Christmas avalanche of Amazon packages – nothing seems to faze you.


To all the admins, assistants, paralegals, and staff: thank you for making us look like competent lawyers…even when we don’t make it easy for you. We would not be nearly as successful without your support.

And finally, to my fellow attorneys, thank you for educating me through your example that being a good person is essential to being a great lawyer.  Bracewell has been a collaborative (and fun) place to learn how to practice law.

 

I wish all of you the absolute best. My contact information is included in the attached vCard.  Save it. Use it. Stay in touch.

As law firms struggle to demonstrate to clients and their own attorneys that they take societal ills seriously, Kathryn’s starting to notice some patterns in the statements getting released. Meanwhile, Joe is covering the state bar exams, where many are continuing to insist on shoving hundreds of people into small rooms in July and making applicants sign away their rights for the privilege of exposing themselves to disease.

# Biglaw Firm Starts The Weekend Off On The Right Foot By Announcing Raises, Bonuses
## It's Friday, Friday, associates getting paid on Friday!

One by one, Biglaw bonuses and raises continue to be announced. Wondering when your firm may make its move? Some large law firms are still deciding if they can “afford” to raise salaries (hint: they very likely can), but we certainly hope your big payday will be coming soon.

In the meantime, we’ve now confirmed that Kramer — a firm that brought in $421,443,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 102 in the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, effective January 1, 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016+ – $435,000
Kramer Levin is also matching the Cravath bonus scale, and this is what year-end bonuses will look like at the firm, to be paid on February 15, 2024:

- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016+ – $115,000
Members of the Class of 2023 will receive an annualized bonus of $15,000, prorated to October 2, 2023.

Congratulations to everyone at Kramer Levin!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# Tipsters Help ATL Be A Positive Force In The Legal Industry
## Above the Law and our tipsters: partners in building a better legal world.

A few weeks ago, I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts, the “Thinking Like a Lawyer” podcast produced by Above the Law. Everyone should listen to the podcast, not just because the banter between the hosts is genuinely entertaining but because the podcast is a good way to be apprised of legal news stories you might have missed during the preceding week.

During the podcast, the hosts discussed a wild legal news story I could not believe I missed and conveyed that it was thanks to the help of Above the Law tipsters that the story got attention from legal news outlets. This made me think how Above the Law can be a positive force within the legal industry with the help of solid tipsters, since tipsters can help call out bad behavior and this incentivizes the powers that be to behave themselves better.

I have been reading Above the Law for nearly a decade and a half, and the news outlet has broken a number of stories within the legal profession during that time. Even when I was in law school, there was a sense that people should not go too crazy at school or while they worked as summer associates since they might end up on Above the Law. One year, a group of law students produced a funny law review video on this topic, but for the life of me, I can’t find it now! I am not sure that any of my classmates changed their behaviors for fear of being on Above the Law, but it was definitely something that people discussed at school.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
When I started working as an associate in Biglaw, people also discussed how the firm and partners might be more likely to follow good practices for fear of being featured on Above the Law. The firm at which I worked had made the pages of Above the Law for all kinds of conduct that possibly crossed lines, and I have to believe that partners were thinking about the bad publicity of an Above the Law story when they made certain decisions.

Over the years, tipsters have informed Above the Law about all kinds of bad conduct at law firms and other facets of the legal industry that might go under the radar for other news sources. For instance, many writers at Above the Law have publicized stealth layoffs at law firms, a situation in which a law firm does not expressly tell associates they are fired but convinces them they should find work elsewhere. Moreover, many articles have discussed how law firms might blame layoffs on performance issues rather than economic reasons to save face even if this makes it harder for a lawyer to find work. I have to believe that these stories, and the publicity that surrounds them, might move the needle for law firm partners and convince them that they should adopt better practices not only to treat associates better but to avoid negative publicity.

Above the Law has an amazing tipster network. Before the pandemic, I went to a bunch of Above the Law events in New York City and met tons of people who discussed how they had provided tips to Above the Law. These folks were not just lawyers. People tend to forget that the legal industry contains numerous kinds of professionals — law firm administrators, secretaries, paralegals, law librarians, and others — who are just as likely to be consumers of news about the legal industry and dish information about lawyers and law firms that might make the pages of Above the Law.

Above the Law frequently solicits tips, but I just wanted to put in my own two cents and relate that tips not only help Above the Law provide solid content to readers but also has a positive impact on the legal industry. Through each period of turmoil within the legal industry over the past decade and a half or so, Above the Law has been there, writing articles based on tips that have called people out for policies and practices that are unfair or undignified. Lawyers and law firms might hold themselves to a higher standard when interacting with employees and running their shops so that they do not end up on the pages of Above the Law.

However, Above the Law is only effective as a check on the powers that be within the legal industry if it has solid tipsters to furnish information. As a result, people should be encouraged to provide tips to Above the Law not only because it may lead to solid content for the website but since this can also impose checks on managers within the legal profession.

# Am Law 100 Firm Lassos A Cravath Match For Associates

One by one, Biglaw firms are doing the inevitable during the 2022 associate salary wars: matching Cravath’s generous new compensation grid.

The latest firm to do so is one that already raised salaries just last week. Texas-based Vinson & Elkins — a firm that brought in $782,352,000 gross revenue in 2020, making it No. 59 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — [adopted the Davis Polk salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/vinson-raise-2022/) on February 24, and here they are again with a Cravath match. This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:


The firm’s salary increases apply to their U.S. and London offices. They’re retroactive to January 1, and associates will see their new compensation in their March 15 paychecks. Congratulations, again!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Vinson & Elkins.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

## Uh-oh. Which firm will be the next to announce?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Those firms thinking along those lines don’t want to be outliers and are hoping to see others thinking similarly.

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/people/kent-zimmermann/), a law firm management consultant with the Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/22/more-first-year-deferrals-likely-as-firms-grapple-with-dormant-corporate-practices-large-incoming-class-sizes/) on the possibility of more deferrals for first-year associates. Zimmermann said that some firms are working on plans to push their start dates back to January, but no one wants to be the first to announce. [Gunderson Dettmer](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/) and [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) previously announced plans to defer their first-years.

At this point in the bonus cycle, Biglaw observers are well aware of what the elite firm are paying to the associates for their year end bonuses. The scale was set by Milbank over a month ago, and quickly confirmed by Cravath and now that’s what most big firms will be giving their associates.

That’s just what happened at Cahill Gordon & Reindel. As part of their bonus announcement they indicated that they pay “special bonuses” ranging from $5,000 to $40,000 for “outstanding individual effort.” Nice!

I think that’s a very significant finding and points to the fact that we’re falling short of what we could be offering people.At a high level, that is something that is going to repel people from the legal profession.

— [Patrick Krill](https://www.prkrill.com/about), an attorney who is a certified alcohol and drug counselor and works as a consultant to numerous law firms on mental health and substance abuse issues, [commenting](https://www.law.com/2020/02/19/lawyers-reveal-true-depth-of-the-mental-health-struggles/) on the fact that when asked, “Do you think the profession has had a negative effect on your mental health over time?” 74 pecent of the more than 3,800 respondents to [ALM’s Mental Health and Substance Abuse Survey](https://www.law.com/2020/02/19/lawyers-reveal-true-depth-of-the-mental-health-struggles/) said yes.

# In-House Leaders Say Lawyers At These Biglaw Firms Are Client Service 'All-Stars'
## Which firms -- and which lawyers -- came out on top?

Which Biglaw attorneys are most beloved by general counsel for their superior client service? Thanks to a brand new ranking, we’re about to find out.

The BTI Consulting Group set out to find which lawyers handled in-house client service with ease, adding them to their annual list of “all-stars.” To compile the ranking, between January 2022 and March 2023, BTI spoke with more than 350 in-house decision-makers at large organizations with over $700 million in annual revenue.

[Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1687928?nl_pk=e87be47f-5f1d-47f6-9e89-095ce13995e4) has some coverage on BTI’s annual ranking, with additional details here:

BTI’s president, Michael Rynowecer, told Law360 that many of the companies that nominated attorneys for the report expressed an appreciation for lawyers who can anticipate what their clients need and provide it quickly and efficiently.

“Clients are beyond to their eyeballs in work,” Rynowecer said. “So they’ve come to really value the attorneys who really, at an operating level, know what they need and just offer up those resources.”

Almost 300 attorneys were named to this year’s list, but which firms do they hail from? According to [Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1687928?nl_pk=e87be47f-5f1d-47f6-9e89-095ce13995e4), these are the firms where at least five lawyers were named by in-house client:

- Jones Day: 13

Congratulations to Jones Day and Gibson Dunn for leading the pack on being client service all-stars, and an even bigger congratulations to all of the attorneys who were named by more than one client. You’ve proven yourselves to be outstanding when it comes to making corporate clients happy, and that’s worth celebrating.
