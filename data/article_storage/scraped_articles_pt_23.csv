Which Biglaw firms are most beloved by general counsel for their superior client service? In 2023, the waters were a bit rough for firms, and client service apparently took a nosedive. Some firms, however, were still up to snuff when it came to pleasing their clients, and the BTI Consulting Group set out to find which firms handled the task with ease in its latest ranking, the Client Service A-Team. In case you’re unfamiliar with this ranking, it measures the top 30 law firms corporate counsel identify as delivering the very best in terms of client service.

To compile the ranking, BTI Consulting spoke with more than 300 in-house decision-makers who were asked to name firms that excelled in 17 different client-service-related activities, including important things like: mobilizing resources quickly, fielding the absolute best team, quickly assessing the situation, a commitment to help, delivering value for the dollar, client focus, and understanding the client’s business.

So, which firms are considered the best of the best when it comes to client service? Per BTI Consulting, the firms that made the latest top 30 ranking performed 9 to 15 times better than the typical law firm in terms of client service. As the report notes, “The law firms delivering superior client service are crushing it — and will continue to crush it.” Why’s that? “It is easier to keep upping your client service game if you are already good.”

Here are the top 30 firms that made the [Client Service A-Team](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/clients-single-out-the-bti-client-service-30-2024-law-firms-best-at-client-service), whose names were mentioned most often across all categories:

- Kirkland
- DLA Piper
- Jones Day
- Reed Smith
- Ropes & Gray
- Gibson Dunn
- Arnold & Porter
- King & Spalding
- Littler
- Ogletree
- McGuireWoods
- Covington
- Baker McKenzie
- Foley & Lardner
- Jackson Lewis
- Davis Polk
- Jones Walker
- Faegre Drinker
- Sheppard Mullin
- McDermott
- Skadden
- Duane Morris
- Hogan Lovells
- Perkins Coie
- BakerHostetler
- Dentons
- Morgan Lewis
- Troutman Pepper
- Mintz
- Wilson Sonsini
Kirkland & Ellis is the leader of the pack once again, after kicking Jones Day out of the top spot following a six-year stint there. [Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1823890) (sub. req.) has additional details:

This year’s report is the second in a row in which Kirkland was the top-ranked firm, and marks its 13th appearance among the Top 10.

“Corporate counsel note Kirkland’s continued improvement in keeping clients informed and dealing with unexpected changes — showcasing Kirkland & Ellis’ deep understanding of today’s business needs and ability to adapt to new circumstances,” the report said.

If attorneys at your firm make more of an effort to better understand your clients’ businesses, then you may find your place of work on this list next time around. Congratulations to all 30 firms that made it to the highest ranks of the Client Service A-Team. You’ve proven yourselves to be outstanding when it comes to making corporate clients happy, and that’s worth celebrating.

Thousands of votes were cast, so it’s fair to say our 2021 holiday card contest was a great success. The race to the finish line wasn’t even close — with 55% of the vote, our top contender was a runaway winner, separated from the second-place finisher by 22 percentage points.

Our winner joins the company of previous holiday card contest winners:

# Top Firms Build Bigger Gap Over The Field... Like They Do Every Quarter

Mid-tier firms are left looking.

It must be Spring.

Flowers are blooming, birds are chirping, and the top Biglaw firms are obliterating the competition in every conceivable metric. Perhaps that last one isn’t so much a sign of Spring as the refrain of every single Biglaw financial report for the last few years.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group’s first quarter results are finalized and David Altuna, Citi Private Bank’s Law Firm Group client adviser, and Gretta Rusanow, its head of advisory services, have [taken to the pages of Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202785849995/Citi-Biggest-Firms-Fared-Best-in-First-Quarter/) to tell us what we all already instinctively knew: the top firms are killing it:

Analyzing the industry results by revenue size, we noted that Am Law 1-50 firms outperformed the other segments in top-line growth. They saw the greatest growth in revenue (6.5 percent) and inventory (4.4 percent), driven by the highest growth in demand (2.4 percent) and billing rates (4.2 percent).

[It’s good to be king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SF1iLXSQto). The survey also notes that these firms felt the biggest expense increases, but who cares when you’re already so far ahead of the game. And more importantly, who cares when you’re slowly driving your competition under:

Most notable was the very challenging first quarter for Am Law Second 100 firms. They saw the largest decline in demand (4.1 percent) and the lowest revenue growth (2.4 percent) among the Am Law 200 segments. This segment also experienced more pronounced levels of dispersion and volatility than all other segments. Seventy-one percent of Second Hundred firms saw demand decline (compared to 38 percent of Am Law 1-50 firms), while 65 percent experienced volatility. Heading into the second quarter of 2017, Second Hundred firms also have the lowest growth in inventory (0.3 percent).

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
David Cowen recently asked [who among the Am Law 200 won’t be here in the next 5-10 years](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/biglaw-divided-on-how-to-deal-with-technology/). Quarter after quarter of those results piling up and we’ll have to start to really wonder.

The legal industry as a whole continues to see tepid demand:

Revenue grew 4.9 percent during the first quarter of 2017. While total demand was up a modest 0.4 percent, lawyer demand, the portion that commands the higher rates, was up a healthy 1.9 percent. Billing rate increases, the primary driver of revenue growth since 2010, were up 4 percent, stronger than the 3 to 3.5 percent range we have seen throughout the post-recession years. A strong collections effort also aided revenue growth, as the collection cycle shortened by 1.6 percent.

When clients [publicly balked at paying higher rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/) last summer, we all laughed heartily behind the scenes. Cravath’s still going to Cravath after all. But there was cause for real concern. Because while anyone looking to hire one of the top firms in the country for a matter is going to pull that trigger regardless of cost, it’s those mid-tier firms that are going to hurt. There are just [too many small, niche firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/general-counsel-increasingly-dumping-the-top-biglaw-firms/) out there ready to do the job. To that point, Citi Private Bank noted that niche/boutique firms were the only segment outside the Am Law 50 to see positive demand growth.

Behemoth firm structures really only work for the very top. As much as the next-tier firms want to be just like the top 50, it’s time to do some serious reckoning with the books and realize that they’re never going to be as desired as those firms and if they aren’t as cheap as their leaner rivals, there’s just not a lot of room for them.

# D.C. Heavyweight Announces Tentative Future Raises

Maybe there’s a raise in here…

UPDATE (7/8/16 3:51 p.m.): Read below for some additional clarifying insight on what happened in this meeting… Kay Nash, did say that raises are likely, but also said that it would likely apply ONLY to junior associates, i.e. 1st-3rd years

While most associates learn about their raises from a straightforward announcement, some get these cryptic “heads up” talks. I suppose it puts minds at ease to know that management isn’t playing possum about market trends. But it only introduces another layer of stress as the associates start to wonder about the eventual details of the announcement. And if it’s not set in stone, these announcements run the risk of even more disappointed associates on the back end.

No, it’s always better to pull this one off like a band-aid.

But Wiley Rein opted for the tentative teaser announcement…

Yesterday, Wiley Rein’s CFO held a session open to associates and summers called “Business of Law 101.” At the start of the session… our head of legal talent, said that she knew we were all “very interested” in associate compensation and said, “As I stand here today, I believe it is likely that we will be moving” but added that the firm is “carefully evaluating” the situation. Obviously, not a sure thing, but it would be very odd if they let [her] make an announcement like that and then changed their minds. Associates are very anxious to know if we will match, so I guess this was an attempt to calm the nerves. We were also painted very rosy pictures of the firm’s finances.

If the firm boasted about its finances and then turned around and didn’t act, that would be some varsity-level trolling. So let’s go ahead and put a marker on Wiley Rein as a firm very likely to match in the next few weeks.

UPDATE (7/8/16 3:51 p.m.): Ah, but what kind of a match? Another tipster who heard the statement had this to add:

[She] did say that raises are likely, but also said that it would likely apply ONLY to junior associates, i.e. 1st-3rd years.

Hmm. If that’s true, legal recruiters may have a new target in a few weeks.

Also, we have a challenge to the description of the firm’s finances as “rosy”:

I would NOT describe the picture painted by the CFO (former A&P CFO) as “rosy.” The firm does not appear to have much debt, but she seemed to lament the fact that we are below our peers for realization rates and that although we are not highly leveraged (approx 60 associates in a 270-attorney firm), this is hurting the firm’s profitability

# Lawyerly Lairs: A Pioneering Cravath Partner's $8 Million Aerie

Christine Beshar

If you’re not familiar with the inspiring story of [Christine Beshar](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/05/mother-at-law-cravaths-first-woman-partner/), you should be. She was the first woman partner at the venerable firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, as well as one of the first women partners at any Biglaw firm.

An immigrant from Germany, Beshar first began working in the law firm world as a switchboard operator (millennials, [Google it](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS453US458&ei=SqzwWv7XHObn5gL0h4foDQ&q=switchboard+operator&oq=switchboard+operator&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71k1l8.0.0.0.4276.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.nbFikvSKGnU)). She later worked for a different law firm as a librarian, before making the jump to lawyer.

Where did Beshar [go to law school?](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-remarkable-career-of-cravaths-first-woman-partner/) Sorry, trick question — she didn’t. After “reading for the bar” (i.e., apprenticing) for a few years, she took the New York bar exam in 1959 and passed on her first try.

Beshar joined Cravath in 1964 and made partner seven years later, in 1971. Being the first woman partner at Cravath, and one of the first female partners in Biglaw generally, wasn’t easy. But Beshar pushed for changes to make it easier for the women who would follow in her footsteps, as recounted in her [New York Times obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/obituaries/christine-beshar-trailblazing-lawyer-dies-at-88.html):

Almost 20 years [after making partner,] she pushed Cravath to become the first major New York firm to open its own child-care center for its working parents, an idea she had proposed. It began in 1989, after the firm had moved to midtown Manhattan from downtown, as an on-site backup service available to employees when other child-care arrangements fell through.

Mrs. Beshar’s proposal had been born of necessity. She had taken only a week or two of vacation time after the birth of each of her children, and one day her son’s babysitter failed to show up.

As reflected in her efforts to improve Cravath as a workplace, Beshar was very devoted to the firm. She practiced trust and estates law at Cravath for decades, right up until her passing. (Although she retired from the partnership in 1999, she continued to advise clients on T&E issues as senior counsel.)

Beshar [passed away](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-remarkable-career-of-cravaths-first-woman-partner/) in [January](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/obituaries/christine-beshar-trailblazing-lawyer-dies-at-88.html), at the age of 88, and a few years after her husband [Robert](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=170721836), who passed away in 2014. (Speaking of Cravath partners passing away, note the update to [this post](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/lawyers-apparently-perform-this-weird-ritual-during-cravath-partner-funerals/) — yes, there’s a special partner procession or walk, but there’s no ritual chant.)


120 East End Avenue

This brings us to today’s Lawyerly Lair. Christine and Robert Beshar raised their four children in a magnificent, 14-room apartment at 120 East End Avenue, one of New York City’s finest co-ops (and one of Tom Wolfe’s so-called [“good buildings”](http://www.frontporchllc.com/2008/09/what-are-new-yorks-good-buildings/)). But now that both Beshars have passed away, the Beshar estate is selling the residence.

And what a residence it is! Per the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/realestate/family-of-christine-beshar-trailblazing-lawyer-selling-co-op.html):

The apartment, which offers striking park and river vistas from its many floor-to-ceiling windows, is roughly 5,250 square feet, with five bedrooms and six and a half baths.

The unit has a private elevator landing that opens to a stately gallery with a black-and-white checkered floor and a powder room.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Super-broker [Serena Boardman](https://www.sothebyshomes.com/nyc/agents/serena.boardman?page=1&tab=sale), of Sotheby’s International Realty (of course), [told the Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/realestate/family-of-christine-beshar-trailblazing-lawyer-selling-co-op.html) in March that the asking price would be $8.95 million. But if you look at the [current version of the listing](https://www.sothebyshomes.com/nyc/sales/00112125-120-East-End-Avenue-Apt-11A-New-York-NY-10028), you’ll see that it’s now on the market for $7.95 million. What a bargain!

(In case you couldn’t tell, that was tongue in cheek. Given the [softness](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-yorks-luxury-real-estate-market-is-experiencing-a-correction-2018-04-03) in the Manhattan market, especially in the $3 million and up segment, major markdowns are quite common. Also keep in mind that the Beshar apartment comes with monthly maintenance charges of $10,485, plus real estate taxes.)

Whether it’s worth $8 million or $7 million or $6 million, it’s an absolutely gorgeous apartment. Let’s take a look around, shall we?

# Lawyers' Mental Health Suffers When They're Viewed Only As Billing Machines By Their Firms

Take a look at your evaluation process, your mentoring process, your work allocation process, your internal communications—all of it. What’s the message? Do people feel like you just care about their about billable hours, or do you actually care about how good of a lawyer and a person they are?

— Patrick Krill, an attorney who advises legal employers on wellness issues, in an interview with [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/lawyer-mental-health-suffers-when-employers-value-only-money-study-says-2022-06-09/) discussing a new study that he co-authored on the [“connections between lawyer well-being and employer values.”](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/12/6/177) The peer-reviewed study — said to be the first empirical analysis of its kind — was published in the June edition of the scientific journal Behavioral Sciences. The results of the study revealed that lawyers who say their employers value them for their talent, skill, and humanity have better physical and mental health than those whose employers value them for their productivity and financial worth.

Woohoo! Way to celebrate the start of the weekend, Akin Gump!

This afternoon — just in time for happy hour — the firm announced their 2018 bonus schedule. As expected, the elite firm mirrored [the market standard for bonuses set by Cravath last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/). And while the bonus schedule may not shock any market observers, it still is a nice thank you for all the hard work associates did over the course of this year.

The bonus scale Akin will be giving their associates:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Class of 2018 – $15,000 (pro-rated)

Class of 2015 – $50,000

Class of 2012 – $90,000
Class of 2011 – $100,000
Class of 2010 – $100,000

PLUS — if you’ve been extra special good this year, the firm is willing to kick you some extra cash:

Those associates and counsel whose performance and productivity is deemed extraordinary, will receive additional bonus amounts ranging from $5,000 – $25,000 above the market level for their class.

# Elizabeth Wurtzel, Literary Lioness And Lawyer, Dies At 52
## The famed memoirist -- a Yale Law graduate, former Boies Schiller associate, and staple of ATL's pages -- belonged to the legal as well as literary community.

Elizabeth Wurtzel (photo by me, taken at a party I hosted years ago)

Elizabeth Wurtzel, the celebrated writer who skyrocketed to fame with her 1994 memoir, [Prozac Nation](https://amzn.to/2us07gN), [passed away today](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/books/elizabeth-wurtzel-dead.html) at a hospital here in Manhattan. As her husband, Jim Freed, told the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/elizabeth-wurtzel-prozac-nation-author-who-spurred-a-memoir-boom-dies-at-52/2020/01/07/fc1a040e-2fcf-11ea-91fd-82d4e04a3fac_story.html), the immediate cause of death was leptomeningeal disease (cancer spreading to the cerebrospinal fluid); the more long-term cause was breast cancer, which Wurtzel had [struggled with](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/elizabeth-wurtzel-the-breast-cancer-gene-and-me.html) over the years. She was 52.

Wurtzel became famous for her writing — Prozac Nation, two other books, numerous magazine and newspaper pieces — but as longtime readers of Above the Law know, she was also a lawyer. She [graduated from Yale Law School](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28wurtzel.html) and worked for a time with David Boies, her mentor in the legal world, at Boies Schiller Flexner.

I got to know Elizabeth through writing about her for ATL. Our coverage of her was not always adoring — for example, we covered her [failing the New York bar exam](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/11/elizabeth-wurtzel-wow-really/) (which she [subsequently passed](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/04/congratulations-to-elizabeth-wurtzel/)) — but she took it all in stride. To be honest, I think part of her just enjoyed the attention.

At some point over the years, we became friends. Elizabeth had great confidence (critics might call it arrogance), as well as a certain elitist streak, and I think she appreciated the fact that we shared two prestigious alma maters.

I’m embarrassed to admit that we were not in touch at the time of her death (and I had no idea she was sick again). When I last saw her, over dinner at an Italian restaurant near her apartment that she frequented, she was in good health and fine form. She shared with us, as only she could do, the remarkable story about her family that she subsequently turned into a buzz-generating [New York Magazine essay](https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/elizabeth-wurtzel-on-discovering-the-truth-about-her-parents.html).

It’s always difficult to write about a complicated person after their passing — and it’s even more daunting when that person was, like Elizabeth Wurtzel, an acclaimed memoirist. When I learned of her death this morning, I [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/DavidLat/status/1214584298147401730) a few descriptors — “fiercely intelligent, frequently infuriating, forever inimitable” — but the best authority on Lizzie Wurtzel was, well, herself.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I like how her longtime friend, the writer David Samuels, described her to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/books/elizabeth-wurtzel-dead.html): “Lizzie’s literary genius rests not just in her acres of quotable one-liners, but in her invention of what was really a new form, which has more or less replaced literary fiction — the memoir by a young person no one has ever heard of before. It was a form that Lizzie fashioned in her own image, because she always needed to be both the character and the author.”

And Lizzie often needed to be the center of attention — a quality not uncommon among memoirists, but one that sometimes made her exhausting to hang out with. She was extremely opinionated — and often right, but no less opinionated when not. She didn’t always show the best judgment — again, something she [openly admitted](https://www.thecut.com/2013/01/elizabeth-wurtzel-on-self-help.html) in her writing — and found herself in constant scrapes. (David Boies was not just her boss and mentor, but also her frequent white knight; as Elizabeth marveled to me on more than one occasion, he rode to her rescue numerous times over the years, never one to abandon a friend in need.)

As she would be the first to admit, Elizabeth Wurtzel was not a perfect person — but her great qualities lie beyond dispute as well. She was brilliant and beautiful, which was what first made her famous, but she was also, on a more personal level, compassionate and courageous — reflected in how bravely she handled her fight with cancer, which she memorably [described](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wd43mb/and-now-this-678) as, “like many things that happen to women, mostly a pain in the ass.” She used her public platform and powerful voice to raise awareness about breast cancer and to advocate testing for the BRCA genetic mutation, aka [“the breast cancer gene.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/elizabeth-wurtzel-the-breast-cancer-gene-and-me.html)

Although she will be most remembered for her writing, Elizabeth Wurtzel exhibited two qualities that we seek from lawyers at their best. First, she had a formidable intellect, including an ability to think outside the proverbial box and challenge conventional wisdom — something she always had, but honed while working for Boies.

Second, and most importantly, she had a strong sense of fairness and a passionate commitment to justice. Few things could get her more exercised in conversation than perceived unfairness or injustice. The case she worked on the most at BSF involved seeking justice for a family whose son was killed by terrorists — terrorists who were, the suit alleged, funded by proceeds laundered through a major bank.

# Jay-Z Declares War... Against The Lack Of Diversity In The Arbitration World
## Could Hova be the savior of diversity in the world of ADR?

Mandatory arbitration goes well beyond Biglaw. It’s not only required of [hapless summer associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/which-biglaw-firms-still-require-summer-associates-to-sign-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) and powerful partners, but it’s also a staple of commercial contracts — including ones involving boldface names. When it comes to being dragged into arbitration, celebrities are… just like us.

But celebrities are in a better position to fight back against unfairness in arbitration proceedings. This morning in New York Supreme Court, Shawn Carter aka Jay-Z filed a very interesting petition to stay arbitration in his [ongoing business and intellectual-property disputes](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/loose-threads-jay-z-roc-nation-and-reliance-on-an-implied-license/) with Iconix, purchaser of the rights to his ROCAWEAR fashion line.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Here’s the core of his argument, from the [memorandum of law in support of his petition](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/jay-z-declares-war-against-the-lack-of-diversity-in-the-arbitration-world/2/) (posted in full on the next page):

Through this proceeding, Petitioners seek a preliminary and permanent stay of an ongoing arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) necessitated by AAA procedures that violate New York law and render the otherwise applicable arbitration clause void as against public policy….

When Mr. Carter began reviewing arbitrators on the AAA’s Search Platform… he was confronted with a stark reality: he could not identify a single African-American arbitrator on the “Large and Complex Cases” roster, composed of hundreds of arbitrators, that had the background and experience to preside over the Arbitration. After repeated requests to the AAA for diverse arbitrators with expertise in complex commercial law, the AAA was able to provide only three neutrals it identified as African-American: two men—one of whom was a partner at the law firm representing Iconix in this arbitration and thus had a glaringly obvious conflict of interest—and one woman.

The AAA’s lack of African-American arbitrators with the expertise necessary to arbitrate “Large and Complex Cases” came as a surprise to Petitioners, in part because of the AAA’s advertising touting its diversity. This blatant failure of the AAA to ensure a diverse slate of arbitrators for complex commercial cases is particularly shocking given the prevalence of mandatory arbitration provisions in commercial contracts across nearly all industries, which undoubtedly include minority owned and operated businesses. The AAA’s arbitration procedures, and specifically its roster of neutrals for large and complex cases in New York, deprive black litigants like Mr. Carter and his companies of the equal protection of the laws, equal access to public accommodations, and mislead consumers into believing that they will receive a fair and impartial adjudication.

Where, as here, a contract violates New York law, New York courts do not hesitate to invalidate that contract provision as void as against public policy, notwithstanding the fact that the parties willingly agreed to the provision. And when an arbitration provision violates public policy, New York courts routinely stay the arbitration.

And that’s the relief Jay-Z seeks in this petition, filed by his [high-powered counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/quinn-emanuel-pulls-off-coup-with-big-time-criminal-defense-hire/), Quinn Emanuel partners [Alex Spiro](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/spiro-alex), [Andrew Rossman](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/rossman-andrew), and [Ellyde Thompson](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/thompson-ellyde-r).

Even with top legal talent, it’s far from a foregone conclusion that Jay-Z will succeed, given the traditional reluctance of courts to tinker with the machinery of arbitration. But if he does prevail, it could lead to big changes in the arbitration world, forcing AAA, JAMS, and other leading ADR organizations to seek out more minority and women arbitrators — which might not be a bad thing.

Jay-Z’s chances of success in this case are certainly subject to [Reasonable Doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_Doubt_(album)). But whether or not he prevails on this particular petition, his arguments could constitute [The Blueprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blueprint) for bringing greater diversity and inclusion to the world of alternative dispute resolution.

UPDATE (11/29/2018, 10:31 a.m.): As reported by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/arts/music/jay-z-roc-nation-arbitrators.html), the court granted an injunction that will put the arbitration proceedings on hold until a hearing on December 11. As Alex Spiro told the [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/jay-z-wins-bid-halt-arbitration-racial-bias-1164590), the ruling by New York Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla “is historic” and “a victory for everyone.”

# General Counsel Will Hit Biglaw Firms Where It Hurts If They Don't Increase Diversity ASAP

We will no longer celebrate good intentions or highly unproductive efforts that haven’t and aren’t likely to produce better diverse staffing. It’s the results that we are demanding and will measure going forward.

— Coca-Cola General Counsel Bradley Gayton, in a [letter](https://aboutblaw.com/Vif) to the company’s outside counsel, where he demanded that law firms staff [at least 30% of new matters with diverse attorneys](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/coke-gc-tired-of-good-intentions-wants-law-firm-diversity-now), with at least half of that billable time going to Black lawyers. Within the next two years, Gayton hopes he will be able to increase his diverse billable hour staffing requirement to 50%. In his letter, Gayton notes that noncompliance over two quarterly reviews will result in a “non-refundable 30% reduction in the fees payable” until a law firm complies, and continued failure could result in a firm no longer being considered for legal work with the company.

# Are You Really Happy At Your Law Firm?

Zain Atassi

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Zain Atassi](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/196) is a Director with Lateral Link, where she recruits and places high-level attorneys with leading AmLaw firms, high-end boutiques, and Fortune 500 companies. Zain focuses on the individual needs of her clients and candidates, delivering the utmost personalized attention. Before joining Lateral Link, Zain gained significant experience as a legal recruiter with a national legal search firm. Prior to recruiting, she spent six years as a litigation attorney with Chicago-based law firms. Zain holds a J.D. from Washington University School of Law and a B.A. with Honors from Washington University in St. Louis.

Lateral hiring in the past few years has hit record highs; and yet, most of the attorneys I speak with on a daily basis initially tell me they are “happy” where they are and do not want to make a lateral move. But, are they truly happy? The data tells us that nearly 50% of Biglaw associates have made one or more lateral moves in the past three years. Maybe everyone is not as happy as they think.

I recently spoke with a friend of mine at a Biglaw firm in New York. She said she “couldn’t imagine working for any other law firm.” I expected a flurry of compliments and praise about her employer to follow, but instead, I was surprised to hear a barrage of complaints: non-responsive partners, associates stretched thin, feeling overused and underappreciated, etc. So then I asked her, “Why haven’t you considered a lateral move?” She had assumed that all law firms were the same, and never really thought about how making a lateral move could be beneficial. But, as the 50% of those that have made lateral moves can attest to, not all law firms are created equal.

There are a myriad of reasons an attorney might leave a firm, but there are generally 10 recurring motivations that I hear the most often. They may not know it at first glance, but most attorneys eventually come to the realization that they want or need to make a lateral move for one or more of the following reasons (in no particular order):

- The People. Let’s face it, we click with some people more than others. We enjoy some work styles more than others. Biglaw attorneys spend the majority of their day at work, so it is unsurprising that most attorneys I speak with want to find a “home away from home” where they actually like the people with whom they work. What’s more, they want to feel valued, appreciated, and respected.
- The Culture. Work environments can vary greatly from firm to firm, and there are numerous factors that make a firm’s culture what it is. From social activities to dress codes to transparency from upper management (I could go on), these are all points to consider in evaluating a firm’s culture. Everyone has their own specific needs and priorities, so we seek out the work environments that best align with our personal values.
- The Geography. Not everyone has their say in where they work right out of law school. Due to firm or practice constraints, you could end up practicing M&A in Omaha or general corporate in New York. Oftentimes a lateral move is necessary to support your practice in the long run. Or, a move is paramount for personal reasons; people get tired of the “Big City” and want to move back home — or vice versa. Whatever the case may be, sometimes it’s more about the geography than anything else.
- The Money. For some, it’s all about the Benjamins. A number of attorneys are surprised to hear that compensation structures among peer firms can vary greatly, especially with bonuses. Know your market and know what you’re worth. Some attorneys just want to be paid top dollar, so moving to a firm that compensates them handsomely is a priority. Other attorneys are concerned about their long-term cash flow and will seek out firms that support their objectives, whether it be to make partner, go in-house, or run for office.
- The Work. At the end of the day, it’s hard for attorneys to squeeze out every billable hour for clients they don’t like — whatever the reason may be. Everyone wants to enjoy what they do, so attorneys tend to make moves in order to focus their practice on the work they find the most satisfying.
- The Hours. Some attorneys are happy to grind away and thrive in environments where long hours are the norm. Others strive to achieve more of a work-life balance. Moving to a firm that appreciates and understands where one falls on this spectrum is important.
- The Prospects. Many attorneys I speak with have specific long-term goals in mind such as becoming partner or landing an in-house job. In order to plan for that future, it’s important to position oneself in the best place possible to achieve that goal. In some firms, chances of making partner are slim to none. In others, it’s a very realistic and attainable goal. It’s important to know how a firm can (or cannot) help you attain your present and future goals.
- The Prestige. You did spend $150,000 on your degree so there is no shame in chasing the more prestigious firm. For some, moving to a firm that has the highest Vault Rankings or the most nods in Chambers is what really matters. If accolades are important to you, then landing somewhere where the prestige factor is high can be the end-all be-all.
- The Size. In law, size really does matter. Some people enjoy working for behemoth firms where they can interact and work with a large and diverse number of people. Others prefer working in smaller, more close-knit teams where they tend to work with the same people all the time.
- The Reach. Whether or not a firm has international clients and offices all over the world is a big consideration for some attorneys. They like the idea of working with colleagues and clients in different countries, or even spending some time abroad in one of the firm’s overseas offices. For others, a firm’s reach can be paramount to supporting their practice.
Whatever your motivations are, I encourage you to review this list and see how many of these factors resonate with you. Are you really happy in your current position? If you are like 50% of your colleagues, chances are high that something better is probably out there for you. Teaming up with a good recruiter who listens to you and who has their finger on the market’s pulse can help you choose a firm that is the best fit for you.

# On Having You Help

Here’s something junior folks don’t always realize: I’m doing you quite a favor if I ask you to help with stuff.

Alright, alright: Maybe that’s a bit of an overstatement. But for certain things, it’s absolutely true.

Suppose I ask you to help with a presentation we’re making to senior management. I could do it myself, but I decide to give you exposure to the top brass.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
First, you must talk about the right subject.

So I have to think hard about what you’re going to say and why.

Then, you must deliver the presentation coherently.

If you wander aimlessly for a half hour through your notes, the gang will blame you only in part. They’ll also blame me, because I was silly enough to let you do this.

So once I’ve figured out what you have to say, I must rehearse it with you a few times to be sure that you deliver it correctly.

(See? This is already taking me three times as long as if I simply did it myself.)

It doesn’t stop there.

You might be asked questions during your presentation.

Someone has to know the answers.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
It would be great if you knew the answers, and we should prepare you for that.

But if you don’t know an answer, or you forget something that we’ve discussed in advance, we can’t leave the question unanswered. Thus, I must know the answer to every question that you might be asked, just to be sure we don’t embarrass ourselves. That’s an awful lot of preparation for me in the days leading up to your talk.

(See? This is now taking me many times as long as if I were simply doing it myself.)

You give the presentation. It’s great!

Everyone congratulates you, and you showed the top brass that you’re up to the task!

That’s just the way it should be — even if I prepared you until the cows came home.

But: You give the presentation. It’s terrible!

You get blamed only in part. I also get blamed for having been foolish enough for letting you speak to the important folks.

See? Having you help is not as easy as it looks.

I’ve given the example of a corporate meeting, but this really applies to most situations in which the junior person is speaking in public.

I decide to let you take the lead at a client meeting.

I spend as much time preparing as you do, and then let you take the credit.

And so on.

I understand completely that this is the senior person’s job: The senior person must pass responsibility on to the next generation, and the senior person must teach the junior people how to excel.

That’s absolutely true.

But the junior people should understand that this is hardly as simple as it looks.

I can’t just say: “Hey, junior person! Go do this!”

Rather, if I’m being responsible, I’m doing an awful lot of work behind the scenes.

I ought to do that work; it’s my responsibility. But the junior person should understand this is not as easy as it looks.

# Legal Fee Voyeurism: Gawking At Gawker's Lawyer Bills
## The embattled media company has hired high-priced talent to help it through its troubles.

Embattled Gawker Media, the prominent digital media company that’s currently mired in [bankruptcy](http://gawker.com/how-the-gawker-media-bankruptcy-will-work-1782289841) and litigation, has hired some top legal talent to help it through its troubles. And these lawyers and law firms, despite some discounts, don’t come cheap.

Here’s a report from Peter Sterne of [Politico Media](http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/08/gawker-close-to-settlement-with-mail-online-in-defamation-suit-004700), who has been covering the trials and tribulations of Gawker more closely than anyone:

In a series of motions filed on July 25, Gawker asked the bankruptcy court for permission to pay the five different law firms that are representing it in various lawsuits. While requesting authorization to pay Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP — the law firm representing Gawker and [former Mail Online employee James] King in the Mail Online defamation suit — it mentioned that it’s close to a settlement in the case….

According to the motion, Gawker paid Cahill about $157,000 in the 90 days before it declared bankruptcy (on June 10) and owes the firm another $87,000. Going forward, Gawker plans to pay hourly rates of $800 for partners and $332 – $588 for associates. That’s a nice discount from Cahill’s normal hourly rates of $920 – $1,140 for partners and $416 – $735 for associates.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Charging $1,000 an hour used to be a big deal (see, e.g., this [2007 piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/business/03fees.html) I wrote for the New York Times). Today, where some partners charge [$2,000 an hour](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/how-much-would-you-pay-for-the-very-best-lawyer/), for $1,000 an hour is something of a bargain.

Cahill, home of legendary First Amendment lawyer [Floyd Abrams](http://www.cahill.com/professionals/floyd-abrams), is one of the best media litigation firms in the country. And the same can be said for the next firm we’re about to mention:

Gawker also asked the court for authorization to pay four other law firms — renowned First Amendment law firm Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz LLP, Florida law firms Thomas & LoCicero PL and Brannock & Humphries, and Gawker’s corporate counsel JB Duncan PC….

Gawker has paid the most money to LSKS. In the 90 days before bankruptcy, Gawker paid LSKS more than $3.6 million for its work on the Hogan trial and four other lawsuits against the company. Going forward, Gawker plans to pay LSKS hourly rates of $515 for senior partners, $490 for partners and counsel, $330 – $445 for associates and $215 for paralegals. That’s about a 20 percent discount from the firm’s normal rates.

Ordinary Americans might be shocked to hear this, but again, that’s a tremendous value. Levine Sullivan is a top media litigation shop, and to get a senior partner for the price of a fairly junior Biglaw associate is a steal. No wonder many clients are turning from Biglaw to boutiques.

But wait, the rates can get even better, once you leave New York City:

Gawker paid Thomas & LoCicero (which handled jury selection in the Hogan trial) about $248,000 in the 90 days before bankruptcy and currently owes the firm another $10,000 or so. Gawker isn’t getting a discount from Thomas & LoCicero and plans to pay the firm’s standard hourly rates of $320 – $495 for partners, $215 – $230 for associates and $170 for paralegals.

Gawker paid Brannock & Humphries (which specializes in appeals) about $175,000 in the 90 days before bankruptcy, owes about $7,000 and has a retainer with the firm of about $17,000. It plans to pay discounted hourly rates of $400 – $475 for partners, $215 for associates and $140 for paralegals.

Check out the bios of the lawyers at [Thomas & LoCicero](http://www.tlolawfirm.com/people) and [Brannock & Humphries](http://www.bhappeals.com/about/our-team); you’ll see seasoned and successful attorneys. And Gawker is getting them for under $500 an hour. It seems that you can get great litigators in the Sunshine State for a half to a third of what Biglaw litigators in NYC charge. (Good news for the Adelson family and their [bevy of high-profile defense lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/the-dan-markel-murder-case-the-adelson-family-speaks/).)

Now let’s go back to Biglaw. Gawker is being represented in bankruptcy by Ropes & Gray, which is charging a pretty penny:

Gawker’s most expensive law firm is Ropes & Gray, which is representing it in the bankruptcy proceedings. Gawker paid a $300,000 retainer to Ropes & Gray before declaring bankruptcy and is currently paying Ropes & Gray’s standard hourly rates of $880 – $1,450 for partners, $605 – $1,425 for counsel, $460 – $1,050 for associates and $160 – $415 for paralegals.

And its adversaries have similarly impressive counsel:

A committee of Gawker’s creditors — made up of [Hulk] Hogan, Ashley Terrill and Shiva Ayyadurai, who are all suing Gawker and all represented by attorney Charles Harder — filed a motion asking for authorization to hire the corporate law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP to represent them in the bankruptcy proceedings. The creditors plan to pay Simpson Thacher’s standard hourly rates of $1,085 – $1,315 for partners, $1,030 – $1,065 for counsel, $485 – $995 for associates and $205 – $350 for paralegals.

Query whether Simpson Thacher’s bills are being covered by tech billionaire [Peter Thiel](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/peter-thiel/), who [bankrolled the litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/why-this-billionaire-used-litigation-finance-as-a-weapon-in-his-war-against-gawker/) filed by wrestler Hulk Hogan against Gawker that took the company into bankruptcy.

UPDATE (3:15 p.m.): It seems the official committee’s fees to Simpson should come out of the bankruptcy estate, assuming the committee’s [request to retain STB](http://www.politico.com/media/f/?id=00000156-5786-d9ce-a757-ffae6ee20000) is granted, but individual creditors might have to pay their own fees.

The troubles of Gawker have some media companies running scared. But from the perspective of lawyers, [“it’s not personal, it’s strictly business”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7zkd0kRS4) — good business.

Disclosure: I worked briefly at Gawker Media for a few months in 2006, back when Gawker owned [Wonkette](http://wonkette.com/), and [ATL Redline](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/what-is-atl-redline/), an ATL spinoff site, uses Gawker’s Kinja platform.

# Biglaw Firm Makes A Lackluster Entry Into The Associate Compensation Game
## Some money is better than no money.

After patiently waiting for news of any change to the associate compensation structure at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, they finally got word on Friday afternoon about the firm’s plans. It was not what most associates had been hoping for.

The firm did not announce a full match of the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale, which is the prevailing market standard for elite Biglaw firms. Instead, the firm announced no change to the base compensation for associates but did pony up supplemental bonuses for associates — but there’s a catch. While 1st, 2nd, and 4th year associates will get sightly more than their peers at other firms in terms of special bonuses, they only get half of the supplemental bonus amount now, and the other half at year end. The supplemental bonuses are contingent on meeting a billing threshold, but associates not on target for those hours at mid-year can make them up by the end of the year and receive the full supplemental bonus.


The reaction we’ve been hearing from Pillsbury associates has been uniformly disappointed:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Pretty depressing information to get on a Friday afternoon.

Pillsbury Formally Announces They Are A Tier 2 Firm: On late Friday afternoon, Pillsbury informed its associates that it is not matching the new salary scale. This comes on the heels of the firm informing associates that it has had its most profitable years in firm history the last two years and that they are beating those numbers this year. The firm also recently informed associates that the strategic goal is to be an Am Law top 30 firm in the next three years. After this bullshit, I’ll just say “good luck with that.”

Firm management should know that many mid-level and senior associates are already interviewing with other firms.

Pillsbury sent memo on Friday and associates are not happy

# A Lot Has Changed For Biglaw Over The Last 33 Years

The [Am Law 100 is out](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/am-law-100-released-a-lot-of-firms-made-a-lot-of-money/), and it got us thinking about the original Am Law 50. Back in 1985 there was, of course, Springsteen, Madonna, and waiting for Nirvana, but there was also a very different top 10 in gross revenue. How many firms in the 1985 top ten rest in the top ten in 2018?

Hint: As a hint/bonus, one of the 1985 top ten doesn’t even exist anymore. Can you guess which one?

Not George Terwilliger (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

Just so this is clear for the record. I am George Terwilliger. I’m not Sidney Powell. I’m not Lin Wood. I’m not Rudy Giuliani. Our opponents here have raised the specter of this somehow being related to cases in which those lawyers have made assertions concerning the Georgia process and the election process and election procedures. We have nothing to do with that.

— McGuireWoods partner [George Terwilliger III](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/people/t/george-j-terwilliger-iii), in a statement made before Judge Eleanor Ross of the Northern District of Georgia, where he sought a federal restraining order to [change how mail-in ballots in Georgia should be validated](https://www.law.com/2020/12/18/im-not-rudy-giuliani-mcguirewoods-partner-distances-from-failed-gop-election-challenges/). Terwilliger represents the Georgia Republican Party, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and the campaigns of Georgia Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Judge Ross ruled that Terwilliger’s clients did not have standing, and dismissed the case.

# NY To $190K: If Not Now, When?
## Some speculation as to when this blessed event might happen.

In our [expanded poll](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-an-addendum-on-leverage/) about which firm would kick off the next round of Biglaw pay raises, the winner was Quinn Emanuel, with 28 percent of the vote. Second place went to Cravath, winner of the [original poll](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/), and third place went to Simpson. This sounds about right to me; all three firms are very prestigious and very profitable, and all have [reasonable leverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-an-addendum-on-leverage/).

Now that we’ve discussed who might lead the charge, let’s move to the next logical question: when? Biglaw associates are probably wishing it had happened yesterday — or several months ago, like back in October 2015, when we had [a bit of a false alarm](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/ny-to-190k-which-firm-may-be-raising-first-year-salaries/) — but those wishes have not come true.

If you look back at the history of [Biglaw pay raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/?rf=1) since 2000, you’ll see they happen on average about once every five years. But maybe that’s not a very useful statistic — the sample size of three is just too small, and the gaps are erratic (six years between the first and second, one year between the second and third, and more than nine years since the last one). There is, however, a [strong case to be made](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/) that a salary hike is overdue.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here’s another way of looking at the timing question: time of year. If you look at the history, you’ll see the three most recent pay jumps all happened early in the year: January 2007, February 2006, and February 2000.

Moving in the first quarter makes a certain amount of sense. At the start of the year, firms have generally completed their collections and analyzed their performance for the prior year, so they have a sense of where they stand financially. And if they want their annual projections for the new year to be accurate, they want to have a good grasp on their compensation costs, earlier in the year rather than later.

So my guess as to when we’ll get the next Biglaw pay raise is the first quarter of 2017. But that is, of course, nothing more than rank speculation.

Here’s a scary scenario (and an option in our reader poll below): never. What if an economic shock plunges our nation, and perhaps the world, into another recession? And then what if, in the wake of that new recession, technological advances (read: [artificial intelligence](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/) and [robot lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/robots/)) depress demand for new associates to the point where firms don’t have to pay more than $160,000 to get the talent they need? There’s no economic law requiring jobs and wages in a given sector to always increase. Just ask [coal miners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksIXqxpQNt0).

Yesterday we called upon our tipster network to help us [crack the closed world of K&E’s individualized bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/kirkland-ellis-places-bonuses-in-stockings-we-need-your-help-to-break-open-this-black-box/). We received a bevy of responses and can now provide a much better picture of the Kirkland bonus landscape. It’s the best we can do to provide you with an accurate view of what it’s like to work here.

The verdict: bonuses are generally clocking in about 20-40 percent above market. We did hear one report of an associate receiving a market bonus, but they explained that their hours were way low this year due to a big practice area slowdown.

Without further ado here are the tips we received (rounded and edited lightly to enhance anonymity):

- Class of 2015, 2100 hours, 1.2x Cravath bonus
- Class of 2015, with class rating (like we all get this year). ~2300hrs $21K
- Class of 2015, 1.75x Cravath, about 2800 hours including nonbillable
That’s a pretty big spread for a young class. That’s from $18,000-$26,250 for those keeping score at home.

- Class of 2014, 2000-2100 hours, $30K
- Class of 2014, with class, between 2000-2100 hours, 30k
Now a pattern emerges: if an associate billed expected Biglaw hours of 2000-2100 they look to be getting around 1.2x market. Getting into the 2300s bumps them up into 1.3x territory.

Midlevels were more circumspect about providing details — for the obvious reason that they’re more identifiable — but we got some insights from them as well:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Midlevel, above class rating, 2500 hours. Got 1.4x market.
- Class of 2011, ~2300 hrs, $35K above market
- Class of 2010; 2600 hours; $115,000
This seems to generally comport with the younger classes — except for the Class of 2010 receiving an approximately 1.27x bonus for 2600 hours. Could the firm be tightening up a bit at senior levels?

As highlighted in the post yesterday, there’s some grumbling about the tightness of the bonuses. An additional 10 percent isn’t really a ton of money in the grand scheme of things, and some associates feel an additional couple grand isn’t worth devoting so much additional time in billables or effort in establishing a top-notch class rating:

- Content, but not encouraged. Definitely feels like they’re targeting “above market” bonuses by the slimmest margin politically palatable, to the detriment of performers.
- Main gripe is that a good rating doesnt seem to matter. Anything the firm says about “quality mattering over quantity” appears to be untrue.
But there’s a flipside to this:

- Midlevel with average rating and around 2000 hours. Got a little over market. Glad I didn’t work too hard.
Kudos.

Let’s end this post on a high note with a tipster keeping the proper perspective on Kirkland’s commitment to paying premium bonuses:

- 2011 Class Year, approximately 2000 hours, approximate bonus of $110k. I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’ve always been very happy with my bonus, but this year more so than ever.
Congratulations, associates!

# Biglaw Divided On How To Deal With Technology
## Technology is coming, and Biglaw is trying to get ready.

Last week, in the back room of a Midtown eatery, a number of eDiscovery specialists from across the New York Biglaw landscape gathered for breakfast and a wide-ranging discussion of the challenges they face bringing their firms into the future of legal technology. The event, part of the [Cowen Group’s](https://www.cowengroup.com/) ongoing series of thought leadership workshops and sponsored by CS Disco, focused in large part on getting to 2020, the round number of our times.

If one envisions a law firm’s efforts to move boldly into the future as a matter of balancing the triad of people, technology, and process, then the most striking revelation of the event was the lack of uniformity across the industry. Considering the pack mentality of Biglaw firms — consistently terrified to waver from their peers — the firms represented on this day varied greatly in their current focus. The first few firms to offer their thoughts said, unequivocally, that they’re in the market for people right now. The next handful were satisfied with their personnel and were really focused on tightening up their procedures.

There wasn’t a lot of appetite to admit that a firm was behind the times on technology, but it slipped out between the lines from a few folks who said they were “always open” to considering new technology. Still, another quipped that firm leaders are advised that they are in a unique position to spend a lot of money on good technology and in a unique position to spend a lot of money on bad technology, and this seemed to reflect the overall mood.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

This tracked generally the results of Cowen’s [recent survey of in-house counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/what-are-your-clients-really-saying-about-ediscovery/) that found a profoundly inward-looking approach to eDiscovery. People, processes, efficiency… but not so much “new technology.” And yet, technology looms over any discussion in this area even if no one wants to admit it. If there’s one thing everyone seems to agree upon, it’s that technology is inevitable. Everyone admits that AI is coming, but no one is eager to be the first mover. They want to be ready when the tide reaches their firm.

Neil Etheridge of CS Disco formulated the equation of the day, noting that good new technology married to bad process results in bad new technology. That formula rang true when one Biglaw discovery specialist described fighting back internally against the perils of a one-size-fits-all approach. When senior attorneys suggested an “eDiscovery checklist for junior attorneys,” the specialist protested that this was a recipe for disaster, inviting inexperienced lawyers to blow past the nuances of every individual production and cut out the experienced personnel. It’s no surprise, of course, that a room full of eDiscovery specialists think it’s invaluable to have eDiscovery specialists on the payroll, but listening to these people explain their experiences saving their firms from eDiscovery naïveté really drove home the critical role they play in the modern Biglaw firm.

Toward the end of the discussion, moderator David Cowen took a detour from the narrow technological focus to ask the room how many of the current Am Law 200 will still be around in the next 5-10 years. Cowen sees increasing consolidation at the top of the market — thanks in no small part to technology — and thinks we’ll see a significant decrease in firms with more mergers and dissolutions. One participant noted the rise of the boutique — the trend toward lower-overhead specialists able to find their niche and thrive (in part due to improved technology) as a contributing factor.

But one veteran of LeBoeuf reminded everyone that firms are never going anywhere until they do.

Here’s what salaries for U.S. associates at Clifford Chance will soon look like:

# Surprise Raises From Unexpected Firm
## Not everyone needs $190K to be happy.
By [Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/author/joe-patrice/)

The Am Law 100 firms mostly fall into line with the elite market pay scale in order to keep pace with the elite firms in terms of recruiting talent. [Mostly](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-firm-tells-associates-they-can-afford-to-raise-salaries-but-theyre-still-not-going-to/). But beyond the top 100, it’s not expected or necessary to keep pace because these firms staff themselves differently, drawing from different law schools and waiting to gather hotshot talent on the lateral market who seek longer-term benefits than a quick influx of cash.

So associates at Quarles & Brady weren’t expecting to hear any news at all about their salaries when management shocked them with a $10K across-the-board raise for all associates in all offices with no strings attached. For firms with offices in places like Indianapolis and Tucson, that’s a nice summer gift for an associate. For associates in Chicago and D.C., this puts their compensation at $160K before any performance bonus and associates elsewhere in the country will be on a $140K scale.

It’s another sign that the upward pressure on salaries doesn’t require everyone to crucify themselves on the cross of $190K gold. There are known and sustainable salary price points in the legal market. People don’t need to overthink this, they just need to keep proportionally on pace.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s quite possible we’ll see more layoffs this year. At the very least, I expect we’ll see firms making quick termination decisions for any performance issues. There is only so long firms are willing to carry excess capacity.

— Nikia Gray, NALP’s executive director, in some additional analysis given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firm-hiring-plummets-35-amid-layoffs-slow-corporate-demand) on the organization’s recent [report on lateral hiring](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/PressReleases/NALPLateralHiringPressRelease_27March2024.pdf) in the legal marketplace. Lateral hiring was down 35% in 2023, following 2022’s decrease of 11.5%.

# Are Lawyers Considered 'Tainted' If They Sue Their Firms?
## Filing suit against your firm may do damage to your career.

It had a devastating effect on me. I thought people would look at me like ‘Wow, she’s a really courageous person.’ Instead, it was ‘I don’t want to be tainted by her.’

— Bonnie Porter, a former [Boies Schiller & Flexner](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/boies-schiller-flexner-llp/) associate who sued the firm in 2002, alleging that the firm [pushed women away from the partnership track](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202768463823/Women-Lawyers-Who-Sued-Firms-Reflect-on-Their-Decision?mcode=1202615717726). Porter claims that Boies Schiller used statements from other female attorneys to undermine her allegations, essentially forcing her into settlement for fear she’d be unable to afford to litigate the case. In 2003, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found reason to believe that women at Boies Schiller did not receive the same treatment as men.

Porter later found a job working as an attorney at Hinkley Allen & Snyder, where she thought people treated her differently because of the suit she filed against Boies Schiller. She’s now a writer in Maine.

# The Global 100: The Richest Law Firms In The World (2016)
## Which law firm had the highest revenue on the planet?

Hip hip hooray, we’ve got new Biglaw rankings so it’s a glorious day! The American Lawyer just released its latest edition of the Global 100, a ranking of the world’s 100 largest law firms by total revenue. How did these firms do in the year that was? As we learned from the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, a slow and steady approach to growth seems to be winning the race, even for the planet’s top-grossing law firms.

Here is some analysis from the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202768367950/For-the-Worlds-TopGrossing-Firms-Slow-and-Steady-Growth?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

The world’s 100 top-grossing law firms continued a postrecession trend of slow and steady growth in 2015, with revenue hitting a new high after a sixth consecutive year of top- and bottom-line gains, according to our latest survey.

Revenue for The Global 100 increased 3.1 percent in 2015, to $96.6 billion, a record for this group. And average profits per equity partner rose 4.9 percent, to  nearly $1.6 million. At current growth rates, total Global 100 revenue in next year’s survey will almost reach $100 billion.

Despite these gains, average revenue per lawyer (RPL)—a key measure of a law firm’s health and efficiency—dipped 2.1 percent, to $812,701. It is only the third decline in group RPL this millennium, after the financial crisis caused drops in 2008 and 2009, and the first time that Global 100 RPL has fallen without the United States economy being in recession.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What could have caused this decline in revenue per lawyer? We’ll refer to this as the Dentons dip. As noted by Am Law, thanks to the firm’s mega-merger with Dacheng — a firm 4,000 lawyers strong — RPL for the entire Global 100 sank like a stone. But for the Dentons Dacheng merger, the Global 100’s RPL would have increased by 0.2 percent, to $841,346. However, while 23 firms saw an increase in RPL of over 5 percent, more than a third experienced declines in 2015 — the most since the Great Recession. This could be a trend worth watching over the course of this year.

Here are the top 10 firms of the 2016 Global 100 (i.e., the top 10 firms ranked by 2015 revenue). Take a careful look, because this time around, there’s a tie:

1. Latham & Watkins: $2,650,000,000
2. Baker & McKenzie: $2,620,000,000 (verein)
3. DLA Piper: $2,543,000,000 (verein)
4. Skadden Arps: $2,410,000,000
5. Kirkland & Ellis: $2,305,000,000
6. Dentons: $2,120,000,000 (verein)
7. Clifford Chance: $2,118,500,000
8. Freshfields: $2,028,000,000
9. Allen & Overy: $2,002,500,000
9. Linklaters: $2,002,500,000

There was a bit of disruption in this year’s rankings due to the rise of Dentons. Last year, Dentons was ranked #19, and its cash ascension not only inspired a rousing game of musical chairs among the top 10, but also forced Jones Day out of the top 10 entirely.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As for Latham, the firm was able to hang on to the number one spot due to the fact that it generated the most revenue ever recorded for a single law firm in a fiscal year, with a 1.5 percent increase over last year’s numbers. After falling from #1 to #3 last year, Baker & McKenzie climbed back over DLA Piper with a revenue increase of 7.8 percent.

# Gaming Billionaire Gambles On Stiffing His Lawyers... Loses
## Why do people think it's OK to just not pay lawyers?

Kazuo Okada made billions in gambling, as the tech geek who figured out how to make slot machines register a “near miss” to prompt the weak willing to shovel another quarter into the maw of avarice. Before it was all said and done, Okada’s slot machine company owned roughly 20 percent of Wynn Resorts and had its own independent casino in Manila. But his latest gamble — not paying his $50 million legal fees — didn’t pay off.

[Bartlit Beck](https://www.bartlit-beck.com/) negotiated a fee deal with Okada back in 2017 when he locked horns with Wynn over the value of his stake in the resort empire. Wynn ousted Okada, claiming the Japanese businessman “likely violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act” and gave him a $1.94 billion 10-year note for his troubles. But Okada’s stake was worth $2.7 billion now so he sought out the power litigation firm to get him his money. Which they — specifically [Phil Beck](https://www.bartlit-beck.com/lawyers-PhilipBeck.html), [Chris Lind](https://www.bartlit-beck.com/lawyers-ChrisLind.html), [Hamilton Hill](https://www.bartlit-beck.com/lawyers-HamiltonHill.html), and [Brian Swanson](https://www.bartlit-beck.com/lawyers-BrianSwanson.html) — did to the tune of a settlement for $2.632 billion in 2018.

With a couple of billion coming in, you’d think Okada would have no problem paying his attorneys a relatively piddling $50 million, but you’d be wrong! The date for payment came and went with Bartlit Beck seeing nothing. Bartlit Beck decided to call Okada’s bluff.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Chris Lind from the underlying case, along with Bartlit Beck’s [Adam Hoeflich](https://www.bartlit-beck.com/lawyers-AdamHoeflich.html), and [Sean Berkowitz](https://www.lw.com/people/sean-berkowitz) from [Latham & Watkins](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/latham-watkins/), all went to arbitration — a condition of the fee agreement — to get the firm paid. Along the way, Okada called the fee “unconscionable,” a ballsy for a fee amounting to less than 2 percent of the recovery. I guess if your billion-dollar fortune is built on quarters it can skew your perspective. The arbitrators, on the other hand, suffered no myopia and awarded Bartlit Beck its full fee plus interest. It didn’t hurt that Okada refused to participate in the hearing, pulling out at the last minute.

Unfortunately, winning an award is only the first step. The firm filed the arbitration award with the courts to get it enforced. Hopefully, Okada has assets easier to tag than some clients. Personally, I once had to order Texas Rangers to seize a Boeing 707 to get someone to pay up. Arranging for hangar space isn’t exactly a skill they teach in law school.

Why do clients think it’s acceptable to stiff attorneys? The greedy lawyer stereotype makes for some good jokes, but while tragic abuses can target the most vulnerable, among the elite ranks of the profession the fees are pretty reasonable. Paying $50 million to recover over $800 million extra is hardly unconscionable. Trafficking in “money-grubbing lawyer” tropes while sitting on billions is much more unconscionable.

And it’s also dumb. If you’re betting on powerhouse litigators to walk away from their fees without a fight, then you’re making the losing bet.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Better Late Than Never
## Despite the wait, associates are pleased with their bonuses.

Paul Hastings traditionally puts out its bonus announcement in late February, and this year is no exception. It must really irk the hard-working associates who have to sit on pins and needles while the rest of the industry brags (or complains) about their bonuses while Paul Hastings brass remains tight-lipped about it. It’s one thing to drag out the process if the firm plans on earnestly assessing its receipts and striking out on its own with a better (or worse) bonus schedule, but when the firm is just going to mimic the rest of the market? Just make your announcement in December!

Anyway, Paul Hastings has made its February announcement, joining [a gaggle](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/firm-disappoints-associates-with-bonus-announcement-again/) of [West Coast-based](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-mo-money-at-mofo/) firms that [hold out until now](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-no-memo-no-problem/) to talk bonus, and associates seem pleased with the match:

PH matched market in all US offices with 2000 minimum hours. Extra discretionary bonuses for certain high-performing associates (e.g., 30% increase for a mid-level associate with good reviews and 2400+ hours). Everyone I’ve talked to is very happy but not surprised since while we have to wait a couple months we always match.

That’s Stockholm syndrome talking. Don’t ever get complacent about having to wait to learn about your bonus. On the other hand, earning that money in 2017 should put them under Trump’s new “nobody pays any taxes” regime so maybe it’s not so bad.

In any event, congratulations to Paul Hastings associates on their windfall.

# Leaving Yourself Open To Criticism As In-House Counsel
## You can be second-guessed to the end of time if you decide not to take a long-shot chance of winning a case.

“We think you should take this writ in the California state court system,” says outside counsel. “The trial court’s decision is plainly wrong. We can draft the writ for a mere $40,000, and we think you have a good chance of winning. If you win, the whole case is over. Take the chance.”

The idea is preposterous. There’s no way the court will grant the writ. But, as in-house counsel, how do you decline this proposal?

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

On the one hand, you can accept the proposal. You might win one in a hundred times. You’re a hero.

Or you can decline this proposal. You’ll never know what would have happened if you had taken the writ. You might later lose $1 million at trial. Outside counsel will always tell you, “You should have taken the writ! We would have won, and you would have avoided the adverse judgment!”

Or:

“File a cert petition,” says outside counsel. “The Supreme Court can decide this issue. We can draft the cert petition for a reasonable price. And we think the Supreme Court will take the case, and you’ll win.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Again, this suggestion seems plainly wrong. The Supreme Court will not grant cert. But, as in-house counsel, how do you decline this proposal?

You can pay for the cert petition. About two percent of cert petitions (in private civil cases) are granted. If you luck out, you might (depending on the decision on the merits) be a hero.

You can decline to pay for the cert petition. It is, after all, a waste of money. But you’ll constantly hear: “You decided simply to pay the million-dollar judgment?  How could you? If you had filed a petition for cert, the Supreme Court would have taken the case, and you would have won.”

As a matter of internal politics, you’ll be faulted only a little bit for spending money on stupid stuff. But you can be second-guessed to the end of time if you decide not to take a long-shot chance of winning a case. So you might as well take long-shot chances.

This argues for hiring reasonably experienced folks as in-house litigators.

If you’re a little more seasoned, you understand when outside counsel is proposing ridiculous crapshoots, and you should simply say no. After you’ve been playing the game for a little while, there’s no doubt in your mind about the right choice, and you can stand up to the internal criticism.

If you’re less experienced, and a little less certain about what decision to make, you’ll be inclined to waste the money and avoid the second-guessing.

Internal politics is a funny thing.

# Biglaw Leader Still Beating The Market... But Not By As Much As Last Year
## Are things slowing down here?

We’re used to watching Kirkland & Ellis throw around its weight as the reigning revenue champion and hand out bonuses that lap the Cravath-defined market by 30 to 40 percent. It’s been a core feature of a firm that’s sped past the competition over the last several years to its current perch atop the global Biglaw game.

But have the lights come on for the K&E party?

The short answer is “no,” as the firm’s individualized bonuses still walloped the market standard. But digging a little past the surface, Kirkland’s bounty isn’t quite as generous as it was before and that could signal a high that’s petering off:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Kirkland had a bonus meeting today. Numbers overall looked to be about the same as last year. Most associates getting 1.25-1.33x of market. They didn’t have the 5% above market “floor” for everyone that they had last year. So some people will be getting 1.0x market.

Beating the market by 25 to 33 percent is still good. It just isn’t the same as beating the market by 40 percent. Far more worrisome is probably the end of the “+5 percent floor” that sheltered quality applicants taking the risk to join K&E and accept its individualized bonus system. They knew that no matter what vagaries befell them in 2018, they’d be able to come out ahead of the game. Maybe they have and maybe they haven’t, but whether this is a momentary blip or a sign that an aggressive expansion strategy from K&E is coming to an end remains to be seen. It’s clear that this is the firm we’re watching most closely come this time in 2019.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Erasing The New York/Non-New York Divide
## This firm is now paying all associates on the same scale, regardless of office location, and people seem pretty happy about it.

To control their compensation costs, some firms have a practice of paying higher bonuses to their New York associates — generally whatever the market rate is for a given year — and lower bonuses to associates in other offices. It can be defended by referring to NYC’s high cost of living and the need to be competitive for talent in the Big Apple, but if often doesn’t sit well with associates outside New York. And given the increasingly national or even international nature of legal practice, where a matter might be staffed with lawyers from all over the country or the world, this compensation differential might be anachronistic (especially if the associates are being billed out at rates that don’t reflect their office location).

Last year, [Pillsbury Winthrop](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/pillsbury-winthrop-shaw-pittman-llp/) paid market bonuses in New York and lower bonuses in other offices. This created complaints from Pillsbury associates in other major markets who had solid hours and strong reviews but received below-market bonuses.

This year, Pillsbury is taking a different tack, as one tipster told us:

Happy to report that Pillsbury announced it will be paying Cravath bonuses to associates in all offices. The firm had another great year, and it’s nice to see that the firm is acknowledging the associates’ hard work. Note that this is a major departure from previous years where only NY associates received market bonuses. Beyond thrilled.

The memo went out last week. Here’s the Pillsbury bonus table, which applies firm-wide:

[](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pillsbury-Winthrop-2016-bonus-scale.png)

As you can see, associates who hit 2000 hours get [market-level bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/), and associates between 1900 and 2000 hours get half of the market. In addition, the firm created a separate bonus pool for associates who did not hit 1900 hours but nevertheless had an excellent year (e.g., major pro bono work); these bonuses range from $5,000 to $15,000.

Said a second source:

To their credit, the firm listened to associate concerns last year and revamped the bonus structure. Everyone is quite pleased.

From a third Pillsbury associate (who last year expressed dissatisfaction with PWSP bonuses):

Waiting for our individualized bonus memos, but the firm’s bonus program announcement announced Cravath scale for those billing 2000+. Very, very happy that the firm is falling in line with the rest of the market.

Now, great people to work with AND market compensation. Love me some Pillsbury doughboy!

Nothing [says lovin’](http://www.popsugar.com/food/Foodie-Flashback-Nothing-Says-Lovin-Like-Something-From-Oven-768681) like market bonuses from the oven. [Hee-hee!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3J2jDQ9cOE)

# Biglaw Firm Knows How To Take Care Of You For Daylight Saving Time
## The firm's just going to give employees back the hour cruelly taken from them.

Few days in the American calendar evoke as much dread as the day we all switch over to Daylight Saving Time. Every year, we move our clocks forward an hour each spring and steal an hour of sleep from hard-working people who just ask to get a couple decent nights of sleep over the weekend. And no matter how many devices attach themselves to the cloud and automatically update, you’ll still be finding clocks you need to manually change for weeks to come. Clocks that require digging into a long-forgotten drawer for instructions to a 1993 Kenworth range to figure out.

And worse, literally no one knows why we even do this anymore:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
People like our own Elie Mystal and Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern [believe we should have Daylight Saving Time all the time](https://slate.com/technology/2019/03/in-defense-daylight-saving-time.html). They are woefully misguided as what we should have is permanent standard time so we aren’t waking our asses up at what should be 5 a.m. People try to convince themselves that daylight saving time is a worthwhile endeavor because they conflate it with longer days, but that is more a function of astrophysics than chronology because the sun is up longer in the summer. More daylight is what you appreciate and no one’s day is going to be improved because the sun is up from 7:16 a.m. to 5:37 p.m. or 8:16 a.m. to 6:37 p.m. isn’t going to stave off any mid-winter woes. Stern even tries to wave away the permanent DST problem of forcing kids to wait for buses in pitch darkness by saying schools shouldn’t begin until 8:30 a.m. Well, guess what? Under the tyranny of permanent daylight saving time that would still require hopping on a bus in pitch blackness.

In any event, until we end the scourge of daylight saving, Dentons has the right idea. Last week, the firm announced that as part of its Wellness for Life program, it will [give employees back the DST hour](https://www.apnews.com/Business%20Wire/2f114c19f17b473ba651d73b8427dd9b) by paying them for it. Employees are being encouraged to leave early, come in late, take a long walk at lunch, and finish that book or podcast:

As part of its innovative multifaceted Wellness for Life initiative, “Daylight Savings — lose an hour and gain an hour,” launches today in which the Firm emphasized that weekends and off hours are a critical time for lawyers and staff to recharge and re-energize.

“Our business and profession is all about talent, and we are committed to continuously building a healthy work environment,” said US CEO Mike McNamara. “Our lawyers and staff work incredibly hard, and losing an hour of weekend time struck us as an opportunity to give something back to them, just as they give to each other and our clients every day. Our culture is centered around innovation, so we are asking our colleagues to be creative with how they personally decide to use this time.”

Good for Dentons. We have a love-hate relationship with wellness programs — obviously it’s important to try to improve the tough working conditions that go along with Biglaw, but many possible solutions are more hokey than concrete. But this is a solid proposal. Forfeit one billable hour to the cause of keeping employees up to the task and allow a little more time for them to adjust to this brutal new reality. Hopefully other firms are watching.

It’s officially winter, and with Hanukkah behind us, Christmas nearly upon us, and everyone in the legal profession ready to ring in the New Year, it’s time to reveal the nine finalists for our ninth annual holiday card contest. But first let’s give shout-outs to some honorable mentions (click on each firm’s name to see its card):

1. [Harness Dickey](http://ecards.vividgreetings.com/harness_dickey/v/Fkh9wQzYUkywmWF4h-wi7Q): A holiday card from an intellectual property firm that’s filled with the patents of your favorite holiday elements, from a wreath to a menorah to sleigh bells to a Christmas tree. This was a very well-executed card, and it’ll remind its viewers that IP lawyers have always made the holiday season a success.

2. [Mayers Nave](http://www.meyersnave.com/holiday2017/): From the nominator: “Wow! An unexpected, clever and creative idea to capture the national zeitgeist in a memorable and upbeat way. A prize for really feeling the firm’s culture in this card.” And from another fan of this firm’s card: “Great example of a card with a thought-provoking message that is not overwhelmed by an overproduced card. Congrats to a small firm with a big heart.”

And now, the nine finalists, in alphabetical order. Again, click on each firm’s name to view its card. Please note that most of these cards have SOUND, so you might want to turn your sound off or down, or use headphones. Explanatory comments come from firm representatives unless otherwise indicated.

1. [Day Ketterer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuPCB-JGOGc&feature=youtu.be): This card is absolutely awesome. According to the firm’s client services and development manager, “This year’s theme has Santa in peril, unable to deliver presents, and in need of legal intervention. Mixed in, you’ll find tongue-in-cheek political references, a nod to Twitter, and some outstanding teamwork from the Day Ketterer legal team.” We’ll predict right now that the number of votes this card receives will be YUGE — and might very well win the popular vote.

2. [Goodman Allen Donnelly](http://www.webbycards.com/2017/goodman/holiday-ecard.html): This card — the very first e-card the firm has ever made — features original artwork created by Michael Goodman, one of the firm’s founding partners. The firm’s marketing director says the firm usually tries to avoid being politically correct, but this time around, “politics being what it is, we played it slightly safer.” A very cute card from a very talented partner. Nice work!

3. [Larson King](http://www.larsonking.com/lk_holiday_card/): This is the fourth time that Larson King has been featured as a finalist in our holiday card contest. Maybe the fourth time will be the charm for this St. Paul-based litigation boutique? All the illustrations in this card were hand-drawn and then animated. Did you notice the cartoon drummer with the mullet? Yeah, he’s based on one of the firm’s partners. Plus, any firm that can sing its own name repeatedly without it getting annoying is worthy of a vote from our readers.

4. [Parry & Pfau](https://p2lawyers.com/blog/2017/12/13/parry-pfau-2017-christmas-video-its-a-wonderful-law-firm): From the nominator: “Parry and Pfau demonstrates how you can incorporate It’s a Wonderful Life, The Terminator, and one other subtle movie reference into a fun little Christmas video that appeals to everyone.” You’re going to have to invest more than .1 in watching this e-card, but trust us, it’s worth it.

5. [Phillips Murrah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMTGlpYhdL4): This is a very lawyerly holiday card in that you simply must read the fine print if you’d like to have yourself a laugh. Pause the video, because there in the fine print, you’ll find a 12-Day Gifting Disclosure that’s full of technical considerations from the delivery of gifts to the preservation of the rights of pipers, lords, and maids. As an added benefit, this part of the card is read super-duper quickly, just like an old-school automobile dealer ad.

6. [Schwabe Williamson & Wyatt](https://communications.schwabe.com/25/273/december-2017/where-s-schwabe--game-blank.asp?sid=9be0112a-8c31-47c8-ae18-d1c0e610d4ce): Who doesn’t love Where’s Waldo? In this case, it’s Where’s Schwabe? You’ll have three minutes to find everything in this firm’s little video game. A very creative and cute idea! “It’s the most wonderful game of the year!”

7. [Sutliff & Stout](https://mytexasinjurylawyers.com/our-firm/sutliff-stouts-2017-christmas-card/): Yet another fun card that focuses on the fine print. Partner Hank Stout says, “This year we are having a little fun with Big Pharma. Hope you enjoy the card and, by all means, please abide by the ‘fine print.'” Sutliff & Stout is a [former finalist](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-finalists-4/) that was in the [honorable mentions](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-finalists-7/?rf=1) last year. Will it finally win?

8. [Wolf Greenfield](http://info.wolfgreenfield.com/happy-holidays-from-wolf-greenfield): This firm nearly won our holiday card contest [in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-finalists-7/) and stole the show [in 2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-winner-6/) with its Rube Goldberg machines. This year, the firm has scaled back and created a stop-motion animation that features a little inventor whose creation comes to life at night. “It’s an ode to our clients, many of whom are inventors who started their careers tinkering in their garages. As intellectual property attorneys and technology specialists with science and technology PhDs, many of us are also tinkerers, and we got into this business because we love to help inventors take something old and make it new again.” (Truth be told, Wolf Greenfield’s card earned its way into the finals this year because I showed it to my son, and he approved of it with a very high-pitched squeal of glee.)

9. [Young, Minney & Corr](https://vimeo.com/247262209): This firm supports charter schools and the teachers and administrators who work there, so of course their holiday card is about — you guessed it — a charter school. Name partner Jim Young says, “At YM&C we believe that every child should have the opportunity to receive an amazing education. This holiday card demonstrates the kind of fairy tale endings that our clients work tirelessly to provide to children throughout the United States. We are proud to work with such great educators and administrators who make students’ dreams come true, and our graphic card is meant to thank them for doing truly important work.”

Now it’s time for our audience to vote. We’ll keep the polls open through MONDAY, JANUARY 1, 2018, at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time). This gives you ample time to campaign for your pick over the holidays (but please, please, please don’t cheat).

Thanks to all the entrants and nominators, good luck to the finalists, and happy holidays to everyone! We hope you have a wonderful long weekend!

# Biglaw Partner Neal Katyal Escapes Burning Man, Avoids Trench Foot
## The Biglaw partner is not your trench foot expert.

If you gave me a million guesses, I don’t think I would come up with a story about former acting Solicitor General/current Hogan Lovells partner[ Neal Katyal](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/neal-katyal/), Burning Man, and trench foot… but here we are. I guess I have to dream bigger.

Anyway, the backdrop to the story is the [deadly](https://abcnews.go.com/US/burning-man-rains-mud/story?id=102886032) mud at this year’s Burning Man. The annual festival was mired by heavy rain that turned the dried lake basin into a thick, slimy mud that[ stranded](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/escapist-utopia-gets-real-burning-man-revelers-stuck-in-mud-4dee63b) over 70,000 people as the [roads were closed](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/04/us/burning-man-storms-shelter-monday/index.html) to vehicles.

But some concert goers *had* to get gone before the [roads officially reopened](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/us/burning-man-festival-rain-mud-updates.html). [Diplo and Chris Rock](https://ew.com/celebrity/chris-rock-diplo-escape-burning-man-fan-truck/) famously hitchhiked their way out of the muck. Katyal attended the festival for the first time this year, and had to hike his way out of the concert and back to the life of a Biglaw partner.

It was an incredibly harrowing 6 mile hike at midnight through heavy and slippery mud, but I got safely out of Burning Man. Never been before and it was fantastic (with brilliant art and fabulous music)…except the ending. [pic.twitter.com/jhxsOfNp5y](https://t.co/jhxsOfNp5y)

— Neal Katyal (@neal_katyal) [September 3, 2023](https://twitter.com/neal_katyal/status/1698302619083509871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

For the record, given [his billable rate](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/this-biglaw-partners-nearly-2500-hourly-rate-is-raising-some-brows/), that was a $7,500 mud run.

He also shared [some advice](https://twitter.com/neal_katyal/status/1698309646061326789?s=20) for others considering the hike. And one suggestion — that hikers don plastic bags on their feet to avoid getting soaked as they wade through the mud — got a lot of attention.

One other thing: if someone you know is hiking, they need to prepare their boots. Plastic bag on your bare foot, then sock over it, then put boot or shoe on. There are lots of places where you sink into the mud down to your ankle. You need the plastic bag to avoid being soaked

— Neal Katyal (@neal_katyal) [September 3, 2023](https://twitter.com/neal_katyal/status/1698360554866298880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

As Katyal later [acknowledged](https://twitter.com/neal_katyal/status/1698783201336975662?s=20), continuous exposure to the moisture trapping plastic bag has the potential to create the conditions that create trench and immersion foot syndromes — a fact other users were quick to point out. Although one would hope the walk out of Burning Man takes less time than the Battle of Somme, minimizing the trench foot risk. But we are, in fact, talking about trench foot at a music festival in the year of our lord 2023.

Regardless, Katyal clarified he was merely passing on the information relayed to him by park rangers. Which is a fair reminder Katyal is your expert source for [how to own Supreme Court justices](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/justice-ketanji-brown-jackson-asks-simplest-most-damning-question-as-supreme-court-entertains-canceling-democratic-elections/), not for preventing the scourge of World War 1.

# Top 25 Biglaw Firm Gives Out More Money (On Top Of Year-End And Special Bonuses)
## Working from home costs money, and this firm knows it.

As observers of Biglaw know, they love to play follow the leader when it comes to compensation. When it comes to year-end bonuses and the special COVID appreciation bonuses on top of that, enough of the top of Biglaw has announced that we know what numbers to expect from a firm to truly be considered elite. So, if a Biglaw firm is out there offering even more money to hardworking associates, well, that’s something to note.

Enter Goodwin Procter. The firm has [previously announced ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/top-25-am-law-firm-announces-special-bonuses-but-theres-a-catch/)their annual bonuses that included a special bonus component that — if you have the billables — puts compensation at the expected market rate. Yesterday, they announced an additional tech stipend of $1,000 (they previously handed out $500 in June to defray work-from-home expenses) for associates to use how they see fit to make this WFH life a little easier, no receipts needed [(full memo on the next page)](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/goodwin-tech-money/2/):

In response to your feedback, we are awarding an additional one-time $1,000 work-from-home stipend to all eligible non-partner lawyers, science advisors and science law clerks in good standing. The gross payment of $1,000 (or the equivalent in your local currency, minus applicable taxes) will be paid in the December payroll to those who are employed on the payment date and who have not given notice.

As was the case with June’s payment, you may use this $1,000 stipend however you would like to make your work-from-home experience more comfortable and to defray any costs you have incurred. You will not need to submit receipts to justify payment of the stipend.

They previously announced [COVID appreciation bonuses for staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/goodwin-staff-bonuses/), something we’d love to see even more firms do. Of course, it hasn’t been all sunshine at Goodwin this year. Despite a ranking of No. 22 in the latest Am Law 100, they also conducted a series of [staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/even-a-billion-dollars-in-revenue-cant-stop-covid-19-layoffs/) and [attorney layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/goodwin-stealth-layoffs/) earlier this year.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Summer Special Bonuses
## Will your Biglaw firm get in on this compensation trend?

Folks sure are worried about the economy, given that we’re in a technical recession right now. But in the wonderful world of Biglaw, the money still seems to be flowing quite freely, and law firm leaders want their associates and counsel to know just how much their hard work is appreciated. You know what that means: special bonus season is upon us.

Special bonuses were all the rage in 2020 (thanks to [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) and [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)) and 2021 (thanks to [Willkie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) and [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/)), and it seems that the latest round of special bonuses may be in the offing. Are you ready for more cold, hard cash?

We’ve received word that Littler — a firm ranked at No. 71 in the most recent Am Law 100, after having brought home $658,578,000 gross revenue in 2021 — kicked off the special bonus party this past Friday. In a video message, the firm announced that associates, counsel, and first-level shareholders would receive special bonuses. There’s one small caveat here, in that only those who were on a 2,100-hour pace at the end of June were eligible to cash out. Attorneys who received these special bonuses averaged a $10,000 payout. Congratulations!

Littler is the first firm we’ve heard of to offer special bonuses this summer. Is the 2022 special bonus battle royal here? Are we about to see another compensation war? If you recall, Cooley started the 2020 special bonus battle by offering associates $2,500 to $7,500 before Davis Polk stepped in to offer amounts ranging from $7,500 to $40,000. Then, in 2021, Willkie was the first to offer up special bonuses, ranging from $7,500 to $40,000, before Davis Polk waltzed in with special bonuses ranging from $12,000 to $64,000.

Is Davis Polk watching right now? Associates certainly hope so.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Special%20Bonuses) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Special Bonuses”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# International Lateral Moves
## You might expect Biglaw firms to be reluctant to hire associates from one country for roles in a different country. But in fact, despite the possible obstacles, the market for cross-border hiring is booming.

You might expect Biglaw firms to be reluctant to hire associates from one country for roles in a different country. Cross-border moves are inherently more complicated than hiring an associate from across the street. There are visa considerations, bar admission hurdles, even cultural challenges.

But in fact, despite the possible obstacles, the market for cross-border hiring is booming. In particular, Biglaw offices in the United States are increasingly open to bringing on foreign candidates. And lawyers from other common law countries are realizing the advantages of gaining experience in the American market. Building a professional network while working on the highest-value, most complex deals in the world pays dividends throughout one’s career, whether the lawyer stays in the United States permanently or moves back home. Lucrative American Biglaw salaries are also a plus (though you’ll need to tolerate high hours expectations in exchange).

If you are a well-credentialed attorney working in Canada, Australia, London, Asia, or the United States, now is a great time to consider an overseas move. And Lateral Link can help.

Growing demand for cross-border hires

International lateral hiring is not a new phenomenon. We have [previously written about it](https://laterallink.com/oh-canada-lateral-moves-to-and-from-our-northern-neighbors/) in the context of moves between [Canada and the United States](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/oh-canada-lateral-moves-to-and-from-our-northern-neighbors-part-ii/). But relative to prior years, the level of interest among firms in hiring from overseas has escalated dramatically in 2021. Firms that have made these hires in the past are looking to bring in candidates in larger numbers. And firms that previously ruled out such hires are suddenly embracing the overseas model.

What explains firms’ growing openness to foreign lawyers? The biggest factor is that local candidates are in short supply. Many firms instituted hiring freezes or layoffs last spring, only to see unexpectedly strong demand for their services in the second half of 2020. All at once, firms have found themselves playing catch-up in a highly competitive market.

The talent squeeze is especially acute in the most expensive cities, such as New York and San Francisco. As with professionals more generally, the pandemic has caused many lawyers to reevaluate their circumstances and in some cases make major life changes. One of the most common has been to move away from high-priced urban centers. That has left firms with slots to fill in the largest markets facing a reduced talent pool. As a result, many are exploring creative solutions like hiring from abroad.

Another important factor is that cross-border hiring is working well for the early adopters. Firms have seen their peers succeed with this model, and that has given them confidence to jump on the bandwagon. The trend is catching on broadly: Lateral Link has worked with dozens of firms this year on international lateral searches.

There are some caveats to keep in mind. First, even in this tight market, firms still expect solid academic credentials, as well as strong and relevant substantive experience. Second, visa restrictions can be an obstacle. On the visa front, Canadians and Australians looking to move to the United States have an advantage. Canadians are eligible for the automatic 3-year TN visa issued at the port of entry; Australians can obtain an automatic E-3 visa prior to traveling to the United States. Candidates moving to the United States from other countries require employer sponsorship, which can be more challenging.

But for candidates who can surmount those hurdles, opportunities abound. There is demand for lawyers at various seniority levels, ranging from second-year associates up to senior associates and counsel. Firms are especially eager to hire in transactional practices such as M&A and finance. Capital markets demand is also growing. Tax and litigation opportunities are more limited, as these practices don’t cross borders as easily. Local bar admission is not necessarily a prerequisite, though of course candidates who already have it are especially desirable.

Lateral Link has specialized capabilities for cross-border lateral moves

If the prospect of a cross-border move is intriguing to you, please note that Lateral Link has a team of experienced recruiters specializing in international lateral hiring. Our primary markets are Canada, Australia, London, Asia and the United States. We work with candidates moving between any of these geographies. Firms specifically reach out to Lateral Link asking for candidates from these markets because they know our team has local expertise. We are constantly sitting down with partners to learn more about their hiring needs.

I lead our international group and bring particular knowledge of the Canadian and Australian markets. I have specialized in international moves for the past six years, and as a result, I’ve gained a strong understanding of which firms and practice groups are open to foreign candidates. I strongly advise candidates considering an international move to seek out recruiters who understand both the origin and destination markets. Real knowledge of both markets is critical to finding the right fit and ensuring a smooth transition. Lateral Link brings the necessary depth of expertise to navigate these moves successfully.

Canada

Firms considering a hire from the Canadian market frequently call me even if I am not working with the candidate because they trust my assessment of Canadian legal backgrounds. Lateral Link primarily places Canadians into the United States or London. We also place American associates into the Canadian market. Candidates interested in moving to or from Canada should contact [me](https://laterallink.com/team/matthew-rosenberg/) or my colleagues, [Elizabeth Soderberg](https://laterallink.com/team/elizabeth-soderberg/) or [Andrew Clyne](https://laterallink.com/team/andrew-clyne/).

Australia

As with Canada, we mainly place Australians into the United States or London. We also assist Australians with moves to Asian markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore. Australian candidates should contact [Zach Sandberg](https://laterallink.com/team/zach-sandberg/).

London

In the London market, we mainly assist U.S.-qualified associates with moves to London and UK-qualified associates with moves to Asia. We sometimes place UK nationals into the United States, but this is more challenging due to the need for visa sponsorship. Our experts on the London market are [Abby Gordon](https://laterallink.com/team/abby-gordon/) and [Andrew Clyne](https://laterallink.com/team/andrew-clyne/).

Asia

The majority of our Asia work involves placements of Americans into Hong Kong or Singapore. One notable feature of Asian markets is that lateral opportunities are available for litigators who have local language skills. For transactional associates, language skills are highly valued, but they are not an absolute requirement. As with London, placements of Asian nationals into the United States are less common, due to visa requirements. Candidates interested in Asia moves should contact [Justin Flowers](https://laterallink.com/team/justin-flowers/) or [Andrew Ng](https://laterallink.com/team/andrew-ng/).

[Lateral Link](http://laterallink.com/) is one of the top-rated international legal recruiting firms. With over 14 offices world-wide, Lateral Link specializes in placing attorneys at the most prestigious law firms and companies in the world.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Mo' Money At MoFo
## General sentiment about bonuses at Morrison & Foerster is positive.

Most Biglaw associates would respectfully dissent from the [Notorious B.I.G.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUhRKVIjJtw) More money does not give rise to more problems; it just means faster repayment of law school loans.

Which is why we’re hearing from happy MoFos at Morrison & Foerster LLP. The firm matched the New York aka [Cravath bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) for associates who made their hours, and associates with 2500+ hours get an extra $5,000 to $10,000, depending on seniority. The memo appears [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-mo-money-at-mofo/2/).

Here are some representative reactions:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- “MoFo bonuses for non-NY offices. Everyone seems very content with the match.”
- “People are pleased. We expected market and got market, so everyone is in a good mood.”
- “Very pleased, not much else to say.”
Some sources had a little more to say, in a slightly more critical vein:

- “While we would of course prefer an earlier announcement and payment, this is the historical practice and lines up with some peer firms.”
- “Associates I’ve talked to are happy, but an extra $5K only for 2500 hours is kinda ridic.”
- “People who got bonuses are generally happy, but many others (who didn’t hit hours) are still wondering–genuinely–why folks in NYC don’t have a minimum hours requirement to get bonuses, but folks in San Francisco (where rents and cost of living are demonstrably higher) have to hit 1950. People are also generally wondering why SF associates get paid bonuses so many months later than our NYC office. Makes one wonder if it is a surprise that talent on the West Coast is going to the Fenwicks of the world.”
But note that even these grumpier sources acknowledged the general positive sentiment. And there’s no denying that the current non-NYC bonus scheme is way better than what it replaced. As one source said:

This is now the third year of firmwide New York match. Prior to that (2013 bonuses and earlier), the firm matched in New York and had a merit/hours matrix for non-NYC. The transition was rocky (you reported on it), but everyone has been content since then (predictability being key).

There are many great things that can be said about MoFo as a workplace — it’s [strong on diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2016/), it’s [family-friendly](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2016/), it’s [fun](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/is-your-firm-on-the-most-fun-summer-programs-list-2015/) — so strong bonuses are just icing on the cake.

Bonuses from the West Coast or California-founded firms are starting to come in — see, e.g., the [bonus news earlier today from Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-no-memo-no-problem/) — and Above the Law will be there to track it all. So please help us help you. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

What Elon Musk is doing is strong-arming a law firm because he can. He’s a very wealthy, valuable client and he’s pissed off at this SEC guy, and he wants to get him fired. If someone presented that to me, I’d say, “Elon Musk, stick your head in the Tesla car and drive away.”

— [Abe Reich](https://www.foxrothschild.com/abraham-c-reich), chairman emeritus of Fox Rothschild, commenting [in an interview](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/01/18/cooley-applauded-for-standing-up-to-elon-musks-threat-to-fire-associate/) on the “ultimatum” Elon Musk gave to Cooley LLP to [fire an associate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-tesla-asked-law-firm-to-fire-associate-hired-from-sec-11642265007) who had previously interviewed the Tesla executive during an SEC investigation. [Cooley stood by its associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-firm-chooses-associate-over-elon-musk/), and Musk retaliated by withdrawing representation in several matters from the firm.

# 12 Résumé Tips From A Legal Recruiter
## Dedicate a few hours to reworking your résumé to be sure it’s the best possible representation of you.

Abby Gordon

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on lateral associate and partner moves from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Abby Gordon](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/team/abby-gordon/) is a Senior Director with Lateral Link’s New York office. Abby works with attorney candidates on law firm and in-house searches, primarily in New York, Boston, and Europe. Prior to joining Lateral Link, Abby spent seven years as a corporate associate with [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cleary-gottlieb/), focusing on capital markets transactions for Latin American clients in New York and for the last five years for European clients in Paris. A native of Boston, Abby holds a J.D., cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center and a B.A. in government and romance languages, magna cum laude, from Dartmouth College. Abby also worked with the International Rescue Committee as a Fulbright Scholar in Madrid, Spain. She is a member of the New York Bar and is fluent in French and Spanish (and dabbles in Portuguese and Italian).

As a legal recruiter, I review numerous résumés each week to assist my candidates with the substance and presentation of their one-page life summaries. Here are 12 tips to avoid common résumé mistakes:

1. Make certain the most important information jumps off the page. Assume no one will read your résumé word for word. Write your résumé for the interviewer who pulls your résumé off the printer and skims it on their way back to the office. Use bullet points, boldface, headings, and logical and consistent formatting to highlight and structure the important points.

2. Be concise. This is related to tip #1. You want the most important content to jump off the page, but every word on your résumé should serve the purpose of showing that you are the best candidate for the specific job. Stick to one page.

3. Know your résumé. If you can no longer remember the main argument of your senior thesis from college, delete it from your résumé or refresh your memory before any interviews. You must be prepared to talk intelligently about anything and everything on your résumé. You must be prepared to articulate a deep dive into your legal work experience, including any underlying legal issues your matters unearthed.

4. Tailor your résumé to the specific job. Keep in the forefront of your mind that you are applying for a legal job. Do not just “update” your résumé by adding to the same document you first created 20 years ago. Delete information that is no longer relevant to a specific job — remember, every word should serve the purpose of getting you this job. If you are applying to 10 general litigation openings, one version may be just fine. However, if you are applying to some general litigation spots and some patent litigation openings, you may want to have two versions of your résumé.

5. Give concrete details when describing your legal experience. Instead of asserting that you are a capital markets lawyer, write that you have “drafted the underwriting agreement as lead associate, representing the underwriters in the offering of $300 million in floating rate notes by a large U.S. manufacturing company.” Even if you have a separate sheet for representative matters, it may be helpful to include a few bullets points in your résumé to showcase this experience. Remember from Tip #2, every word counts. Do not use neutral words, where a more positive word would convey more meaning. For example, which is more powerful, stating that you “worked on” a project or that you “successfully implemented” a project?

6. List only current and accurate information. If you are no longer on a committee, delete it from your resume or indicate the proper date range of your participation. Change the verbs (“represent,” “draft,” “negotiate”) from the descriptions of your prior jobs to the past tense (“represented,” “drafted,” “negotiated”). No longer fluent in French? Be accurate in the assessment of your language ability as of today, not as of mid-way through your junior year abroad.

7. Show your human side. Include a few lines that show you are a human being, not a robot. Include interests so long as they are true passions and not aspirational hobbies. If nothing else, this “fluff” gives interviewers softball question material for breaking the ice. Space is a commodity, so consider lumping interests, language skills, bar admissions, volunteer work, and (active) participation in professional, alumni, or community organizations into one “Additional Information” section. Remember that this section is fair game for questioning. Do not list membership in a committee where your only participation is contributing to their e-newsletter click rate stats.

8. Make certain the most impressive information jumps off the page. I am often asked if you should list education or work experience first. A corollary to Tip #1, you also want the most impressive content to jump off the page. So, if you went to a top law school, list education first. If your law school was not as highly ranked, but you landed a job at Wachtell, list work experience first. In the case of a prestige tie, I would list work experience first.

9. Apply the squint test. Tape your résumé to a wall about 10 feet away or you hold it far out in front of you as though you’re taking a selfie. Then squint so the words are out of focus. Does the balance of black and white on the page make your eyes happy? Is there much too much dense text? Is there too much white space?

10. Proofread and proofread again.  Read your résumé carefully for inconsistent formatting and for typographical, spelling, or grammatical errors. Then proofread again. And again. Then find a friend (or a legal recruiter) to review your résumé. Nothing screams, “Do not hire me,” like an avoidable mistake on your résumé.

11. Avoid unwanted social media integration. You know that photo of you in the Bahamas, wearing your bikini? Shirtless? Remember how you uploaded it to your Google profile and now you list your Gmail address on your résumé? Did you know that I can see that photo of you in the right-hand sidebar of my screen as I’m emailing you? If I can see it, so can the recruiting coordinator, and so can the partner at the firm where you are interviewing. Some candidates’ Twitter feeds also shows up on the right-hand sidebar of my inbox. You don’t have to stop using social media, but if you are indiscriminate or controversial with your tweets, consider setting up a separate email account for the job search.

12. Use but don’t copy résumé models. Look over as many model résumés as you can get your hands on. But don’t blindly copy another résumé’s format if it doesn’t work for your experience. As a recruiter, I happily provide my candidates with example résumés, but I will not give them a fixed template. Every individual is different; every résumé is different.

There is no one right way to design a résumé, but there are wrong ways. This singular piece of paper is the key to getting your foot in the door to the next step in your career… or not. Dedicate a few hours to reworking your résumé to be sure it’s the best possible representation of you. You owe that to yourself. And remember that a good recruiter is an expert on the legal industry and on the job search process. Perfecting your résumé is one place where a trusted recruiter can add great value.

# Biglaw Firm Losing Attorneys As It Preps For Merger
## Not everyone will be there when the two Biglaw firms become one.

Chadbourne & Parke has really been making the news lately. They are defending themselves against a highly contentious [former partner’s gender discrimination case](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kerrie-campbell/). Plus they are getting ready to [merge with Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/biglaw-merger-means-the-end-of-chadbourne-parke/)… but that doesn’t mean all the partners and associates will be there when the two Biglaw firms become one. The number of attorneys that are saying adieu to Chadbourne [keeps on mounting](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/933497/chadbourne-defections-surpass-20-as-bias-suit-merger-loom):

In March, Erez Tucner joined Holland & Knight LLP in New York after spending more than 11 years with Chadbourne and serving as partner in its tax practice since 2011. A month later Alston & Bird LLP said it had added the former chair of Chadbourne’s intellectual property group, Paul Tanck in New York. And, in May, Reed Smith LLP said it had strengthened its energy and natural resources practice in London by snagging the managing partner of Chadbourne’s Moscow office, Andrei Baev.

And Covington & Burling has reaped the largest haul of Chadbourne attorneys — racking up 18 laterals in recent months:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Since the end of April, Covington has added 18 attorneys to its ranks from Chadbourne, a Covington spokesperson said. Just this past week, Li Zhang, Ursula Owczarkowski — who will serve as Covington’s international project finance vice-chair — and Julie Scotto joined Covington in London as of counsel. The firm also added former Chadbourne attorneys Derek Kirton and Haykel Hajjaji in its recently opened Dubai office and Lido Fontana and Deon Govender in its recently opened Johannesburg office.

We also are hearing from ATL tipsters that the defections are making an impact stateside. It’s been [reported](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202789382892/Covington-Adds-15-More-Chadbourne-Lawyers-in-Three-Cities) already that several New York partners have left the firm, and sources say in both that office and the D.C. one things are getting “really ugly”:

Associate morale is at an all-time low… So many rainmaking partners have left that work has dried up even in the once stellar project finance group. Associates are begging for work and pouncing/back biting on each other like piranhas.

Big-time partners that leave a firm are often the lateral moves that make news, but when a firm’s associate ranks start to get depleted, well, that has a real impact on the lives (and work) of the attorneys left behind.

# The Pandemic Law Firm Holiday Party: Festive Fun Or Superspreader Nightmare?
## Some are 'eager' to attend in-person parties, but others are worried about them.

If you’re a member of the legal profession, December could easily be called the most wonderful time of the year. After all, associates’ stockings have been [stuffed with bonuses aplenty](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/?rf=1), and salaries have never been so high. What better way to celebrate firms sharing their largesse than with a holiday party?

Sure, there may be a new COVID-19 variant spreading across the country and one of the top firms in the nation may have already had a party that [turned into a viral outbreak](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-holiday-party-turns-into-covid-outbreak/), but that shouldn’t stop attorneys from having some fun. Or should it…?

Will the coronavirus be putting a damper on this year’s holiday parties? We polled about 500 attorneys at firms both large and small, and this is what they had to say.

Is your firm having an in-person holiday party this year?



The largest group of respondents (32.99%) reported that they were having a holiday party this year, and that it would be the same size as 2019 or bigger. This is honestly a bit shocking but let’s move right along. Will people actually go?

Are you planning to attend in-person? 



Of the respondents who reported that their firm was having a holiday party this year, or that they were not sure if a holiday party would be occurring, almost 40 percent (37.04%) reported that they would eagerly attend an in-person event. Others are feeling pressured to attend, while others still have no desire to go because of COVID risks (and some of their colleagues will use COVID as an excuse).

Which of the following social distancing measures will be in place?



Proof of vaccination (76.84%), outdoor options (28.42%), and required face coverings (17.37%) were identified as the top three social distancing measures that will be in place at in-person holiday parties this year.

How do you feel about your organization’s holiday party plans? 



Of those who reported they would be having in-person holiday parties this year, the largest cohort reported that they think these plans are OK (31.84%). The next largest group, at 25.56%, reported that they think the plans are a little off because of COVID risks.

Other firms, of course, aren’t having in-person holiday parties this year, but will instead be offering alternative options for their lawyers to celebrate the close of the year. Our respondents told us that gift cards or other gifts (29.17%), and online happy hour-style gatherings (27.08%) were popular holiday party substitutions this year. Talk of holiday parties was so low key at some firms that 33.33% of respondents were unsure what the holiday party plans are for this year.

So, what do attorneys really think about their firms’ in-person holiday party plans during a pandemic year? Our respondents really spilled all the beans here. Some, of course, are hopeful that things will be all right (“It’s a risk but we’ve been really careful all year, so I’m optimistic.”). The rest aren’t too thrilled about the premise of attending — or being “forced” to attend — an in-person holiday party just yet.

- “Even if it is not explicit, there is a ton of pressure to be present for all aspects of ‘re-entry’ and in-person firm life. High risk folks not only have to balance risk to life versus career, they sometimes need to out themselves as high risk to justify non-participation. I’m pregnant and had to tell my teams long before I was comfortable to avoid being in indoor maskless client meetings. The Latham party outbreak is going to be the tip of the iceberg. Firms are making plenty of money with remote work, bringing us back in and making us show up is about showing they have power over every aspect of associates’ lives.”
- “My firm (Latham) had the NY corporate department holiday party on 12/2/2021, and so far over 10 people who attended have tested positive for COVID. We have cancelled all remaining holiday parties but I’m horrified by the fact that partners took this risk and pressured junior associates into attending an unmasked indoor event that has become a superspreader event.”
- “I’d be happy to attend this sort of party after I’ve already seen my grandparents over Christmas. But if I have to choose between attending a pre-Christmas office party and safely seeing my grandparents on Christmas, I choose my grandparents.”
- “We got an evite that was just like 2019 — for a spot that’s literally underground, and an emphasis in the invite for lots of great food. It seems completely irresponsible and an insult to everyone who has been trying extremely hard to minimize transmission of this virus so that it finally gets somewhat under control. I understand the desire to go back to ‘normal’ (me too!), but the world has changed forever. It’s time to recognize that fact.”
On that note, we here at Above the Law would like to wish our readers the very happiest of holidays. We sincerely hope that if your law firm is having an in-person holiday party, it’s festive, fun, and above all, safe.

Ed. note: This is Part One of a two-part series on how law firms can address critical vulnerabilities in their security posture.  Part One will focus on setting the stage for an external expert assessment and use a case study to examine physical security issues law firms should be examining.  Part Two will continue with the case study by addressing assessment techniques including attack simulations, social engineering, and open source intelligence review.

Law firms face cyber threats from sophisticated attackers including nation-state and criminal syndicates who target them for their corporate IP, sensitive information, and access. Companies increasingly need partners who can assist with sophisticated security issues while providing a defense-in-depth strategy and 360-degree view of the firm’s security posture, whether physical or digital.

The benefits of this proactive approach to security is twofold: one, the process itself — engaging in a holistic and interactive learning exercise with a trusted security advisor helps promote buy-in with stakeholders as well as educates the law firm security team. This interaction helps teach both the defensive and offensive techniques and processes that are repeatable, immediately implementable and reflect actual tactics employed by adversaries.  Finally, the findings themselves provide a viable business impact analysis which allows for both a business impact view as well as an unfettered view by all stakeholders. This helps bolster an enhanced security posture for critical assets in the law firm’s environment.  Spoiler alert: as with everything in life, there is always room for improvement.

Case Study of a Law Firm Security Audit

Law Firm X (X), with global offices in 10 locations, is concerned about its security posture.  There have been a few close calls where the potential for client data leakage, financial theft, or compromise of critical assets was almost realized.  Also, in the past six months, there has been some significant movement within the firm’s partners and board.  The executive management committee is asking its head of (information) security (CISO X) — is the security is enough?

The CISO X has reassured the firm stakeholders that it has a top-notch security team dedicated to tackling the firm’s security issues head-on.  However, to get more certainty about the firm’s security posture, CISO X has engaged an experienced and reputable Cyber Firm Y (Y) to identifying and prioritizing critical, systemic, and unknown vulnerabilities discovered within their applications, network, and security technologies, practices, and human resources. Often the gap between the known tactics, techniques, or procedures of current threat actors is far separated from known risks and protective mechanisms that defenders often rely on.

The CISO utilizes the security firm over a series of weeks, to perform attack simulations, physical security testing, social engineering, and application security testing.  These services aren’t cheap, plus X already has a top-notch information technology and security team in-house that handles security issues.  So why is all this necessary, and what does this really accomplish?  Let’s dig in.

##How Physical Security Assessments Help
Typically physical security assessments are performed to accomplish one of two goals. One, to get buy-in and understanding from top down around how easily an adversary can compromise almost any physical security. Or two, to accurately evaluate the gaps in the defense-in-depth security strategy being relied upon to protect and mitigate these risks. This helps paint an accurate picture of X’s ability to withstand a real-world physical breach, a physical security assessment will focus on breaching its physical facilities, evading physical security, compromising personnel, abuse current processes, and assessing or counter in-house security teams (also known as “blue teams”).    These physical engagements will provide the CISO X with a realistic evaluation of its actual security maturity not only technologically but also operationally and culturally. After all, law firms organically allow all forms of clients, vendors and deliverable in without prejudice of their actual intent.

Physical assessments provide visibility into various risks posed by a would-be attacker with physical access to, or within wireless range of, X’s locations. Companies conducting physical assessments (also known as “red teams”) should use current tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP’s) from today’s most sophisticated physical attacks to accurately reflect real-world vulnerabilities and plausible scenarios. Often these TTP’s are not thought of or accounted for, such as:

- Bypass Mechanisms for Physical security (exterior gates, fences, perimeter and interior camera systems, etc.)
- Manipulation of Access management systems and logging/monitoring of staff/tenants/visitors.
- On-site power generation disruption.
- Business continuity provisions and standard, including failover/failback standards and SLA specifications for uptime and the abuse of encompassing derivative plans.
- Abuse of environmental infrastructure (heat/air conditioning/water).
- Security provisions for utility access points and the misuse of such access.
- How are power, technology/network, and security teams organized?  What are the credentials/backgrounds of the teams?  How are they vetted?  Do they maintain a 24/7 presence on site?
- Equipment/delivery receiving and security abuse.
- Monitoring and logging of access to server cages and the bypass possibilities.

Goals of a typical assessment may include:

- Gain general access to a facility that should be off-limits to non-employees
- Gain access to sensitive areas within a facility
- Gain an initial foothold on the computer network, that will enable future remote access
- Access to the wired network via a firm computer, cabling, network appliance, etc.
- Access to the wireless network
- Demonstrate the ability to retrieve sensitive or proprietary equipment.
- Obtain sensitive information, credentials, or access that could further a future attack.
##Tradecraft Employed During the Physical Assessment
##Initial Surveillance
Using open-source research and visiting the target facilities, Y’s red team performs its initial surveillance in order to accomplish the following:

- Identify physical protections and procedures at the facility.
- Monitor nearby locations for facility personnel to measure operational security (OPSEC) weaknesses that lead to disclosure of information (e.g., badge pictures).
- Observe personnel at the facility to gather information about pattern of life, security procedures, and employee characteristics.
- Obtain information digitally (badge cloning) or physically (photograph) of access controls (badging systems) for later access and or impersonation.
- Interact with employees at the facility including employees in outdoor areas, lobby personnel and those commuting to/from work.
- Explore the facility to map all locations and discover sensitive areas.
- Identify entry/exit points.
- Identify security personnel and their surveillance patterns.
- Identify CCTV coverage, or lack thereof.
##Badge Cloning and Facility Entry
Employee badges are the keys to the kingdom.  Surprisingly, they are typically not difficult to clone, impersonate, or copy.  Y can use cloning devices in order to capture badge data from a badge belonging to an employee. If successful in creating a cloned badge, it can be used to access the facility. Without a badge, social engineering techniques such as tailgating (walking closely behind a badged employee) can be used to access the target facility without the required credentials.

If access is gained, Y operators will search for a means to access the corporate network and enable long-term remote access through deploying a device (aka a “leave behind device” or “dropbox”) that gets plugged into the target network.  Alternatively, Y can also attempt to gain access to any Wi-Fi networks located at the facility through capturing key exchanges and brute forcing keys.  Once connected through the internet or a bridged out-of-band backup link such as a cellular connection, this dropbox provides Y with remote access to X’s network.

With physical, wireless, and hardwired network access, Y and the internal knowledge obtained, operators are now wholly embedded within X environment.  It’s worth noting here, that engagements like this occur with the express consent of X.  In fact, Y will require a letter of authorization signed by a C-level executive of X to present as a “get out of jail free” card, if its operators are caught in the proverbial act.  And X’s security team can be “in” on the assessment, or only certain members of X’s security team can be made aware these exploits, to truly test the security team response capabilities as well as it’s processes and procedures.  The decision of who participates is up to X based on the ultimate goal or objectives of the assessment.

In Part Two, we’ll explore how external security assessments can help law firms understand other types of vulnerabilities outside of its physical posture — from executives to apps to simulating an attack on the network itself — and there is a lot of “tradecraft” to get into, so stay tuned.

# Biglaw Loves Kamala

Senator Kamala Harris (Photo by NOAH BERGER/AFP/Getty Images)

We know that Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Kamala Harris has support from Biglaw. An attorney herself, even in the Democratic primaries [she commanded hefty support (as defined by contribution money) from the top Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/youre-not-really-surprised-kamala-harris-is-getting-big-bucks-from-biglaw-are-you/). And now that she’s on the ticket, well they’re planning on raising even more money on behalf of the Dems.

Kirkland & Ellis partner Jonathan Henes who served as national finance chair for Harris’s presidential campaign, [told Law.com ](https://www.law.com/2020/08/12/big-law-fundraisers-already-in-the-works-with-harris-as-bidens-vp-pick/) excitement in Biglaw circles is high for the ticket, and he’s even planning to co-chair a fundraising event:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“The excitement is off the charts. I probably received 300-plus texts over the last 12 hours from people asking how they can get involved and how they can help,” Henes said Wednesday. “There is a groundswell of excitement and support for a Biden-Harris ticket.”
….
“Kamala’s supporters are incredibly loyal, and it’s because they—like me—believe in her,” Henes said. “We were going to support Joe regardless, but the excitement of Kamala being selected is going to increase funding, increase other support, because we are just so thrilled that we’re seeing a Biden-Harris ticket.”

Of course, I’m sure it helps that Harris [is married](https://twitter.com/m4c9416/status/1293686281961119747?s=20) to DLA Piper partner[ Doug Emhoff.](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/doug-emhoff/) Henes got involved in Harris’s campaign through Emhoff, and Henes says Emhoff was instrumental in organizing lawyers’ support of Harris.

But support for Harris may go deeper than a shared profession. Peter Zeughauser, a law firm management consultant at the Zeughauser Group, also said that Biglaw’s support may be tied to her reputation as a regulator:

“Firms are going to step in and provide the usual significant support for the ticket, in part because of her background as a lawyer and a prosecutor, but also as a tough regulator,” he said. “Those are all important considerations for Big Law firms when they think about how they’re going to support.”

# Associate Bonus Watch: Tiers Of Scrutiny

The untimely passing of Justice [Antonin Scalia](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/antonin-scalia/), to which we’ve devoted extensive (some say [excessive](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/most-lawyers-dont-give-a-damn-about-justice-scalia/)) coverage, will not keep Above the Law from performing one of its main missions: coverage of Biglaw bonuses.

Today’s announcement comes from [Hughes Hubbard & Reed](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/hughes-hubbard-reed-llp/) (whose [bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/06/associate-bonus-watch-hughes-hubbard-makes-special-bonuses-as-it-would-have-been-stupid-to-call-them-spring-bonuses/) we haven’t covered in a few years). HHR announced its bonuses earlier this month, but it took us a little while to get all the info we needed.

(Remember: our bonus coverage depends on the help we get from you, our readers. We can’t bring transparency to Biglaw compensation without the information and bonus memos that you send us, by email or by text (646-820-8477). Thanks, as always, for your contributions.)

As you may recall from [prior coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/hughes-hubbard-issues-true-up-raises-above-market-bonuses-if-you-hit-your-hours/), Hughes Hubbard pays market base salaries until you’re a sixth-year associate (i.e., market rates through the fifth year). Here’s the firm’s base salary scale (with the market scale aka [Simpson Thacher scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/) indicated parenthetically for comparison purposes, starting in the sixth year):

Class Year – Salary

1st – $160,000
2nd – $170,000
3rd – $185,000
4th – $210,000
5th – $230,000
6th – $240,000 ($250,000)
7th – $250,000 ($265,000)
8th – $265,000 ($280,000)
9th – $275,000 ($290,000)
10th and above – $280,000 (varies)

(Occasionally associates with bad reviews may get penalized by having their salary frozen, says a source.)

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

As for bonuses, here’s how the Hughes Hubbard system works, as one tipster tells us:

Basically there are four tiers for all associates (no stub bonsuses for first years): 1950, 2100, 2300, and 2500 hours.

Bonuses are doled out based on where you are on hours, with most the firm generally hitting [market](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/) or above this year at tier 2 (the 2100-hour mark).

Generally the bonus is purely based on billables, but for the past couple years you could count pro bono/quality office hours above 200. This year, they switched to allow counting of pro bono hours above 50 and quality hours above 150, but in each case those hours can only bring you up one tier.

In addition, 20 associates who didn’t make hours can still get a $5,000 consolation prize bonus if they do good work and make a case for it. You need to apply for it in your end-of-year annual accomplishment summary listing stuff you did and why you deserve a bonus. This was a compromise made a few years ago to keep people who couldn’t make hours (because there was no work from their rainmakers) happy-ish enough to stay.

The firm pays bonuses after reviews, which should be finished by the end of February.

And here are what the tiers look like:



So take, for example, a class of 2010 associate. The market aka [Cravath bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/?rf=1) for that seniority level is $80,000. At Hughes Hubbard, a class of 2010 associate will get $80,000 at tier 2, i.e., for billing 2100 hours. For more than 1950 but under 2100 hours, that associate will get half the market rate, or $40,000. At the 2300-hour mark, that associate will get a shade above market, or $90,000. For 2500 hours, which is a whole lot of hours, that associate will get a decent amount above market, $105,000.

How do HHR associates feel about their bonuses? Here’s a summary:

As usual, people who made hours (especially people above 2500) are happy this year, and those who didn’t aren’t. Some associates are annoyed about pro bono hours not counting until after you hit 50 (and then only hours above 50 are counted).

I think it’s great that people actually get significantly more cash for suffering through heavy hours.

The system seems fair enough — not especially generous, not unusually stingy. The Hughes Hubbard tiers won’t induce joy, but won’t trigger tears either.

# Another Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries, Just In The Nick Of Time
## It might've been painful to wait this long, but at least your firm didn't leave you hanging.

It was just two days ago that we received the following message from a forlorn associate at Patterson Belknap:

Some frustrated associates at Patterson Belknap wanted to let ATL know that, despite the movement in the market, the firm has been completely silent on the subject of associate raises. Although the firm is outside the Am Law 100, Patterson’s profits per partner are healthy and much higher than those of many firms that have raised, the firm is not highly leveraged, and it has only one office — in New York City — where cost of living is the highest. Patterson markets itself as a highly selective firm that competes with some of the most elite New York firms in terms of talent and, until now, salaries. There’s some speculation that because Patterson has essentially done away with on-campus recruiting and now hires almost exclusively law clerks, management may try to wait until clerk recruiting season to raise salaries. Hopefully we’re just being paranoid, but the prolonged inaction has made us suspicious.

Patterson Belknap currently sits at No. 149 in the latest Am Law 200 rankings, but with profits per partner of $1.62 million, the firm is ranked No. 51 out of all 200 Am Law firms. After nearly a month of watching associates at other firms receive raises, those who work at Patterson were right to question when they’d receive more money.

Luckily for these associates, the firm decided to issue raises last night under cover of darkness. Hard copy memos announcing Cravath matches — listing the increases, not the actual new salaries — were sent to associates after hours, and salary increases are effective July 1. To our knowledge, Patterson has matched Cravath salaries from their first-year associates at $180K through their eighth-year midlevel associates at $315K.

It might’ve been painful to wait this long, but at least your firm didn’t leave you hanging. Congratulations to all Patterson Belknap associates!

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# Biglaw Partner Gets Benchslapped By Federal Judge, Avoids Criminal Contempt
## The judge laid on the guilt while scolding the Biglaw partner.

Reed Smith partner [A. Scott Bolden](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/b/bolden-a-scott) represented former Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, but the latest controversy revolves around Bolden’s actions. Reed Smith attorneys have since withdrawn from Mosby’s case, but U.S. District Judge Richard D. Bennett was still referred the matter of Bolden’s conduct as potential criminal contempt after a finding by Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby of the District of Maryland.

So what *did* Bolden do? As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/judge-scolds-reed-smith-partner-for-theatrics-and-profanity-but-says-criminal-contempt-doesnt-apply) ABA Journal:

Part of Bolden’s misconduct stemmed from his statements at a press conference after Griggsby granted a government motion to continue Mosby’s trial, according to Bennett’s opinion. Mosby is accused of lying to make a hardship withdrawal from her retirement account and making false statements on mortgage applications to buy two homes in Florida.

During a September 2022 press conference, Bennett said, Bolden “exposited at length on the latest developments in the case, expressing outrage that the trial had been continued, characterizing the hearing as ‘bulls- – -,’ and suggesting that the prosecution of Ms. Mosby was motivated by racial animus.”

Griggsby found that Bolden’s profanity and extrajudicial statements violated local court rules. She also found that Bolden violated court rules by disclosing confidential jury questionnaire responses, along with associated juror numbers, in a court filing. And she found that he violated court rules by filing a court document without the signature of a Maryland lawyer. Bolden was appearing pro hac vice in the case.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Bennett [didn’t take kindly](https://www.abajournal.com/files/BoldenDec.pdf) to Bolden’s “theatrics and profanity,” saying they’re “contrary to the traditions of civility and collegiality” of the court. But while his actions were a violation of local rules, that isn’t the same as criminal contempt.

If the statute permitted criminal contempt for violations of local court rules, it would “in theory, license this court to impose criminal contempt upon any attorney who omits a fax number from the bottom of a court document … , submits a filing using a 1.25-inch margin … or supplies only three copies of an arrest warrant,” Bennett said.

As [reported by](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-scott-bolden-mosby-lawyer-contempt-20230221-5ub5rls3ajfstoir4kikrixawy-story.html) the Baltimore Sun, the judge called Bolden on the carpet over his behavior, saying, “You’re better than this. A person of your experience should never find himself in this position.” And the guilt trip worked — at a hearing on the matter, Bolden apologized repeatedly. Bolden reportedly “sounded as if he was holding back tears when addressing Bennett.”

Bolden’s attorney, Arnold Weiner,  said of the decision, “We think the judge made an absolutely correct ruling as a matter of law,” and that Bolden is a man of “high integrity,” and will practice law “honorably.”

Way back in the 1990s, Akin Gump was at the [very bottom of Biglaw associate compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/flashback-friday-associate-compensation-in-the-1990s-part-1/). But they aren’t at the bottom anymore. The firm just announced they are moving to the rarified air of MoneyLaw, increasing their associates’ salaries by $20,000-$35,000, depending on class year.

Akin Gump has moved to the full Cravath scale in all U.S. offices as well as in London, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The class of 2016 and summer associates will also be seeing a bigger payday.

Michael Steele, partner at the richest law firm in the world, Kirkland & Ellis, is [making news](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/01/kirkland-ellis-london-partner-drops-31-million-on-malibu-mansion/) for his latest real estate purchase in the Malibu hills overlooking Carbon Beach. (The Steeles also own an historic estate in Gloucestershire.) Steele and his fashion designer wife, Giovanna Steele, are relocating from London to Los Angeles, so naturally they need a palatial mansion — 12,000 square feet to be precise — to call home.

And woo boy, have they hit the mark.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As real estate publication Dirt [report](https://www.dirt.com/gallery/more-dirt/lawyers/michael-steele-house-malibu-1203609086/steele1/)s:

Completed in 2021 and built by developer Kirkor Suri, the Steeles’ new modern compound rests on a rugged hillside parcel spanning almost 22 acres, and is secured behind double gates. Five bedrooms and nine baths are spread across nearly 12,200 square feet of two-level living space rife with stone floors, high ceilings and designer light fixtures. Clerestory windows running the length of the living spaces allow for an abundance of natural light, while massive pocketing glass doors blur the line between indoor/outdoor spaces and offer sweeping ocean views.

But those are far from the only notable features:

The glass-clad mansion greets with a striking glass entry and large pivoting door, which opens into a double-height entry displaying a bespoke floating glass staircase illuminated with LED lights. From there, main-level highlights include a chic great room spotlighted by a fireplace. A family room adjoins the gourmet kitchen, which is outfitted with top-tier stainless appliances and a massive island with an eat-in bar.

A sumptuous master retreat holds a fireplace, private patio, walk-in closet and luxe bath with a soaking tub. Three additional ensuite bedroom suites also can be found on this level; and a lower-level is highlighted by a sumptuous entertainment lounge with a poker room and wine cellar. Other chic amenities include an elevator, indoor spa, a fitness center, steam room/sauna, beauty salon and massage room.

There is also ample outdoor entertaining space and a three-car garage. In addition to the $38 million price tag, there’s also a $5,000 monthly homeowners association fee.

Before we get to the walkthrough tour — easily the most jealousy-inducing .1 of your day — let’s take a moment to gawk over the views. It has to be one of the most enticing parts of the property and only two words will do: Stun. Ning.

If you’re a Biglaw associate in the fall of 2021, two things are probably true: (i) you embody the [latest TikTok craze](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/oct/13/extravagant-eye-bags-how-extreme-exhaustion-became-this-years-hottest-look), and (ii) you are eagerly awaiting news of your bonus, which may be right around the corner. 

To kick off our coverage, we’re asking you to take this (always) confidential, (always) brief survey to share your thoughts on the upcoming bonus season. And if you’d like to stay on top of any changes this bonus season, enter your email below to sign up for our free bonus alerts.

And as a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please email it to us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish — including, of course, the first such announcement.

# Latham Bonuses Are Out And The Median Bonuses Beat The Market
## With big bonus numbers like this, waiting isn't so bad!

If associates have to wait until January for their year-end bonuses, at least many of them will be taking home more money than the standard Biglaw bonus rate.

At Latham & Watkins, bonuses come with a 1,900 hours requirement, but they also give extra money for those who are billing above that threshold. And, from the looks of it, Latham associates have been pretty busy. The base bonuses (both year-end and special bonuses [which Latham gave out in the fall](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/latham-bonuses/)) are at market levels, but the median bonuses for every class year beat the market rate. And the top bonuses are way over what the market gives out.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The firm circulated the below chart internally, and you can get a sense of just how generous bonuses are at Latham ([full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/latham-bonuses-year-end/2/)):



The firm also announced the success of their charitable giving initiative, “Giving Thanks By Giving Back.” A total of $2.7 million was donated by the firm and their employees to organizations that fight hunger.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477).

# This Just In: Forcing Successful People To Work Under Conditions They Don't Like Can Get Them To Lateral
## Firms better add better snacks to the breakroom if they want to keep their key talent in the office.

Adapting to COVID was a time. Now that the smoke and lawyer cat videos have cleared, there have been two competing takes on what the “new normal” will mean for the industry. The first is the “fall in line or else” approach usually expected of Biglaw. Sure, working from your living room was nice and all, but the office is calling. So return. [Or else](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/morgan-lewis-office-attendance/). But not all firms are using the adapt with vinegar approach. A couple are realizing that honey — acknowledging that much of the work doesn’t require team members to meet in person and trusting in their capabilities — not only attracts worker bees, it attracts a swarm of ‘em.

When Paul Hastings recruited a 43-lawyer restructuring team from Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, chair Frank Lopez called it “one of those unicorn situations that happens once in a decade in the legal market.” Yet in post-pandemic hindsight, the Am Law 50 firm’s eye-catching acquisition appears to have been at the front end of a wave of ever-growing group departures involving professionals in different cities.

Less than one year later, a 44-person cybersecurity team from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith roughly matched the Stroock departure by relocating to Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete in 17 different cities. And within the last month, 130 lawyers have defected from Lewis Brisbois to a nationwide startup created by former labor and employment leaders.

Smaller group moves have also transpired with professionals based in multiple locations. Norton Rose Fulbright recruited a team of lawyers representing finance and tech companies in St. Louis and Atlanta from Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner; Morgan, Lewis & Bockius recruited 10 of Stroock’s consumer finance litigators in several cities.

These group laterals could be the new normal. For one, lateraling with a bunch of your coworkers is an easy way of skipping the dreaded talking phase of adjusting to a new Name & Name firm. Second, having teams of lawyers able to work together on matters from different offices, homes, and time zones has a benefit that is hard to reap in brick-and-mortar-obsessed firms without the threat of sleep deprivation; when you have that many people spread out, it is basically always 5 p.m. somewhere:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Even more willing to embrace multijurisdictional group additions are leaders at Constangy Brooks, which followed its group addition from Lewis Brisbois with another cyber team from Octillo Law in five locations.

The round-the-clock nature of cyber services allows for a more dispersed and virtual workplace environment, leaders said.

“We had to take everything we knew about smaller groups and expand that, navigate things so that we could make it as smooth as possible to make sure not to disrupt the billing process,” said Teresa Bult, administrative partner and general counsel for Constangy Brooks.

Group lateral moves do carry with them some particular growing pains. A consequence of the novelty is that firms may have to go out of their way to establish safeguards to maintain cohesion:

Many firms also lack a standardized integration process across their offices and practice groups. Some only focus the screening process on the partners leading the prospective group and neglect to vet the attendant associates, counsel and other professional staff.

“We’ve seen instances where teams split up after moving,” Hamman said. “If the entire team is not vetted properly, the new firm’s platform may not be as adequate for them as others. You need to make sure you have done that on the front end to make sure the entire team is something that you need.”

I get the feeling that the wrinkles will get ironed out over time. It’s been clear for a while now that lawyers are willing to trade a bit of salary if it means that they can [enjoy the COVID comforts they’ve grown accustomed to](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/the-office-exodus-why-lawyers-are-trading-higher-salaries-to-work-from-home/). If firms can bite the bullet and adjust to these clear trends, there is a lot of money to be made.

# Transaction Gone Bad: A Deal Lawyer Gets Sentenced To Prison
## This former Biglaw counsel is going to prison, although not for a huge amount of time (as prison sentences go).

Last year, transactional lawyer [Harvey Newkirk](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/harvey-newkirk/) sued his former firm, [Bryan Cave](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/bryan-cave-llp/), claiming that it [hung him out to dry](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/ex-biglaw-attorney-files-lawsuit-claiming-his-former-firm-hung-him-out-to-dry/) when federal prosecutors pursued him on criminal charges arising out of a deal he handled while at the firm. Newkirk sought at least $2.5 million from Bryan Cave, to cover legal fees relating to an alleged fraudulent scheme to buy Maxim magazine that he worked on while in the firm’s employ.

Now Newkirk has even more cause for complaint against Bryan Cave. As reported by [Law360](http://www.law360.com/articles/787286), Judge Jed S. Rakoff just sentenced Newkirk to a six-month prison term and three years of supervised release. He must also pay $3.1 million in restitution, according to [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-maximmagazine-idUSL2N17O17A). Newkirk got convicted by a jury of wire fraud back in December.

In the grand scheme of things, six months isn’t a long time, at least as far as federal prison sentences go. The real problem for Harvey Newkirk is what his post-prison life might look like, as explained by [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-21/ex-lawyer-who-lied-to-lenders-in-maxim-deal-gets-six-months-inao9oan):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Lawyers for Newkirk, who earned degrees from two Ivy League universities [Cornell for college and Columbia for law school] and memberships in elite institutions, told Rakoff that their client is disgraced and struggling financially.

He and his wife were once members of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem whose members are “a historical who’s who of the elite, black community,” a supporter wrote in a letter to the judge on Newkirk’s behalf. “The community is small, so people gossip, speculate and shun.”

Surprisingly small and gossipy? The black community sounds a lot like… Biglaw.

# Jimmy John's Serves Up Sandwiches And Oppressive Non-Compete Agreements
## In other words, non-compete are not intended to keep 18-year-old delivery drivers from seeking employment. Yet that's exactly how bread and meat purveyor Jimmy John's uses them.

The Platonic ideal of a non-compete agreement envisions an engineer who worked on a team perfecting the latest iPhone quitting in the middle of the night to take a job heading up the Samsung product development team. That’s the sort of industry where companies have a legitimate interest in protecting their intellectual property. And hell, even there the agreement is probably not valid since Apple is based in California and they frown upon non-compete agreements. In any event, non-compete agreements are intended to cover something pretty close to rocket science.

In other words, non-compete are not intended to keep 18-year-old delivery drivers from seeking employment. Yet that’s exactly how bread and meat purveyor Jimmy John’s uses them. A class action lawsuit filed against the company reveals that they force the lowliest of their lowly employees to sign away their rights to work almost anywhere in the food industry as a condition of employment. And we have a copy….

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here’s what these jerks were making employees sign [per the Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/13/jimmy-johns-non-compete_n_5978180.html?1413230622):

Employee covenants and agrees that, during his or her employment with the Employer and for a period of two (2) years after … he or she will not have any direct or indirect interest in or perform services for … any business which derives more than ten percent (10%) of its revenue from selling submarine, hero-type, deli-style, pita and/or wrapped or rolled sandwiches and which is located with three (3) miles of either [the Jimmy John’s location in question] or any such other Jimmy John’s Sandwich Shop.

Ten. Percent. That likely excludes a ton of other food businesses. In fact, the lawyer on the case, [Kathleen Chavez](http://www.fmcolaw.com/Attorneys/Kathleen-C-Chavez.shtml), offered the hypothetical case study of an Illinois high schooler who heads to college at the University of Alabama and is shut out of working anywhere in Tuscaloosa that serves at least 10 percent sandwiches up to and including the school cafeteria due to the three mile [EEZ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone) around Jimmy John’s.

And to what end? Is the siren song of Jared Fogel so compelling that Jimmy John’s has to resort to contractual shenanigans to protect Lord Sandwich’s secret recipe? Thankfully, saner heads should prevail on the law.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“A guy who’s putting a piece of roast beef between two pieces of rye bread — the challenge for the employer is to show what the hell this person knows that will hurt you,” said one expert on non-compete agreements, who asked not to be named since he isn’t involved in the case.

“Without making a judgment about Jimmy John’s, I would say the lower you go down the food chain of employees, the question becomes a little more pressing: What is your legitimate business reason here?”

Unfortunately, we can guess at the not-so-legitimate business reasons of Jimmy John’s. Why might a company force people on the lower end of the experience scale to sign an agreement that threatens them with legal action if they leave? To hoodwink inexperienced kids into accepting without question any sort of abuse they get on the job, perhaps? That theory would certainly fit the narrative for a company with a reputation for firing workers for [contemplating unionization](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/01/jimmy-johns-workers-sick-days-union_n_1467652.html) and faces a pair of lawsuits alleging [systematic wage theft](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/jimmy-johns-wage-theft_n_5669565.html) — one of which features this non-compete nonsense.

Perhaps Jimmy John’s has another side to the story. As [Kitchenette noted](http://kitchenette.jezebel.com/jimmy-johns-non-compete-agreements-are-utterly-psychoti-1645839165):

A company spokeswoman refused to comment, because Jimmy John’s doesn’t give even a semblance of a fuck about basic human decency, and they’re scared that if they have to publicly comment on this issue, that’ll become blatantly obvious.

On that note, maybe the best observation comes from the brilliant [Rick & Morty](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty/). When the family’s teenaged daughter found herself working for Satan in his “Twilight Zone, Ray Bradbury, Friday the 13th the series, Voodoo crap magic” store, she balked at walking away from the job noting: “Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn’t evil?”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Merger Effort Crumbles

Nixon Peabody and Stroock have [called off the merger effort](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/07/stroock-and-nixon-peabody-call-off-merger-stroock-pursuing-other-combo-candidates/).

The effort first came to light a couple months ago, but after a number of Stroock partners abandoned ship, it appears that the deal is off. Those departures might not have had anything to do with the end of the deal, but… it couldn’t have helped.

Stroock is downplaying the decision to abandon talks.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Our discussions with Nixon Peabody were never exclusive,” the firm’s statement went on to say. “We have continued talks with other firms, we are making good progress with them and are excited about the opportunities they present.”

Based on merger documents obtained by Above the Law, it appeared as though the talks were reasonably advanced. Maybe some people plan weddings before going exclusive, but that’s not normally how law firms behave.

Stroock continues to seek a partner willing to shore up holes in the firm’s portfolio created by some high-profile departures. So if you’re a firm looking eager to merge, Stroock is willing to talk.

But I hope you’re not looking for anything exclusive, because I hear Stroock gets around.

# Former Biglaw Mailroom Clerk Writes Book Called 'The Law Firm That Called Me The N-Word'

So far I’ve sold four [copies].

— Richard Thomas, who worked for Chadbourne & Parke nearly a decade ago, in a [brief interview with the Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202773219045) about his recently released e-book, which details his experiences at the firm. Thomas, who wrote the book under the pen name [Webster Edgewood](https://www.amazon.com/Webster-Edgewood/e/B01HEBQXI0), changed the name of his book from “Going Postal” to [“The Law Firm That Called Me The N-Word”](http://amzn.to/2gJ7uVX) (affiliate link), after finding out about the [$100 million gender bias suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) the firm is currently facing. Thomas previously filed a pro se wrongful termination and racial discrimination suit against Chadbourne and received $6,500 as a settlement. Chadbourne claimed a press release about Thomas’s book [contained defamatory statements](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/files/chadbourne-parke-press-release-complaint.pdf), and it has since been taken offline.

Don’t let the K&L Gates hit you on the way out.

It’s not just [Carrier](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/05/trumps-misleading-numbers-about-the-carrier-deal/?utm_term=.9f7c11f3fe37). President Donald Trump needs to place a call to [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/) — although now it might be too late.

It seems that K&L Gates recently shed hundreds of good, solid American jobs (many of them in politically important “swing states” like Pennsylvania and North Carolina). These jobs might not be going to Mexico, but their elimination does reflect the broader economic changes that are sadly hollowing out our nation’s middle class and increasing income inequality.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Last week, we reported on [significant staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-banished-beyond-the-gates/) at K&L Gates, but we lacked details on the number of affected individuals (other than a claim of at least 30 staffers laid off in Pittsburgh). We’re now getting some firm-wide estimates — and it seems the cuts were huge. Here’s what one tipster told us:

The firm let go nearly 200 staff across the firm, including director levels in Human Resources and Marketing. IT was the hardest hit, but other departments, including Human Resources, Business Development, the paralegal group, and marketing, also saw large numbers let go.

I’m not sure of each state’s employment laws, but to my knowledge all U.S. layoffs included one week of severance pay, plus benefits through the end of February. Since being let go I’ve been told through former colleagues the firm was cutting down in areas the new leadership felt were “cost centers.” It’s been quite some time since the firm saw any staff as more than cost centers. It’s a “do more with less” mentality, and now those still employed are picking up even more work from those of us let go.

Said a second source (corroborating the claim of triple-digit cuts):

I have heard there were more than 150 let go firm wide, but cannot confirm that number.

All three offices in North Carolina were affected. To my knowledge, only service center staff, secretaries, paralegals, and other support staffers were let go. No attorneys were affected. Some employees had been with the firm for 15 or 30 years. Others joined the firm in the past few years, leaving very good jobs in order to do so.

My severance package and the package of a colleague consisted of one week of pay for each year worked, which is not consistent with what was reported to you per your article. I’m very interested to know if there were inconsistencies in how that was applied.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We’ve actually heard of several different approaches to severance, as noted in our [prior article](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/nationwide-layoff-watch-banished-beyond-the-gates/) (including the UPDATES). It appears that some got one week of pay per year of service, some got two weeks of pay per year of service, and some got twelve weeks of pay. So it seems that severance did vary across the firm — possibly based on seniority, possibly based on department or role, and possibly state by state.

Here are additional complaints about how the cuts were handled:

I have had a difficult time receiving outplacement services from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. I reached out to them immediately after I was laid off and was told the first available appointment was not until two weeks later — halfway through the month of outplacement services we have been provided. At this rate, the time will run out before I receive much of anything. Also of note, they chose February, the shortest month of the year to do this.

Finally, I feel the layoffs were done in a very cold way and affected only affected primarily lower-level staff — the low-paid staff. [UPDATE (2/15/2017, 10:50 a.m.): As noted by the first source quoted above and as another source recently reminded us, the staff reductions at K&L did include some upper-level management. Directors in admin, HR, and marketing departments were affected.]

We were immediately locked out of our computers and had to leave as soon as we packed up our personal items. I went through a layoff during the Great Recession and that employer gave us a month of advance notice to give us a chance to start looking for employment. I know of attorneys that have been let go over my time at KLG for poor performance who were given lead time to find other positions, but that courtesy wasn’t extended to us lower-level staff. Cold and wrong!

We reached out to K&L Gates with these comments, including the claim of 150 to 200 affected employees. The firm did not get back to us.

Layoffs of law firm employees as opposed to factory workers are probably not on President Trump’s radar screen — but Biglaw cuts can be similarly sudden and painful, reflecting the same erosion of trust between employers and employees that we’ve seen over the years. As one laid-off K&L Gates staffer commented, “It was quite a shock to us all, especially given how long most of us have been loyal to the firm.”

K&L Gates is sadly not alone. We’ve received a number of reports of Biglaw layoffs — but we need additional confirmation before reporting them.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477).

“A million dollars isn’t cool. You know what’s cool? [A billion dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e0n7vTLz1U).”

If Justin Timberlake is to be believed, contract management software behemoth [Ironclad](https://ironcladapp.com/) just got very cool, indeed. Ironclad recently closed $100 million in Series D funding off a valuation just shy of $1 billion, making it the tech world’s latest unicorn.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Cool” isn’t part of the conversation Ironclad co-founder and CEO Jason Boehmig usually hears around his company. “We’ve been described in the press as boring, unsexy, all those words,” he told me during an interview last week. “But I think the people who really understand what we’re doing [see] there’s also kind of a revolutionary implication for what we’re doing.” Beyond that, Ironclad’s success also contains lessons that everyone in law — from law firm management to newly minted associates — can draw from.

Setting The Standard

Boehmig makes it all sound so simple: Ironclad wants to do for contracts what the shipping container did for cargo. As [Boehmig retells it](https://ironcladapp.com/blog/announcing-ironclads-series-d/), the history of shipping cargo by boat is primarily marked by one innovation: containerization. For millennia, products were put on ships in containers of all sizes, with little to nothing in the way of agreed-upon standards for shipping sizes, package tracking, or other aspects of the industry we now consider essential. Packages spent months at sea without word of whether they were actually making their way to shore, cargo was routinely lost, and the loading and unloading of boats took more time than the actual hauling of the cargo across the ocean.

Then World War II hit, and lost containers of ammunition and supplies were no longer acceptable. The shipping industry settled on standards for shipping containers and package tracking, which we today call containerization. With that, the shipping industry seemingly grew up overnight. While your grandparents might have ordered a package, crossed their fingers, and hoped it would arrive sometime in the next six months, today we can order nearly anything we can think of online and trust it will generally arrive safely, securely, and quickly.

Boehmig sees the same opportunity in the world of contracting. The contract is the basic unit of much of the business world. Our companies can move only as fast as we can enter into agreements with new vendors and customers. Yet most companies’ contract processes remain drastically slow, with each contract going through endless tailoring processes and requiring the signoff from more stakeholders than is practicable. Ironclad aims to fix this problem.

The Disciplined Pursuit Of Less

What’s maybe the most revolutionary thing about Boehmig’s strategy is that he wants to fix only that problem. Part of Ironclad’s success comes down to Boehmig’s laser-focus on contract management and resistance to feature creep and vision bloat. When [I first spoke with Boehmig at the end of 2019](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/the-ironclad-rules-of-tech-lawyer-edition/), Ironclad was exclusively a contract management solution. When I asked him last week about the areas Ironclad will expand into with its latest $100 million round of financing, he said simply, “We’ll stick with contracts.” Boehmig sees contracts as an unfathomably huge and largely untapped market segment, one with more than enough room to grow in for the time being. “We really want to be the place that people make business contracts,” and despite being an industry leader, Boehmig characterizes Ironclad as only “1% of the way there.”

Rather than build out ancillary structures from scratch, Ironclad has leaned heavily into partnerships with other top-of-the-market providers. “I always approached the company in favor of only doing the things that we think we can do at a first-class level,” he said, using DocuSign as an example: “DocuSign is fantastic at e-signature, they’ve built an incredible e-signature product. We said, ‘that’s a first-class product. We are gonna integrate around that.’” By focusing on building a strong core product that integrates well elsewhere, Ironclad has avoided reinventing the wheel and dedicated its resources to higher-return areas of development.

Ironclad’s strategy brought to mind Stanford MBA grad Greg McKeown’s 2014 book “Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less.” McKeown argues that less often turns out to be more. By identifying what is actually important in our lives and our businesses and giving those our absolute priority and attention, we both maximize the impact of our achievements and positively reframe our internal metrics for success.

For law firm leaders, the lesson of Ironclad is to identify our strengths, and then lean into them. Rather than diluting a firm’s resources by trying to be all things to all potential customers, firm managers can focus on developing the practices that make their firm unique and show the firm off in its best light. By focusing on what we do best, we shed distractions and set ourselves up for the strongest success we’re able to muster.

The Long Haul

I asked Boehmig if he had any advice for aspiring entrepreneurs, and his response seemed to work equally well for young attorneys setting out to build their practices: “Pick an area that you want to work on for a decade-plus and that you’re going to get excited about. You’re going to talk so much about what you work on since it’s such a big part of your life. One mistake I see budding entrepreneurs make is they feel like they found a clever hack in a process, and they get caught up in considering the incremental improvement that could make. They don’t necessarily consider ‘Do I actually want to spend a decade working on this problem?’”

Instead, Boehmig argues, pick a problem you can commit a decade to, commit, and see what happens. “By any means necessary, keep moving, putting one foot in front of the other. Big companies don’t care as much as you, and that’s really your only advantage as an entrepreneur — that you care more. As long as we keep caring more and asking the right questions, and wanting to spend more time with our customers, we’ll win.”

I couldn’t agree with this advice more, especially to young attorneys trying to find their professional feet. Many attorneys I’ve known stumbled into a practice through happenstance, or inertia, or sometimes just dumb luck. I’ve known attorneys that’s worked well for, but what are the odds that what we stumbled into is what we actually enjoy? The attorneys I know who have both the most financial success and the most personal satisfaction are the ones who walk into the office every day knowing they’re doing what they want to do. Clients know when you actually care about your work, and that passion will show up in both your work product and your bottom line. Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day for the rest of your life.

Now that’s cool.

# Biglaw Firm Exceeds Associates' Bonus Expectations

The end of the years is steadily marching forward and a number of Biglaw firms have yet to tell their associates what to expect in their stockings. But associates at Hogan Lovells have to wonder no more.

According to sources HoLove already informed associates they’d be matching the scale set by Cravath at the start of bonus season, but there would be discretionary bonuses above the market rate for those that performed particularly well in 2017. Folks are reporting HoLove was pretty generous with that discretionary fund. In fact, tipsters say it isn’t even hours based (but assuming you hit the 2,000 hour minimum), and associates there are quite happy with the results:

[I received] little bit above market. No clear reason why, though the firm does have a (by application) system to award additional discretionary bonuses, for which I did NOT apply. I’m very pleasantly surprised and happy.

It’s always nice to get a little extra for a job well done!

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Do you like to be in the know? Do you love gossiping with friends and co-workers over the latest bonus news? Then you simply must sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts. It’s easy, just scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything.

Biglaw money is all around us! It’s the most wonderful time of the year in Biglaw, and that means raises and year-end bonuses are making the rounds.

We’ve now confirmed that Arnold & Porter — a firm that brought in $1,038,782,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 49 in the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, as of January 1, 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016+ – $435,000
Arnold & Porter is also matching the Cravath bonus scale, and this is what year-end bonuses will look like at the firm, to be paid on January 31, 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016+ – $115,000
On top of these bonus numbers, associates who billed 2,400-2499 hours will receive an additional 10% increase in their class-year bonus; associates who billed 2,500-2,599 hours will receive an additional 15% increase in their class-year bonus; and associates who billed 2,600+ hours will receive an additional 20% increase in their class-year bonus. That’s a nice stack of cash for the firm’s hardest workers. 

Congratulations to everyone at Arnold & Porter!

# Law Firms Have Best Quarter In 8 Years
## Go ahead and celebrate... cautiously.

Despite managing partners [losing faith in the economy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/managing-partners-losing-faith-in-the-economy/) and [resigned to another lackluster year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/2015-was-a-weak-year-for-the-legal-industry-and-you-should-expect-more-of-the-same-in-2016/), the first quarter of 2016 appears to have been gangbusters for firms. According to the Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group Survey, [revenue grew 5.8 percent](http://www.law.com/sites/articles/2016/05/12/citi-report-law-firm-revenues-surged-in-first-quarter/), making this the best quarter for the legal industry since 2008.

Is this an outlier or a sign that the good times have returned? Well, there’s probably not enough information yet:

The strong increase in revenue was at a level the industry has not seen since the first quarter of 2008. This was driven by growth in demand of 1.8 percent, rate growth of 3.2 percent and a collection cycle that was shortened by 1.5 percent. This compares very favorably to the slow start of 2015, which saw revenue grow just 2.3 percent, driven by demand growth of 0.1 percent and rate growth of 2.8 percent, but slowed by a collection cycle that lengthened by 1.6 percent.

Expenses in the first quarter of 2016 increased 3.2 percent, almost evenly split between overhead and lawyer compensation and well below the pace of revenue growth. That is a far cry from the 3.9 percent expense growth in the first quarter of 2015, which outpaced revenue growth.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Revenue is up, expense growth has flattened a bit, and it’s time for some [cautious optimism](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/05/16/citi-law-firm-revenue-rising-at-pre-recession-levels/):

Legal consultant Peter Zeughauser also sees reasons to be optimistic in the numbers. He said via email that it’s a good sign that growth appears to be broad-based across geography, practice area and industry sectors. He added that less work appears to be migrating these days from the top firms into cheaper competitors, meaning clients are still willing to pay top dollar for some work. (BTI Consulting backs this up, finding in a [recent survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/how-much-would-you-pay-for-the-very-best-lawyer/) that rates of $2,000 an hour are no longer total aberrations.)

“There will always be those who say the re-set button was pushed, the golden era will never return, and the sky is falling,” Mr. Zeughauser said. “But, that just isn’t so for well-run firms.”

Well, that may not be cautious enough. Not to knock an 18-fold improvement in demand, but 1.8 percent isn’t exactly great. Especially when you take into account the level of volatility in the market. With wild swings still higher than prerecession levels, to quote [The Wolf](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0436793/quotes), “Well, let’s not start sucking each other’s dicks quite yet.”

# Where Do Lawyers Fall In The Top Income Brackets?
## Attorneys who make it to Biglaw reap the rewards of a stable and lucrative career, with great prospects outside of the exclusive confines of Biglaw.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

Between pay, perks, and prestige, the only better position to hold in the U.S. job market than an Am Law 100 associate is an Am Law 100 partner. Because of the lockstep nature of associate pay, and the relatively consistent formula for deriving partner compensation, attorneys in Biglaw are securely rewarded well above the 90th percentile for almost any other field. The few exceptions to these are specialized surgical fields that require between four and seven years of additional training on top of four years of medical school. However, the road to obtaining one of these positions is also arduous.

There are roughly 68,000 domestic associates and partners at Am Law 100 firms. However, there are around 1,300,000 lawyers in the U.S., meaning Am Law 100 associates and partners make up only 5% of the total population of lawyers. Therefore, when comparing salaries between Am Law 100 firms and professions, the top 5% is the most apt point of comparison.

Within law, the distributions of income are bimodal, meaning there’s a large gap between the distribution of incomes for Am Law attorneys and attorneys working at smaller firms, government offices, or corporations. However, there are individual cases where attorneys in non-Biglaw posts make many times more what the most handsomely rewarded Biglaw attorneys make.



The NALP survey of first-year salaries illustrates this trend clearly. Without the skew from Biglaw though, the mean likely settles to around $60,000 — an almost $100,000 gulf between the two. The mean first-year salary for a non-Biglaw associate is around the same as the starting salary for most STEM bachelor’s and entry-level architects. Masters and bachelor’s degrees in almost any engineering field trump the average starting salary of a non-Biglaw associate.

On the other end of the spectrum, Biglaw partners rake in some of the top compensation, in the greatest volume compared to other professions. In the Am Law 100 alone, there are around 33,000 partners and another 9,000 counsel. On average, equity and non-equity partners in the Am Law 100 take home $1,114,000 a year.

CEOs come close. According to the Census Bureau, there are roughly 400,000 CEOs in the U.S. Of those, around 13% equal or surpass Biglaw’s average take-home, meaning there are roughly 52,000 CEOs equaling or beating Biglaw compensation, compared to 68,000+ in the Am Law 100 alone (not including counsel).

Consultants fall below the other two. The median salary for an experienced consultant in New York was $145,000, $50,000 below the median salary of a seasoned New York attorney. The largest difference lies in the top earners for each group. The 90th percentile for an experienced consultant starts at $260,000, compared to $780,000 for the top 10% of New York attorneys.

Investment bankers are rewarded handsomely for the long hours they put in. At the highest level, the average investment banker take-home almost aligns with Biglaw salaries. However, it takes many more years to get to the highest levels of investment banking. The leverage between vice presidents and managing directors is even worse in investment banking than in Biglaw. Goldman Sachs, for example, has around 12,000 vice presidents, but only promotes 400 people to managing director every two years. While investment banking can yield windfalls many times that of Biglaw, the chance of obtaining a senior position is much less likely.

Altogether, attorneys accounted for the largest group of people in the 1% within the U.S — with the majority of them at Biglaw firms. The next closest group was private-practice physicians. Overall, however, physicians in different disciplines and settings accounted for more of the top 1% than attorneys. Additionally, physicians had a higher “chance” of being in the top 1%. However, the latter requires many more years of training and schooling. Because of the more even distribution of physician salaries, when comparing the top earnings of physician and attorney salaries, attorney salaries almost unilaterally beat physician salaries.

One thing to consider, however, is that most associates will not make partner. There are around 32,000 domestic associates at Am Law 100 firms currently, compared to 30,000 partners. Because the runway for partnership is relatively short — 7-9 years — and the length of partnership is long — generally around 30 or more years — the promotion rate for associates is low. While associates enjoy staggering salaries for their experience compared to other professions, there is no guarantee of a continuous upward trajectory.

Many former associates who don’t make it to partner still enjoy salaries of equal or greater value, but there is far less security outside of Biglaw. Overall, attorneys who make it to Biglaw reap the rewards of a stable and lucrative career, with great prospects outside of the exclusive confines of Biglaw.

# Biglaw Firm Makes Life Easier For Working Mothers
## This is the second firm to offer such a revolutionary perk.

Last September, when writing about Latham & Watkins’s [revolutionary breast milk-shipping program](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/biglaw-firm-offers-revolutionary-program-for-working-mothers/) for all nursing mothers — both attorneys and staff members — traveling on work-related business, we asked, “Which Biglaw firm will be the next to step up and make life a little easier for female associates and staff who are working mothers?” Several months have passed, and it appears that another Biglaw firm has decided to make accommodations for new mothers.

The shipping of breast milk is still an uncommon perk offered by Biglaw firms, but Reed Smith announced this week that it will begin to do so for its attorneys who are on business trips. The firm is also upgrading its office lactation centers by installing hospital-grade, multiuse breast pumps to make the process more seamless than ever before for nursing mothers. Last, but not least, the firm will pay for lawyers returning from maternity leave to take an online coaching course called [Mindful Return](http://www.mindfulreturn.com/), which was created by Dentons partner [Lori Mihalich-Levin](https://www.dentons.com/en/lori-mihalich-levin). (Mihalich-Levin is also the author of [Back to Work After Baby](http://amzn.to/2reCIME) (affiliate link); expect to see a review of that book here on Above the Law sometime soon.)

More Biglaw firms should be offering these services and upgrades to nursing mothers. After all, it’s not as if they’re very expensive. The [Legal Intelligencer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202786424050/Reed-Smith-Tries-LowCost-Parenting-Perks-to-Retain-Women?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=2) has more information on their cost — which is really quite low:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The cost of these programs is nominal. A 34-ounce overnight milk shipment costs $139, the office breast pumps cost roughly $1,000 per office and the four-week online course costs $99 per person. But the firm is hoping for a greater return on the investment, in the form of a culture shift and the ability to ease women lawyers’ rise in the ranks. Losing good lawyers, after all, can be much more costly.

Karen Lee Lust, who is in charge of ReturnRS, the firm’s program whose goal is to retain women, says that “the more support there is for women the less attrition there is.” No one, not even Biglaw attorneys, should “feel like [they] have to choose between doing [their] job and being a good parent.”

Congratulations to Reed Smith on going forward with this program. The firm’s nursing mothers will feel all the more valued because something like this is being offered. Reed Smith is the second Biglaw firm that we know of that will ship its nursing lawyers’ breast milk back home to their babies.

Why haven’t more firms announced programs like this yet? If your firm is making life easier for nursing mothers and has a breast milk-shipping policy, please reach out to us via [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Breast%20Milk%20Shipping) or text at (646) 820-8477.

# Biglaw Partner Retires, Then Decides To Become A Law Clerk
## He’s likely the oldest law clerk in the country.

At first, as you might imagine, it was awkward.

— [Paul Hurdle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hurdle-7427174/), 71, commenting on what his [first day of clerking](https://news.virginia.edu/content/he-retired-then-became-law-clerk) was like for Judge [Craig A. Karsnitz](https://courts.delaware.gov/superior/aboutus/judges_profile_Karsnitz.aspx) at the Superior Court of Delaware. Both of Hurdle’s co-clerks recently graduated from law school and are less than half his age. Hurdle is likely the oldest law clerk in the country. Prior to clerking, Hurdle was a partner at McKenna Long & Aldridge, and he remained at the firm after it was acquired by Dentons before retiring in 2016. “I quickly discovered that retirement didn’t suit me,” he said. He plans to [take the Delaware bar](https://news.virginia.edu/content/he-retired-then-became-law-clerk) this summer.

How did Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, notoriously loudmouthed and anti-Establishment, [come to be represented](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/?rf=1) by the law firm of [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jones-day/), famously tight-lipped and blue-chip?

That mystery gets uncovered in this fascinating [Washington Post piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trumps-own-beltway-establishment-guy-the-curious-journey-of-don-mcgahn/2016/04/11/856229a8-fb9a-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html) by Ben Terris, a deep drive into JD partner [Donald F.

[I]f any member of the so-called establishment would be willing to gamble on a Donald Trump presidency, there are plenty of reasons why it would be Don McGahn.

In the 1980s, a young Donald Trump had his sights set on a different kingdom to conquer.

Atlantic City had recently passed legislation to allow casinos, and Trump wanted a piece of the action. Doing so required a power broker, someone who understood the intricacies of both the law and local political forces. So Trump turned to a portly Irish American attorney named Patrick McGahn — “Paddy” to his friends, and Uncle Pat to his nephew Don.

Paddy, the son of a shopkeeper and recipient of three Purple Hearts from the Korean War, was known to have the best professional connections in town, and the high legal fees worthy of them. As Trump gobbled up real estate, Paddy paved the way.

Just as his nephew Don, aided by his team at Jones Day, is paving the way for Donald Trump’s presidential ambitions. But at least Don McGahn’s work isn’t as, well, shady as his [late uncle’s](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/03/nyregion/patrick-t-mcgahn-jr-72-lawyer-for-casinos.html). Per the Post:

When Trump purchased property from two brothers with Mafia ties, he paid double the value, according to Wayne Barrett’s book, “[Trump: The Deals and the Downfall](http://amzn.to/1qjGEXV)” [affiliate link], and [put the title in the name of Paddy’s secretary](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/29/the-kkk-and-mob-allegations-haunting-donald-trump.html) before transferring it to one of his corporate entities.

Paddy McGahn’s representation wasn’t cheap, but Trump didn’t mind, noting that “he gets things done in this town.” Perhaps Trump feels the same way about Don McGahn, a D.C. insider, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, and leading election lawyer. It seems that Don McGahn came to Trump’s attention [because of his uncle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trumps-own-beltway-establishment-guy-the-curious-journey-of-don-mcgahn/2016/04/11/856229a8-fb9a-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Did Trump recognize a name he could trust when he decided to hire Don McGahn to get things done in This Town? McGahn did not respond to repeated requests for an interview, nor did the Trump campaign.

“I got to believe that Trump came to Don because of Pat, that’s got to be the connection,” said Bill Pascrell III, a lobbyist who worked on behalf of Trump casinos for more than a decade. “When Trump needed an election lawyer, I doubt he just Googled ‘good election lawyers.’”

Donald Trump and Jones Day might seem to be an awkward fit — citing our [earlier story](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/?rf=1), Ben Terris notes that “Trump’s message is a tough one for folks at Jones Day to swallow” — but Trump and Don McGahn are more copacetic. Just as Paddy McGahn shared Trump’s [“in your face” approach to politics](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/03/nyregion/patrick-t-mcgahn-jr-72-lawyer-for-casinos.html), his nephew Don exhibits an anti-Establishment streak, despite working at a white-shoe firm:

[Don McGahn’s] always been a bit of an iconoclast. Until recently he kept his hair long, and he still plays bass in an [’80s cover band](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122523208143177711) that gigs in Ocean City, Md. While many of his colleagues boast Ivy League diplomas, McGahn got his law degree from Pennsylvania’s [Widener University](http://www.widener.edu). Like Trump, he’s something of an outsider no matter how far inside he gets.

Oh, and here’s a delicious tidbit of Biglaw gossip that might explain McGahn’s willingness to represent such a controversial client:

Shortly after McGahn started at Jones Day he picked up a new client: Aaron Schock, the congressman who was then reeling from a scandal involving the misuse of federal funds and has since left office. To this day, according to FEC reports, Schock has still not paid Jones Day the nearly $750,000 he owes them. (Jones Day representatives also did not return calls.)

Getting stiffed by Schock put McGahn in a difficult position with his new law partners, said a Republican strategist who has worked him. “He had this huge hole to fill. And when Trump came along, he was under a lot of pressure by management to fill that hole.”

So far, according to FEC reports, Trump has filled nearly $700,000 of that hole.

And there might be plenty more where that came from, as the Trump-Cruz battle escalates further, perhaps culminating in a contested convention — where, again, Don McGahn’s savvy will come in very handy.

You can read Ben Terris’s extremely interesting WaPo piece — which also explores, among other things, whether there’s any conflict or tension between McGahn’s election 2016 work and that of his partner, renowned election lawyer [Ben Ginsberg](http://www.jonesday.com/bginsberg/) — over [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trumps-own-beltway-establishment-guy-the-curious-journey-of-don-mcgahn/2016/04/11/856229a8-fb9a-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3_story.html).

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected by ALM for its 2021 Am Law 200 ranking, by what percentage is all partner compensation up for the Second Hundred, that is, firms ranked 101-200?

Hint: The average compensation for all partners (equity and income partners combined) took a nifty uptick over 2019’s compensation levels.

See the answer on the next page.

Google is great for doing due diligence on an open job position.  Learn all you can abut the job and the firm or company.  And then tailor your submissions to them accordingly.  But ultimately a recruiter wants to see a face — in person.  And a candidate wants to “kick the tires” — in person.

Despite the explosive growth of technology, in-person interviews are still the gold standard for proper recruiting.  But given the current state of technology, things are different from the time that I sat for my first interview — everyone at the table knows more about the other side than I would have ever dreamed.

But how is a candidate for that big interview supposed to act?  Or know what to say?  Or what to wear?

That’s easy — Google it!  No need to speak to anyone about this, since you can simply Google and learn all you need to know about proper interviewing techniques.  And how to dress.  And what to say.

Well, we’re here to provide you with some things that Google may not tell you — timely tips on what not to do — or say.  And what not to wear.  Its easy to blow an interview — and we’re here to tell you how not to do it!

None of this is scientifically based or tested — rather, it is strictly from years of personal hits-and-misses, observations, and embarrassing anecdotes.  But that’s not to say it isn’t valuable.  It is. (I can’t swear that you can’t find similar advice on Google, but why waste the time when you can just finish reading this post in two minutes?)

Here are the tips, in no particular order of importance, just how they came to mind in some of my cringeworthy ruminations.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- When introduced to the hiring partner, don’t call him (if it’s a him) “Pal,” “Dude,” or “Chief” (unless that’s his name). And if the hiring partner is a woman, don’t call her “Babe” or “Hon” (unless that’s her name). It demonstrates a certain lack of respect and an overabundance of familiarity. In fact, you may want to think twice about addressing the hot dog vendor on the way to the interview or the woman at the concierge desk in this manner.
- Don’t wear shorts, a t-shirt, or a baseball cap. Shorts and a t-shirt are too casual, and a baseball cap, of course, is inappropriate unless you know which team the partner is a fan of.  The same with skinny jeans and a shirt with an upturned collar — don’t try to be to cool.  Stick with a skirt or suit, especially if you know that the partner is over 35.   A good rule of thumb: anticipate how the interviewer will be dressing and try to dress nicer.
- Don’t talk money or hours — at least not in the first interview. For example, “I hope this job pays more than X” is likely a bad line, as is “I need to be outta here by 5 every day — I hope that’s OK?”  This tends to give the interviewer the false impression that you will not give your life for the sake of firm profits, something that should wait until after you are hired.  Instead, say something like, “It happens rarely, but sometimes I need to sleep (doctor’s orders!), so every once in awhile I need to go home for an hour or two before dawn.”  Much better impression, no?
- If there is a lull in the conversation, instead of whistling, talk law! Law, law, law!  Besides being the profession of the recruiting partner — and you — it is also likely to be the most interesting thing that you have to talk about.  You know — “So, what do you think about that law against perpetuities, huh?  Pretty, pretty complicated!”  That shows initiative and that you care about the other person’s interests.  For God’s sake, do not say, “How do you like those Giants?”  S/he may be a Jets fan!  What a faux pas.
- Do not — I repeat — do NOT respond “gin and tonic” when asked if you would like something to drink. Unless it is after 4 p.m.  Or the recruiter is shnockered (not unlikely — we/re talking Biglaw, right?).  And NEVER order a wine spritzer.  Ever!  (No, reason — I just hate wine spritzers).
- Wipe your hands with a tissue or handkerchief before shaking hands — nothing is worse than a cold or clammy handshake.
- Don’t wear sunglasses — unless your eyes are bloodshot from a long night of debauchery. Then by all means, you better wear them.  On balance, looking downtown and hip is likely better than looking like a drunk.
- Don’t tell any dirty jokes or stories, even if the host(ess) does. And racial/religious/gender slurs are a total no-no, even if you are merely repeating something told to you.  David Duke is likely not the person who will be interviewing you.
- Don’t put your feet up on the desk — even if you ask first. You may knock over the recruiter’s photo of him/herself with Justin Bieber.   Or his/her kid’s popsicle stick model of the old Supreme Court building.
- Finally, be polite. Always say please and thank you, as you were taught long ago.  And raise your hand if you have to go to the bathroom.  No grunting, fist bumps, or chest bumps.
And don’t bring your mother into the interview.   Tell her to wait for you at the Starbucks downstairs.

# Judge This Book By Its Cover
## Women lawyers must never become complacent, we must never think that the work on a particular issue is settled. The book stresses that point.

In dinosaur days, when I went to law school, books about women lawyers didn’t exist due to the paucity of women in practice. In the past 20 years or so, books have been written about women lawyers and their accomplishments. [Dahlia Lithwick’s new book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahlia_Lithwick), “Lady Justice,” focuses on the accomplishments of women lawyers — some well known, others not, but all of them have contributed to where the law is today and how the fight for justice continues.

The book’s subtitle is apt: “Women, The Law, and The Battle to Save America.” Lithwick has been a senior editor for Slate for years, and the book is valuable and insightful, reporting on women lawyers who have battled inside and outside the courtrooms to preserve democracy. Not an easy task.

Looking back from the perspective of more than 40 years in the profession, I know that women in the law have come a long way, but we are not there yet. And if anything tells us that, it’s the Dobbs decision. Women lawyers must never become complacent, we must never think that the work on a particular issue is settled. The book stresses that point.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Lithwick’s book couldn’t be timelier as hard-fought rights won and taken for granted face inroads and even rollbacks. She profiles a number of women lawyers — some familiar names and some not so — all of whom have been engaged in hard-fought battles to preserve our democracy, especially over the past six years. Vigilance is more important than ever. These are perilous times. All of these women are profiles in courage whose belief is that the law is there to serve all of us, whether it’s voter suppression, reapportionment, abortion, immigration, or the panoply of other issues facing us.

Who does Lithwick choose to highlight? She starts with Pauli Murray, “the most important woman lawyer that few people know about” who was “one of the most visionary and effective race and gender equality lawyers of the twentieth century.” Among her many accomplishments was her determination to make sure that the word “sex” was included in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. That was just one of many achievements, but her work on the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments in a law school paper, subsequently used by the NAACP in the Brown v. Board of Education litigation, was not acknowledged. Watch the [documentary about Murray’s life and career](https://www.amazon.com/My-Name-Pauli-Murray/dp/B09DMPMWCP), especially if you know nothing about her and her many contributions to the development of the law in her lifetime.

Also profiled is Sally Yates, who was the acting attorney general when Donald Trump became president and who almost immediately signed the order banning entry into the United States by immigrants and refugees from certain specified countries with substantial Muslim-majority populations. Yates could not in good conscience as the acting attorney general represent that the Trump travel ban was justified. Trump fired her.

Another women lawyer profiled is Vanita Gupta, now the CEO and president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who says that right now it’s not just about litigation, it’s about organizing groups and coalitions to work together. In her career, she has, among other positions, worked for the ACLU on racial justice issues and the DOJ Civil Rights Division under Eric Holder. One point Gupta makes is that change is often easier to make from the inside, and thus the DOJ job allowed her to do just that. Something to think about when considering career moves.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Another familiar name is Roberta Kaplan, who, along with Biglaw attorney Karen Dunn, litigated the case against the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville arising out of the Unite the Right rally in 2017. There’s Stacey Abrams, who has devoted her life to issues of voter suppression, and whose organizing efforts in Georgia gave Democrats a majority in the Senate in 2020.

Lithwick also devotes two chapters to the #MeToo movement, one of which includes her own remorse at not speaking up about the antics of now-retired Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski. The other chapter is, not surprisingly, about the Brett Kavanaugh nomination circus, and how Anita Hill viewed it all from her unique perspective (and if you don’t know who she is, Google her.)

But I want to highlight three women lawyers Lithwick writes about, perhaps not as well known in the fights for American democracy. One is Becca Heller, co-founder of the International Refugee Assistance Project. She mobilized attorneys who went to airports across the nation to help those affected by the travel ban as soon as Trump signed the order.

The second is Brigitte Amiri, the Texas lawyer litigating the issue of abortion at the Texas border. It’s a story like Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” even more dystopian because the story is true: an unaccompanied detained immigrant minor sought an abortion. It’s the story of the Kafkaesque procedures it took to accomplish that objective.

The third is Nina Perales, an attorney for MALDEF, expert in election law and who confronted the whole thicket of reapportionment issues amid the unsuccessful attempt by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census. She optimistically believes that judges want to do the right thing in reapportionment cases.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
No matter the circumstances, no matter how many successful verdicts, no matter how many times women lawyers triumph in court, the message is to never give up fighting for what you think is right. The message is to keep going, regardless of how hard the road may be. It’s a book about women and the law and power. And the cover of the book is pink.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

It has been an incredible privilege to serve as a member of the federal judiciary and to have served our justice system. I am thrilled to be coming home to begin the next phase of my career at Cravath, where I was trained and will have the opportunity to continue making a difference in the courtroom alongside a tremendous team.

— Judge [Katherine Forrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_B._Forrest), formerly of the Southern District of New York, commenting on her [return to Cravath](https://www.law.com/2018/09/12/ex-sdny-judge-katherine-forrest-returns-to-cravath/) after her [unexpected retirement](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/breaking-s-d-n-y-judge-katherine-forrest-is-leaving-the-bench/) from the bench after having worked as a federal jurist for just seven years. [Faiza Saeed](https://www.cravath.com/fsaeed/), Cravath’s presiding partner, said, “Having practiced with Katherine for nearly two decades at the firm, we are delighted to welcome her back to Cravath.”

# How You Communicate With Your Firm -- Everyone In Your Firm -- Will Define You For Years
## Treating support staff as second-class citizens is a mistake.

Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve joined a video lunch to talk about how legal services professionals around the world are continuing to work and continuing to find ways to communicate effectively during the global pandemic.

Early in discussions, it was clear there was an attorney/staff division at law firms. That’s wrong, but not so surprising. What I found galling is what little regard some firms had for support staff early on in the crisis and how the divide grew in the days that followed.

While many attorneys were allowed to work from home almost immediately, support staff were required to come into the office to retrieve, print, and ship documents to the lawyers working remotely. It’s also clear that while many firms worked hard to find ways to create flexible work environments for attorneys, those same firms haven’t done the same for their support staff.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Treating support staff as second-class citizens is a mistake. And how firms communicate with and treat their workers — all workers — will define them and reverberate for months and years to come.

Billionaire Mark Cuban made the observation this week in terms of larger corporate brands, cautioning that putting business over safety will define a company for decades. “Not only is it smart to take care of your employees, but it’s also good business and that’s the way I’m looking at it,” [Cuban told MSNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/coronavirus-mark-cuban-warns-against-rushing-employees-back-to-work.html).

We’ve already seen[ backlash and backstepping](https://www.kennedy-center.org/education/mo-willems/) by firms too quick to try to go back to business as usual. In fairness, many firms have been doing right by their employees from the very start. They were quick to cut nonessential activities and make accommodations and adjustments for their support staff. And, importantly, when some employees were treated differently than others, they explained why and worked quickly to address the disparities.

But many others have employees who’ve been grumbling and outright angry about how they are being marginalized. This comment continues to stick with me: “My life is not as valuable as our attorneys.”

This is a good time to think through how you’re communicating and how you want your firm and its management decisions remembered during this crisis. Some ideas to think through follow:

- Put safety and people first.
- Be quick with the latest news and updates. Silence feeds paranoia, guessing, and rumors.
- Let employees at all levels know you care by communicating that management is working to find ways to adapt and address the needs of all employees.
- Be sure that managers at every level are doing regular check-ins with all employees.
- Be direct and transparent about your firm’s state of affairs. You never know where a good idea is going to come from. An employee invested in the firm’s future will be more willing to jump in with creative ideas to support business continuity.
- Model safe behavior. If you are only rewarding employees who take safety risks to continue operations, then the message is clear: the firm values business and profits over people.
- Finally, continue to monitor how and whether you’re reaching employees in the most effective way. And don’t forget to invite feedback, hear out and address concerns with respect and empathy.

We’ve never seen numbers like this.

When you think about the size of the firm, its spread geographically, its client diversity and where they are in the league tables for transactional work —just look at what their need is.

— Michael Ellenhorn, CEO of Decipher, a company that tracks U.S. lateral attorney moves, commenting on [Latham’s lateral hiring spree](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/27/latham-leads-in-associate-laterals-hires-amid-2021-deal-boom/) thus far in 2021. Between January 1 and June 30, the firm hired 274 lateral associates, the most of any Biglaw firm.

Many lawyers find themselves contemplating taking a position on the board of a nonprofit at some point in their career. Whether you’re a new attorney or you’ve been practicing for a while, joining a nonprofit board can be not just personally rewarding, but it can help you enhance your career by deepening your skills, allowing you to make valuable connections, and helping you further a cause that’s personally meaningful to you. 

With these rewarding aspects, though, come certain practical and ethical considerations. PLI is offering a half-day program, [Serving on a Nonprofit Board 2022: Practical and Ethical Considerations for Attorneys](https://www.pli.edu/programs/serving-on-a-nonprofit-board?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), which will help lawyers learn how to identify opportunities for board service, as well as the practical and ethical decisions that will help them maximize the value of their board roles.

Specific topics to be covered include:

- How to identify your best opportunities for serving on a nonprofit board 
- What due diligence you need to do, including identifying the questions to ask and documents to request and review before you join a nonprofit board 
- How to bring maximum value to your role by using your legal skills and experience to assist the board 
- How to use diversity as a lens through which to make board and staff decisions 
- The basics of nonprofit financial statements and how to recognize potential red flags 
- Identifying and addressing key ethics issues and concerns for attorneys who serve on nonprofit boards 
Attendees will leave the program with practical tips for joining a nonprofit board and an understanding of the important ethical considerations for attorneys serving on nonprofit boards now or in the future. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/serving-on-a-nonprofit-board?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

If you want to learn more, you can also listen to program chairs Judy Siegel, of the Pro Bono Partnership, and Raphael Stern, of Lawyers Alliance for New York, discuss the benefits of board service with Alicia Aiken on PLI’s podcast, [Pursuing Justice: The Pro Bono Files.](https://www.pli.edu/link/3b56426a168f45c2a5391d8f142ebef5.aspx)

It starts out so innocuously — Pepper Hamilton sent around an invitation for an event in their Philadelphia office. It should be super easy — if you’re interested in the event and are free on that day, mark it in your calendar. If you aren’t? Just ignore it. That’s it, that’s all you have to do to avoid a Reply-All scandal. But this being Above the Law, of course that isn’t what actually happened.

You see, the event that Pepper Hamilton was advertising is a judicial diversity panel. And, the event is sponsored by a few groups at the firm: the African-American/Black Affinity Group, Asian Pacific American Affinity Network, Pepper Latina/o Caucus, Pepper Pride, South Asian Affinity Group, Veterans Group, and Women’s Initiative. Which are pretty much exactly who you’d expect to sponsor an event like this. But one partner, [David Stratton](https://www.pepperlaw.com/people/david-b-stratton/), just couldn’t leave well enough alone.

Stratton forwarded the message to two other partners with a derisive comment about the affinity groups, “I never knew we had so many groups who want to be treated specially.” Which is just a shitty thing to say. Affinity groups are a wonderful opportunity for folks to network and find mentorship (which is [one of the best ways](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/how-do-you-get-biglaw-firms-to-care-about-diversity/) to keep diverse attorneys at a firm) and ask for pretty little in exchange. But because it isn’t something Stratton is personally involved with or cares about, he writes them off with a nasty little comment he intended to send to friends (I presume) at the firm.

Then, he replied-all with an apology, but, as one of the many, many tipsters who wrote in about Stratton’s comments reveal, not everyone was even aware of his original, wildly inappropriate comments until the apology was sent.

The worst part is, no one knew he felt that way until he REPLIED ALL with an insincere APOLOGY that INCLUDED his original message. Just wow….
Two thumbs way up for diversity and inclusion at Pepper Hamilton.

You can take a look at the email chain below.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As you might imagine, the firm administration was not pleased at all about this turn of events. They quickly sent their own email from managing partner [Thomas Cole](https://www.pepperlaw.com/people/thomas-j-cole-jr/), distancing themselves from Stratton’s off-color comments, and assuring everyone the matter is being properly handled behind the scenes.

We are disappointed by the inappropriate email sent earlier today by one of our attorneys regarding the Pepper Judicial Diversity Panel. The comments in the email are not reflective of Pepper Hamilton’s culture, which prioritizes diversity and inclusion as core values. We are proud of our Diversity Committee and the firm’s affinity groups to advance diverse perspectives at Pepper. We want to assure all of you that we are handling this incident appropriately, in a private manner, consistent with our values. We also want to encourage all of you to attend the Pepper Judicial Diversity Panel, which is a great event that contributes to the firm’s continuing efforts to overcome biases and ensure an inclusive environment for all attorneys and staff. If you wish to discuss this matter, I encourage you to reach out….



The firm is really trying, I get that. And as Cole’s email signature even says, the firm is [Mansfield Rule Certified](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/the-list-of-biglaw-firms-at-least-trying-to-care-about-diversity/), meaning they’re committed to take concrete steps to meaningfully diversify the firm. But, as much as the powers-that-be may wish that this email is “not reflective of Pepper Hamilton’s culture,” they have to face the hard truth that, at least in pockets of the firm, it might be. A firm’s management can’t dictate firm culture from on high, and Biglaw is often filled with fiefdoms that are insular from the larger environment (this is why it’s common to see entire groups lateral to a new firm together, as a piece that can be plugged into a new superstructure). The work lives of associates in a group are impacted way more by the attitudes and opinions of the partners they work for than the management committee.

It would be nice, and certainly easier, to think of Stratton’s email as a singular bad act. But for a firm that seems as committed to diversity as Pepper Hamilton, it would behoove them to treat this incident not as a one-off, but as something potentially indicative of the attitudes of more than just Stratton. This should be an opportunity for the firm to have more of the difficult conversations and bias trainings that ensure the inclusive atmosphere they want is what is really happening on the ground.

Another former Jones Day associate, Jessica Jardine Wilkes, has joined the [gender discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/jones-day-facing-second-class-action-lawsuit-over-fraternity-culture-of-the-firm/) against the firm, bringing the number of plaintiffs in the case to seven. The case was brought by former associates, alleging that the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system is used to pay women less than men at the firm, and further alleges there’s a “fraternity culture” at the firm. Initially, the case had six plaintiffs, two named — Nilab Rahyar Tolton and Andrea Mazingo — and four anonymous; Wilkes joins as the third plaintiff to be named in the lawsuit.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/06/10/facebook-lawyer-joins-bias-class-action-against-jones-day/) Law.com, the amended complaint adding Wilkes was anticipated by Jones Day, who said at a case hearing the plaintiffs may have additional women come forward:

Jones Day labor and employment partner Terri Chase indicated at a hearing in the case last month that the plaintiffs may be preparing to amend their complaint with additional women accusers. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss subsequently asked for a joint status report by June 19 that would explain whether Sanford Heisler intended to add additional accusers or claims. The firm filed documents Sunday showing that Wilkes had agreed to become a named plaintiff.

Wilkes was an associate at Jones Day from October 2014 to September 2016. According to her LinkedIn profile, she departed the firm to work as corporate counsel at Symantec. Wilkes currently works in-house at Facebook.

The lawyers from both sides in the case are currently tussling over whether the four Jane Doe plaintiffs should be able to continue anonymously. Attorneys for the plaintiffs have until June 12 to submit declarations supporting the Jane Doe plaintiffs’ request to continue without being identified.

# Biglaw's Choices In The War For Talent: More Flexibility Or More Money
## Why not offer associates both things?

It’s clear that following the COVID-19 pandemic, when almost all lawyers were working remotely, individuals have realized that the traditional 9-5 office-based approach just isn’t the only option anymore. It is in the best interest of firms to address their flexible working policies, as our research shows the next biggest single factor firms can continue to meaningfully compete on is pay. Firms must either offer flexible working options or pay their lawyers very well if they are successfully to attract, recruit, and retain the best people for their business.

— Duane Cormell, managing director of Realm Recruit, [commenting](https://www.legalcheek.com/2021/11/flexibility-trumps-pay-as-lawyers-top-priority-research-shows/) on the results of the recruitment consultancy’s annual [survey of legal professionals](https://www.realmrecruit.com/userfiles/RealmRecruit/WebContent/The%20Great%20Talent%20Shortage%20-%20Adapting%20Your%20Attraction%20and%20Retention%20Strategies%20for%202022.pdf?created=21-11-17-11-41-10&utm_source=Press+Release+Legal). About 83% of lawyers said if they were to look for a new job, flexible working would be important to them, while 81% said the same about money.

# Biglaw Firm Makes Big Waves With Gender-Neutral Parental Leave Policy
## Wow! The babies of Biglaw attorneys extend their thanks.

It was just last year that we updated our [Biglaw parental leave database](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/parental-leave-and-related-policies-by-firm-2015/), and it was then that we found out that on average, women lawyers receive 14.33 weeks of paid maternity leave, while male lawyers receive 6.3 weeks of paid paternity leave, less than half of what their female counterparts receive. Upon seeing how great the discrepancy was, and later finding out that male attorneys were being stigmatized for taking parental leave time, we implored large law firms to do better, writing, “[B]elieve it or not, men have families too, and some of them are interested in being present in their children’s lives. Give these guys some credit for taking an active role as parents.” Unfortunately, based on [reader testimonials](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-pink-ghetto-paternity-leave-horror-stories-from-dads-working-in-law-firms/), it appears that not much has changed for male attorneys in large law firms since then — until now.

We’ve received word that [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/winston-strawn-llp/) will be instituting a lengthy, paid, gender-neutral parental leave policy. By “gender-neutral,” the firm means that it has eliminated the need for attorneys to identify themselves as a “primary caregiver” to reap the generous benefits and rewards being offered. Winston & Strawn may be the first Biglaw firm to strip this language from its parental leave offerings, making it an innovator. (If your firm has a similar policy that we don’t know about, please let us know [via email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Biglaw%20Parental%20Leave%20Policy).)

This policy is applicable to all associates and of counsel attorneys across all offices, and is effective immediately, including for those who are already on leave. Here’s more information about Winston & Strawn’s new policies from the firm’s [press release](http://www.winston.com/en/thought-leadership/winston-strawn-announces-gender-neutral-parental-leave-policies.html):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Under the new policy, U.S.-based associates and of counsel attorneys – regardless of gender – will receive up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave for child care and parent-child bonding, to be taken in one or two increments within the first year after the child arrives. Parents are not required to designate themselves as primary or non-primary caregivers—a distinction that may not reflect the needs and experience of individuals in two-career households.

The firm has also created a Parental Leave Transition Support Program to assist attorneys who take a parental leave. The program includes: 1) a Parental Leave Liaison to assist attorneys in preparing for and returning from parental leave, 2) confidential career coaching services, and 3) “ramp-down” and “ramp-up” periods during which an attorney’s billable hours targets will be adjusted to aid in the transition.

“These changes are ultimately about human capital,” says Julie Goodman, Winston’s chief human resources officer. “We want to attract and retain the most talented people and promote their success for the long term, regardless of gender.” Offering a gender-neutral leave policy like this without later penalizing attorneys for taking that leave is definitely a way to attract and retain top talent among large law firms.

What is your law firm doing to promote gender equity in parental leave policies? Please let us know so we can update our database. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Biglaw%20Parental%20Leave%20Policy), text us at (646) 820-8477, or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog). Congratulations to Winston & Strawn for taking a leap into the future with this new policy. The babies of Biglaw attorneys extend their thanks.

# Biglaw Firm Goes Old School In Latest Recruitment Effort
## Imagine if there were no internet...

Sidley Austin is apparently trying to buck the trend when it comes to lateral hiring. While most Biglaw operations are looking towards cutting-edge technology, social media, and recruiting firms to fill their vital lateral needs, Sidley has decided to go old school. We’re talking like pre-internet style… that’s right, they went with a print classified ad.

And here it is in all it’s glory:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The best part is Sidley took the ad out in the New York Post. Not the Times or even the Wall Street Journal, but the Post. Perhaps they have some super secret industry intel that suggests all the best and brightest in capital markets really enjoy punny headlines.

UPDATE: Some tipsters believe the job posting to be related to Program Electronic Review Management (PERM) System Labor Certification. A PERM job posting (which is a part of the labor market test associated with the green card process) requires print advertising.

I know it’s a familiar refrain for us here at Above the Law, but lawyers love cool rankings — call it the L.L. Cool R effect. Sorry, it’s a bad joke and I know it, but I have to do something while waiting for more Biglaw firms to announce their year-end bonuses.

Anyway, we’ve got some Biglaw rankings for you to enjoy / waste time with. BTI Consulting Group has their latest [2020 Client Service A-Team report](https://www.bticonsulting.com/bti-client-service-ateam-2020) out. To come up with their list of all-star client service firms, BTI conducted 350+ interviews with in-house counsel at companies with average revenues of $21.8 billion. Then BTI asked which law firms are tops in 17 different client-service-related activities, including: Understanding the client’s business, uniformity of service, dealing with unexpected changes, unprompted communication, and anticipating clients’ needs. To make the A-Team, the following 30 Biglaw firms were mentioned most often across all categories:

- Jones Day
- Gibson Dunn
- Arnold & Porter
- Morgan Lewis
- Sidley
- Skadden
- DLA Piper
- McGuireWoods
- Littler
- Covington
- Baker McKenzie
- Kirkland
- Greenberg Traurig
- Reed Smith
- Seyfarth Shaw
- Ogletree Deakins
- Latham
- Wachtell
- Jackson Lewis
- Hogan Lovells
- Davis Polk
- Faegre BD
- BakerHostetler
- McDermott
- Mayer Brown
- Alston & Bird
- White & Case
- Hunton
- King & Spalding
- Polsinelli

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Michael Rynowecer, president of BTI Consulting, [told Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1224785/gcs-say-these-firms-are-tops-for-client-service) they added two new categories for this year’s ranking: Dealing with complexity and delivering a uniform service. And why did they add them? Well, it’s because clients increasingly demand those skills:

“Dealing with complexity and a uniform experience are now pillars of client service. Five years ago they were a bonus,” Rynowecer said. “I think that is a watershed event. I think you’re going to see more volatility in what clients want and expect in terms of client service, and I think this is the start of that watershed.”

Congrats to the firms that made the 2020 list!

I am frequently the only African American woman in the room. At the end of the day, I’m a Black girl. It doesn’t matter how successful I am. It doesn’t matter how many clients I have. It doesn’t get easier and I am still a Black girl in this industry. With that barrier, I have to navigate in a different way. How? By saying (to myself), ‘Get over it.’ I don’t make excuses and I don’t let the barriers navigate where I go.

— [Nicole Lynn](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-us/people/1015307), a litigation associate at Norton Rose Fulbright who also works as a sports agent with Lil Wayne’s Young Money agency, commenting on the [diversity issues](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/texas-inc/article/norton-rose-lil-wayne-sports-agent-nicole-lynn-15513004.php) within the sports management world, which she says are even worse than those present within the legal profession. [Andrew Price](https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-us/people/1006786), a partner at the firm, says Lynn is excelling at both of her careers. “[She] has been able to do both and do them well, and I don’t know how she does it. I get emails from Nicole at all hours of the night. She has never let being an agent affect her work at the firm.”

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 03.21.18

What Biglaw firm represents Slate management in the online publication’s question for unionization? Slate’s legal writer, Mark Joseph Stern, says of management’s stance in the negotiations, “It’s appalling that management has not only taken this position but hired a notorious union-busting law firm to enforce it in the face of opposition from every single person on staff.”

Hint: It’s not the firm’s first brush with right-of-center notoriety.

# Be Prepared, Because More Biglaw Layoffs Are Coming
## The third quarter could get pretty rough at some firms.

Firms are getting to grips with the idea that the economy will stay down for a while. The next step is structural change. Clients are thinking about how to lower legal costs and still meet their needs, and as we get into the fall, two things will happen: firms don’t want to be seen doing layoffs until they have to, but they’re also realizing the economy will be down for a while, maybe the next year and a half. This is all coming at the normal timing of annual associate reviews.

I think that layoffs are coming. It’s cruel to let someone go in the middle of a pandemic, and it’s really hard to fire someone over Zoom. Nobody wants the stigma of doing something like that.

— Hugh Simons, a law firm strategist who formerly served as chief operating officer at Ropes & Gray, commenting on the [likelihood of law firm layoffs other serious austerity measures](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/07/14/a-2nd-wave-of-potential-layoffs-looms-over-law-firms-3rd-quarter/) that could take place in the third quarter of 2020. Some firms have already conducted associate and staff layoffs (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-200-firm-conducts-associate-layoffs-due-to-covid-19/) and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-200-firm-lays-off-attorneys-due-to-covid-19/)) as they assess the damage the pandemic has done to their bottom lines.

# The Most Successful Biglaw Firms On Earth, According To ChatGPT (2023)
## It took the chatbot quite a few tries to get this ranking in shape.

The vast majority of law firm rankings depend on revenue, profits, and prestige, and here at Above the Law, we’ve covered just about every one of them. Now comes a new global Biglaw ranking that relies on revenue, number of clients, reputation, awards, and recognition by industry peers — and this time, it was conducted not by a leading legal industry publication, but by a robot.

It seems that ChatGPT, the chatbot that’s taken the legal profession by storm, has stepped into the law firm rankings game. [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/13/hello-chatgpt-which-is-the-best-law-firm-in-the-world-405-117321/) recently asked the AI tool to name the most successful law firms in the world. Here are the seven Biglaw firms it came up with on its first try:

- Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom: A leading global law firm known for its expertise in complex corporate transactions and securities law.
- Sullivan & Cromwell: A prestigious New York-based law firm with a strong reputation in mergers and acquisitions, investment banking, and international finance.
- Cravath, Swaine & Moore: Another highly regarded New York-based law firm known for its expertise in corporate and securities law.
- Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton: A global law firm with a strong presence in Europe and Asia, known for its expertise in corporate law, finance, and international arbitration.
- Simpson Thacher & Bartlett: A prominent law firm based in New York, known for its work in M&A, private equity, and capital markets.
- Latham & Watkins: A leading global law firm with a strong presence in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, known for its expertise in corporate law, finance, and litigation.
- White & Case: An international law firm with a strong presence in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, known for its expertise in cross-border transactions, project finance, and capital markets.

Pardon me, ChatGPT, but it looks like you’ve forgotten quite a few firms. Where’s Kirkland? What about Wachtell? Why aren’t any Magic Circle firms being mentioned? Come on, shouldn’t Davis Polk be here? Maybe Paul Weiss, too? It took our new robot overlord three more tries to come up with answers about the firms that were left out of its first round of ranking Biglaw elites.

“I apologize for leaving out some important firms in my previous answer,” ChatGPT said, going on to offer some basic facts about the missing firms, and later referring to them as being “among the most successful and prestigious law firms in the world.”

So, why did ChatGPT name the firms it did, and why were so many missing? This was the bot’s response, per Law.com International:

The names of the law firms I mentioned are some of the most well-known and highly regarded law firms in the world. These firms have a long history of providing high-quality legal services and have established a reputation for excellence in their respective fields.

In my response, I aimed to provide a comprehensive list of some of the top law firms globally, and the firms I named are widely regarded as some of the best in the industry. I did not include all law firms as the list would have been too exhaustive, but these firms are a good representation of the top law firms in the world.

And there you have it, just some of the most successful Biglaw firms in the world, according to ChatGPT. Just like its [questionable thoughts](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/chatgpt-crowns-clarence-thomas-as-champion-of-gay-rights-in-feedback-loop-of-stupid/) on prominent Supreme Court cases, the AI bot’s grasp of the best firms on Earth seems a little off. But, at least it’s learning some lawyerly CYA moves, like claiming that a full list of the best Biglaw firms would have been “too exhaustive” to name.
