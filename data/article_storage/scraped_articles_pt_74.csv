# Honoring Advocates For Women's Equality In The Legal Profession
## Do you know who Inez Milholland was? If you don't, you should get to know her -- and these other leading figures in the fight for gender equity.

Next year marks the centennial of women’s suffrage in the United States. In 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, providing that “[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.”

Perhaps surprisingly to some, women were able to practice law in the United States before they were able to vote. Indeed, at the time of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, the [National Association of Women Lawyers](https://www.nawl.org/) (NAWL) had some 170 members in 25 states — and many of NAWL’s members played leading roles in the movement for women’s suffrage.

I learned this and many other interesting historical facts about women lawyers in the United States when I had the pleasure of attending NAWL’s [2019 Annual Meeting and Awards Luncheon](https://www.nawl.org/2019annualmeeting), which took place here in New York earlier this month. ([Cadence Counsel](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/cadencecounsel/) — the in-house division of [Lateral Link](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/), where I [now work](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/) — was a proud sponsor of the event, so we had a table.)

In her opening remarks, [Kristin Sostowski](https://www.gibbonslaw.com/professionals/kristin-d-sostowski), a partner at Gibbons and the 2019-2020 president of NAWL, discussed the role of the organization and its members in promoting women’s suffrage. In particular, she highlighted the work of [Inez Milholland](https://time.com/4391874/the-society-girl-who-became-a-martyr-for-womens-suffrage/), a lawyer and activist who became famous for her advocacy of women’s rights.

After graduating from [Vassar College](http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/inez-milholland.html) in 1909, Milholland applied to the law schools of Harvard, Yale, and Columbia, but was rejected on the basis of her sex. After graduating from NYU Law in 1912, she devoted her legal career to advancing equality for women, workers, and people of color (she was a member of the NAACP as well as NAWL). She was especially known for her work on women’s suffrage, leading the giant 1913 suffrage parade in Washington — on horseback, no less — and going on a national speaking tour for the cause.

Sadly, Inez Milholland did not live to see women’s suffrage become a nationwide reality. She died in 1916, three years before ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, collapsing onstage at a suffrage event in Los Angeles. She was hospitalized for what turned out to be an untreated infection of her tonsils, passing away 10 weeks later. She was just 30 years old at the time of her death — and her martyrdom helped [advance the cause of women’s suffrage](https://time.com/4391874/the-society-girl-who-became-a-martyr-for-womens-suffrage/), which became the law in her home state of New York the following year.

Milholland continues to inspire advocates for women’s equality, in both society at large and in the legal profession specifically. NAWL president Kristin Sostowski said that she often asks herself, “What would Inez do?” But as Sostowski reminded the NAWL luncheon attendees, even though Milholland accomplished so much in her all-too-short life, so much work remains to be done.

And NAWL and its members are doing that work. At the lunch, the organization presented the Virginia S. Mueller Award to four of the group’s most outstanding members: [Susan Alker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanalker/), COO and general counsel of Crescent Cove Advisors LLC; [Elizabeth Banzhoff](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/elizabeth-m-banzhoff.html), counsel at Perkins Coie; [Tamela Merriweather](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamela-woods-merriweather-72755033/), senior vice president and assistant general counsel at Northern Trust Corporation; and [Heather Stenmark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-stenmark-a061624/), counsel at Allstate Insurance Company.

Of course, the fight for women’s equality in the legal profession is not just a fight waged by women. NAWL bestowed the Lead By Example Award to [James Chosy](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2018/12/10/us-banks-james-chosy-where-tech-leads-so-do-in-house-lawyers/), executive vice president and general counsel at U.S. Bancorp, for being a leading male attorney who supports the advancement of women within his organization. At U.S. Bancorp, the [fifth-largest](https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank.html) bank in the country, Chosy has achieved the impressive feat of building a legal department that is more than two-thirds women — and where women make up a whopping 78 percent of lawyers in senior leadership.

Inequality comes in many forms, and some have to overcome multiple forms of disadvantage in order to advance in the legal profession. Consider the story of [Grace Speights](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/gspeights), recipient of NAWL’s M. Ashley Dickerson Award, which recognizes lawyers who promote diversity.

Speights, an African-American woman, grew up in Philadelphia below the poverty line, raised by a single mother who worked in a drapery factory. Despite these challenging circumstances, Speights graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and the George Washington University Law School (Order of the Coif), clerked for a federal judge, and went on to become one of the nation’s leading employment lawyers. Today she leads the labor and employment practice of Morgan Lewis & Bockius — and does all she can, both as a lawyer with her clients and in her work outside the firm, to ensure inclusive and respectful workplaces and to advance diversity in the law.

The last two awards both went to organizations — fittingly enough, because combating inequality requires coordinated and collective action. The NAWL President’s Award, given for championing policies and programs to retain and promote women attorneys, went to USAA, the Fortune 500 company that offers diversified financial services to people and families who serve or served in the U.S. military. The Arabella Babb Mansfield Award, given for professional achievement, positive influence, and valuable contribution to women in the law and in society, went to the ACLU Women’s Rights Project, for its many decades of dedication to advancing the equality of women under the law.

All in all, NAWL’s 2019 Annual Meeting and Awards Luncheon was both educational and inspiring, a wonderful opportunity to honor leading advocates for women’s equality in the legal profession. I look forward to attending this event in the future — and to celebrating future leaders in the movement for gender equity in the law.

# Partner Describes Biglaw's Economics Perfectly: 'Unrealistic, Unhealthy, Inhumane'
## It's so true.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It turns out that [Biglaw] has a problem with economics. The nature of that problem is that all economies are cyclical. Over time, in any economy, in any market place, output will grow, then decline, then recover, then decline. This doesn’t suit [Biglaw], which only wants to see steady gains. …

The problem isn’t that economies are cyclical, that’s a fact of life. The problem here is that [Biglaw] can sometimes have unrealistic reactions to both upturns and downturns. If this happens, it’s not in the interests of their own attorneys or their clients. It’s inhumane and unhealthy.

Why do firms announce compensation news over voicemail? It’s not like these bonuses will never leak out if only they avoid leaving a paper trail. No one actually likes listening to long voicemails. The best feature of modern smartphones is that they transcribe the voicemails for you so you don’t have to listen to figure out what’s going on.

And yet some firms stand by the self-indulgent voicemail speech, failing to appreciate that every associate is rolling their eyes with the message on speaker just waiting for the good part.

O’Melveny apparently opted for the voicemail.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Since the firm technically has “Myers” in the name, we’ll give the bonus its proper Myers-Briggs name of[ a MSBLDPWM](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/pillsbury-special-bonus/).

May 31	Sept 30	Total
Class of 2020	$4,500	$7,500	$12,000
Class of 2019	$6,000	$10,000	$16,000
Class of 2018	$12,000	$20,000	$32,000
Class of 2017	$16,500	$27,500	$44,000
Class of 2016	$19,500	$32,500	$52,000
Class of 2015	$22,200	$37,000	$59,200
Class of 2014 & up	$24,000	$40,000	$64,000
Though maybe it’s more fair to say it’s “JO” since that’s functionally a June/October breakdown. In any event, back-loaded DPW matches for all U.S. and Asia associates and counsel hitting an annualized 1900 hours based on detection points of April 30 and August 31.

This is where I’d usually say that the memo is attached on the next page, but there is no memo. Maybe I’ll just record myself doing a dramatic reading of this article and post that later.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 11.01.16
## * Is there a constitutional right to smoke weed? This defendant says he was prescribed medical marijuana to help him kick an opioid addiction, and his bail conditions must be revised to allow him to keep smoking it, lest his Sixth Amendment right to participate fully in his own defense be impaired. How high were the Katten Muchin lawyers who thought up this creative defense? [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL1N1D11GJ?il=0)] * Baker Donelson plans to merge with Ober Kaler to create one of the largest Biglaw firms in the country. Effective January 1, the firm will have more than 800 attorneys, and one of the largest health law practices in America. The $400+ million in revenue expected to be brought in by the merger isn't too shabby, either. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/merger-plans-to-create-law-firm-among-50-largest-in-u-s/)] * ""[N]o one is dragging their feet here. The Justice Department is committed to working with the FBI to move the case forward."" AG Loretta Lynch and Deputy AG Sally Yates are trying to get FBI Director James Comey to wrap up his renewed interest in the Hillary Clinton email probe as quickly as possible before the election next week. [[Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/justice-fbi-clinton-emails-230549)] * ""You haven’t been able to do it with trademark law. You haven’t been able to do it with patent designs. We are now going to use copyright law to kill the knockoff industry. I don't know that that's bad. I'm just saying."" Differing opinions about the fashion industry emerged during oral arguments in the Star Athletica case. [[New York Times](http://nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/in-a-copyright-case-justices-ponder-the-fashion-industry.html)] * ""We are all feeling a little less confident. ...

* Is there a constitutional right to smoke weed? This defendant says he was prescribed medical marijuana to help him kick an opioid addiction, and his bail conditions must be revised to allow him to keep smoking it, lest his Sixth Amendment right to participate fully in his own defense be impaired. How high were the Katten Muchin lawyers who thought up this creative defense? [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL1N1D11GJ?il=0)]

* Baker Donelson plans to merge with Ober Kaler to create one of the largest Biglaw firms in the country. Effective January 1, the firm will have more than 800 attorneys, and one of the largest health law practices in America.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 09.22.17
## * According to a lawsuit filed against the NFL and the New England Patriots by Aaron Hernandez's family, the former football player who was serving a life sentence for murder at the time of his death had a ""severe case"" of CTE. Jose Baez, the family's attorney, said Hernandez had ""the most severe case [researchers] had ever seen for someone of Aaron’s age."" [[CBS Boston](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/09/21/aaron-hernandez-cte-results-jose-baez/)] * A man after Trump's own heart: During a recent speaking engagement, Justice Neil Gorsuch explained why he believes judges ought to be conservative on the bench, saying that ""the job of the judge to apply it, not amend the law ... even when he might well prefer a very different outcome."" Later, he said judges must stick to interpreting laws instead of rewriting them. [[Associated Press](https://apnews.com/f4db85d505434a3bb66265da4475b710/Supreme-Court's-Gorsuch-touts-conservative-role-for-judges)] * Uh-oh. Skadden is under fire for work the firm did for Paul Manafort five years ago.

Aaron Hernandez

* According to a lawsuit filed against the NFL and the New England Patriots by Aaron Hernandez’s family, the former football player who was serving a life sentence for murder at the time of his death had a “severe case” of CTE. Jose Baez, the family’s attorney, said Hernandez had “the most severe case [researchers] had ever seen for someone of Aaron’s age.” [[CBS Boston](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/09/21/aaron-hernandez-cte-results-jose-baez/)]

* A man after Trump’s own heart: During a recent speaking engagement, Justice Neil Gorsuch explained why he believes judges ought to be conservative on the bench, saying that “the job of the judge to apply it, not amend the law … even when he might well prefer a very different outcome.” Later, he said judges must stick to interpreting laws instead of rewriting them.

Members of the legal profession are keenly aware that the pandemic has brought about even more stress and anxiety than usual. Working from home thanks to the coronavirus crisis completely stripped down the illusion of work-life balance, and many associates have found themselves forced into a situation where they’re constantly “on duty,” even more so than before the COVID-19 crush began.

But with a renewed focus on mental health, some Biglaw firms are trying to invest more heavily into their attorneys’ well-being. As luck would have it, May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and this week is Well-Being Week in Law. One top law firm, Goodwin Procter, is showing its lawyers the love this week, in the form of a $1,000 well-being payment for all eligible non-partner lawyers, science advisors, and science law clerks in good standing in the U.S., U.K., Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Here’s an excerpt from a memo the firm sent out yesterday afternoon (full memo available on the next page):

As you continue to work extremely hard on behalf of our clients, we want to ensure that you are also taking care of yourself. To this end, we are awarding a one-time $1,000 wellbeing payment to all eligible non-partner lawyers, science advisors and science law clerks in good standing. The gross payment of $1,000 (minus applicable taxes) will be paid in the May payroll to those employed on this month’s payroll date who have not given notice.

You may use this $1,000 payment however you would like to engage in self-care and to defray costs you have incurred during this extended period of remote work – like takeout meals while working long hours or new exercise equipment. You will not need to submit receipts.

Goodwin is continuing to make an effort to support its employees during these trying times. If you recall, the firm previously [handed out $1,500 in two separate payments](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/goodwin-tech-money/) to defray the costs of working from home (e.g., well-being, meals, technology, supplies, and other expenses incurred due to remote work). At the same time, the firm announced special bonuses for paralegals, ranging from $8,000 to $20,000, depending on seniority and hours billed (memo available on the next page). The firm is really doing its part to make up for the fact that it earlier conducted a series of [staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/even-a-billion-dollars-in-revenue-cant-stop-covid-19-layoffs/) and [attorney layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/goodwin-stealth-layoffs/) during the height of the pandemic.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# 3 Ways To Strengthen Your Bond With In-House Counsel Through Secondment
## Secondment can provide a greater understanding for how to better serve clients in private practice.

Before landing my first in-house role, I read everything I could get my hands on about making the transition from private practice to in-house. Not only was I interested in how lawyers made the move, I was also interested in reading what I could about whether it was a move I wanted to make. From what I was reading, making the move was not easy and not always what it was cracked up to be.

Recently, I chatted with my good friend Florence Z. Mao, a senior associate at Ogletree Deakins, who shared with me that she was where I was those many years ago. She was in private practice, but she was interested in seeing what it would be like to move in-house. Flo did more than read about what it was like to work in-house. Flo temporarily made the move in-house through a secondment. Whether she decides to move in-house or not, Flo shared with me that her secondment allowed her to do something even more important. It provided her with an opportunity to gain a perspective that did not have before. With this perspective, she would be able to serve her clients better and bond with her client’s in-house lawyers in a way she had not done before.

What is a secondment?

It is when a lawyer is assigned by the lawyer’s firm to work temporarily for a client company for the purpose of meeting the workforce needs of that understaffed company due to a company employee’s absence.

What did Flo learn?

I will let Flo tell you in her own words. As an in-house lawyer, I would have to say that she hits the mark with her assessment. I am now an absolute fan of secondments. What a great way to strengthen the partnership between outside counsel and in-house counsel.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
In the last five months, I’ve had the privilege of seconding at a large technology company as their in-house employment counsel. Before this experience, I’d spent my entire career at law firms. It was eye-opening to finally see things from a client’s perspective. Now that I’m returning to private practice, I’d like to share three lessons I’ve learned during my secondment to help outside counsel build stronger relationships with in-house attorneys.

1. Respond, Respond, Respond.

In-house attorneys juggle multiple balls at any given time. Sometimes a question to outside counsel is for general enrichment (i.e., “What is XYZ new law in New York?”) or to prepare for an upcoming internal initiative. Other times, the question is more urgent. Maybe a C-level executive is asking for information to make critical decisions. Maybe it’s a tricky personnel issue and HR is waiting for an answer to take next steps right away.

Even if you don’t know the answer and need time to research, responding to acknowledge the request can assure in-house attorneys that you’re on it. By letting them know that you’re “on it,” they can move to the next fire they need to put out. Just as an associate might check with their partner on when an assignment is due, ask when your client might need an answer. The response may surprise you — they often need it ASAP.

2. Bedside Manner Matters.

If in-house attorneys are contacting you, they know that you’re the subject matter expert. You’ve spent hours becoming an expert. They’re contacting you because they’re unfamiliar with the area of law. Talking in an intelligent, but approachable, way can make a difference here

For example, I was on a call with outside counsel to discuss an international legal issue. Our paralegal wasn’t available for the call, but I told counsel I would fill them in afterward. Outside counsel then asked me a question about the underlying issue, and followed up with, “Or is that a paralegal question?” Even if counsel didn’t mean it this way, it sounded dismissive and left a bad taste in my mouth. In-house attorneys and paralegals work as a team — they’re often on the same page about major issues, so not everyone needs to attend a meeting.

As another example, a director-level employee and I had a call with outside counsel on a complex area of law. When outside counsel asked a question and the director began to answer, counsel would cut the director off and not let them finish. This occurred many times during a 20-minute call. After the call, the director called me to complain about outside counsel. While virtual calls are not easy, be intentional about how you interact with in-house attorneys and their only client – company employees.

3. Put Your Recommendation At The Top Of The Email.

In-house attorneys get many emails and phone calls from different departments throughout the day. They are often pulled in multiple directions. Some issues they deal with are easily disposed of, but others require intense negotiation with internal stakeholders and contain time-consuming problems to solve. As a result, emails that are long, winding, and don’t provide clear recommendations are exhausting and frustrating to read.

While it’s important as outside counsel to “cover your bases” and make sure clients have all the information they need to make a decision, you’ll be recognized as a true business partner if you can succinctly recommend a course of action at the get-go. Put your recommendation at the top of the email in one or two sentences. Then explain your reasoning in more detail. In-house attorneys will appreciate your clean and crisp communication and return with more business.

My secondment has provided a greater understanding for how I can better serve my clients in private practice. Bottom line is that in-house attorneys are almost always dealing with multiple fires on any given day. The best way we, as outside counsel, can support them is to partner with them to achieve the best outcome. The three strategies above will take you there.

# Greenberg Traurig Offers Voluntary Buyouts With 'Enhanced' Severance
## This is much better than layoffs.

For the past seven months, the coronavirus crisis has ravaged the legal profession, leading to salary cuts, furloughs, and in some cases, layoffs. But some firms seem to have remained completely unscathed by the global economic turmoil that’s been caused by COVID-19.
Take Greenberg Traurig, a firm that brought in $1,641,790,000 in gross revenue last year, earning it 14th place in the latest Am Law 100 ranking, for example. Back in April, we [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/more-good-news-from-biglaw-firms-not-cutting-back/) that the firm had offered “a good deal of transparency about [its] financial position” and assured attorneys that there would be no layoffs. At that time, there had been no word of salary cuts at the firm, and to our knowledge, throughout the pandemic, no such cuts were made. The firm made it quite far without having to take any major cost-cutting measures, but sources have told us that GT has now decided to roll out a voluntary separation program for full-time staff.

An internal memo states that while the firm remains in a “strong financial position,” many “roles and responsibilities have inevitably shifted” due to the firm’s remote working environment, and that some employees had allegedly asked if Greenberg Traurig would offer a voluntary separation program so they could pursue “other professional, personal, or academic opportunities” outside of the firm. Ask and you shall apparently receive, GT employees. Eligible staff members for the separation program include legal assistants, administrative assistants, administrative clerks, file clerks, records clerks, and hospitality assistants. Here are the details of the plan’s “enhanced incentive offers” for employees to voluntarily leave the firm:

As noted above, eligible staff members will have until November 15 to decide if they want to take advantage of this program.

(Flip to the next page to see the full buyout memo from Greenberg Traurig.)

We reached out to Greenberg Traurig for comment on the firm’s buyout plan. Here is a statement we received from a firm spokesperson:

We are proud of the fact that our disciplined management, our balanced platform, our committed shareholders, putting our people first, and allowing us to solidly perform thus far in 2020, have allowed us to avoid any across-the-board layoffs or compensation reductions for our lawyers or staff at any levels this year, notwithstanding the pandemic. However, as we now look forward and plan for our future, and what our clients’ and lawyers’ needs are likely to be, we felt remote working has made this program sensible at this time. It is being offered to a majority of our US offices.

A federal judge just approved a deal between a Biglaw firm and “the longest-lived dead law firm in the Western World.” To what defunct Biglaw firm, founded in the 1853 and dissolved in 2006, was she referring?

Hint: Lawyers in the case were quick to point out that, in fact, Brobeck is the longest living dead law firm, still kicking around in the California bankruptcy system 13 years after its death.

Answer: Coudert Brothers, founded by brothers Frederic René Coudert, Sr., Charles Coudert, Jr., and Louis Leonce Coudert. The international law-focused firm had an impressive history. Frederic himself was [tapped for the U.S. Supreme Court by Grover Cleveland](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9902E3DF1139E333A25752C2A9649D946297D6CF) and declined the offer — the slot eventually went to Justice Edward White who would later go on to serve as Chief Justice.

# In-Person Meetings With Adversaries Can Be Valuable
## The best way to build rapport with a counterpart can be to meet in person.

Over the past two years, lawyers have been conducting meetings remotely that often used to take place in person before the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, it makes sense that people would favor virtual meetings during the pandemic rather than in-person ones in order to promote social distancing and keep people safe. However, as people ease back into the new normal now that COVID-19 has subsided to some degree, lawyers and courts are operating in person in many contexts just like before the pandemic. Lawyers should also try to meet adversaries in person more often whenever they can now that operations are somewhat returning to normal so that attorneys can realize the benefits of in-person meetups.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, I rarely, if ever, met any of my adversaries in person. I rarely went to court to argue motions or for other appearances since only the senior lawyers on my team were trusted to argue matters in court. In addition, since the matters were so big, clients rarely wanted me and other junior attorneys to be involved in meetings. Of course, sometimes I would tag along with senior lawyers, but this was a rare event, and I was scarcely an active participant in such meetings.

When I left Biglaw for a smaller firm, I had a much more active role in managing my files. This required me to deal with clients, adversaries, witnesses, and other stakeholders to the legal profession. In order to ensure that things went smoothly, it was often necessary to have a good rapport with adversaries. Sometimes, it was easy enough to build rapport over the phone, but I quickly found out that the best way to build rapport with a counterpart was to meet an adversary in person.

One time, I was involved in a massive document production with an adversary. The document production was intense since we were claiming privilege and other protections, and I had to compile a massive privilege log detailing the documents we withheld from the production on the basis of some kind of protection. A handful of the documents were being reviewed in camera by the court, but my adversary and I were coming to arrangements about some of the documents, which lessened the burden of the court in reviewing the materials.

At one part of the project, I had to produce documents to the adversary. I noticed that the adversary had his office across the street from me. I suggested to my adversary that rather than mail the documents to my counterpart, I could just hand-deliver the documents to him at his office. The weather was pretty nice, and it was no problem taking a short walk to hand deliver the documents.

When I got to my adversary’s office, he seemed happy that I took the time to hand deliver the documents rather than impersonally dropping the documents in the mail. We had a nice conversation, and then we parted ways. After meeting my adversary for the first time in person, it was much easier to work through the document production together. This was likely due to the fact that my adversary and I could now put a face to a name and felt like we had more of a connection than we did just talking on the phone and exchanging emails.

More recently, I was working on a landlord-tenant matter with an adversary, and the negotiation became heated at times. My adversary kept gaslighting me by relating that I was requesting language that was not common and that was not needed due to the mechanics of the agreement we were negotiating. At one point my adversary said that working with me was like getting an IV in the wrong direction. If someone can explain this metaphor to me, I’d appreciate it; I still have a hard time wrapping my head around what my adversary meant!

In any event, when it came time to exchange the executed documents and the payment, it would have been simple enough to drop the materials in the mail. Nevertheless, I thought it would be easier and more personal if I hand-delivered all of the materials to my adversary’s office. The walk was not that bad, and when I met my adversary face to face, all of the tension in the negotiation was gone. We had a nice conversation about our careers, and then we exchanged our documents and ensured that everyone had a copy of all of the relevant materials. The rest of the deal went by without a hitch, likely owing to the fact that my adversary and I built rapport with our in-person meeting.

All told, as we all emerge from our COVID-19 cocoons, lawyers should consider meeting their adversaries in person more often. This can help build rapport that can be critical to ensuring that lawyers have an easier time working with each other.

It’s been a little more than a month since Davis Polk raised the bar on associate salaries, and while the vast majority of top Biglaw firms have already raised salaries in some form or fashion, we’re still waiting for confirmation from several elite firms on what, exactly, they’re planning to do when it comes to associate compensation.

On that note, we’d love to find out what is going on at Greenberg Traurig. With $1,730,230,000 gross revenue in 2020, the firm placed 16th in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, but from what we’ve heard, the firm has reportedly only raised salaries for associates in New York — but not all associates, mind you.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sources tell us that sometime between June 21 and June 24, the firm increased salaries for first-year associates to $205K. As far as other class years are concerned, we’ve heard that salaries may be individualized beyond the class of 2020, but with raises comparable to the new Davis Polk scale.

Now, what of associates outside of New York? That’s another story entirely. Insiders at the firm tells us the tale:

“[N]o raises have occurred in a major, non-New York market. The issue hasn’t been discussed, and the firm tends to handle these matters secretively and by office. Same happened with special bonuses: associates were informed on an office-by-office basis with a phone call and nothing in writing, so we don’t know what happens across offices.”

“GT is individually assessing each associate in select offices but it seems like unless there is extreme performance, the vast majority of associates won’t be getting raises. Per usual, GT is trying to keep everything a secret and telling associates not to tell each other anything.

The black box system is worse than Jones Day. At least people know about Jones Day, but GT gets away with murder. GT never puts anything in writing for fear of info being discussed among employees or ending up on Above the Law, so people would only hear about their raises and salaries verbally.”

# The White Sandal Elite: The Go-To Law Firms of Silicon Valley
## Which firms are the best in Silicon Valley?

One of the big takeaways from the just released [2016 Amlaw 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/?utm_source=ATL&utm_medium=Native%20Content&utm_campaign=2016%20AMLAW%20POST) numbers is that, although white-shoe New York firms have recently struggled for growth, their Silicon Valley peers are ascendant, thanks to a “frothy” tech market and the resultant IPO and M&A work. Of course, the Silicon Valley legal market extends well beyond the cadre of elite Biglaw players such as Wilson Sonsini, Cooley, and Fenwick to include a complex ecosystem of specialist boutiques and smaller firms with deep local roots and thriving practices in areas ranging from estate planning to restructuring to white collar defense.

Our friends at [Lake Whillans Litigation Finance](http://lakewhillans.com/?utm_source=ATL&utm_medium=Native%20Content&utm_campaign=LW%20HOMEPAGE) recently [opened](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/litigation-finance-leader-lake-whillans-expands-opening-palo-alto-office-300230623.html?utm_source=ATL&utm_medium=Native%20Content&utm_campaign=LW%20EXPANDS%20POST) a new Palo Alto office to better serve its Silicon Valley-based clients, including entrepreneurs and venture capital firms. To celebrate this new outpost, Lake Whillans is sponsoring this handy primer to the “white sandal” firms of Silicon Valley. Among them, these firms not only can handle every transactional need, but also do anything from taxes to setting up HR review processes.

Engaging these firms can help the tech startups, unicorns, and venture capitalists of the new economy avoid or contain problems down the road. Should legal issues arise, Lake Whillans can step in and help resolve them.

Saying thanks is nice and all, but appreciation doesn’t keep the lights on. That’s why when big firms want to really show support, they send it to the bank.

Vinson & Elkins just said thank you in a major way, joining the new Davis Polk scale. And as the 72nd highest grossing law firm in the world according to Am Law’s 2021 Global 200 survey, they’ve got a lot to share. Here’s the breakdown.

Class Year	Annual Base Salary
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$293,500
2017	$335,000
2016	$360,500
2015	$381,000
  2014+	$396,500
The raises will be retroactive to January 1 and will hit bank accounts in March. Woop Woop!

(Turn to the next page to see the Vinson & Elkins memo.)

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Firm's Complex Bonus Structure Provides Most Associates With Less Than Their Peers
## Not every firm can pay like Cravath.

When we discuss the emerging break between the [haves and have nots](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/2018-looks-like-another-year-of-blah-for-the-legal-industry/) among the Am Law 100, Bryan Cave is the sort of firm on the wrong side of that divide. The industry is pulling work from most of the top firms in favor of smaller shops or handling more in-house while simultaneously doubling down on the truly elite firms creating a tier of top Biglaw firms that seem stuck in neutral. Dig a little deeper on Bryan Cave and there’s a firm that’s suffered declines in gross revenue for three straight years, making it a poster child for this phenomenon sweeping the Am Law 100.

So it’s probably unsurprising that Bryan Cave’s bonuses don’t reach the heights that Cravath can afford. The firm’s bonus memo is now out and it’s eschewing the standard class year formula for a matrix of two class year tiers and billable hours that leave most associates compensated well-below their peers at other firms.

For the sake of clarity, here are the bonus ranges associates can reach based on where their billable hours are on a range of 1900-2300.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Class of 2016 — $10K-30K
Class of 2015 — $10K-30K
Class of 2014 — $15K-45K
Class of 2013 — $15K-45K
Class of 2012 & Earlier — $20K-60K

So to put this in perspective, a 2016 grad billing 2000 hours would receive $15,000 which would put them perfectly in line with their peers. And a 2016 grad billing 2300 hours can bring home $30,000, which is a sizable advantage over most firms.

But the 2015 grad faces another reality. A 2015 grad billing a standard 2000 hours would receive $15,000, while the same lawyer on the Cravath scale would bring home $25,000. The class of 2015 Bryan Cave lawyer would need to bill 2200 hours before they reached the Cravath par.

And it gets more bleak as we move up the scale, with associates in the class of 2014 and earlier unable to approach the Cravath scale no matter how many hours they bill.

Last year, Bryan Cave saw revenue decline for the third year in a row, [yet posted a small lift in PPP](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202780290815/). If that outcome repeats itself this year, we can look back at this bonus announcement as evidence of a strategy.

# Boutique Sues Winston & Strawn For Violating 'Copyright' In Rule 12 Brief
## Suing lawyers for copying your brief is... a choice.

“As an attorney, plagiarism is your friend.” A senior partner delivered that message to my class of incoming associates in our first few weeks on the job. After years and years of being taught to fear plagiarism as an academic crime, the firm wanted to drill home that exercising originality in word choice is often damn near malpractice.

In a common law system, copying what’s worked before is sort of the whole point.

IP boutique [Hsuanyeh Law Group](https://www.hsuanyeh.com/) sued [Winston & Strawn](https://www.winston.com/en) this week [alleging a copyright violation over a brief](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/boutique-sues-winston-strawn-copyright-brief/2/).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Advertising attorney Rob Freund flagged the suit on social media.

BigLaw firm Winston & Strawn was sued today for allegedly plagiarizing another firm's Rule 12 motion.

Hsuanyeh Law Group registered one of its Rule 12 motions with the Copyright Office and says Winston copied it ""nearly verbatim"" in a consolidated case. [pic.twitter.com/xnzuFTL3jf](https://t.co/xnzuFTL3jf)

— Rob Freund (@RobertFreundLaw) [December 28, 2023](https://twitter.com/RobertFreundLaw/status/1740218708050808910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Hsuanyeh and Winston both represented parties in patent infringement actions against the same actor in the Eastern District of Texas. Hsuanyeh filed a Rule 12 motion on August 23. On August 24, Winston filed a Rule 12 motion on behalf of its client echoing the Hsuanyeh motion. Hsuanyeh then ran to secure a copyright registration on August 30 and now demands statutory damages.

The cases cited by Hsuanyeh are… suspect. White v. West DOES say that briefs can be subject to copyright, but it’s about Westlaw publishing — and therefore profiting off — publicly filed legal briefs. Nothing about the logic of the case would carry over to filing a copycat brief. Moreover, the White court concluded that while briefs are theoretically copyrightable, publishing them on Westlaw amounted to fair use, so even in that extreme circumstance the authoring lawyers had no copyright case.

Newegg is closer, involving attorneys in the same matter where the defendant lawyer ripped off materials after declining to join a joint defense agreement and therefore stealing the work without contributing to the preparation costs.

Except the crucial distinction in Newegg is that the lawyer lifted from a draft brief. Had the work product already entered the public record, it’s hard to imagine the same outcome. The facts are so specific that the attorney in Newegg is on record that “[I offered someone a steak dinner if this case was ever cited or helped make anyone any money](https://www.law360.com/articles/843231).”

But all that aside… why? What skin is it off Hsuanyeh’s noses? It’s not like they can charge Winston’s client for the work. If Winston billed its client for writing a whole brief when it just copied from another successful motion in the same court [that would raise ethical issues](https://nysba.org/NYSBA/Coursebooks/Fall%202018%20CLE%20Coursebooks/Ethics%20in%20Legal%20Practice%202018/5%20-%20NYCBAR%20Opinion%202018-3.pdf), but copying a brief to save the client money is just good representation. Does Hsuanyeh want the recognition so prospective clients know they did the heavy lifting here? That’s a fair request, but not a reason to let law firms copyright briefs. Because where does that end? Winston may be a goliath here, but the more common application of a brief copyrighting regime will be big dogs beating up on small firms and struggling pro se litigants.

Hopefully, Newegg’s lawyer will never have to lay out for that steak dinner.

# Biglaw Associate Sues D.C. Metro After Terrible Accident
## Before the accident, he had a promising legal career ahead of him.

Williams & Connelly senior associate Kevin LoVecchio suffered a horrible accident at the metro station near the firm’s office in August of 2015. According to court filings, he has been unable to work since. Now the firm is representing him in a lawsuit seeking $50 million in damages.

The details of the accident detailed in the complaint sound downright scary — as LoVecchio was leaving the station, a metal pole that wasn’t secured properly struck him on the head. He alleges he staggered above ground where strangers called 911. The National Law Journal reports:

LoVecchio claims he suffered “severe and prolonged” injuries from the accident, as well as mental pain and suffering. The complaint says he could not continue working as an attorney at Williams & Connolly and has lost income and possible future earnings. (LoVecchio is still listed on Williams & Connolly’s website as one of its 141 associates and, though disabled, is still employed by the firm, his lawyer said.)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Williams & Connelly is representing their associate, and it must be a relief to LoVecchio to have such heavy hitters in his corner:

LoVecchio is represented in his case by Stephen Urbanczyk, a Williams & Connolly partner who works on mass tort litigation defense for companies, such as those involved in vaccine, silicone breast implant, coffee maker fire and tractor fire liabilities.

“We typically represent firm employees in most legal matters. I have represented plaintiffs in this type of case many times,” Urbanczyk said in an email Monday. He declined to say whether he was handling LoVecchio’s case pro bono or for a fee, because that was not part of the public record, he said.

Before the accident, LoVecchio had a [promising legal career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-lovecchio-b1970b5) ahead of him. A former Third Circuit clerk, he had also worked for Elizabeth Warren while at Harvard Law School.

# Managing Time As A Solo

Almost daily I ask myself: outside of client appointments and preparing for them, what are the three most important things to get done today for work? I dusted off this forgotten approach in March 2020 when the COVID-19 lockdowns necessitated a rapid work-from-home adjustment. Before becoming a solo, for years I implemented this tactic while working as a law guardian, a child welfare attorney for the state of New Jersey. I put this method into place as almost a survival strategy to perform my ethical duties when I had a caseload of managing over 100 clients. I was visiting children at home and school, attending court around two weeks per month, reading discovery, replying to emails, fielding phone calls, putting out emergent case-related fires, all while coming home to the incessant demands of family and household management. Everything felt like an emergency. I was being pulled in a million directions. I felt like I was drowning.

I recall appearing in court all day, before stopping by my office to exchange files for the next day. When I  walked in, I saw a stack of discovery on my desk piled so high I couldn’t find the light switch. I still have no idea how it didn’t fall over. It seemed like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Looking at it made me want to cry. At that moment, I wanted to clear my desk before doing anything else. But it was already 5 p.m., and I had until 6 p.m. at the latest to make daycare pickup. There wasn’t time to address the tower. I knew something had to give and that the only way out was to prioritize the most critical next steps. I left my secretary a note to box the tower of discovery and to leave it in my office so I could tackle it later.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I left feeling defeated, only later to come to the realization that I had accomplished three things: 1) I had a plan for the documents, 2) I dropped off and picked up files for court as intended, and 3) I would reach the daycare before 6 p.m. Over time, three became my favorite number, and I had a strategy to conquer a forever growing list of tasks to accomplish. For years, to keep my head above water, the top of my list could be any emergency spilling over from the day before or making sure court was prepped for the next upcoming day.

My plan worked well until work changed dramatically when the pandemic hit. My strategy flew out the window as the top of my list became figuring out how to work from home effectively and efficiently like so many others. Spending additional time at home led me to reflect on my future and my goals.

Two years went by before I decided to follow a dream to embark on a new journey to open my own firm as a solo practitioner. I knew how to practice law. I was learning to be a business owner. My initial approach prompted the start of a giant Word doc. It began as a to-do list which transitioned to an outline. But this outline approach did not help me move forward. It was pages and pages long. And overwhelming. There had to be a better way. I was used to my routine as a government employee, but I now needed to multitask more than ever before. I started using an online project management tool to organize my thoughts and action items.

About a year ago, I realized this was not enough. I reflected on how I was able to juggle so much of my old caseload so effectively for years. It was my top three item action list. So, I started again, sometimes coming up with my list the night before, sometimes first thing in the morning. My list of three is not rigid, sometimes it ends up a list of five. Overall, this made everything a bit easier to manage, and I could fall asleep at night knowing I had at least accomplished that list.

While it is tempting to bite off more than one can chew, I create a reasonable short list, breaking things down as much as possible. Think of the list as snacks to sustain yourself throughout the day, rather than a big, full-course meal leading to a nap. Clean my office. Not a reasonable action item for the day unless I wasn’t planning on working on anything else. Instead, clean out the blue box sitting inside my office closet. If the box is cleaned out first, I can more effectively clear off my desk. The desk is a separate action item. The goal is to aim for attainable, achievable to-do items. Plus, there’s nothing better than checking things off a to-do list.

Once I quickly brainstorm my most important items, I consider how long each will take, how many meetings I have for the day, how much time I have before needing to be somewhere at the end of the day and the realistic timeframe for completing each of them. One caveat here, I never think things will take as long as they do. Ever. It’s my Achilles’ heel. But, I try my best to consider time. I then choose which is the most important and that’s the goal of the day. The next two actions are my hopeful items.

In the pursuit of time, coupled with transitioning from being a government attorney to a solo practitioner, learning to integrate a time management system has been a critical part of my journey. As I write this article, which was originally intended to be about opening my own solo practice after leaving the government, I question if writing about managing time counts. As I’ve shown in this article, setting up systems to manage my time has been key to making that transition.  Can I cross the task of writing off for the day, or should I create a new blank Word doc? The point was to write today; I’m crossing it off my list. Accepting that my article is done rather than perfect (a challenge for a lawyer with Type A tendencies), maximizing productivity, and learning to prioritize between being an entrepreneur and practicing law is the key to a small business staying afloat.

# Productivity Data: Here's How Lawyers Get Work Done

One of the most challenging aspects of running a law firm is making the most of your time. This is because managing a law practice isn’t easy. Your to-do list can quickly become overwhelming when you’re in charge of both practicing law and running your law firm.

That’s where streamlined law firm processes come in. If you reduce redundancies, your law firm will run more smoothly and efficiently. One of the best ways to increase your productivity? By choosing the right software tools to run your law firm.

Of course, every law firm is different. The productivity needs of lawyers vary by practice area. Practice area demands drive workflows and processes, and as a result, even lawyers using the same software will use it differently depending on the type of law they practice.

The Benchmark Report

Benchmark data recently obtained from the MyCase law practice management platform supports this premise. The data was anonymized and then analyzed to understand how different legal professionals working in various practice areas used the features available to them.

The goal is to ascertain which features have the most significant impact on lawyers’ day-to-day activities and learn more about how lawyers from different practice areas get work done. To gain those insights, we compared the practice areas, with a focus on the most considerable variances in how productivity features were used.

The end result is the 2022 MyCase Benchmark Report, which will be a three-part series. In Part 1, we analyzed productivity data to determine how work gets done in firms and by whom. Parts 2 and 3 will offer insights from the financial and lead generation data.

[Part 1 ](https://www.mycase.com/guides/benchmark-report-how-work-gets-done-in-law-firms/)was released this month and provides lots of interesting insight into how lawyers get work done in their firms. It includes benchmark data that lawyers can use to compare their firm’s efficiency to other similarly situated firms and ultimately make better business decisions. Below, I highlight some of the most notable findings.

Capturing More Time

First, let’s look at the data related to time tracking. For lawyers who bill by the hour, accurate time tracking is the key to profitability. Among other things, we examined how lawyers track time and which features increased the amount of time captured. The most notable learning was how much of a difference passive time tracking tools can make to a firm’s bottom line.

Passive time-tracking tools work in the background and capture a lawyer’s work while using a software program. The data from the report shows how valuable this functionality can be for law firms.

Notably, 25% of the legal professionals who use Smart Time Finder recorded an additional 186,214 billable hours in 2021, which is 25 hours of extra billable time per person. Assuming a $350 per hour billing rate means billable time worth $65,174,900 was captured overall using this feature, which amounts to an additional $8,600 invoiced per lawyer.

Streamlined Communication

Other interesting data from the report highlights how different the workflows of different practice areas can be. There are particularly notable contrasts between litigation and transactional practices, especially when the practice areas with the most significant variances in their use of productivity features are analyzed.

For example, consider the difference in the average number of text messages sent from the MyCase platform per case in the following practice areas:

- Family Law — 20
- Criminal Law — 20
- Real Estate — 15
- Trust and Estate — 9
There is a similar trend with secure client portal messages sent per case:

- Matrimonial — 23
- Family Law — 19
- Trust and Estate — 10
- Real Estate — 8
As you can see, the number of communications sent varied across practice areas, with some clients requiring higher levels of interaction.

Better Collaboration

There were similar trends found with collaboration data. Fewer documents were created and shared in transactional practices, whereas matrimonial and family law legal professionals created documents and collaborated on them more often with clients.

Here’s the data on the average number of documents created per case:

- Family Law — 31
- Matrimonial — 27
- Personal Injury — 21
- Criminal Law — 13
- Traffic — 6
Next, the number of documents shared per case:

- Matrimonial — 24
- Family Law — 20
- Employment — 18
- Trust and Estate — 9
- Real Estate — 7
How Does Your Firm Compare?

Now that you have a better sense of how other law firms are getting work done, take a look at how your firm is operating and try to understand better where inefficiencies lie. Determine how the tools your firm has in place are affecting productivity, for better or for worse.

Consider how your firm’s day-to-day practices compare with the data shared in this report. How streamlined are your firm’s processes? Are you communicating and collaborating with clients as often as other firms are? 

This benchmark analysis is helpful since the more you understand how the technology you choose is used in your firm, the better your firm will run. By increasing your firm’s efficiency and productivity, you provide a more streamlined and frictionless experience for everyone in your firm and your clients.

# 5 Tips For Having A Long And Successful Legal Career
## A legal career is a marathon, not a sprint -- and whether you're a law student, associate, or partner, you always need to be thinking about the next turn in the road.

A legal career is a marathon, not a sprint — and whether you’re a law student, associate, or partner, you always need to be thinking about the next turn in the road. You might have achieved a major career goal — getting into a top law school, landing a job as a Biglaw associate, making partner — but you can’t rest on your laurels (unless, well, you’re ready to retire). There’s always a new achievement to be unlocked.

In my new career as a [legal recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/), I have broadened and deepened my knowledge of the legal industry and job market. Based on my experience as a recruiter so far, as well as my 20 years as a practicing lawyer and then a legal journalist, here are five pieces of career advice. They’re most germane to Biglaw associates, but some of them apply to law students, partners, and even non-lawyers. I hope you find them helpful.

1. Be open to opportunity.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The job I held from 2006 to 2019, as founder and managing editor of Above the Law — “legal blogger,” “online journalist,” “digital journalist,” or whatever you might want to call it — didn’t exist when I was in law school. And when I was in law school, I certainly had no idea that I would wind up in it.

Careers take unexpected and surprising turns, often driven by luck. And you can “make your own luck” by keeping abreast of industry news (by reading ATL and other Biglaw-focused publications), networking (in person and online), and being receptive to possible opportunities (even if an opening might not initially seem like your dream job).

When in doubt, hear the pitch or take the meeting. It’s not like [Persephone eating the pomegranate seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone); going to an interview doesn’t obligate you to take the job. But going to an interview, even for a job you ultimately decline or don’t get, could help you learn about a job that you do accept, make a valuable new professional contact, or land a client.

Going to a callback never killed anyone. You might get [stuck in an elevator for a few hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/law-school-students-locked-in-elevator-3-hours-during-worst-callback-ever/), but that’s very, very rare.

2. Always be learning.

To paraphrase the old motivational phrase [“always be closing”](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/always-be-closing.asp) (made famous by Alec Baldwin’s [star turn in Glengarry Glen Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk)), you should always be learning, especially in a knowledge-driven field like the law. Laws change, industries change, and the only way to remain relevant is to stay on top of the changes.

If you no longer feel challenged or stimulated in your current job, or if you find yourself working on the same types of matters or performing the same types of tasks over and over again, then it might be time to start exploring. If you’re no longer learning from your job, then you’re just collecting a paycheck — and while collecting a paycheck is nice, you can do that while improving your knowledge and skills at the same time. (I can relate; a desire to take on new challenges and develop new skills drove my own [recent career switch](https://www.law.com/2019/05/07/qa-david-lat-on-moving-from-legal-industry-writing-to-recruiting/).)

3. It’s no longer all about the benjamins (or prestige).

When picking where to start their careers, many law students go for the firm offering the biggest paycheck and greatest prestige (which often just boils down to prestige, since most of the top firms pay on the same market/Cravath scale). This is an admittedly crude way to pick a firm, but it’s the approach of many students, including myself back in the day, and it has a certain logic: if you don’t know what type of law you want to practice, you might as well “start at the top” and keep as many doors open as possible.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
But a few years into your career, armed with a better sense of what you actually want to do, it might be time to move to a platform that makes more sense for your specific interests. The uber-prestigious firm you picked for starting your career might not be the best place for you to build a practice based on the particular type of work you’ve selected as your specialty or the particular industry you’ve decided to focus on — perhaps with an eye to moving in-house in a few years.

4. Don’t go in-house too early.

Speaking of moving in-house, it’s the promised land for many Biglaw associates (and even some partners), and many can’t wait to make the jump. But don’t make the jump too early.

As Dan Cooperman, former general counsel of Apple, said on the [Legal Speak podcast](https://www.law.com/2019/05/17/tips-from-the-top-8-gcs-share-how-to-get-ahead/) (around the 5:30 mark), the best time to go in-house is after four or five years at a firm. That’s the amount of time you typically need to become fully confident in at least one area of the law, which will serve you well as corporate counsel and help you get the best work.

(Speaking of the Legal Speak podcast, I recently appeared on it, speaking with host Leigh Jones about how Biglaw has changed over the past 13 years, the role Above the Law played in covering (and promoting) that change, and my new work as a [legal recruiter](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/team/david-lat/). Check out the episode [here](https://www.law.com/2019/07/12/what-david-lat-learned-about-big-law-and-himself-at-above-the-law/).)

5. Don’t leave Biglaw too late.

The conventional wisdom is true: there’s a sweet spot for leaving Biglaw, falling somewhere between your third and sixth years. If you know that you don’t want to stick around to make a run at partnership, either because you don’t want or don’t think you’ll make partner, then figure out a good time to leave.

If everything is going reasonably well, it can be tempting to just stick around your current firm and collect a nice paycheck. And as long as you’re making money for them, your firm will be more than happy to keep you.

But beyond a certain point, your marketability will drop. If you search for jobs based on the desired year of law school graduation — one of countless searches you can run on the amazing [Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/default.aspx), a resource I use every day — you’ll find a bell-curve distribution: not many jobs for lawyers with under two years of experience, lots of jobs for lawyers with two to six years of experience, and then fewer jobs for lawyers with six or more years of experience (although this will vary based on a number of factors, including your credentials and practice area).

(Beyond a certain point of seniority, you ideally want to be a partner with a big book of business. Partner hiring doesn’t rely as much on public job postings; instead, recruiters play a major role.)

# Solos And Small-Firm Lawyers Shouldn't Be Afraid To Ask For Advice
## With some effort, solos and small-firm lawyers can seek advice about legal matters from others, and this can have a positive impact on their practices.

One of the benefits of working at a larger law firm is that there are often numerous lawyers that can be consulted when there is a question of law or legal procedure. Associates can usually speak to partners if they have a question about strategy, and everyone can talk to colleagues at a larger firm about how best to approach legal tasks. However, solo practitioners and small-firm lawyers often do not have ready access to another lawyer with whom they can ask questions and seek advice about legal issues. Nevertheless, solo and small-firm lawyers can speak to individuals who work at other firms and other colleagues to make sure that they are following the best strategy to serve a client’s needs.

When I worked for a handful of larger law firms earlier in my career, I enjoyed swapping ideas with other lawyers. At the beginning of my career, this was out of necessity, since I simply did not know what the correct process was for a variety of legal situations. As I progressed in my career, I became acquainted with various lawyers who knew a lot about certain legal subjects like discovery or appeals. If I had a question in a given area of the law, I would consult the person at my firm who had expertise in a given area so that I could figure out the best strategy for a client.

When I started my own legal practice over three and a half years ago, the first thing that hit me was how alone I was when facing legal issues. I had no one to talk to about strategy since I was the only person at my firm calling the shots. Six months after I opened my law firm, my brother joined the shop as a partner, but my brother and I practice very different areas of law. Many times my brother can provide helpful advice on issues, but at other times, my questions are outside his field of expertise.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Over time, I was able to build a network of solo and small-firm lawyers I could talk to if I had a question about legal matters. Initially, I spoke to other lawyers who shared the same office space that I had when I first started the firm. I would have spoken to lawyers who I knew from prior firms at which I worked, but I did not want to bother them, and many of my legal questions were better directed to solos and small-firm lawyers. Also, I felt that I would be taking time away from lawyers at larger firms by speaking with them about legal questions, but with small-firm lawyers, it is usually mutually beneficial to provide advice and then have someone to discuss questions with later down the line.

Over time, my network of people of whom I can ask questions about legal practice has grown considerably. Now, I have individuals in my network who are skilled in all different legal subjects and different areas of legal process. The good thing about keeping in contact with different lawyers is this also fortifies your referral network. For instance, I may have a commercial matter that is related to a bankruptcy issue, so I may ask a lawyer friend a bankruptcy question so that I can better represent my client. However, I do not handle bankruptcy law myself, so if I have a bankruptcy referral, I’d likely give it to the bankruptcy lawyer who I know is competent through our interactions. In addition, I know for a fact that answering questions about legal practice for other lawyers, especially attorneys outside of my normal jurisdictional area, has helped me get work in the past.

I would be remiss if I did not mention that people should follow guidelines when asking for advice from an attorney outside of your law firm. Perhaps most importantly, lawyers need to follow all ethical guidelines when seeking such advice. This includes not disclosing client confidences without permission, which should be relatively easy in most situations, since attorneys can typically ask about the mechanics of a legal process without revealing confidences. Moreover, if an attorney does not feel like they will be competent when handling a given legal task even after getting advice, they should refuse to handle the case. However, in most instances, there will not be too many issues with seeking advice from other lawyers.

In any event, it can be difficult to be a solo practitioner or small-firm lawyer for a variety of reasons, including the lack of other attorneys as the same shop with whom a lawyer can confer about legal issues. However, with some effort, solos and small-firm lawyers can seek advice about legal matters from others, and this can have a positive impact on their practices.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Firms That Refuse To Follow The Market May Have 'Crappy' Bonuses
## Sorry, associates, but your salaries are just too high.

A lot of firms that followed to $180,000 did so because they felt they had no other choice from a competitive recruiting and retention standpoint. But bonuses may be the first way that we see a splintering where some firms say, “We refuse to continue to follow, because our business model is too different to justify continuing.”

— [Dan Binstock](http://g-s.com/dc-legal-recruiters/dan-binstock.php), a partner at attorney search firm [Garrison & Sisson Inc.](http://g-s.com/), commenting on [how he sees the 2017 bonus season playing out](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/983191/how-associate-bonuses-may-highlight-biglaw-s-profit-gap) between the haves and have-nots of Biglaw.

(Speaking of the 2017 bonus season, if we take past as precedent, Cravath’s bonus announcement may be dropping sometime this afternoon. Stay tuned for the big news from Above the Law!)

# Trump Administration Pivots From Grandma Ban, Refocuses On Banning Refugees
## I cannot fathom how the Supreme Court thinks there's going to be a clean way to allow any of the travel ban to survive.

The Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to stay part of the Ninth Circuit’s ruling regarding the travel ban.

Last week, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court decision holding that the [Trump administration too narrowly construed “bona fide relationship”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/ninth-circuit-trump-travel-ban-defeat/) when it was figuring just which Muslims it was allowed to ban. Now, the Department of Justice is appealing part that decision to the Supreme Court, and Justice Anthony Kennedy has granted a temporary stay of the Ninth Circuit’s order.

The part that Justice is not appealing is the part that applies to “grandmas.” The Ninth Circuit said that Trump got it wrong when prohibiting certain familial relations, and Justice is cool to let that part of the ruling stand. The Department says it wasn’t banning grandmas in practice, anyway. It’s the legal equivalent of falling flat on your face and then declaring, “I meant to do that.”

But the Justice Department is appealing the stuff that applies to refugees. Because, you know, people can empathize with grandparents more easily than they can empathize with desperate people fleeing a war-torn nation. Or something.

The Ninth Circuit ruled that refugees who have received assurances of assistance from people or organizations within the U.S. had a “bona fide relationship” with the country, and must be allowed in. The Trump administration would still like to ban those people — for reasons truly passing understanding to me — and so they’re appealing.

Justice Kennedy granted the administration’s request to stay this part of the ruling, pending further argument. Truly, I’m not sure how it will all shake out because this was always the most confusing part of the [Court’s initial order partially allowing the ban to go forward](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/did-roberts-show-his-hand-on-the-travel-ban/). In pertinent part, here is the language explaining what a “bona fide relationship” would look like between banned people and entities in the United States:

As for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading EO–2. The students from the designated countries who have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a relationship with an American entity. So too would a worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience. Not so someone who enters into a relationship simply to avoid §2(c): For example, a nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.

The relationship has to be in the “ordinary course” as opposed to for the purpose of “evading” the ban. But, what about a normal relationship that is only made necessary because of the ban? The people the Ninth Circuit is trying to get in are refugees who have made arrangements with refugee resettlement agencies. It is ORDINARY for those organizations to help refugees. But that relationship would seem to be also necessary given that the order is trying to ban refugees based solely on their country of origin. Are the refugees “evading” the ban? Well, absolutely. But they’re also doing a normal thing refugees did before our country turned into a failed Republic.

And how does this all play out with oral arguments on the ban as a whole set for October 10th? Is the Court going to resolve this issue before then? Is it going to wait till it issues an order on the whole thing, potentially rendering the refugee issue moot?

Speaking of mootness, the whole “90-day refugee ban” think should technically toll on September 27th. Is Trump going to issue a new, 90-day “emergency” ban on refugees, then?

People, we live in a world where there is potentially a refugee who couldn’t come last month, could come last Friday, can’t come today, will be able to come in two weeks, but won’t be allowed to come after the Court renders a ruling a month from now… SUBJECT TO FUTURE LITIGATION! #ThanksDonald!

Trying to ban people based on where they come from instead of based on things they’ve actually done is very hard. I continue to be amazed that this seems to be an issue that Supreme Court really wants to consider. Any extension of the Trump travel ban will result in years and years of litigation, and the lower courts will feel emboldened to continue to test the Supreme Court on every iteration of the policy. Does the Court really want to be playing whack-a-mole with this thing for four years, only to have it all overturned by the next President like eight minutes after his or her inauguration? Why is Kennedy stepping on the Ninth Circuit here? Why do any of them want this?

For that matter: WHY IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING? That’s the question that the Trump people have never satisfactorily answered with any of this Muslim ban/travel ban argument. What, precisely, is the security situation they want to achieve, and how does indiscriminately banning refugees help that effort? WHERE IS THE EMERGENCY?

Is there anything to this policy beyond its obvious bigotry and xenophobia? And if not, why is the Supreme Court so eager to pretend that there is?

# Law Firms Find Balance In Shifting Talent War With Timely Resource Insights
## As legal demand and firm capacities fluctuate, firm leaders must find ways to provide clients with swift and responsive legal services and prioritize lawyer work-life balance while maximizing the use of their resources and protecting profits.

Slowdowns in demand and looming economic uncertainties are driving reports of [hiring freezes and stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/) in the Am Law top 50. This and [other rumblings](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/want-a-big-signing-bonus-with-your-biglaw-lateral-move-not-in-this-economy/) of a diminishing legal job market contrast starkly with the all-time high rates of lateral hiring and associate turnover of the past 18 months.

During that time, [associate salaries jumped](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-laws-pay-war-is-dangerous-game-for-firms-posing-as-elite) by more than 22% in less than two years — a talent attraction tactic that, paired with several rounds of bonuses, led to a nearly 12% rise in direct expenses for Am Law 100 firms.

Firm leaders now must balance new compensation realities with traditional profit expectations. At the same time, today’s shifting power dynamics could signal an end to law firms competing for top talent through offering flexible and remote work options and other perks and benefits.

Will partners start demanding 60+ hours of in-office work per week? Or will firm leaders seek to maintain the positive changes the talent wars created, including fully remote work options and responding to associate feedback?

One thing is certain: As legal demand and firm capacities fluctuate, firm leaders must find ways to provide clients with swift and responsive legal services and prioritize lawyer work-life balance while maximizing the use of their resources and protecting profits.

####Allocate work objectively in a hybrid environment
It appears the legal industry may eschew fully remote positions in favor of hybrid work environments, which were adopted by nearly every NA and UK firm during the pandemic, with nearly 9 out of 10 calling it a permanent change, according to a recent BigHand [Legal Resource Management Report](https://bit.ly/3gB2gin) (that also provides the additional insights below).

Hybrid working is an increasingly popular practice that allows employees to work flexibly and manage their own schedules, but also benefit from traditional face-to-face time in the office. When asked about the biggest opportunities of hybrid working, 35% of firms cite the removal of lawyer preference or bias for specific support staff, for better work allocation to the most appropriate resource.

These are key factors for leaders looking to engage all their lawyers and staff in ways that motivate and reward their contributions. Because though firms may be regaining the upper hand in the job market, these truths remain:

- Many lawyers will not commit to eight years of billing 2400+ hours per year to earn partner status.
- However unintentional their biases, the apprenticeship learning model suffers when partners merely shout down the hall or only seek members of their “tribe” (e.g., sex, color, race) to find associates to work with.
- Relying on personal judgment and anecdotal evidence does not allow firms to leverage the full potential of every lawyer and staff member.
Decision-makers need real-time data on lawyer workloads and skillsets, paired with cost-effective matter resourcing strategies, to assign work objectively. Resource management technology helps pinpoint the right person for the job based on data such as skills, experience, cost, and availability. Leaders can also leverage a data-driven approach to talent management to:

- Evaluate the existing capacity and the future needs of each practice area
- Spot career growth opportunities for individuals
- Identify candidates who will be most successful in a particular role or location.
This alleviates the burden on partners—who over a third of firms believe spend too much time resourcing matters—giving them more time to mentor associates on the law and cultivate the expertise and trust with clients that lead to repeat business and referrals.

####Move to an equitable and cost-effective legal matter resource model
Firms not moving to a more equitable and cost-effective resource model risk missing out on new business, as 71% of NA and 63% of UK firms report pressure from clients to ensure they use the most cost-effective resources for their legal work.

Yet, 55% of firms have either no data or only partial data relating to the capacity of associates, while approximately 45% of firms report little resource allocation or matter staffing strategies focused on matter profitability.

Analytics on prior matter staffing, expenses, and budget variances lead to more accurate forecasts for resourcing current matters more profitably. Critically, firms can course correct early when they optimize their use of real-time matter data.

With day-to-day insight into matter staffing and resource levels, dashboards instantly reveal who is performing what tasks and at what cost. Supervisors can then act quickly to keep matters within the agreed price and scope of work. As a result, the firm avoids billing write-offs, write-downs, and unpleasant client conversations.

Data turns guesswork into productive strategies to evaluate capacity, assign work equitably and objectively, and control headcount while improving matter profitability. This is how firm leaders empower themselves to find a long-term balance that optimizes work life for everyone.

Once again, Seward & Kissel proves to be on a whole other level when it comes to firm culture. Last year, we wrote about the firm’s [massive miniature golf competition](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/seward-kissel-designs-worlds-longest-miniature-golf-hole/). The Guinness people may not recognize it, but the firm did unofficially design the world’s longest hole in the office-spanning event. Now the firm is back at it, holding a baking competition in honor of Pi Day.

Billed as the Greatest Baking Show on Earth, the event covered four categories of baked goods:

1. Cakes & Pies
2. Cookies
3. Cupcakes & Muffins
4. Other (this included everything from lemon squares to “mandel broit” (a Jewish dessert similar to biscotti))

The firm sourced judging from within the office as well as inviting a few outside experts: Melissa Tavss, founder of [Tipsy Scoop](https://tipsyscoop.com/pages/barlours) (liquor-infused ice cream), Spencer Baretz of Baretz & Brunelle (and his son, Noah), and Mike Denkensohn, the former Seward & Kissel COO. It was up to this crew to taste the treats and decide on winners.

In addition to Seward & Kissel personnel, the rules allowed submissions on behalf of family. As the ringmaster of ceremonies Steve Nadel explained, “We want Seward & Kissel to feel like a second family/home away from home for its people. So, if that’s the case, why not let S&K personnel’s family members partake in the fun and submit their finest baked desserts too. If your family is happy, then you’re likely going to be happy too!”

And it turns out, family members might have the strongest baking skills, with three of the four champions coming from the ranks of the extended Seward & Kissel family. The winner of each category received a $100 Amazon gift card.

I don’t want to name the winners in case they never banked on having their name spread across the internet — it’s bad enough for lawyers to be in Above the Law, to say nothing of family — but we can honor the winning treats in each category:

1. Cakes & Pies: Classic Haitian Rum Cake
2. Cookies: Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies
3. Cupcakes & Muffins: Banana Chocolate Muffins
4. Other: Peanut Butter Truffles

Haitian Rum Cake sounds amazing, though I’ve always been partial to a solid cookie.

Diversions like a golf tournament or a baking contest give everyone a reason to come into the office and socialize for a bit. Between longer hours and more remote work, keeping an office culture together is going to take some creativity. And Seward & Kissel keeps coming up with intriguing — and in this case, tasty — ideas on that front.

# Partners Shouldn't Take Credit for Articles Written By Associates
## Unsurprisingly, many partners have somewhat big egos.

Associates at many law firms have a number of tasks they need to conduct in additional to completing legal assignments and billing hours. At many firms, associates need to contribute to business development efforts that help partners originate new business. This process has the benefit of teaching associates how business development works so that associates are better situated to sign clients when they step into more senior roles. As part of business development efforts, many attorneys write articles about legal subjects that are published in legal publications or on law firm websites. Many law firms give partners authorship attribution even though partners spend little or no time writing these articles. This is not fair, and partners should not take credit for articles that they had little role in writing.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, it was very common for associates to curry favor with partners by writing articles and listing the partner as a first-name author. Unsurprisingly, many partners have somewhat big egos, and it can be a big ego boost to have one’s name on an article that is being published in a local bar journal or a digital legal news outlet. Associates would routinely be on the lookout for opportunities to write articles that they could attribute to partners.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, I was preparing to have a paper I wrote in law school published in a law journal. This was a massive undertaking since the paper was extremely long, and I had spent literally years on the paper during law school and my first year or two of practice making sure that it was ready for publication. When a partner got wind of the fact that I was publishing a law journal article, he tried to see if he could get attribution! I politely told him that this had been a years-long effort and I was not going to split credit with a partner who would do almost nothing toward preparing the article for publication, but this was the phenomenon I faced at that law firm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
There are some good reasons why partners should have their names on articles written by associates. For one, partners often have much more business development potential than associates. This is because partners are much more experienced in their industries and have many more connections with legal professionals and in-house contacts because of the time they spent practicing law. If someone sees an associate’s name on an article, they might not reach out to that associate for a similar legal issue they face. However, if someone sees a familiar partner’s name on an article, they are far more likely to pick up the phone and call that partner to discuss work.

However, there is a relatively easy way to deal with this matter, and this is to place the partner’s name after the associate’s name. It is common in the medical industry and the nonprofit world to order authors by who made the biggest contribution. However, it is far more common for the partner to be listed first on an article as a matter of seniority no matter how much participation that partner had on writing an article. Law firms should take a lesson from the medical arena and other industries when it comes to article attribution if they strongly feel that a partner should be listed on an article.

Perhaps the main reason why it is not right to list a partner’s name exclusively on an article written by an associate or list the partner’s name first is because this may be misleading. Sure, some within the legal industry may know that it is common for a partner to be named first on an article no matter their contribution to the piece, but not everyone knows this. By attributing an article to a partner who may not have played a major role in writing a piece, lawyers can give people the false presumption that a partner knows their stuff when it comes to a given area of the law.

Moreover, this practice makes it more difficult for associates to make a name for themselves and develop a body of work that can help them in career advancement. Depending on the article, authorship can be important for jobs and other opportunities within the legal profession. When someone publishes an article, it shows that they have taken the time to learn much about a given area of the law and that they might have certain skills which can be helpful in a number of roles. Attributing articles to partners does not allow associates to make a name for themselves as much in the legal profession.

All told, partners should not be taking credit for articles that they did not write. Not only can this practice be dishonest and confusing, it can impact an associate’s ability to develop his or her career.

# Hey, Look! There's At Least One Metric Where Ron DeSantis Is Beating Donald Trump

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign may increasingly seem like a losing one, but there’s one way he’s kicking frontrunner Donald Trump’s ass. No, it’s not (just) avoiding indictments. It’s DeSantis’s donations, well, at least when it comes to attorneys.

As [reported by ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/desantis-crushes-trump-in-cash-from-lawyers-seeking-alternative)Bloomberg Law, in campaign donations from lawyers, DeSantis has a 6-to-1 advantage — $1.3+ million compared with >$200,000. Perhaps that isn’t surprising. DeSantis is a Harvard Law-educated lawyer, and a Federalist Society member to boot.

Plus, you know, Trump has a habit of shitting all over the legal norms lawyers are supposed to uphold.

“Trump is clearly at this stage antagonistic to a lot of the traditional legal norms, so that presents problems,” said Mark Braden, former chief counsel for the Republican National Committee. “Many of the larger law firms would be uncomfortable in supporting him and that flows down to the partners.”

And while DeSantis may not have a lot of momentum, he may be the best option for never-Trumpers:

“The thinking among a lot of Republican lawyers is that DeSantis is the best shot at Trump not being the nominee,” said a Washington-based law firm partner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “There’s a pretty clear-eyed sense that this is going to be hard.”

# Vault Rankings: Top Law Firms By Practice Area And Region (2020)
## Which law firms are considered to be at the top of their game? Let's find out!

Earlier this week, Vault released its closely watched rankings of the nation’s [100 most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2020/). It was there that we learned Cravath held onto its title as the most prestigious firm in America for the fourth year in a row, edging out Wachtell — the firm that once held the top slot for 13 years — by .377 points.

But what if your firm wasn’t top-ranked in the Vault 100? Perhaps your firm isn’t the most prestigious, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have clout. Some law firms reign supreme when it comes to certain practice areas, and others are known to dominate entire regions of the country.

Which law firms are considered to be at the top of their game by practice area and region? Let’s find out!

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
For the purposes of the practice area ranking, Vault asked associates to vote for up to three firms they think of as the strongest in their own practice area, and the overall ranking indicates the firms that received the highest percentage of votes. Associates were not allowed to vote for their own firm, which we’re sure made many recovering gunners very, very sad. Current gunners may find this list useful if they know which area they’d prefer to practice in. Pay attention, prospective laterals, because this is useful for you, too.

We’ve picked out a dozen of the practice areas that were ranked by Vault (you can see the full list [here](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-practice-area/antitrust)):

General Commercial Litigation: Quinn Emanuel

Appellate Litigation: Gibson Dunn

Private Equity: Kirkland & Ellis

Litigation Boutiques: Susman Godfrey

General Corporate Practice: Cravath

Securities: Davis Polk

Bankruptcy: Weil Gotshal

Energy, Oil and Gas: Vinson & Elkins

Intellectual Property: Fish & Richardson

Labor and Employment: Littler Mendelson

Real Estate: Fried Frank

Tax: Skadden

Next up, we’ve got a ranking that matters to those who think “location, location, location” is the most important thing in life. Vault’s regional rankings are based on votes tabulated from associates who were asked to rate firms on a 1 to 10 scale based on their prestige within the region.

# Access To Court Records Should Be Free For Everyone
## One of the fundamental underpinnings of our judicial system is that transparency leads to a fairer and more just legal process.

A couple of weeks ago, a client asked me to pull some court records related to a matter my client had in a jurisdiction in which I do not practice. In both New York and New Jersey, the states in which I practice, most court records are free to retrieve online — for lawyers and the public alike. I expected this would be the case in this other forum, but as it turns out, this other state court charged a ton of money to retrieve the documents. I am familiar with how the federal system charges money to access federal court records through PACER, but I did not know that some state courts also charge significant sums for court records. In my opinion, all court records should be free to access by lawyers and the public alike for a number of reasons.

One of the fundamental underpinnings of our judicial system is that transparency leads to a fairer and more just legal process. As the namesake of my alma mater, Justice Louis D. Brandeis once said, “sunlight is the best disinfectant,” and our legal system flourishes when people have easy access to information. For this reason, court proceedings are generally open to the public and matters are not subject to sealing orders unless there is a compelling reason for this.

However, accessing information about court proceedings can be difficult if there is a paywall that prevents people from acquiring such information for free. Although the court system may only charge a modest sum per page, this can add up fast if parties wish to review multiple documents related to a proceeding. Access costs might not seem like a substantial amount of money to lawyers and law firms, many of which might get reimbursed for access costs from their clients. However, pro se parties, smaller nonprofits, and some journalists might not have deep pockets to scour certain judicial proceedings, and having a paywall can hurt the legal system by impeding their access to justice.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Some proponents of paying for court records may point out that such expenses help fund the judicial system, which is a public good. Most lawyers understand that many courts are understaffed and under-resourced, and providing the judicial system with additional revenue can help courts operate more effectively and provide better justice for everyone involved. However, the judicial system can access additional funds in many other ways. Lawmakers can allocate more resources, and the judiciary can charge additional fees for filings and other services. Putting court records behind a paywall seems to create more harm than the good caused by generating revenue for the judiciary.

Other proponents of paying for court records might believe that this expense puts a needed barrier between the public and those seeking to access potentially sensitive documents. Of course, it is true that people may wish that court documents be kept private due to the often damaging information contained in such records. Indeed, it is relatively easy for the public to access documents containing private information such as bankruptcy petitions, criminal histories, and the like. Having a paywall might separate those who have a genuine need for legal documents and those who are just looking for dirt on parties to litigation.

However, people should understand that if they are part of the legal process, information concerning court proceedings will be made public. Courts can restrict access to highly sensitive information, and in jurisdictions in which I practice, family court documents and other records are difficult to review online or otherwise. However, the judiciary should always defer to open access whenever this is possible.

I know there has been some efforts in recent years to make federal court records on PACER free for everyone, but movements should also exist to make state court records free. Judiciaries should consider how paywalls to obtain court records hurt transparency in the judiciary and question whether the benefits of a paywall are worth the harms.

# Best (And Not So Best) Practices For Billing Clients For Contract Attorney Work
## In some jurisdictions, it's illegal for law firms to treat contract attorneys as a profit center.

It’s no secret that some Biglaw firms treat contract attorneys as a profit center. They pay the contractors [a pittance](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/so-how-much-are-contractors-really-making-out-there/), they charge the client a fortune, and they pocket the difference.

It’s not a good practice — well, at least not for the clients and the contractors — but it’s common enough that clients are starting to rebel. Some clients will, in their engagement letters, prohibit outside counsel from “upcharging” for contract attorneys. Other clients will require their law firms to use specific vendors or [alternative legal services providers](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/alt-legal/) for work that would normally be done by contractors.

But did you know that law firms profiting from contract attorneys is actually impermissible in some jurisdictions? As noted in the [Texas Lawyer](http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202789350937/Where-Should-Firms-Draw-Line-on-Contract-Lawyers?mcode=1202615604418), state bar ethical rules in Texas and Maryland forbid upcharging for contract attorney work.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And at least one litigation powerhouse [doesn’t upcharge for contractors](http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202789350937/Where-Should-Firms-Draw-Line-on-Contract-Lawyers?mcode=1202615604418) across the board, regardless of jurisdiction:

Susman Godfrey has a policy when it comes to contract lawyers: The high-flying litigation firm discloses to clients exactly how much the temporary attorneys cost, and that’s exactly what the client pays.
In other words: No surcharge.

“We do a pure pass through,” said Erica Harris, Susman’s hiring partner and chairwoman of its employment committee….

The Houston-based firm applies the same standard in all its other offices as well — New York, Seattle and Los Angeles.

That’s classy — and it hasn’t prevented the firm from thriving either. Any firm that pays a [$25,000 starting bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/associate-bonus-watch-which-firm-now-offers-up-to-125000-in-associate-starting-bonuses/) — on top of a starting salary of $190,000, clerkship bonuses of [$80,000 to $100,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/clerkship-bonus-raises-three-is-a-trend/), and [generous year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-and-new-partner-watch-susman-godfrey/) — can’t be doing that badly.

# More Than 100 Biglaw Firms Tackled Their Diversity Issues During The Pandemic
## This is a great start but there's still much more work that needs to be done.

Diversity continues to be a difficult concept for law firms to wrap their arms around, and to do so during a pandemic seemed all but impossible, but somehow, someway, they did it. More than 100 firms were able to deliver on their commitment to diversity during the worst of times, all thanks to the Mansfield certification process.

Back in 2017, the Diversity Lab came up with the idea to [hold Biglaw firms accountable](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/get-ready-for-the-biglaw-rooney-rule-as-firms-try-to-actually-do-something-about-diversity/?rf=1) for their diversity goals by employing a program modeled after the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview a minority candidate for head coach or general manager vacancies. Here, the Mansfield rule — named for Arabella Mansfield, the first woman admitted to practice law in the U.S. — encourages Biglaw firms to consider two or more candidates who are women, LGBTQ+, or attorneys of color when hiring for leadership and governance roles, promoting attorneys to equity partner, and hiring lateral attorneys. To be considered “Mansfield Certified” by Diversity Lab, a firm needs to show that 30 percent of the candidate pool for these positions are diverse.

For the first time during Diversity Lab’s four-year-old program, all firms involved in this round were able to achieve certification. This time around, Mansfield 4.0, firms that wanted to achieve “Mansfield Plus” certification had to ensure that 30% of the lawyers staffed on matters resulting from formal pitch meetings be from historically underrepresented groups (on top of the existing requirement that these lawyers make up 30% of notable leadership roles). Ninety-two of the 118 Mansfield-certified firms achieved “Mansfield Plus” certification during the pandemic.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As reported by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2021/09/13/for-the-first-time-all-of-mansfield-programs-law-firms-achieve-certification/), firms that dedicated themselves to diversity saw a real change in the composition of their leadership:

[W]hile non-Mansfield firms saw racial and ethnic diversity in their management committees stay relatively the same, from 8.6% to 8.7%, between 2017 to 2019, Mansfield firms saw a 4.4 percentage point increase, from 8.2% to 12.6% in that same time frame. The increase among Mansfield firms was about 30 times more than the increase among non-Mansfield firms.

“Despite the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, the Mansfield Rule certified firms have not deviated from their goal of ensuring that law firm leadership reflects the rich diversity of the profession,” said Natalia Marulanda, Diversity Lab’s Mansfield Rule director. “We are enormously proud to work with such a committed group of firms.”

So, which firms are now Mansfield certified? Here are the 118 firms — and those with an asterisk are “Mansfield Plus” certified.

Teamwork makes the dream work!

In February of 2020, Troutman Sanders announced bonuses that associates described as “[a slap in the face](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/troutman-bonus-2019/).” Two months earlier, Pepper Hamilton enraged its associates by offering a bonus structure where “[8th years are still making the same bonus as a first year at other firms with market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/pepper-bonus-2019/).” But then these two maligned firms got together to create Troutman Pepper and 2021 is a whole different story.

First, some bonuses:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


Those are market bonuses, folks! And there aren’t any limits based on which office associates serve in — all associates in good standing with 1950 in annualized billables (up to 100 pro bono hours) will qualify. The first payment will be in July 2021 and the second in January 2022. Associates will have the opportunity to catch up if they miss out on the first payout.

That’s great news all by itself, but, as they say, just wait, there’s more! The firm announced base salary raises across the country:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
This isn’t the first firm this cycle to announce upward adjustments to salaries in less-than-marquee markets, but this is epic news considering where associates were last year. I ended my piece on last year’s bonus situation at the two firms with the line, “Hey, maybe 1+1=3!” and wouldn’t you know it, sometimes the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Full memo on the next page…

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Salary Increases Reach Biglaw Offices In China
## Lawyers in China get good news about salary.

We’ve noticed a bit of Biglaw schizophrenia when it comes to international offices. Some firms are dutifully including their overseas lawyers — [particularly London folks](http://www.legalcheek.com/2016/06/akin-gump-london-office-latest-to-up-nq-pay-to-127k-and-beyond/) — in their improved compensation plans. Others have fallen completely silent on overseas attorneys, or pawned the decision off on their international offices, leaving associates on tenterhooks.

Cleary Gottlieb has now brought the salary cavalcade to Asia with a memo announcing raises for its associates on the U.S. scale toiling in the firm’s [Hong Kong office.](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-increases-reach-biglaw-offices-in-china/2/) We’ve heard the firm sent the same message on to the Beijing office, but have yet to receive a copy of that memo.

Unknown at this time is the fate of the Seoul office. Tipsters say the firm generally keeps its Asian offices in lockstep, but so far we’ve gotten so much silence out of the South Korean office you’d think it was the North Korean office.

For all the disgruntled overseas associates writing us about their Biglaw employers dragging their heels on letting you know one way or the other what to expect, feel free to casually email this story to your firm’s managing partner with a “Pls Hndle Thx.”

The Hong Kong memo is available [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-increases-reach-biglaw-offices-in-china/2/).

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Skadden Enters The Bonus Game
## Plus senior associates with 'extraordinary performance' will get extra money.

It’s not a shock when an Am Law 50 firm moves to match the prevailing market bonuses within a week of the first announcement, but it sure is nice for the associates there. The bonus season began when Milbank [took the plunge and announced bonuses last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/). Even though Milbank announced earlier than usual, Cravath[ quickly matched that scale,](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/) and now the only real question is when the other elite Biglaw firms will announce their own bonuses.

The guessing game has ended for Skadden associates, as today they announced they were getting on board with the prevailing Biglaw bonus scheme, with the possibility of slight improvement for senior associates. The bonus schedule — [which looks similar (though not identical) to other firms that have announced this bonus season](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/associate-bonus-watch-2019/) — is as follows:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000 or $100,000
Class of 2012 and senior – $100,000 or $110,000

As you’ll notice, Skadden leaves some extra room on the schedule for senior associates who’ve had “extraordinary performance” this year to make $10,000 extra in their year-end bonus. Bonuses will be paid by the firm on December 13th. ([Full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/skadden-enters-the-bonus-game/2/).)

Remember, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

Embarking on the journey of a law student entails numerous critical choices, of which, selecting among multiple summer associate or first-year associate propositions stands paramount. At Lateral Link, we appreciate the significance of this decision. Our crew of seasoned legal talent finders, many of whom have trodden the path of summer associates themselves, impart a profound knowledge base and guidance, empowering you to make an enlightened choice.

Assessing Law Firm Offers Beyond the Facade of Rankings

Though rankings may shed some light on a firm’s accomplishments, they can inadvertently offer a skewed perspective. Abby Gordon, co-director of our Northeast associate recruitment division and a past summer associate and associate at Cleary Gottlieb, articulates this concept as, “Choosing a firm transcends mere rankings. While the prestige of your first firm undeniably paves the way for future career opportunities, there is more to it. It equally revolves around identifying the perfect alignment for your ambitions, interests, and ethical values.” Scrutinizing a firm’s work environment, stability, and resonance with your career aspirations is indispensable. For further insights on firm selection, [refer to Abby’s counsel in a past ATL piece](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/7-factors-to-consider-when-picking-a-law-firm-to-work-for/).

Holistic Evaluation of Influencing Variables

“Approach your opportunities with a comprehensive perspective, taking into account your immediate and long-term personal and professional objectives,” recommends Matt Bennett, a California-based Lateral Link recruiter, USC Gould School of Law graduate, and previous summer associate at Snell & Wilmer. “I consistently encourage candidates to strategize their thinking, to not just fixate on whether they fancy a firm’s current practice, and this mindset can be immensely beneficial to newly minted attorneys fresh from law school. Delve into the firm’s culture, geographical presence, practice domains, mentorship programs, benefits, work-life equilibrium, partnership prospects, hourly obligations, remuneration, and incentives. Consider the professional relationships that you can cultivate in the firm and their potential trajectory. These are critical considerations, especially when you are just initiating your legal career and lack the foresight that experience gifts. Extend your thinking beyond macro-level professional objectives: contemplate how the attributes of a firm might facilitate your short and long-term personal and lifestyle objectives. Endeavor to envision your evolving work and life aspirations as time progresses,” Bennett elaborates. Scrutinize whether the firm champions diversity, nurtures a collegial atmosphere, and offers pro bono opportunities, particularly if these aspects are valuable to you.

Tailored Guidance from Lateral Link Recruiters

Our recruiters understand the intricacies involved in choosing between multiple offers. “Lateral Link’s team consists of past attorneys and law firm recruiters. We can offer personalized advice drawn from our market knowledge, firm-specific intel, and industry connections,” shares Amy Langan, Manager of Professional Development & Law School Relations. To encourage a comprehensive dialogue about your career trajectory, Lateral Link extends a complimentary 15-minute discussion to address law students’ queries and offer direction.

The Impact of Your First Law Firm

Your inaugural law firm can exert a substantial impact on your legal career’s trajectory. To demonstrate this, Gloria Cannon, our Managing Principal, recites her experience from her law school OCI tenure:

“After deliberating offers from numerous Am Law 200 firms, I chose to spend my 2L summer at Milbank’s LA office, where I was exposed to corporate, real estate, litigation, and bankruptcy/financial restructuring practices. After my law school graduation, I joined Milbank’s financial restructuring team due to its esteemed reputation, cordial culture, and the size of the group, which allowed me to swiftly take on significant responsibilities with extensive client interactions.

One of our primary clients was Oaktree Capital Management, a distinguished Los Angeles-based asset management firm, for whom I executed a considerable amount of work. Consequently, during my 5th year, Oaktree’s General Counsel directly invited me to join their in-house legal team. I wouldn’t have encountered this fantastic in-house opportunity had I not been a summer associate at Milbank.”

This anecdote underlines the delicate dynamics involved in deciding between multiple offers – the decision transcends the work type and encapsulates firm culture, training, and long-term career opportunities.

Deciding on Your Legal Career’s Initial Steps

The decision should reflect your career ambitions, personal values, and lifestyle preferences. While mentors, professors, and recruiters can extend guidance, the ultimate decision rests with you. “Refrain from focusing on prestige or peer choices. Prioritize the decision that best aligns with your future goals. Apart from the numerous variables to consider, trust your intuition when assessing firms and the lawyers you have interacted with during interviews or over the summer,” advises Langan, a former recruiter for multiple Am Law 200 firms.

Perceiving the Broader Career Landscape

The path to a triumphant legal career comprises diverse opportunities. Each decision you make contributes to your comprehensive career evolution. While the choice of your first firm is unquestionably critical, it is merely one of the many vital decisions that will sculpt your legal career.

Lateral Link recruiters are dedicated to assisting law students in navigating multiple offer decisions. We are at your side throughout this journey, ensuring your choices align with your career objectives and personal ethics, enabling you to make the most advantageous choice for your future legal profession.

# What The K&L Is Going On? More Partners Pass Through The Gates
## Where are these partners going, and what does their leaving say about the future of the firm?

We ended last week with [news of K&L Gates partner departures](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/the-latest-departures-through-the-kl-gates/), and we’ll start this week with more of the same. Here’s the latest news, via the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202751481519/KL-Gates-Losses-Continue-as-10-More-Partners-Join-Mayer-Brown?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=1):

In one of the largest mass lateral moves between two Am Law 100 firms in recent months, 10 partners have left K&L Gates in Washington, D.C., for rival Mayer Brown.

The moves cut deeply into K&L Gates’ consumer credit compliance and enforcement practice, which had [already lost](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202750900634/) five partners to Mayer Brown earlier this month. Factoring in 15 associates, a counsel and a staff attorney who are also making the jump, 32 K&L Gates lawyers have now left for Mayer Brown, including 24 in Washington, two in Palo Alto, California, and one in Houston.

The earlier group joining included the leader of the practice at K&L Gates, Steven Kaplan, and its previous head, Laurence Platt. Among those now joining them is Ori Lev, a former enforcement chief at the Office of Foreign Assets Control and a former deputy enforcement director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Lev joined K&L Gates [last March.](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:w9r04h543Y8J:www.klgates.com/kl-gates-adds-cfpb-deputy-enforcement-director-as-consumer-financial-services-partner-in-washington-dc-office-03-25-2015/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)

So Lev’s time at K&L was… short-lived. The other lawyers [joining Mayer Brown as partners](https://www.mayerbrown.com/Mayer-Brown-adds-26-lawyer-team-to-Consumer-Financial-Services-group/) are Costas “Gus” Avrakotos, David Beam, Holly Spencer Bunting, Krista Cooley, Eric Edwardson, Kristie Kully, Lauren Bergen Pryor, Stephanie Robinson, and David Tallman. According to [Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/kl-gates-departures-mount-as-10-partners-join-mayer-brown/), all were partners at K&L Gates except for Bergen Pryor, who was an associate at KLG.

What to make of all this movement? Here is one ATL tipster’s take:

[Your recent [article](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/more-departures-from-the-kl-gates-do-they-matter/)] wondered whether the KLG departures mattered. These were some of the most lucrative practice groups in the firm. [Steven] Kaplan, [Laurence] Platt, [Alan] Goldberg, [David] Glatz, [Michael] Abernathy, and [Paul] Genender were all high-dollar equity partners. They all decided to leave even though the firm is getting a large contingency payment from the CMU/Marvell litigation later this year [which ended with Marvell Technology Group agreeing to pay a [$750 million settlement](http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202749972201?slreturn=20160211101924) to Carnegie Mellon University]. They all stood to receive a payout from that but chose to leave and will get nothing.

Also your article did not mention Genender leaving Dallas — a serious blow for the office, which was [decimated by departures](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/barbarians-at-the-kl-gates/) last year. Like Chicago, the Dallas office is in serious trouble. The firm had to delay funding 401k plans for partners (moved from March to May/June). It also had to push back matching payments for staff until after the summer.

With all the departures, the firm is not likely to meet its financial goals this year, and only the CMU settlement will make the year look good on paper in December. But that is a one-shot deal and can’t be replicated. A lot of partners have figured that out, hence the mass departures.

We ran all this by K&L Gates. The firm declined to comment.

But we welcome your comments, dear readers. You can contact us [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=K%20and%20L%20Gates) or by text message (646-820-8477). Thanks.

# Black Biglaw Partner Writes Touching Letter To His Son Amid Racial Injustice In America
## The killing of yet another black person has put this father in an unenviable position. Here are the words of wisdom he has for his son.

I struggle with the juxtaposition of instilling hope amid my constant fear for the safety of my black son, daughters and stepsons. I’m not talking about that common separation anxiety experienced by all loving parents. This is an uncommon fear reserved almost exclusively for the parents of black and brown children, who themselves have been subject to blatant and unconscious acts of racism in their own lives. Parents living in this perpetual state of fear and worry that, at any given moment, our child will face a chance encounter with a real or faux police officer. And that a misconstrued word, sudden movement, slow movement or involuntary twitch will lead to tragic or fatal consequences. …

Rest assured that as your father MY MISSION IS TO KEEP YOU SAFE. I vow to forever stand with you and push back strongly against any forces that imperil your safety.

— [A. Michael Pratt](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/p/pratt-a-michael), a litigation partner at Greenberg Traurig, in a [letter written to his son](https://www.law.com/2020/06/18/a-black-fathers-letter-to-his-black-son-my-mission-is-to-keep-you-safe/) upon his college graduation. Pratt’s letter was originally supposed to be “a lighthearted celebratory missive,” but in the wake of the latest officer-involved killing of a black man, and after seeing his son’s “pain, despair, fear, hurt and anger,” Pratt switched gears. The Biglaw partner hasn’t lost hope for his son’s future, writing, “I remain prayerful that these emerging multiracial collaborations are sustainable and that our America will finally find a solution to contain those racist elements that hold such life or death power over its black and brown citizenry.”

In order to gain a greater appreciation of the encounters and situations that Black attorneys, paralegals, and law students face, I created a survey in conjunction with the [Big Law Black Hair Symposium](http://blackhairbiglaw.com/).

I researched who had already done the serious in-depth quantitative investigations on Black hair and Big Law. There really wasn’t much out there. It dawned on me that the research I had anticipated doing would be the only research available on the topic.

The lack of existing research sharpened my focus. It soon became my fervent hope that the initial research I was to conduct would eventually be the basis for another student’s master’s or PhD thesis. I would lay the groundwork and someone else could pick up the baton and run with it.

The Basics

The survey ran from September 10 through October 9, 2022, and was open to individuals of all races with a concentration on Black attorneys’ groups and Black student groups. In total, we received 205 responses. SurveyMonkey did the initial calculations which we followed up with more in-depth analysis by Kingsley Ukwuoma, a biostatistician and expert in systematic review and meta-analysis.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We asked 10 questions on our survey. We left the last question open for individuals to tell us more about their own personal hair situation. Although, we were limited, somewhat, by the free version of SurveyMonkey, the questions got to the heart and ethos of the information were looking to research. This article explores five of the ten questions.

Question 1: How would you classify your natural hair?



A straightforward synopsis of the survey informs us that 50.25% of the legal professionals who responded the survey had type 4 hair on the [Andre Walker Hair Typing System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Walker_Hair_Typing_System). Andre is noted for having been Oprah’s stylist for many years.

Type 4 is a category of kinky, coily hair that many Black people have. While my survey doesn’t ask for racial classifications, this can be roughly presumed by the type of hair selected. Black individuals may have hair in more than one category, or they may have hair that is not within Type 4. Black and mixed-race people are greatly represented in hair Types 3B and 3C. As a rule of thumb, the closer the hair type is to Type 1, the less likely the person is likely to be of African descent.  Of course, this is only a generality, and exceptions apply.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Question 2: What is your occupation?

- 43.90% of people that answered were lawyers: attorneys, government lawyers, prosecutors, retired attorneys, etc. (This percentage was recached when factoring in the “other” write-in answers.)
- 22.93% were law students. (This percentage was reached when factoring in the “other” write-in answers.)
- 8.51% of law students were also paralegals. (This percentage was reached when factoring in the “other” write-in answers.)
- 17.56% of paralegals were also law students. (This percentage was reached when factoring in the “other” write-in answers.)
- 1.46% were students who did not identify as law students.
The “other” responses had answers such as: judicial assistant, law internship coordinator, government attorney, prosecutor, and various types of paralegals.

Question 3: How much do you spend on your hair per month?

- 43.84% spent $50 or less per month on their hair.
- 30.05% spent $50 to $100 per month.
- 25.80% of those responded spend more than $100 per month on their hair.
This question is relevant due to the volume of recent news coverage regarding the vast amounts of money that Black women spend on their hair. According to a statistic from [Essence Magazine,](https://www.essence.com/news/money-career/business-black-beauty/) African Americans spend $127 million per year on grooming aids. From personal experience, I can tell you that the higher you climb on the corporate ladder, the more you spend on maintaining that hairstyle that helped you get the job in the first place.

Question 8: How big is the firm you work for?

- 14.15% worked at law firms with more that 500 associates.
- 20.00% were students not working at a firm.
- 11.22% were solo practitioners.
- 12.20% worked at firms with 10 or fewer partners.
Question 9: At work, who do you feel judges your hair most harshly?



- “No one” was the leading answer with 29.6.% of responses.
- “Myself” was second at 22.93%.
Of the racial categories selected, white women were deemed as being the harshest critics of Black hair at work (15.61%). Interestingly, this was followed closely by Black women (12.20%), then white men (11.71%). Curiously, Hispanic men and women, Asian men and women, and Black men were found to be the least disapproving in this regard.

Moreover, the write-in answers proved to be enlightening, with some of the responses calling out judges for being critical about Black hair in court. Other write-in responses were more introspective, with one respondent admitting, “When [my hair is] worn natural, I don’t feel judged but rather treated as a spectacle in the eyes of my non-Black colleagues.” A Black British respondent who wears his dreadlocks in a turban stated that he gets “the odd comment from persons who are Sikh or from the Asian community.”

I remain thrilled with the results of our [Black Hair Big Law Symposium](https://blackhairbiglaw.com/) as well as the [research](https://blackhairbiglaw.com/research) results, which continue to be fascinating. Part three of this series will focus closely on the research that shows the percentage of law firm colleagues at making negative remarks about Black attorneys’ hair. In addition, we tackle the hypothesis that Black women attorneys go out of their way to straighten their hair for their job interviews but switch things up once hired.

If you haven’t read [Part I](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/black-hair-big-law-part-i-it-all-started-with-ketanji/) of the Black Hair Big Law series, now is a great time to start.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses -- And Updates Their Salary Scale
## It's no surprise this firm is ponying up the big bucks this year.

More bonus news from the halls of Biglaw!

On Monday, Sidley Austin announced the bonus schedule most associates could expect to see for all their hard work this year. As expected, Sidley’s bonuses fall in line with the scale first popularized by [Cravath last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/), though they do leave open the possibility that exceptionally high billers could see a little bit more holiday cheer.

The base bonus scale at Sidley this year:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


Throughout Biglaw this year the bonuses have matched — by class year — the amounts dispersed last year. But this is a case where old news is actually good news. Remember this summer [associate salaries were raised ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)and a number of firms also gave out special mid-year bonuses. Which means 2018 was a good year for associates.

Speaking of the summer’s salary wars, in the same memo announcing bonuses Sidley also updated their [salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/chicago-time-to-get-your-raises/). Now, don’t get too excited. This doesn’t mean there are raises in the offing — a third-year will still make $220,000. But the class years have all gotten a bump up (as you might expect) and it’s a nice bit of clarity to know exactly when the firm considers you a third-year (versus a second-year) associate.

# Biglaw's Chaotic Pandemic Hours
## It's not just you -- hours have gotten increasingly erratic during COVID.
By [Kathryn Rubino](https://abovethelaw.com/author/krubino/)

Biglaw has never been known for its reasonable hours — even in the best of times. But as we all know, surviving and working through a pandemic makes everything more challenging.

Client demands haven’t taken a knee as COVID raged on. So even when you had to teach your kid some new math or tried to get anyone to take a nap, work still had to be done. According to[ reporting by](https://www.law.com/2021/04/12/client-demands-timezones-and-a-corporate-boom-why-attorneys-are-working-longer-and-more-erratic-hours/) Law.com, Biglaw was sympathetic to those other obligations — but that meant the day just ended later, because the work still had to get done:

“We have made it clear that we understand that there are periods of time in the normal working day in which you are unavailable,” said William Hartnett, chairman of Cahill Gordon & Reindel’s executive committee. “People had gaps during the working day in which they weren’t working, which extends their days into the early evening.”

Some attorneys, for example, cannot be available from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on school days, so they’re online at midnight, Hartnett said. Time zones are also a complicating factor: Cahill litigation department chairman Herbert Washer logs in at 5 a.m. for his European clients and often ends his day around 11 p.m. after wrapping up his domestic work.

While client demands don’t stop, those arbitrary deadlines that are infamous in Biglaw can be curbed:

“We’re all required to meet their schedules. One thing that both Herb and I insist on is that the scheduling pressure should come from the outside, not internally. We don’t have control of the clients’ schedule, nor are we entitled to,” Hartnett said.

But even with firms trying to alleviate the extra stressors for their attorneys, folks are still working like dogs. Cahill says demand is up 20 percent, and elite firms are generally doing pretty well for themselves in the COVID world. No wonder they’re happy to share the largesse with associates:

“These firms understand how busy their associates are and people are working much harder than they have in the last 10 years,” said Ru Bhatt, a partner in Major, Lindsey & Africa’s New York associate practice group. “Firms are in a place where they’re sharing the wealth a little bit because they understand it’s tough.”

# Partners Assessing A Secondary Market Move: Finding The Right Firm And Office
## As the 2023 partner lateral market comes into focus, we can report that opportunities at Am Law firms in secondary markets remain plentiful.

Back in December, we suggested that the [expansion of Am Law firms into new secondary markets](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/lateral-partner-moves-to-secondary-markets-an-unprecedented-opportunity/) may have been the defining Am Law firm story of 2022, and we explained some of the many reasons why partners at Am Law firms in major cities are moving to secondary markets in unprecedented numbers.

As the 2023 partner lateral market comes into focus, we can report that opportunities at Am Law firms in secondary markets remain plentiful. This is especially true for practices that are less dependent on a strong economy such as litigation, antitrust, privacy, data security, intellectual property, employee benefits, and tax.

Secondary market Am Law opportunities may appeal to partners in two categories. First, they may be a fit for partners interested in moving from outside the state to a secondary market, for the reasons described in our December article. Second, they may be attractive to partners already based in a secondary market who see a chance to “trade up” to an Am Law firm that has recently arrived in their city.

If you find yourself in either of these categories, what are the most important factors to consider as you search for the right firm and office?

Practice alignment with office strategy

The most important criterion to assess is how well your practice aligns with the firm’s strategy for the particular secondary office you’re considering. Note that office-level strategy is not the same thing as firm-level strategy!

Typically, when a firm opens in a new city, it will have identified specific priority practice areas and clients (both existing and potential) for the new office. Two office openings from last month offer clear examples. [Goodwin launched in Philadelphia](https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2023/01/23/goodwin-chairman-explains-why-philadelphia-fits.html), targeting health care, life sciences, private equity, and financial services work. Meanwhile, [Davis Wright opened in Culver City](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2023/01/19/a-magnet-for-innovation-davis-wright-tremaine-opens-west-los-angeles-office/) with the aim of expanding its entertainment, media, and healthcare practices.

If your practice area aligns with the new office priorities, that’s an excellent sign. Especially where the firm has publicly announced the practices it intends to build, there will be a sense of urgency internally to back up the talk with demonstrable success. If your practice fits into the plan, you can expect the firm to make a real effort to support you. Conversely, if your practice is not a priority for the office in question, think twice. Even if the firm is willing to bring you in, you cannot expect the same level of support as will be extended to partners in the priority practices.

Cross-selling opportunities

A critical component of strategic fit is the extent to which you can reasonably expect to benefit from cross-selling opportunities, both at the local office level and firm-wide.

Cross-selling can sometimes be driven by proximity to key existing and potential clients: the logic is that by being nearby, partners will be positioned to build strong relationships that lead to servicing an increasing proportion of the client’s legal needs. In interviews about the Culver City opening, Davis Wright partners took care to emphasize their focus on creating cross-selling opportunities on LA’s Westside for lateral partners. Similarly, firms opening in Miami—one of the most popular secondary markets for recent Am Law office expansion—are taking care to [site their offices](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-scrambles-for-miami-client-proximity-in-new-market-rush) as close to priority clients as possible, in some cases securing space in the same prime Brickell developments that are drawing recently arrived leading hedge funds.

Platform benefits

Although office strategy should be at the forefront, it’s also critical to consider the platform offered by the firm as a whole. How valuable would this firm’s platform be for your practice? K&L Gates’s communications around its office opening in Nashville in 2021 highlighted this factor. In the firm’s [press release](https://www.klgates.com/KL-Gates-Launches-Nashville-Office-with-Hire-of-25-Lawyers-2-3-2021), partners connected the strong local opportunities in healthcare to the firm’s national healthcare practice and emphasized the value of “a fully integrated law firm with the breadth of practice area capabilities, industry insights and knowledge, and geographic reach that K&L Gates offers.” It’s particularly logical that K&L Gates would play up this factor in Nashville, which historically has not drawn interest from Am Law firms with global reach. But platform is an important consideration regardless of your destination.

Talent pool

Access to talent has been a key driver of recent secondary market expansions. That includes not only newly hired associates and counsels drawn to secondary market offices but also lawyers currently employed by the firm who may stay longer if given the opportunity to transfer. The secondary markets that firms have favored are viewed by many as nice (and cost-effective!) places to live. Consider, for example, Kirkland’s new offices in Boise and Salt Lake City. Another selling point for many secondary market offices is the lack of state income tax. Think Miami, Austin, or Seattle.

Talent has also been a key selling point in attracting lateral partners to these new offices. One reason that partners already working in secondary locations are often eager to join firms in the Am Law is because Am Law firms feature a materially more sophisticated legal talent pool, which newly arrived partners can leverage to accelerate their practices. For Am Law firms arriving in secondary markets, depth of talent is a key advantage—this is a dimension on which the regional firms with a longer history in these markets typically cannot compete.

Lateral partner integration

It’s also essential to inquire about and understand your potential new firm’s lateral partner integration plan. Successfully integrating new partners into the firm’s existing practices is in everyone’s best interests, but even so, we’ve witnessed many cases of poorly managed integration.

For an example of a firm vocalizing its commitment to integrating lateral partners, consider Latham’s opening in Austin in 2021. Latham brought in three lateral partners with deep Austin ties to anchor the new office, two from DLA Piper and one from Wilson Sonsini. In the [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/latham--watkins-opens-new-office-in-austin-301367469.html), Latham Chair and Managing Partner Rich Trobman spoke of the firm’s intention “to offer clients in Austin the very best of the Latham platform, by combining our new partners’ experience and skill sets with our already deep and successful bench-spanning capital markets, venture capital, and private equity.” If you’re considering a lateral move of any kind—but especially to a relatively smaller office—you will want to make sure your new firm is similarly committed to integrating you effectively.

***

If you are a partner interested in exploring secondary market opportunities, we invite you to get in touch. Although there are ample partner-level opportunities out there, partner needs are hardly ever posted. Drawing on our longstanding relationships with leading Am Law firms, we make it our business to know who is looking. We assist with interview and business plan preparation, and when you reach the offer stage, we can negotiate on your behalf, minimizing awkward interactions with your soon-to-be partners. Remember, we do this for a living. It’s a wise choice to avail yourself of the benefit of our experience.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Ari Kaplan

Have you lost weight? Last week, ATL featured an excellent article on the art of business development, by [a true pro](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/whats-possible-how-to-get-business-in-30-seconds-or-less-give-or-take-two-years/). Perfect timing. This week I sat down with alt.legal entrepreneur [Ari Kaplan](http://www.arikaplanadvisors.com/), who promises that his technology can guide you down the path to riches and independence, but only if you embrace accountability.

Whether you want to stay on the traditional Biglaw path or venture into the wild world of alt.legal businesses, only one thing is certain: we all die in the end. Also pretty certain (and more relevant to this column): to be at the top of your legal game, you will need to build your own book of business.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The good news is, the basics of business development can be taught (email me for [book recommendations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People), and might I add, you are a very, very good-looking reader). Moreover, the basics can be understood in much less time that it took you to learn Con Law (though I bet you learned Con Law in no time at all).

The bad news is, while the rewards of success could be life-changing, results can take years and not even your boss will encourage your efforts. Moreover, unlike most of the work you do as a lawyer, it is it very difficult on a day-to-day, or even month-to-month, basis to see that this “work” is paying dividends. I put “work” in quotes, because if you are used to spending days on end locked in your office, writing fifty-page briefs, it will not feel like work to routinely get lunch/coffee/cocktails with a law school friend (unless your law school friend is Ted Cruz). But it is work, it is valuable, and you need to stick with it to win.

So how do you ensure you’re treating business development like it’s your job, when technically, it isn’t? To answer this question I sat down with a leading legal-industry analyst, [Ari Kaplan](http://www.arikaplanadvisors.com/about/), and chatted about his business-development software platform (called [Lawcountability](http://www.arikaplanadvisors.com/lawcountability/)). In essence, Kaplan created a virtual boss, but instead of being a rude taskmaster, this one is the coach you’ve always wanted, who only cares about helping you become the best version of yourself. Since the platform’s launch it has been adopted by lawyers at major firms like Ogletree Deakins and Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan, as well as a dozen law schools.

Like many we have interviewed in this column, Ari spent most of his career as a practicing lawyer, with [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/mcdermott-will-emery/) in New York. He also is the author of [The Opportunity Maker: Strategies for Inspiring Your Legal Career Through Creative Networking and Business Development](http://amzn.to/1qun3EC) (affiliate link to the second edition, releasing next week). Finally, he is the principal researcher for a variety of benchmarking reports in the legal industry, so his knowledge of legal and alt.legal runs deep!

Enjoy the interview below!

Joe Borstein: What is Lawcountability?

Ari Kaplan: If the modern lawyer is a white-collar hustler, then Lawcountability is his or her killer app. It is like an easy button in the cloud for lawyers interested in building accountability into their business development, marketing, and networking. It is also helping law students improve their career efforts and job hunts.

Through my training programs and conference keynotes, I have had the privilege of addressing thousands of lawyers around the world and thousands of law students at almost 50 schools in the U.S., Canada, and the UK. I have found that the challenge for most individuals is not that they are not getting good ideas or that those ideas are unproven, it is that they don’t execute. And, they don’t execute because there’s an absence of accountability.

So I thought that if I could layer technology on top of engaging, practical, and useful online training sessions that are only 10 minutes long and, hopefully, delivered in an engaging way, it would help individuals overcome their anxiety, uncertainty, or complacency, and excite them enough to create opportunity.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Lawcountability offers a mash-up of traditional training, group coaching, and e-mail reminders, and combines them with colorful visualization, mobility, and calendar integration to form something user-friendly and cost-effective that can transform careers for those who use it.

JB: So how did you get this idea off the ground?

AK: The journey from the idea to its execution has been a fun adventure because, after all, I was trained as a lawyer and had no knowledge of CakePHP or the myriad issues that arise when you are building software. Launching the companion iPhone apps added another layer of excitement to the process.

I was on vacation over the holidays in 2012 and decided to make the development of this tool a New Year’s resolution. I went for a walk and dictated an e-mail describing exactly what I wanted to build, how I expected it to work and the features it would contain. That day, I found a developer to design a simple wireframe and within a few weeks, I was showing it to my network of trusted advisors, which included law firm partners and leaders in professional development. They provided valuable feedback and encouragement.

In the spring of 2013, I felt confident enough to offer a webinar to potential clients, though I advised them that the tool did not actually work and that I was merely providing screen shots of how it would function when finished. One firm contacted me immediately after the call and asked to license the tool the next month. I thought it would take two and the firm agreed to wait. It actually took almost a year, but that firm did subscribe when we launched on March 3, 2014, and it continues to use our software over two years later.

It was a finalist for ILTA’s Innovative Solution Provider of the Year award last fall, and now bar associations around the country, from Florida to Alaska, are beginning to feature it as a member benefit.

JB: So what are the key benefits to users?

AK: The benefit of Lawcountability is that it essentially provides a turnkey system where the firm gets to offer its lawyers new programming every single week that provides a great idea for networking, marketing, business development, writing articles, finding public speaking opportunities, using social media, and generally raising one’s profile. For solo practitioners, it is like having a virtual coach on retainer.

The embedded reminder system is associated with point values to encourage benchmarking or gamification. Firms can create metrics and analytics, while individuals can instantly generate business development plans and seamlessly add activities to their calendars through an Outlook integration feature.

We really tried to build a tool that employs all of the elements that make technology both useful and effective.

JB: Why do you think that accountability has become so important in the legal industry?

AK: Lawyers are experiencing an increased emphasis on accountability in every area of their professional lives.

Through technology, clients are proactively monitoring matters and evaluating performance based on predetermined metrics. Law firms are more attentive to the pace of the career progression for both associates and partners based on lockstep milestones of skill acquisition and training. Finally, this is trickling down to the individual level, where the best lawyers are recognizing that those who set goals, commit to accomplishing certain tasks, and incorporate consistency into their marketing and business development strategies tend to be most successful.

JB: From your experience as a legal industry researcher, how has the legal industry shifted?

AK: Technology, technology, technology.

I have produced almost 20 different benchmarking reports focused on different aspects of corporate and legal trends. The shift in the legal industry can be characterized by the recognition that those who can adapt to a more technology-centric environment will be able to thrive and meet client expectations to incorporate greater efficiency into their practices.

JB: Your research touches all sides of the legal industry.  What are you hearing from corporate counsel in terms of what they want from law firms?

AK: Regardless of the company type, size or location, I am always amazed by the fact that when I interview an in-house lawyer, he or she has consistent concerns related to communication, client service, project management, and a law firm’s commitment to the organization’s business beyond its immediate legal problems.

In-house counsel want a holistic consigliere, who is extremely well-versed in any given subject, but also networked enough to find immediate answers to the most pressing questions, regardless of whether they relate to the actual case at hand or just a concern of their key contact.

JB: Thanks Ari, last question: how do you think law students can stand out?

AK: I wrote my first book, The Opportunity Maker, almost a decade ago, and the keys to law student career success are essentially the same today as they were years ago. The tools they can use are a bit different, but the theme remains the same: be a hustler. Be dynamic, proactive, thoughtful, grateful, and persistent (in the most positive way).

Study great rainmakers and ask people for advice. Set Google Alerts and use the results to organically follow up with individuals that you meet. Find ways to demonstrate your thoughtfulness by sharing press leads, inviting members of your network to speak at student events, or profiling alumni for a student publication. Review LinkedIn updates and congratulate connections on their achievements.

For those using our software, we encourage them to leverage the techniques we share with at least two professionals every week. In fact, we have started an initiative to personally introduce active students, who take advantage of our content on a regular basis, to lawyers at mostly large firms, who use our system as well.

In my books, presentations and research reports, I have always tried to make good ideas more accessible to lawyers, law students, and business leaders. I am also committed to encouraging them to implement those suggestions for their own benefit, as well as for their clients and their firms. I built Lawcountability to further that mission and will continue to adapt the technology to meet the needs of a dynamically changing profession.

Thank you for this opportunity.

Brandon Moseberry

Learn to make yourself indispensable by developing a subject matter expertise and taking ownership of matters, as well as learning to not be selfish with your time. Practically, this means supplemental reading on your off-time and when taking on assignments, coming up with a proposed solution rather than simply asking the senior associate/partner to provide the answer. My approach developed into something along the lines of, “Here is the issue, here is what I’m proposing and why,” and have the senior associate/partner let me know if and where they disagreed. Lastly, be nice to people and have a sense of humor, because life is short and first and last impressions matter.

—[Brandon F. Moseberry](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/m/moseberry-brandon), newly elected partner at Baker McKenzie, [on what advice he would give](https://www.law.com/2019/02/06/how-i-made-partner-baker-mckenzies-brandon-moseberry/) to others trying to make it to partner. With shrinking partnership classes, wannabe partners are going to need all the help they can get.

We have to push the brakes in today’s world to deal with the mental health and emotional stability of our community. It is probably the most important single issue I’ve grappled with during the pandemic.

— [Brad Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp), chairman of Paul Weiss, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/paul-weiss-set-to-crack-rare-6-million-profit-per-partner-mark) on the need to combat burnout and promote mental health in the legal profession. Karp says the firm has not only turned away work and pushed back on client demands in the name of its attorneys’ health and wellness, but it has also forced lawyers and staff to take vacations to decompress. Karp says he expects profits per partner at the firm to exceed $6 million in 2021.

# George Conway's Daughter Taking Her Shot On American Idol This Weekend

George Conway via Twitter

We’ve [covered our share of the Conway family](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/wachtell-litigator-george-conway-just-cant-help-slamming-his-wifes-boss/) as the internal drama spilled over into a fight for the soul of the Republican Party, if not the country. But we’ve mostly avoided the topic of Claudia Conway, the social media influencer whose clashes with her mother — and a bizarre topless image allegation that [brought the New Jersey police into the matter](https://nypost.com/2021/01/26/cops-investigate-kellyanne-conway-after-nude-photo-of-daughter-posted/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&utm_source=Slack) — have garnered more than a few headlines. That’s because, despite her voluntary entry to the world of influencing, we’ve more or less taken the stance that she’s 16 and doesn’t need to be dragged into the fights her dad wages against her mom’s old boss, former social media influencer Donald Trump.

But since this is a bit of good news for the Biglaw scion we figured it’s all right to turn the ATL spotlight on her.

On Sunday, [Claudia will be appearing on American Idol](https://www.insider.com/claudia-conway-american-idol-audition-to-air-in-february-2021-2) to audition for a golden ticket as part of the show’s season premiere.

“I know that half the world sees me as a joke because of my parents and whatever bulls—. I’m just a 16-year-old with passions, and you know, trying to figure out the future. This is a really good opportunity. A really f—ing cool opportunity that I went with immediately, because if “American Idol” reaches out to you, you don’t say no,” [she said](https://www.tiktok.com/@claudiamconway/video/6927104397193415942?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1).

While we’re all excited for Claudia, we have a personal stake in this too. Hopefully, the broadcast will feature a cameo from the high-stakes litigator in the inevitable soft-ball hype video before her performance.

# Britney Spears May Be Free, But Her Dad Still Wants Her To Pay His Legal Fees

Mr. Spears reaped many millions of dollars from Britney as a conservator, while paying his lawyers millions more, all from Britney’s work and hard earned money. The conservatorship has been terminated and Mr. Spears was suspended ignominiously. Under the circumstances, his petition is not only legally meritless, it is an abomination. Britney poignantly testified about the pain her father caused her and this only adds to it. This is not what a father who loves his daughter does.

— Greenberg Traurig partner [Mathew Rosengart](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosengart-mathew-s), who successfully represented singer Britney Spears in her quest to end her conservatorship, commenting on her father Jamie Spears’s [request that his daughter’s estate continue to pay his legal fees](https://www.billboard.com/business/legal/britney-spears-dad-jamie-wants-her-to-keep-paying-his-legal-bills-1235013323/), despite the fact that the conservatorship was terminated in November. The elder Spears claims that without the estate’s help, the legal bills would “subject him to personal bankruptcy and ruin.”

Ty Cobb

Donald Trump attorney and self-appointed “[adult in the room](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/ty-cobbs-hilarious-emails-and-what-they-say-about-biglaw/)” Ty Cobb has a lot of us wondering if there’s just too low a bar for “adult” at this point. Because holding strategy meetings about the single most important criminal probe in the country at a popular restaurant in a city absolutely lousy with reporters seems like a rookie mistake.

On the other hand, if this case goes awry, Cobb may have a future in dinner theater.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s another bizarre flub from Cobb, the former Hogan Lovells partner who joined the Trump team to provide a steadying influence that seemed more imperative than ever after Marc Kasowitz finally bowed out under public scrutiny for engaging [in a flame war with a random online critic](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-writes-angry-emails-and-everyone-completely-overreacts/). Since then, Cobb has… engaged [in a flame war with a random online critic](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/ty-cobbs-hilarious-emails-and-what-they-say-about-biglaw/). Baby steps.

Yesterday, Peter Baker and Kenneth P. Vogel of the New York Times broke the news that Ty Cobb and fellow Trump team heavy John Dowd had a leisurely lunch last week at BLT Steak, a restaurant near the White House, and decided to use the time productively by loudly divulging [all manner of internal gripes about the defense strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/us/politics/trump-lawyers-white-house-russia-mcgahn-ty-cobb.html).

Here's a photo of Ty Cobb & John Dowd casually & loudly discussing details of Russia investigation at [@BLTSteakDC](https://twitter.com/BLTSteakDC) while I sat at next table. [pic.twitter.com/RfX9JLJ0Te](https://t.co/RfX9JLJ0Te)

— Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) [September 18, 2017](https://twitter.com/kenvogel/status/909615525285842949)

I guess Dowd and Cobb thought the patron was just Snapchatting their food, and not writing their editor, “THIS IS WHY I EXPENSE MY F**KING LUNCHES, TOM!!!”[[1]](#f1)

But at least the casual conversation in front of God and the New York Times didn’t hit on anything important….

“The White House counsel’s office is being very conservative with this stuff,” Mr. Cobb told Mr. Dowd. “Our view is we’re not hiding anything.” Referring to Mr. McGahn, he added, “He’s got a couple documents locked in a safe.”

Mr. Cobb expressed concern about another White House lawyer he did not name. “I’ve got some reservations about one of them,” Mr. Cobb said. “I think he’s like a McGahn spy.”

Oh, you think the White House Counsel is hiding incriminating documents? That seems… significant? Even if Cobb’s comments are chalked up to hyperbolic small talk, his indiscretions reveal a lot about the Trump defense strategy that the President should have wanted kept under wraps. McGahn, who is likely a fact witness in this probe, now faces the perception that he’s hiding key information from the government on behalf of the President, an unfortunate cloud to bring into a sit down with special counsel Robert Mueller. Cobb and Dowd may have gone to a steakhouse, yet Bob Mueller’s the one who ended up sharpening his knives.

If only there were a good guideline — an easy to remember word or catchphrase — for when it’s a good idea for a lawyer to casually talk, in public about, the inner workings of a client’s case or other sensitive matters.

A word like, for example, [never](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-new-yorkor-pillsbury-associates-brace-yourselves/).

After The Times contacted the White House about the situation, Mr. McGahn privately erupted at Mr. Cobb, according to people informed about the confrontation who asked not to be named describing internal matters. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, sharply reprimanded Mr. Cobb for his indiscretion, the people said.

Well, so long as the other Trump administration adult-in-the-roomTM weighed in with a reprimand! Over the weekend, someone asked me which Trump official would depart next. I ventured that one of the lawyers, either Cobb or McGahn, would be shown the door next. That’s before the world knew the two lawyers were locked in a West Wing power struggle. As we learned from the Mooch-Priebus showdown, these sorts of spats tend to end with both leaving in quick succession, so place your bets now.

In the meantime, if you’re in the D.C.-area, I know a couple of guys looking for good Seamless recommendations.

Was Ken Vogel a little worried that a tweet about two high-profile attorneys for the President of the United States discussing withholding documents in a criminal probe might be a bit dry without a social networking boost from an account advertising happy hour wine deals?

# Ongoing AI Education Strategies And Resources For Lawyers

We hear a lot about what lawyers need to know about AI but not much about how and where to get the training and information we need.

“I know I must understand the capabilities, limitations, and biases of each AI tool my company uses and the ethical dilemmas surrounding each use case,” my lawyer friend recently said. “But how should I stay on top of technology that changes so quickly? New releases of AI language models can arrive mere months apart. Will one yearly CLE class be enough?”

Ongoing AI education is part of our new normal. It’s a great time to be a lawyer if you like learning new things and innovative ways for people to do their jobs better. Continuous AI learning will expand your skill set and boost your knowledge of technology that’s become vital to doing business everywhere. 

Below are several ways to inform your AI learning strategy and address the most pressing issues of the many vying for your attention. 

Focus On Specific-Use Cases First

One of your first goals will likely be to develop company policies and guidelines for the responsible use of AI. This involves:

- Defining responsible AI principles and related expectations.
- Adhering to a specific and efficient measuring system for AI use.
- Developing performance standards that result in the uniform evaluation of AI systems and outcomes.
The first step in achieving these aims is determining how and where the company uses AI. Focus on current-use cases to advance beyond the theoretical space and target the specific benefits, risks, and ethical considerations that may arise. 

Detail every instance where AI is integrated into company operations. Collaborate with organizational leaders to learn about their use cases and their goals. How do they measure progress and prevent bias? What protections are still needed? 

Collaborate Across The Company And With AI Experts

Cross-departmental collaboration is essential to fully understand all the ways a company uses AI. Prepare to work with:

- IT and compliance team members who ensure AI tools comply with data privacy and security regulations and ethical and legal standards. 
- HR teams on potential issues related to AI tools used in hiring and performance evaluations. 
- Marketers to ensure companies don’t make false or exaggerated claims about AI capabilities or outcomes.
- AI vendors to clarify — in detail — how their solutions work and comply with regulatory requirements and ethical standards. 
Many lawyers will need data scientists, software engineers, and AI specialists to explain how AI tools work and answer questions about potential risks. Speaking with regulators can also help you understand the risks and potential for misuse.

Invest In Ongoing AI Education And Training

Continually learning about AI and its applications requires conscious effort. You’ll find many interesting seminars, webinars, and conferences on the use of AI in law and business. 

There’s been an explosion in books, guides, and articles on AI. Turn to trusted sources such as [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/artificial-intelligence/), [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/topic/subject/ai-and-machine-learning), [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/Ultimate-guide-to-artificial-intelligence-in-the-enterprise), and other respected publications. 

Join or follow groups such as the [Center for AI and Digital Policy](https://www.caidp.org/), [The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics for Autonomous and Intelligent Systems](https://standards.ieee.org/industry-connections/ec/autonomous-systems/), and the [AI Standards Hub](https://aistandardshub.org/).

Consider adding ongoing AI technology training to your list. 

- [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/training/free) and [Google](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/elements-artificial-intelligence) offer free online courses on artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
- Microsoft and LinkedIn offer [free introductory courses](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/career-essentials-in-generative-ai-by-microsoft-and-linkedin) on generative AI through the AI Skill Initiative. 
- Platforms like Coursera and edX offer a wealth of courses on AI, as do many universities. 
You may also be responsible for staying aware of all updates to AI and privacy regulations and ensuring compliance. A yearly CLE class may come in handy for this, though it’s essential to always keep your ear to the ground for any significant developments. 

The bottom line is that AI presents an excellent opportunity to learn about new topics and gain skills to help your career flourish. It may feel daunting at first, but there are many resources to help you navigate the world of AI and stay up to date with new developments. Don’t be afraid to dive in, become a legal expert in AI, and take your law practice to new heights!

Where do you go to learn about AI?

How do you stay up to date with the latest regulatory developments?

What types of CLEs or other training do you find helpful?

Almost three weeks have passed since Milbank first announced its new salary scale, and while a number of Am Law 100 firms and boutiques have already matched, associates are growing impatient with this waiting game. When will Biglaw firms show them the money? As it turns out, some firms may be doing so quietly under cover of their annual review process.

Above the Law has been told that reviews are well underway at at Cooley — a firm that came in at No. 19 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, having brought in $1,552,149,000 gross revenue in 2020. As part of that process, sources say reviewing partners have told associates that their new salaries are equal to the Milbank scale. But wait, there’s more.

You may remember that way back in September 2020, Cooley was the firm that got the [special bonus ball rolling](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/), which kicked off a real compensation craze across Biglaw. It seems that Cooley may be back in the special bonus game according to insiders at the firm. We’ve heard that these bonuses may be tied to hours and that they seem to be in line with an earlier Davis Polk special bonus. (For what it’s worth, these special bonuses may be tied to Cooley’s year-end bonuses, which are typically announced in February. This would mean that the firm has matched the prevailing market rate for year-end bonuses.)

If you’re at Cooley and you’ve received Milbank salary and special bonus news as part of your annual review, please reach out to us and let us know. After all, if additional special bonuses are in the offing on top of salary raises, we — and all other Biglaw associates — would love to know about it. We’ve contacted the firm for confirmation of these raises and bonuses, but have yet to hear back. If and when we do, we will provide an update here.

Congratulations to everyone at Cooley — and if you haven’t had your review yet, now you know what you can likely expect to happen!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Former MoFo Office Manager Sentenced To Prison For Embezzlement
## Sure hope that pinky ring was worth it.

[After pleading guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/former-mofo-manager-pleads-guilty-to-stealing-from-the-biglaw-giant/) to felony mail fraud for using a firm credit card to make $425,000 of unauthorized personal purchases, former Morrison & Foerster office operations manager Andrew Robertson has been sentenced. He’ll spend 41 months in prison and he was also ordered to forfeit $425,000 and to serve three years of supervised release after his release.

Robertson’s job at MoFo included having a purchasing card and he was able to approve certain orders, including office supplies, renovation matters, and catering. But Roberston used firm funds to buy things for himself. Robertson’s haul reportedly included Prada jeans, watches, a 60-inch television, more than a dozen pairs of Air Jordans, an Apple laptop, a sleeper sofa from Crate & Barrel, a 24-inch gold chain necklace, a 1980s-style prom king costume, and a white-gold pinky ring.

While employed at the firm, Roberston was already on parole for stealing $700,000 from another company. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said he used a falsified Social Security number and paperwork to obtain the job.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Robertson’s attorney, Davis Bos, said depression and childhood trauma factored into his crime. However, it was Robertson’s previous conviction that played a role in the sentencing hearing, as[ reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-biglaw-office-manager-is-sentenced-for-425k-embezzlement-it-was-his-second-offense) ABA Journal:

At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the prior conviction “doesn’t seem to have had any effect whatsoever on him.”

“My concern also is that he had an earlier sentence for similar conduct, spent 24 months [in prison] but didn’t skip a beat,” Kollar-Kotelly said.

“You can’t keep doing this,” Kollar-Kotelly told Robertson.

MoFo had the following statement on Robertson’s conviction:

“Morrison & Foerster terminated Mr. Robertson and alerted law enforcement immediately after we discovered theft of firm property,” the statement said. “Mr. Robertson’s actions did not impact any of the firm’s clients. We have been fully cooperating with law enforcement on this matter.”

# One Of America's Most Prestigious Biglaw Firms Calls On SEC To Rescue Banks From Short Sellers
## Banks are 'under attack' -- but will the SEC do anything about it?

Banks are failing, and in response, because some people just want to watch the world burn and make a quick buck in the process, other banks’ stocks are being short sold left and right.

Wachtell Lipton, one of the most prestigious Biglaw firms in America, isn’t just going to stand by and watch as more banks fold under the pressure. The firm wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to do something about it — and fast.

Late last week, the firm sent out a client memo entitled, “Abusive Short Selling: Once Again, It’s Time to Act.” Written by [Edward Herlihy](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/edherlihy/), co-chairman of Wachtell’s executive committee, and [Matthew Guest](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/mmguest/), a partner at the firm, the memo calls on the SEC do something it hasn’t done since the 2008 financial crisis: place a temporary ban on short sales of banking institutions.

Will the Biglaw firm’s banking gambit work? We’ll have to wait and see.

In the meantime, read Wachtell’s full memo below.

The country needs a prompt, tailored response by the SEC to coordinated short attacks that are putting our economy at great risk. In recent trading sessions, the short strategy consisting of “pile-on and wait” has targeted safe and sound regional and community banks and shaken the market’s confidence. Skyrocketing short interest levels have created a relentless downward pressure on the banks’ equities that bears little or no relationship to fundamental performance. The targeted banks are the engine of American economic activity, with their local presence and knowledge allowing for responsible underwriting of the agricultural, small business and middle-market lending that sustains production and employment.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The distress faced by the banks that failed was undoubtedly the result of some mix of poor risk management and challenges from the extraordinarily rapid change in interest rate conditions created by the Federal Reserve. But, despite this, potentially viable private sector, open bank resolution attempts were stymied by short-seller driven market death spirals that overwhelmed rationality.

Unnecessarily shaken by the curious and seemingly pre-ordained outcome of the First Republic auction, confidence in America’s mid-size and smaller banks remains under attack. Just as we wrote during the Financial Crisis, decisive, focused action from the Commission is necessary to appropriately regulate coordinated short attacks that profit trading firms at the expense of small retail investors, employees and retirees. Similar to their action in 2008, we urge the Commission today to impose a 15-trading day prohibition on short sales of regulated financial institutions to allow time for the banking regulators to work on steps to restore confidence, and for the market to absorb fundamental information and work as it should. Other longer-term solutions may include reinstitution of the traditional up-tick rule, and aggressive enforcement combating abusive short sales, market manipulation and groups acting in concert. Absent prompt action, strong banks, employees, communities and the American consumer may continue to bear the high costs of unnecessary and unjustified distress.

Awful news from the Southern District of New York: a law clerk, Kimberly Greer, died yesterday on her way home from work. According to [reports,](https://wcbs880.radio.com/articles/kimberly-greer-struck-killed-charter-bus-lower-manhattan) she was killed after being hit by a charter bus on the corner of Centre and Leonard Streets around 7:30 p.m. She was in the crosswalk when hit by a bus making a left turn. While the investigation into the tragic incident is still being investigated, the driver of the bus, Xi Chen, has been charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to use due care.

Greer was currently clerking for magistrate judge Katharine Parker, and had accepted a second clerkship with SDNY judge Vincent Briccetti slated to begin in the fall of 2019.

In an email sent to those in the Southern District, Judge Parker offered the following remembrance of Greer:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Kimberly was a vibrant young woman with an excellent legal mind. She distinguished herself in Chambers through her keen analytical skills and fluent writing. Most importantly, she was one of the most kind and generous persons I know, quick to lend a hand to colleagues, bake cookies for interns, and mentor students. She was a deeply valued and loved member of my Chambers Family and we are devastated by this tragedy.

Kimberly began her clerkship in March 2018. Prior to clerking she was an associate at Vedder Price P.C. She graduated from Fordham Law School in May 2016, cum laude. While at Fordham she distinguished herself as a leader. She was on Fordham Law School’s National Moot Court Team, winning first place in oral advocacy and best brief writer. She was President of the Fordham Law School Student Association and an Associate Editor of the Fordham Intellectual Property, Media & Entertainment Law Journal. She was a Ruth Whitehead Whaley Scholar and recipient of the Eugene J. Keefe Award. Because of her strong advocacy skills, she was invited to and taught moot court at Fordham Law Schools in the Fall of 2018. She graduated from Northwestern University in 2012, where she was also on Dean’s List.

Our thoughts go out to Greer’s friends, family and colleagues at this difficult time.

# Plaintiffs In Jones Day Gender Discrimination Case Want It To Be A Class Action
## Plaintiffs are taking on the black box compensation model.

Plaintiffs in the gender discrimination case filed against Biglaw firm Jones Day have[ filed a motion in federal court to conditionally certify the case as a collective action](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/12/05/class-cert-bid-ups-the-ante-in-jones-day-associates-gender-bias-case/) under the Equal Pay Act. The purported class-action gender discrimination [lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) alleges a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system.

There are currently six named plaintiffs in the case (there had been seven, but [one anonymous plaintiff dropped out](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/plaintiff-backs-out-of-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-rather-than-reveal-her-name/?rf=1) rather than reveal her name). The plaintiffs are spread throughout the country — Nilab Rahyar Tolton, Andrea Mazingo, Meredith Williams, and Jaclyn Stahl worked in California offices of the firm, while Saira Draper was an associate in Atlanta, and Katrina Henderson was in the firm’s New York office — and allege the same black box compensation systems kept their pay below that of men working at the firm:

“Plaintiffs worked in multiple Jones Day offices and practice groups, and each has been subjected to a common compensation practice that results in women earning less than men for substantially equal work,” they said in the filing. “All are challenging the same compensation policy, under which every associate’s compensation is determined in a ‘black box,’ with final decisions made by the Firm’s Managing Partner, Stephen J. Brogan.”

If the collective action is certified, female associates who have worked at Jones Day since April 3, 2016, would be able to opt into the litigation.
In [their response](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/jones-day-to-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-you-dont-deserve-to-be-paid-on-the-cravath-scale/?rf=1) to the First Amended Complaint, Jones Day denied the plaintiffs’ allegations, going after the notion the plaintiffs should be paid on the market scale set by Cravath, and highlighting the professional failings of the plaintiffs.

# Davis Polk Rescinds Offers To T14 Law School Students For Their Controversial Statements On Israel

Davis Polk & Wardwell has rescinded job offers made to three law students who served in leadership positions of student organizations that signed on to controversial statements made in the wake of the deadly Hamas terrorist attack in Israel. The students in question attend Columbia and Harvard, and went unnamed in an internal email (available in full on the next page) sent by DPW’s chair, Neil Barr.

In that email, Barr noted that the statements put forth by the student groups were “simply contrary to our firm’s values,” and that the consequential decision to rescind their offers was “appropriate in upholding our responsibility to provide a safe and inclusive work environment for all Davis Polk employees.” Davis Polk remains “in dialogue” with two of the affected students to “ensure that any further color being offered to us … is considered.”

Barr’s internal email included the following statement on the matter:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The views expressed in certain of the statements signed by law school student organizations in recent days are in direct contravention of our firm’s value system. For this reason and to ensure we continue to maintain a supportive and inclusive work environment, the student leaders responsible for signing on to these statements are no longer welcome in our firm; and their offers of employment have been rescinded.

A report from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/business/davis-polk-employment-columbia-harvard-israel-palestine.html) states that the Biglaw firm may be reversing course:

On Tuesday, the firm said it was reconsidering that decision for two of the three students, who fought their dismissals and said that they did not authorize the letters, which did not have any individual signatories. The potential reversal highlights the complexities — for both employers and employees — of navigating what has quickly become one of the most emotionally divisive issues in recent decades.

Davis Polk’s move to rescind these students’ offers follows a decision made by Winston & Strawn to revoke an offer made to NYU Law’s Student Bar Association president, who sent out a school-wide newsletter [branding the Hamas attack on Israel as “necessary.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/nyu-student-bar-president-israel-palestine/)

# The Best Law Schools For Getting A Biglaw Job (2016)

Being employed is the best!

Rankings season is upon us, and many publications are rolling out their best offerings for readers’ perusal, in advance of the release of the 2017 U.S. News & World Report Law School Rankings and the latest edition of the Above the Law Top 50 Law School Rankings.

For about a decade, the National Law Journal has published a list of the best law schools to go to if you want to work in Biglaw after graduation. The NLJ refers to these institutions of higher education as the “go-to law schools,” and this year, they’re ranked by the percentage of 2015 graduates who took associate positions at the 100 largest law firms based on lawyer headcount.

Before we get to the list of the go-to law schools, it’s worthwhile to speak about the landscape for entry-level employment in the legal profession. While offer rates were sky-high this summer, hiring percentages from America’s top law schools are still dramatically different than they were during Biglaw’s heyday. But things continue to improve from the doldrums of the recession. The [National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202751423586) has more info:

Overall, large-firm hiring held steady in 2015, with 23 percent of graduates from our top 50 Go-To law schools taking new associate jobs at the biggest 100 firms — the same percentage as last year. Those 100 firms hired a total of 3,412 law school graduates from the class of 2015. At the same time, the 50 law schools most popular with large firms sent slightly fewer graduates into the job market than in 2014, although that 1.8 percent decline compared with 2014 was smaller than the 4 percent drop the previous year.

That said, things are looking up for the NLJ’s Go-To Law Schools. Here are the Top 10:

- Columbia Law School
- University of Pennsylvania Law School
- University of Chicago Law School
- Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law
- Duke Law School
- New York University School of Law
- Cornell Law School
- University of Virginia School of Law
- Stanford Law School
- University of California, Berkeley School of Law

You can access the full list of the Top 50 Go-To Law Schools by clicking [here](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202751499299).

With more than 50 percent of its graduates heading to Biglaw firms after graduation, Columbia has ruled this ranking for the past three years. Penn and U. Chicago held steady in their second- and third-place finishes, but there was some movement in the rankings further down the list. Northwestern is now in fourth place after finishing in the #7 slot last year, knocking NYU down two slots. UC Berkeley is back in the Top 10 after disappearing from it last year, knocking Harvard out of the picture entirely. (It should be noted, however, that Harvard sends many graduates directly into clerkships, and those placements aren’t considered in this ranking. That’s likely why Yale barely made it into the Top 20 on this list, and why Stanford’s placement in the Top 10 is so low.)

The National Law Journal also has a list of [“Firm Favorites,”](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202751500491) noting the law schools that specific firms recruited most heavily from. Here are some highlights from that list:

Skadden Arps: Columbia and Harvard (21 from each school)
Paul Weiss: Columbia (16)
Kirkland & Ellis: Chicago and Northwestern (14 from each school)
Latham & Watkins: Georgetown and UVA (13 from each school)
Jones Day: NYU (10)
Gibson Dunn: Columbia and Stanford (9 from each school)

Things still aren’t where they used to be, but they’re getting better each year. More notable than these numbers are the tuition figures appended to this year’s rankings. While the total costs aren’t wildly different, the employment percentages are. Why pay $58,000 to go to a school that sends 25 percent of its graduates to Biglaw when you can pay the same amount to a school that sends 52 percent of its graduates to Biglaw?

Either way you slice it, this list is incredibly useful. It’s a great way for law students, both current and prospective, to gauge their employment prospects in a still-recovering market. Use the National Law Journal’s rankings wisely — or ignore them, at your peril.

# Biglaw Firm Fires Partner After Sexual Harassment Investigation
## Another Biglaw firm ditches a partner over sexual harassment claims.

Maybe, just maybe, the powers that be at Biglaw firms are getting the message that they need to put the safety and well-being of their employees ahead of partners, particularly ones accused of sexual harassment.

Over the long weekend [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-reed-smith-axes-london-partner-over-sexual-harassment-incident) broke the story that the Biglaw firm of Reed Smith fired a partner after an investigation. According to their reporting, a partner in the London office was let go after the firm investigated allegations that partner sexually harassed a female trainee. The specifics of the partner’s behavior remain unknown.

The firm issued a statement touting their “swift” handling of the allegations:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In a statement a Reed Smith spokesman told RollOnFriday that the firm took “swift and appropriate action” as soon as it became aware of “the incident”. Confirming that the “individual concerned” has left Reed Smith, he said that “the safety and well-being of all of our colleagues matter greatly to us, and we are committed to providing a positive and professional workplace for all our people”.

It’s good to see the firm didn’t let profits stand in the way of dealing with allegations of sexual harassment.

I know, I know.

The word “brand” itself gets a bad rap — and if you don’t believe in branding, please feel free to move on.

But if you, like me, have discovered the power of being aware of how you stand out at your workplace (essentially what your reputation, aka “street cred,” is) and intentionally want to ensure that you show up consistently, then this post is for you.

I don’t think any of these tips are groundbreaking — but if executed consistently, they can help you maintain your brand with less brain drain and stress.

Keep A Done List

Many of us have a to-do list. But do you have a done list? A running list of the bigger projects and work you’ve done over the year? Mine just happens to be chunked out in fiscal quarters because that’s how our business is run. The why? It’s helpful to be able to see at a glance what you’ve been working on — to step back from the “trees” to see the “forest.” Keeping the running list in real time helps because it’s easier to scramble and grab your done list when you get an impromptu one-to-one meeting with your manager than to rely on memory when asked, “what are you working on?” Even if the meeting isn’t impromptu, it’s still easier to grab your list instead of trying to prepare for your one to one from memory. It’s also helpful at performance review time because chances are you may not remember what you did yesterday, much less over the year.

Having a done list also helps you evaluate whether you are getting the kind of work you want and whether it’s impactful to the company (and if the answer is no, gives you a basis to ask for the kind of work you want). In addition to work, you may want to jot down any speaking opportunities you’ve had, any publications or awards you’ve received, and any company-enriching committees you’ve been spending time on (like pro bono, mentoring, or the diversity and inclusion committee).

Keep A Recent Headshot

My recommendation is to always have a recent professional headshot ready just in case you need it for a bio, a publication, an award, or a speaking opportunity. It’s also nice to have for your LinkedIn profile. How recent is up to you, but I try to have one that is less than five years old. Another nice to have is an environmental photo (which is more of a partial or full-length professional shot). Obviously, this is not necessary and low on the priority list, but it can really help fortify your external executive presence. And it’s always better to have one on hand then to have to scramble and find someone when you need a photo and realize the last one you had was when you were a first-year associate at that first firm. By the way, it is worth investing in having a professional photographer instead of relying on a selfie or one from your iPhone taken by a friend.

Keep An Archive Of Your Bio

As you gain speaking opportunities and win awards, you will often be asked for a bio of 250 to 500 words. I personally think it’s a pain to write one. So here’s the tip: each time you create one, save it in a file (I use One Note). And each time you are asked, you can work from what you have already created and just tweak it as necessary for the occasion — instead of re-creating the wheel every time.

We think you have to be a superwoman to get to the top of these law firms. And here is someone who would appear to be a superwoman, and even then, if her allegations are true, she’s discriminated against.

— [Nancy Ezold](http://www.ezoldlaw.com/attorneys/nancy-omara-ezold/), an employment lawyer who sued Wolf Block Schorr and Solis-Cohen in the ’90s for [sex discrimination](https://bol.bna.com/fear-of-career-damage-led-woman-to-sue-proskauer-anonymously/), commenting on the anonymously filed [$50 million gender bias lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/inside-the-50-million-gender-discrimination-case-a-partner-filed-against-proskauer-rose/) against Proskauer Rose. The plaintiff’s alleged originations in the Jane Doe case are said to have varied between $7 and $9 million in client revenue per year.

# Boies Schiller Promised Associates Raises, But So Far, They Haven't Materialized
## UPDATE: The firm says there's nothing to worry about and associate raises are on the way.

Over the summer, Boies Schiller Flexner made big news when they announced a [revamped associate compensation system](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/big-changes-on-the-horizon-for-boies-schiller-bonuses/). Gone, if the associates opted in, was the firm’s traditional bonus formula that includes a revenue share component that affords associates a cut of the matters they work on, which for contingency work can be quite generous indeed, in favor of a market rate system (complete with a 2,000 billable hour requirement).

As part of that change, the firm promised associates raises to the prevailing market rate in June. But then they pushed back the raise date to October 15th. Then again it was moved to the end of October. And now it’s November, and… nothing.

As an [insider tells](https://www.law.com/2020/10/30/boies-schiller-flexner-misses-associate-salary-raise-deadline-as-rumors-swirl-about-cash-flow-issues/) Law.com:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
More senior attorneys topped out at $330,000. It’s unclear whether any of Boies Schiller’s offices were already paying associates at that level prior to the raise announced earlier this year. But for associates on lower pay scales in markets such as Florida, the raises announced this summer would have amounted to “tens of thousands” of dollars, one former partner said.

“Boies Schiller had promised to raise associate salaries to Cravath NY scale firm-wide starting in June, then they sent a memo pushing that back to October, then they pushed back October salary payments from 15th of October to end of month, now the associates are really upset because October payments also did not reflect raises,” the former partner said.

This series of payment delays has reportedly sparked concerns at the firm of cash flow issues. Those fears are supercharged by a [series of partner departures ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/everyone-seems-to-be-overreacting-to-these-boies-schiller-departures/)— more than 40 thus far — from the firm earlier this year. And of course, the firm has said they’re in the midst of a [larger transition phase](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/david-boies-dishes-on-firms-transition-strategy/), as the relatively young Biglaw firm anticipates a world where the name partners are no longer practicing, slow moving as [that transition](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/boies-schiller-transition-process-continues-with-two-new-managing-partners/) may be.

UPDATE: The firm has reached out with an update on the associate raises, according to a spokesperson for the firm:

Salary adjustments for those associates who elected to move to market compensation became effective on October 1, 2020, and were due to be paid out on October 30, 2020. The adjusted salaries will be paid—retroactively—on Friday, November 6th. To set the record straight: the processing of the new salary adjustments through the Firm’s financial systems took longer than anticipated. The suggestion of delay caused by cash flow issues is both absurd and flat-out wrong. Unlike so many other firms, our Firm is one of very few that has not made salary or work force reductions due to the ongoing Covid pandemic.

# Biglaw Firm Celebrates International Women's Day By Highlighting Men's Voices

Yesterday was International Women’s Day, and brands around the globe went out of their way to signal their support for the cause. And while a tweet or IG post doesn’t change much, it at least lets consumers or potential clients know the values their money supports.

Biglaw is a business, and subject to the same PR pressures as other brands. So, it was unsurprising to see[ Skadden highlighting](https://twitter.com/SkaddenArps/status/1368718179279716352?s=20) the accomplishments of the women of the firm, or Akin Gump [amplifying the message](https://twitter.com/akin_gump/status/1368974340453244934?s=20) of two female partners, or[ Milbank sharing](https://twitter.com/MilbankLaw/status/1369077815379783684?s=20) an associate’s thoughts on how to change the legal industry to become more equitable. But not every Biglaw firm hit the right tone with their message.

Take Squire Patton Boggs. The[ firm’s tweet](https://twitter.com/SPB_Global/status/1368901545757184001?s=20) about International Women’s Day was exclusively of men showing support for the concept of equality. Certainly meaningful diversity and inclusion is everyone’s responsibility, not just the traditionally disenfranchised, but this was the firm’s *only* tweet for #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2021.



If you’re trying to promote gender diversity, giving male voices center stage is hardly the best way to do it. But this isn’t the first time a Biglaw firm has made men the center of their gender diversity efforts. [Back in 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/biglaw-firm-doesnt-think-men-get-nearly-enough-credit/?rf=1), Paul Hastings did something similar in an internal email, and as I said at the time:

Listen, I’m sure these are good people that probably even care about diversity in the workplace. But there is a way to handle and even promote allyship that doesn’t make it all about the men. One of the fundamental keys to being a [good ally](https://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround/how-to-be-a-better-ally-an-open-letter-to-white-folks), in any context, is realizing it isn’t about you [the person with the privilege]. Certainly increasing gender diversity at the firm is something that men need to prioritize and take responsibility for, but casting men as the heroes that will save women from their own languishing careers misses the mark.

Yes, there is yet another ranking of Biglaw firms. But that isn’t surprising — lawyers just love knowing exactly where they stand vis-a-vis their competition. Now that Am Law has rolled out their annual list of the [Global 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/09/24/the-2019-global-100-ranked-by-revenue/), we know everyone is curious to see just how the rankings shake out.

First the good news: Overall, the Global 100’s gross revenue grew by 8.1 percent, bringing that number up to $114.2 billion, handily beating last year’s growth of 6.4 percent. And while the United States dominates the list — 77 of the firms on the list have the bulk of their attorneys here — the international presence is growing, with 12 firms having more U.K. lawyers than any other and 5 Chinese firms cracking the list.

While you can — and should — check out the full list of the Global 100 firms [at Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/09/24/the-2019-global-100-ranked-by-revenue/), we’ll cut to the chase and share the top 25 firms in the Global 100 ranked by gross revenue.

The Biglaw pay raises and bonuses of recent years are due in no significant part to a boom in M&A work, which accounts for a large chunk of revenue for the major New York law firms that tend to lead the market on compensation. Last year, global M&A activity reached a record high of [$5 trillion](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ma-activity-tops-5-trillion-in-record-2015-2015-12-28) (with one firm, Skadden Arps, advising on [$1 trillion](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/12/11/the-trillion-dollar-ma-milestones/) worth of deals).

So M&A work is critically important to law firms — and to in-house lawyers as well, whose employers can be dramatically transformed by a major transaction. If deals are going to be done, they need to be done right.

At the [2016 Annual Meeting](https://www.accmeetings.com/am16/agenda.aspx?_ga=1.190435179.1789950044.1474032089) of the Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC), taking place right now in San Francisco, I attended a great session called “Lessons Learned From Major M&A Transactions.” It featured the following panelists:

- Janet Wright, SVP, Corporate Legal, Dell Inc.
Here are some takeaways from the conversation:

1. Have an M&A team at the ready, even before you’re working on a deal.

Transaction timetables can be tight, so in-house lawyers should think in advance about who should be on their teams, both internal and external, and put those specialists “on call.” The external team might include outside counsel, communications or PR professionals, firms that work on proxy fights (for public companies), and alternative legal services providers (who can help reduce cost). And as companies and transactions become more global, in-house lawyers need to consider developing relationships with advisors in other jurisdictions too.

The internal team might include colleagues in human resources, information technology, finance, and accounting. It’s important to have a wide range of expertise on your team — and to have “clean” teams, so that information isn’t shared with people inappropriately.

2. Pay careful attention to regulatory issues.

Very few deals are challenged on regulatory grounds, but when it does happen, it can create major challenges. Don’t make the mistake of treating regulatory issues as an afterthought or saving communication with regulators for the last minute. If you reach out to regulators early enough and explain any specific issues or concerns you might have (including ones regarding timing), they are often happy to work with you.

In-house lawyers need to make sure that other team members don’t take actions that create regulatory problems — for example, investment bankers who brag in an offering memo for a company about the industry’s high barrier to entry, which can create antitrust issues. In-house attorneys must coordinate communications with different regulators, both within the United States and abroad, to ensure consistency (because regulators do talk to each other). And in-house lawyers must watch out for “gun jumping”; two companies can’t start acting like one entity until they’ve gone through the government’s antitrust review.

3. Have an integration team that plans for the post-closing environment.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While “gun jumping” is a no-no, companies must at the same time think ahead to day one of operating as a combined entity. An integration team should focus on which functions or divisions will get combined post-closing and which ones will continue to operate separately. A smooth integration process is crucial to making sure that a deal’s value is fully realized.

4. Don’t be afraid to walk away.

M&A deals are like marriages — they are transformative, and they shouldn’t be entered into lightly. Too many transactions are actually value-destroying instead of value-creating. When it comes to a contemplated M&A deal, in-house lawyers must always keep in mind: what are we doing, and why are we doing it?

People at a company can get so focused on closing a deal that they lose sight of why they’re doing the deal or whether it’s a good idea. Lawyers (and businesspeople too) can get so set on a deal that they ignore warning signs that emerge during due diligence that should have led the transaction to be called off. Sometimes issues that emerge during diligence can be addressed through tweaks to the deal terms or merger documents, but sometimes it’s best to just walk away.

5. Learn from each transaction that you complete.

Companies that do a fair amount of M&A can and should get better at the process each time. After each deal, in-house lawyers should hold debriefing sessions to review what went well and what didn’t. These debriefs can be used to create checklists of unanticipated issues, so those issues can be addressed more effectively when the next deal comes around. These checklists can in turn be used to create a playbook for use in future transactions.

Major M&A deals can be intimidating, given their many moving parts, as well as the thousands of jobs and billions of dollars at stake. But at the end of the day, M&A is a lot like so many other processes: practice makes perfect.

To my readers in the Biglaw world, have you ever felt like Marty McFly? Like you’re stuck somewhere that looks familiar, but is decades behind the times, and only you and maybe a couple others realize it? Do you feel like you’re waiting for a bolt of lightning from the sky to rip you out of the past and send you back home?

I ask this because I watched Back To The Future with my kids over the weekend, and it struck a nerve I wasn’t expecting. I’ve had the privilege of spending a lot of time these past few years researching, discussing, and thinking about the place of Biglaw in the modern business economy, and watching Marty McFly stumble around a time-shifted Hill Valley felt all-too-familiar. That transition to an earlier time is the same sensation I get when returning to the Biglaw world after spending time immersed in the larger business community. In too many ways, the Biglaw industry is operating as if the last 20 years never happened. Doc and Marty knew when and where lightning was going to strike, and they used that to launch themselves into the future. We don’t have that same luxury, but all the same we desperately need something to zap our industry out of its comfort zone.

(Fun sidebar: the movie also hit my son hard. He sobbed hysterically when Doc Brown tore open his shirt after being shot at the end of the movie to reveal he was wearing a bulletproof vest. “They’re happy tears,” my little guy said. Parenthood, amiright?)

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The Cost of Curiosity

Lately I’ve been giving a lot of thought to the concept of professional curiosity as one avenue to kickstarting Biglaw out of its malaise. The larger business world is [recognizing](https://hbr.org/2018/09/research-83-of-executives-say-they-encourage-curiosity-just-52-of-employees-agree?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_campaign=dailyalert_activesubs&utm_content=signinnudge&referral=00563&deliveryName=DM14647) that fostering curiosity at every level of an organization is essential to boosting productivity, happiness, and engagement. Curiosity is both a cause of and evidence of a healthy work environment. It’s a piece of a virtuous cycle.

When employees feel empowered and protected, they’re more likely to feel ownership of their team, and the desire to develop it. In that environment, employees want to learn more about what they’re doing. They want to understand more about their role in the larger team, and that team’s role in the company, and perhaps even their company’s role in the larger industry. They take that knowledge and turn it into new ideas and innovations, or maybe just a greater sense of purpose and camaraderie that increases their productivity. In a healthy environment, management recognizes engagement and superior performance, and rewards it. Curious, engaged, empowered employees are the everyday R&D of a modern business.

Unsurprisingly, Biglaw’s ossified structures aren’t exactly great at encouraging employee curiosity. At what level does Biglaw typically incentivize pure learning for the sake of learning? I’d argue almost none. Associates who spend time in the library learning about new areas of law are going to be asked why they aren’t billing. File clerks and secretarial staff who bother their supervisors with questions about how the legal industry works are more likely to be reprimanded than edified.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Where curiosity is encouraged, it’s always purely for the sake of immediate financial benefit, rather than long-term organizational health. For an example, if an associate is ordered to go research a new statute coming through the legislature so the firm can market itself with an informational session with industry leaders, that’s not evidence of an associate being given room to develop themselves. That’s more evidence of the top-down, do-what-I-say hierarchy that defines so much of Biglaw. We sell our time by the hour. It’s not surprising that we don’t reward people who spend their hours doing things that can’t be immediately sold.

Why Rain Comes with Lightning

 We also largely lack one of the big prerequisites for fostering curiosity in our ranks: the feeling of professional safety and empowerment. As I’ve [discussed before](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-is-turning-associates-into-george-costanzas/?rf=1), the best teams are comprised of people who feel safe within the team. Anyone who will take a bullet for someone else usually thinks the other would have taken a bullet for them. As an industry, we’re horrible at this. Our associates continually report feeling under scrutiny, under pressure, under-rested, and over-worked. Curiosity is a risk. It’s spending time away from what we know works in pursuit of something that might, just might, work better. If our associates don’t feel comfortable enough to take a long lunch break without checking in, how can they feel safe enough to ask to spend time researching new technologies or bleeding edge areas of law where the potential payoff is distant and uncertain?

The simultaneous tragedy and opportunity here is that curiosity is one of the things that lawyers are best at. We’re trained from law school forward in the art of identifying things we don’t know, curing that ignorance, organizing our thoughts so that others can learn from our effort, and in the process identifying five more things we don’t know that we could do further research on. I remember the rush I’d feel as an associate when I was assigned a research project on something truly interesting, and the internal tension between learning all I wanted to learn versus getting back to productive, billable tasks.

Encouraging curiosity also has second-order benefits that so many firms overlook. Non-billable time spent learning and engaging with the community outside of Biglaw is an investment in the future. Giving associates and young partners the time, space, and encouragement today to become industry thought leaders is a good way to have a new crop of rainmakers generating profits for your firm in a decade, and to ensure those rainmakers stay with the firm that helped build them up.

Creating More Doc Browns

In Back to the Future, Doc Brown spent his family’s entire fortune pursuing his curiosities and creating the flux capacitor. Although law firms can’t pay first-year associates $190,000 per year to theorize and experiment around-the-clock, we can do better. By failing to foster curiosity in our firm cultures, we’re failing to fully utilize one of our fundamental strengths as attorneys. You can’t harvest a crop you never plant, and you can’t sell cutting-edge expertise and counsel when you haven’t bothered to learn anything new. Today’s learners are tomorrow’s moguls. It’s bad leadership, and bad business, not to think long term and encourage that kind of professional growth in our ranks.

Teaching our associates to ask questions fearlessly would be powerful. How powerful precisely is hard to say, but I’d stake good money it’s at least 1.21 gigawatts.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In the wake of a violent takeover of Capitol Hill fueled by thoroughly debunked allegations of a “stolen” election, Donald Trump’s phone call with Georgia election officials encouraging them to “find” enough ballots to award him the state may seem like the distant past. But nope, that was just a few days ago.

Not that the call should fade from our memories. The myths that fueled the unruly mob yesterday were forged by the insistence of Donald Trump and his enablers that votes were triple-counted and that zombie Hugo Chavez is secretly running voting machines from his basement. At least four people are dead after yesterday’s assault on the Capitol and there’s a straight line from there to Trump’s election interference efforts.

Cleta Mitchell is [already out at Foley & Lardner](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cleta-mitchell-out-at-foley-lardner-after-troubling-donald-trump-call/), resigning after the firm expressed its concern that Mitchell participated on a call where the President of the United States committed deftly to checking off all the requirements of an election interference charge. Mitchell blamed “leftist groups” for her resignation, so she stayed on brand until the end.

But one thing kept bugging me about the transcript of the infamous call:

You also have the attorneys that represent the president, Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell…

“Cleta Mitchell” is self-explanatory. “Kurt” is Kurt Hilbert, the Georgia attorney who is the attorney of record on Trump v. Kemp, the lawsuit that formed the basis of the now infamous “settlement negotiation” call. However, this “Alex” never spoke on the call so we didn’t get a window into who he was. But who is “Alex”? A random conservative solo trying to become the next Jenna Ellis?

No, it’s a Biglaw partner. After a few days of digging, we’ve determined that [Alex B. Kaufman](https://www.foxrothschild.com/alex-b-kaufman/) of [Fox Rothschild](https://www.foxrothschild.com/) was the final participant on the call.

When reached for comment, the firm stressed that “Firm policy prohibits Fox Rothschild attorneys from representing as counsel anyone participating in efforts to contest the 2020 Presidential Election” and concluded that “Kaufman did not attend the January 2 call among President Trump and others in his capacity as a Fox Rothschild attorney.”

At first blush, that statement made me fear I’d hit another dead end in my search for “Alex.” But then I parsed that last line and realized it doesn’t exactly say that he wasn’t on the call. After lobbing another request to see if the firm intended to place a period after “others” in that sentence, I received a revised statement including this line:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Kaufman was not acting as a Fox Rothschild attorney when he was present for, but did not speak on, the January 2nd call among President Trump and others.

Well, there you have it. They almost had me!

The statement also explains that “[t]he firm does not bar its lawyers from running for public office or participating as individuals in political activities.” This “participating in political activities” language is attempting to carry a lot of weight. It tracks Mitchell’s attempt to shrug off Foley & Lardner’s concerns that she’d gone rogue by claiming that she was engaging in private political activity and not acting as a legal advisor. Despite being introduced as his lawyer and spending the whole call arguing on the president’s behalf.

When we discussed Mitchell’s situation with Foley & Lardner, we pointed out that attorneys practicing outside the aegis of their firms can raise all manner of ethical and insurance issues. To that end, Fox Rothschild notes that Kaufman already serves independently as the General Counsel for the Fulton County Republican Party and an Associate General Counsel for the Georgia Republican Party, but declares that the firm “does not represent the Fulton County Republican Party or the Georgia Republican Party in contesting the 2020 presidential election.” This wording suggests that the firm does in other situations while one of their partners is in-house for those entities.

Thus, unlike Mitchell, Kaufman seems to be acting in his capacity as counsel to the Georgia parties, which the firm seems to characterize as a political activity even if it involves acting as legal counsel. Though the call introduces him as representing Donald Trump, perhaps that was simply imprecise phrasing. In that case, presumably, acting on behalf of another entity like the state party resolves a lot of the thornier issues that Mitchell invited by offering legal advice with no other affiliation than Foley & Lardner. That said it’s hard to square the policy against “representing as counsel anyone participating in efforts to contest the 2020 Presidential Election” with “unless they’re working as in-house counsel for someone participating in efforts to contest the 2020 Presidential Election.”

Still, it’s worth noting again that the effort to undermine the election and sow the seeds of the mob that we saw yesterday has not been the sole work of dubious free agents like Rudy and Jenna Ellis. Lawyers with Biglaw pedigrees are deeply involved in this effort.

And some of those Biglaw firms are trying to have their “Firm policy prohibits Fox Rothschild attorneys from representing as counsel anyone participating in efforts to contest the 2020 Presidential Election” cake and eat it too.

Here is the final Fox Rothschild statement in full:

Firm policy prohibits Fox Rothschild attorneys from representing as counsel anyone participating in efforts to contest the 2020 Presidential Election. The firm does not bar its lawyers from running for public office or participating as individuals in political activities.

Neither Alex Kaufman nor Fox Rothschild represent the President or his campaign. Kaufman is a partner in the firm’s Atlanta office. Kaufman, in his individual capacity, is the General Counsel for the Fulton County Republican Party and an Associate General Counsel for the Georgia Republican Party. Kaufman was not acting as a Fox Rothschild attorney when he was present for, but did not speak on, the January 2nd call among President Trump and others. Fox Rothschild does not represent the Fulton County Republican Party or the Georgia Republican Party in contesting the 2020 presidential election.

UPDATE (1/7/21 7:37 p.m.) : Statement from Fox Rothschild:

Alex B. Kaufman and Robert J. Kaufman, both partners in the Atlanta office, reached a mutual agreement with Fox Rothschild LLP today to depart from the firm and pursue new professional opportunities. Alex and Robert joined Fox Rothschild in December 2019 after running their own firm since 1982.  

As you may have read in the media, Alex Kaufman was present for the January 2nd phone call among President Trump and others. Neither Alex Kaufman nor Fox Rothschild represent or have ever represented the President or his campaign.

As a national law firm, we are non-partisan, and we do not represent either President Trump or President-elect Biden.

UPDATE (1/9/21 9:40 a.m.):

Kaufman’s statement:

“My father and I have enjoyed working with Fox Rothschild over the past year, and we have worked with them to provide our clients with the highest levels of service,” Alex Kaufman said. “Before joining Fox Rothschild, I worked in our family’s law firm that my father first opened in 1982. Joining Fox Rothschild was a chance to try something different. We’ve enjoyed our time working with this great legal team, but in the end, as happens, both sides determined this was not the right fit. We will continue to service our clients’ needs moving forward with the same excellent service they’ve come to expect of us.”

Recent media stories have mentioned that Alex Kaufman took part in, but did not speak on, the Jan. 2 phone call between President Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

“I do not and have not represented President Trump, the Trump campaign, or the Secretary of State,” Kaufman said. “In my personal capacity I provide legal counsel to local Republican parties and other stake holders. I was on the call in case there was talk of a settlement agreement that impacted my responsibilities. In my view, that call did not cover issues for me to weigh in on, and therefore, I played no role in the conversation.”

“Our future will look very much like our past: We’ll continue to provide our clients with excellent legal counsel and continue our involvement in the Atlanta community.”

President-elect Donald Trump

Trump has denounced people in language that punctuated his campaign. If what he said is not pure protected opinion, then the press side ought to take a hard look and see if they have a basis for commencing litigation. They have to think creatively, as no candidate in living memory has denounced the press as he has; no candidate has banned journalists from covering him because they didn’t like the tone or substance of what they are saying. And so, press lawyers ought to bear in mind that if things get rough, if the relationship is one of constant denigration and threats, it may be time for journalists to think about using libel laws in a way that is constitutional.

If what he’s saying is merely rhetorical or hyperbolic in the sense of ‘reporters are no good,’ that would not give [the journalist] a right [to sue]. But if he seems to mean it, if he says a reporter is routinely publishing false material, then maybe we’re moving down the road where a reporter responds by not only saying, ‘It is not so,’ but by going to court.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
— Famed First Amendment attorney [Floyd Abrams](https://www.cahill.com/professionals/floyd-abrams), in comments given to the [Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/famed-media-defender-reporters-should-think-suing-donald-trump-libel-946178) after moderating a discussion between [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), [Daniel Ellsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg), [Max Frankel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Frankel), and [Noreen Krall](http://chipsnetwork.org/home/co-founders/noreen-krall/) about national security and the media hosted by the [Media Law Resource Center](http://www.medialaw.org/component/content/article/11/257-mlrc-annual-dinner-2016). Before the discussion began, Abrams referred to President-elect Donald Trump as the “greatest threat to the First Amendment since the passage of the Sedition Act of 1798.”

# Davis Polk Goes Over The Top On Salaries
## Well, this escalated quickly.

Let’s get the money train started.

Hey, did you like yesterday’s salary announcements? Would you like to see more? Perhaps a firm going over the top? Well, you’re in luck.

After Milbank raised the stakes on associate salaries, Davis Polk has told the market loud and clear that they will see any salary increase and raise you.



Davis Polk has spent the last year absolutely dominating the compensation discussion as a prime mover on the special bonus front, and I guess it didn’t like the idea of not taking a leading role in the salary conversation.

Congratulations, everybody!

Please help us help you when it comes to salary news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Salary”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary/Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Associates Miffed Over Fine Print On Special Bonuses
## With enough client billable hours, you too can get the money your peers are making.

The good news is that Jenner & Block has finally gotten on board with special bonuses to thank associates for their hard work during the pandemic.

And you see, on the surface it may seem like a typical bonus announcement. After all, the bonus numbers (set out below) are the same standard set by Davis Polk all those weeks ago.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
But according to tipsters at the firm, the full memo (available in full on the next page) sets out some pretty stiff billing requirements. Specifically, associates have to be on track to bill 2,000 hours (make-up payments are available at Jenner) and the kicker is that pro bono and other non-client work won’t be counted towards the hours.

As a particularly salty insider shared with Above the Law:

Jenner & Block just issued a memo re special bonuses. Only given out if you are on track to meet 2,000 true billable hours – no consideration of pro bono or firm-directed work.

People are pissed. The firm talks big talk about how important pro bono is and how much they value it as well as business development hours, but will never put their money where their mouth is. Indeed just three weeks ago the firm released “guidance for associates regarding non-billable hours” setting forth all the non billable work associates should prioritize, and yet it’s entirely ignored in bonus time. We hoped after a year that the new managing partners would’ve addressed this recurring hypocrisy, but alas it’s just the same old same old. Don’t come to Jenner if compensation is a priority for you.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# How To Leave Biglaw For Good
## Lose the golden handcuffs in the new year.

So many people working in Biglaw hate Biglaw. While the paycheck is nice, and acts as golden handcuffs keeping folks tied to a job that otherwise makes them miserable, some people yearn for work that doesn’t tie them to their office for 2,200 hours a year. But trying to figure out exactly how to extricate yourself from a job that comprises the majority of your professional experience can be a real challenge.

Enter Elena Deutsch. She’s the founder of a career counseling service call Women Interested in Leaving (big) Law, known as WILL, and the name of the company is pretty descriptive of what it does. Deutsch, who is celebrating the one-year anniversary of WILL, is an expert in helping women navigating major career changes. As one of WILL’s clients, an eighth-year associate in San Francisco, said of the experience:

When I started WILL I had no framework for how to approach the conundrum of whether to stay or leave my firm… and more largely what to do with my career. I had given it a lot of thought, but was stuck. Now, I have more confidence. I decided to leave my firm and I’m coming from a place of clarity and belief in myself.

In this week’s episode of the Jabot podcast, I interview Deutsch to discuss career changes, leaving Biglaw, and how to have a career you enjoy. And if you’re interested in the services WILL offers, they’re holding a private workshop for women in New York City on January 24, 2019, and a seminar on alternative careers at the New York County Lawyers Association on February 6, 2019.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

Biglaw firms continue to cut costs wherever they can in the wake of the coronavirus crisis to keep their firms afloat. Some firms thought that layoffs would suffice, but even that wasn’t enough, and they now find themselves making additional cuts — this time to partner draws and benefit programs.

You may remember that last month, Goldberg Segalla [conducted staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/law-firms-conduct-layoffs-slash-salaries-in-response-to-pandemic/) “in large numbers,” according to our sources. Apparently that wasn’t enough, and now, the firm has turned its eyes to partner draws and benefits. We’ve been told that Goldberg Segalla will be reducing its biweekly partner draws by 10 to 20 percent, effective with the May 8 payroll. Sources also say that the firm has terminated its 401(k) matching program.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We reached out to the firm for confirmation, and this is what a spokesperson told us:

The reduction in draw does not reflect a decision with respect to overall compensation. In addition, the firm will be suspending the 401(k) match for a period of time. These are temporary measures we expect to institute in the short-term while operating in the COVID-19 environment.

Let’s hope Goldberg Segalla can save jobs through these additional reductions.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

You’ve got partners who bring in the work and deserve to be compensated for it, and partners who do the work and deserve to be compensated for it as well. It’s not unlike a professional sports team without the O line: A quarterback can be great, but they’re not much without a strong O line.

— an anonymous Biglaw partner, in comments given to [Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/growing-pay-gap-between-big-law-partners-causing-culture-rifts-2022-4?r=US&IR=T) on “the invisible middle,” that is, the group of senior associates and service partners responsible for bringing in a substantial share of a firm’s revenue, who aren’t being paid nearly as handsomely as many of their colleagues. One former Dechert attorney spoke of a “massive” compensation gap between their firm’s lowest-paid partners and “superclass” partners. A Gibson Dunn partner noted that supercharged partner salaries could cause a “culture hit,” saying, “You can’t keep your culture when somebody is making eight times as much as someone else In what sense are those people partners? They’re not.”

# The Biglaw Firms Where Women Are Most Satisfied With Their Jobs (2022)
## Women aren't as satisfied with their jobs as men. Which firms are trying to fix this problem?

What does it take to cultivate job satisfaction at a law firm? In a new report from BTI Consulting, associates pointed out exactly what they wanted from and valued in their work lives, and which firms were the best at committing to their overall happiness.

According to BTI, Biglaw associates are looking for these eight core activities from their firms when it comes to their overall professional happiness:

- Commitment to helping associates in their career
- Specific action to help develop a career path
- Access to training they need
- Good mentoring
- Optimism about growing within their firm
- High levels of job satisfaction
- Being well paid
- Having at least one partner watching out for them

After going evaluating 4,000 responses, BTI found that 147 Biglaw firms did the best job when it came to associate satisfaction. Sounds nice, right? It turns out that women aren’t nearly as satisfied at their Biglaw firms. When separated by gender, women associates ranked just 122 firms as the best for overall job satisfaction. In fact, women rated their job satisfaction as 13.5 percentage points lower than that of their male counterparts, and 62% of them saw their firms imparting “limited or no commitment to helping them in their careers” (compared to 48% of men). Oof.

Some firms, however, really stood out above the rest when it came to satisfying their female associates. Which ones are committed to helping women in their careers and developing their career paths?

Women associates named 97 firms as being on top of the game when it came to helping them in their careers by creating robust women’s initiatives and offering resources and guidance for women in the profession. Only nine of those firms were ranked as being the best of the best when in helping women to foster their careers. Here they are:

- Baker Donelson
- Fenwick & West
- Fisher Phillips
- Greenberg Traurig
- Jones Day
- Littler
- Milbank
- Polsinelli
- Wilson Elser

Relatedly, women associates seem to think their firms are really slacking when it comes to helping them develop their career paths. Just 22% of women associates said they saw “robust and specific action” from their firms in terms of cultivating their career paths. While 80 firms were named as excelling in this area, these seven rose to the top. Here they are:

- Baker Donelson
- Fenwick & West
- Fisher Phillips
- Greenberg Traurig
- Jones Day
- Milbank
- Wilson Elser
Congratulations to these firms on their efforts to help women associates nurture and develop their careers in Biglaw. This is an accomplishment that’s incredibly important to diversity in the legal profession, and we’d love to see even more of it. Maybe your firm will be one of the “best of the best” next year.

# Biglaw Firm Merging With Minority-Owned Boutique To Create Coast-To-Coast Firm
## The merger offers the potential to lift other firms up along the way.

Yesterday, [Frost Brown Todd](https://frostbrowntodd.com/), an Am Law second 100 firm, announced that it’s merging with [AlvaradoSmith](https://www.alvaradosmith.com/), a minority-owned California firm. With offices in Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco joining with Frost Brown Todd’s existing 14 offices, the firm now spans from Washington, D.C. to the Pacific Ocean.

At a time when we’re hearing rumblings of law firm layoffs, Frost Brown Todd and AlvaradoSmith see strength in growth.

“AlvaradoSmith is known for successfully taking on matters and clients often associated with big firms, while FBT has the resources of a large firm with the culture of a boutique shop,” said AlvaradoSmith Managing Shareholder Ruben Smith. “That’s why we’re confident this combination will be an excellent fit, allowing us to grow our capacity and resources while still retaining our deep connection to clients and community. We look forward to a very productive future with Frost Brown Todd.”

According to firm sources, the firm will operate as Frost Brown Todd AlvaradoSmith through 2023 before fully transitioning to Frost Brown Todd.

There’s something bittersweet about mergers like this. AlvaradoSmith is a minority-owned law firm with over 30 years of success and, after 2023, the name will get absorbed into another Biglaw firm.

On the other hand, it’s a testament to the firm’s record that it now forms the foundation of a national firm’s California presence. In a market that too often crushes small firms, being able to partner with a broader network of attorneys across the country takes AlvaradoSmith’s work to another level.

Leslie Davis, CEO of the [National Association of Minority and Women Owned Law Firms](https://namwolf.org/), explained that while the country is technically losing one minority-owned firm, the merger carries more promise for the organization’s overarching mission. “We’ll sorely miss them as part of our roster, but they’ll always be part of the NAMWOLF family” because, as Davis noted, the perspectives and values cultivated at AlvaradoSmith aren’t going away as it joins with Frost Brown Todd.

Among the advantages of bringing AlvaradoSmith’s perspectives and values into a merged firm is adding the insights of a successful minority-owned firm to a national firm’s DEI initiatives. AlvaradoSmith’s Managing Shareholder Ruben Smith will co-chair the firm’s diversity and inclusion committee and there’s really no way to quantify the value of having someone in that role who comes at it with the added perspective of having run a firm.

The merger also opens the door to leveraging Frost Brown Todd’s national scope to lift up other NAMWOLF members. “We’re hoping that this merger is an opportunity to partner with NAMWOLF,” Davis said. “They still have the same mindset and goals…. There are still conflicts and times when you need a different set of eyes.” Adding partners familiar with NAMWOLF’s 210 member firms across 43 states presents tremendous referral opportunities. In that way, merging into a national firm is more about attacking the problems plaguing the legal profession from a different angle.

And most importantly, Davis pointed out, it’s only a loss for NAMWOLF when a member firm closes its doors. Everything else is just another opportunity for partnership. With NAMWOLF adding more firms over the last 18 months than it’s lost, seeing former members carry the organization’s values to a national platform is a win-win for the expanding roster.

# Biglaw Firm Finally Gets In On The Special Bonus Action
## Associates will cash in -- if they bill enough.

Biglaw’s move to thank associates for their hard work during a pandemic/[ploy to keep associates bound by golden handcuffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/special-bonuses-are-just-another-way-to-keep-associates-hooked-on-biglaw/) is continuing. Yet another Biglaw firm is giving associates special bonuses, provided, of course, that they bill enough.

Steptoe & Johnson, which made $393,914,000 in gross revenue lat year, making it 97th in the AmLaw 100, has just announced special bonuses. The firm will match the market standard set back in March by Davis Polk, but there’s a slight catch. In order to be eligible for the special bonuses, “associates must be at 100% of budget, based on billable work alone.”

Eligible associates will receive bonuses according to the following schedule:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Level	July	December	Total
1	$4,500	$7,500	$12,000
2	$6,000	$10,000	$16,000
3	$12,000	$20,000	$32,000
4	$16,000	$28,000	$44,000
5	$19,000	$33,000	$52,000
6	$22,200	$37,000	$59,200
7+	$24,000	$40,000	$64,000
They went with July/December disbursements, which is a bit later than the June/September dates some firms are rolling with, but, most importantly, the amount of money remains the same. The firm also clarified, like so many other firms, that this will be in addition to the regular year-end bonuses.

Additionally, the firm noted that if an associate does not meet the hours requirement for the July bonus payment (the threshold is not disclosed in the email, it’s expected it’ll be in line with the firm’s usual hours requirements), they’ll have an opportunity to garner a make-up payment along with the December bonus.

# The End Of The 'Partner' Era
## Lateral moves are no longer a bottom-line bonus, but a requisite for competing in the modern legal market.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

The Am Law 200 law firms rarely witness partners with “lifer” mentalities anymore. As the lateral market has become more opaque and clients more mobile, and as firms chase metrics, we expect to see very few partners stay with their firm long-term.

Over the last eight years, over 50% of Biglaw partners have lateraled firms at least once. Those who last moved 5-6 years ago are the most likely to move again based on sample data from 2015 lateral moves.  As an attorney becomes more displaced from his last lateral move, his likelihood of moving increases fairly linearly. The exception to this rule is a partner within one year of his last move.

Movement rates spike in the first year of an attorney’s lateral move. To recruiters, this is unsurprising; what might have seemed like a perfect marriage of attorney and firm can swiftly fall apart once the partnership is consummated. The impetus for these first-year moves are often either financial or personal; a partner may have overpromised and under-delivered respective to their projections during the lateral process, a firm may have hyperbolized its platform or overstated its capabilities, or it can simply be a case of culture shock or coworker compatibility.

After the first year, rates of movement steadily increase until they hit a second peak in the fifth year. Based on the collected data, partners making a move last moved five years ago, on average. Because of relative population sizes, in terms of volume, most lateral partner moves are made by those who have not moved in the past five years. However, the data suggests that firms that added partners in 2011 — five years ago — will see lateral attrition at a much higher relative rate than normal.



The firms at the top of this list are largely unsurprising; this Who’s Who of the largest firms features few surprising names. DLA Piper’s modest loss of lateral partners since January backs our assumptions. Fifty percent of the partners had moved in the last eight years, with most moving either one year ago, or five years ago.



This trend is not uniform, however; JD year plays a significant role in predicting who will move. Based on the analysis of 2015’s lateral moves, there is a strong upwards trend in lateral movement the more junior a partner is. The correlation coefficient between JD and movement rates is .2, a fairly pronounced correlation.

This trend is not surprising. As partners push up against mandatory retirement ages, their practices become less mobile. For those waiting too long, it can become extraordinarily difficult to secure another partnership position after they have been de-equitized.

The dip in the movement rates for late ’90s and early ’00s grads represents a mobility trap in the life of a partner. Many of these partners are newly equitized, and they are in the process of accreting portable business. Many of the early- to mid-2000 grads are non-equity partners and face less scrutiny over their portable business. Attorneys from the early- to mid-’90s have had years to secure new clients and build up their portable business, making them more attractive lateral prospects. Without this dip in lateral mobility, the correlation between JD year and movement rates would have been even more pronounced.

The marginalization of the old partnership model has transformed the partner market on the firm level from an autarky to an open economy — similar to sports teams these days, we see fewer lifers like Magic and Bird and more journeymen like Jason Kidd and Dwight Howard.

Lateral moves are no longer a bottom-line bonus, but a requisite for competing in the modern legal market. Firms are starting to make use of analytics to keep their partnership stock steady. Firms that binged on lateral hires in certain years will have to plan ahead to offset the losses they will likely incur five years down the line.

Our job at Lateral Link is to understand the market and respond to trends before firms find themselves in a pinch. We typically approach decision makers before they ask for assistance because we already understand the situation they face given market intelligence and data. In a way, we act as merchant bankers — in the historical sense — and we are happy to help you analyze and quell your lateral leakages before you start to notice them; once you start noticing losses, it’s often too late.

[Lateral Link](http://laterallink.com/) is one of the top-rated international legal recruiting firms. With over 14 offices world-wide, Lateral Link specializes in placing attorneys at the most prestigious law firms and companies in the world. Managed by former practicing attorneys from top law schools, Lateral Link has a tradition of hiring lawyers to execute the lateral leaps of practicing attorneys.

# Ninth Circuit Judge Plans To Leave The Bench, Return To Private Practice
## It better be the job of a lifetime for him to leave a lifetime appointment.

It’s not everyday that a federal appellate judge decides to pull the plug on a lifetime judicial appointment, but here we are.

Judge Paul Watford of the Ninth Circuit recently announced that he will be resigning from the bench to return to private practice. The 55-year-old judge will be calling it quits on May 31, and said it was “one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make in my life.”

The former Supreme Court shortlister sent a [brief resignation letter](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/dwpkdagqbvm/watford_letter.pdf) to his colleagues and to President Joe Biden late last week via email as an attachment. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/9th-circuits-watford-onetime-supreme-court-contender-resign-2023-01-09/) has some details on what he wrote in the body of that email:

Watford said he was “not sure yet what I will be doing next, but I anticipate returning to private practice.” He had been a partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles prior to his appointment to the 9th Circuit, the largest of the federal appeals courts.

Will Watford be headed back to his old stomping ground at Munger Tolles? Or will he be moving on to greener in-house pastures? Only time will tell, and we’ll have additional coverage when we find out where he’s headed.

Criminal defense attorney Alex Spiro has not suffered for a lack of high-profile clients. He secured an acquittal for Thabo Sefolosha, the NBA player wrongfully arrested and roughed up by the NYPD. He represented rapper Bobby Shmurda on drug and gun charges. He also served on Aaron Hernandez’s defense team and defended Dinesh D’Souza… so not all his clients were as upstanding as Hernandez.

The point is, the Harvard Law grad who found his home in criminal defense work after stints at the CIA and Manhattan DA’s office has built his reputation on representing the white-collar price point in blue-collar situations. In one sense, this places Spiro’s practice at a fascinating intersection. At a time when there’s a lot of focus on the advantages the [rich and well-connected receive in the criminal justice system](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/ivanka-and-don-jr-avoided-indictment-the-old-fashioned-way-by-being-rich/), Spiro’s career often places him at the frontier where wealth smashes headlong into race. Where every benefit of the doubt money can buy with some prosecutors is flipped and becomes a detriment for minorities — like Sefolosha or Shmurda — seen as high-profile trophies for enterprising prosecutors. It’s a unique niche where Spiro stands tall. Last year, a profile of [Spiro in The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/2016/6/9/16040732/alex-spiro-bobby-shmurda-thabo-sefolosha-1-oak-f28073829b51) kicked off with this quote:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“I don’t need this,” Alex Spiro says. “I could try bond trader cases where the bank pays you a million dollars, no one’s gonna argue with you, there’s no drama, no screaming, you try the case, you win, you move on. Or you lose and that’s unfortunate. You get a plea deal – they either take it or [they] don’t.”

Spiro isn’t walking away from his unique practice, but he may add a bond trader or two more to his platter now that he’s leaving [Ben Brafman’s firm](https://abovethelaw.com/benjamin-brafman/) to join Biglaw litigation heavy [Quinn Emanuel](http://www.quinnemanuel.com). From this morning’s press release:

Managing Partner, John B. Quinn said:  “Experienced white collar criminal trial lawyers are rare commodities in New York.  We think Alex will thrive in firm of trial lawyers like ours.”

William A. Burck, Co-Chair of the firm’s Investigations, Government Enforcement, and White Collar Criminal Defense Practice added:  “Alex is a young superstar in the New York defense bar.  His moxie, toughness and strategic brilliance make him a perfect fit for our firm.”

Alex Spiro commented:  “My experience at the Brafman firm was invaluable and Ben was a great colleague and mentor to me. I just wanted practice law on a more diverse and global stage.  There is literally no firm in the world that could provide me with a better platform than Quinn Emanuel.”

At first blush, a move like this might look like Spiro’s radically reversing course from his Ringer quote — perhaps shifting his practice toward exclusively representing those hypothetical bond traders — but if you thought a change in scenery would change Spiro’s focus on defending high-profile clients facing hard time, you’d be wrong. To talk to Spiro, his excitement about his work is infectious, and he’s not moving to the Biglaw world to do less of the work he’s passionate about. Rather, Quinn’s resources and national reach are giving Spiro more support that he can leverage to expand his practice — taking on all manner of criminal cases from the bond traders to rappers railroaded by the justice system to, I don’t know, serial murdering soccer players (it’s only a matter of time before they find “The Corner Kick Killer.”). If there’s any Biglaw firm that could offer Spiro that opportunity, it’s Quinn Emanuel. Its litigation-centric model provides Spiro all the Biglaw advantages without the downside of having to battle transactional attorneys for resources. Seems like a win-win.

As days go by, more and more Biglaw firms are getting in on the special bonus action, and now a UK-based firm has decided to make money magically appear in its associates’ bank accounts. That’s right, a member of the Magic Circle is now handing out special bonus bucks to its associates, but which firm could it be?

Abracadabra! It’s Freshfields! Yesterday, the firm matched the generous Davis Polk scale, and issuing payments in April and October. Check out what it looks like at the firm, below (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/freshfields-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

Counsel are included in these bonuses, but exact amounts will be communicated individually. As another plus, it doesn’t seem like there are any billable-hour thresholds attached to these bonuses. Congratulations!

P.S. Now that one Magic Circle firm has entered the special bonus fray, will others — like Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, and Linklaters — opt to join in all the fun?

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/freshfields-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Freshfields.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Designs New Office Around The Reality Of Telecommuting
## With its new office, the firm tries to strike a balance between face-to-face office work and the realities of modern efficiencies.

Arent Fox’s reception area — a striking work showing the hint of a skyline. Art by Shuli Sade.

At the end of the day, the goal in designing a new Biglaw office in Midtown Manhattan is creating a space that lawyers want to work in. That’s the message of Andrew Silfen, Arent Fox’s New York managing partner describing the firm’s new 76,000 square foot office in at 1301 Avenue of the Americas, between 52nd and 53rd, which some long-time readers might remember as the former home of Dewey & LeBoeuf. In a world where partners — and even associates — increasingly take advantage of technology allowing them to work remotely, a law firm office has to become an affirmative draw for attorneys. A reason to come in and engage in the face-to-face interaction that facilitates sound mentoring.

And, not for nothing, but at the rates New York real estate goes for — upwards of $95 per square foot in that area — a firm can’t afford to be keeping cavernous offices empty for attorneys who prefer to avoid the lost billable time that comes with the daily commute.

And, as one might expect, there’s a small cafe with free snacks for attorneys looking to refuel or have a nice meeting over coffee.

What Arent Fox has done is build a sleek, modern office built on collaboration, cutting-edge tech, and plenty of natural light. Similar to [White & Case’s office design](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/white-case-has-built-the-new-modern-law-firm-office-and-its-awesome/), Arent Fox relies on glass offices to keep the interior well-lit. As Silfen jokes, the firm should invest in Windex stock. Traditionalists may balk at the idea of working in plain view of everyone, but the effect upon interior spaces is striking. In a classic office, walking to an administrative station feels like entering a fluorescent-lit horror chamber. With these glass offices, on the other hand, the stations and the staff who sit there have plenty of light and great views of their own. It’s hard to overstate how much this improves the overall office environment.

Confidentiality is maintained by keeping office spaces sequestered from the outward facing conference space. Clients and adversaries can be kept out of the day-to-day working areas to avoid prying eyes.

The doors to all these offices are set up to close whisper quietly, in part to foster a comfortable environment and no doubt in part to avoid damaging all this glass through blunt trauma. It’s a cool effect to see in practice, but some part of me felt sorrow that a litigator won’t be able to slam a door after hearing the latest absurd demand from opposing counsel. There’s a value to catharsis.

For attorneys in need of privacy amidst all the glass, Arent Fox has them covered with a number of internal quiet working spaces — and, naturally, maternity rooms — that lawyers and staff can set up in when they need to get away from it all.


Arent Fox’s boardroom-style conference room

The design element that really resonated with me was the level of variety Arent Fox provided it comes to collaborative and conference spaces. A lot of firms have their cookie-cutter rooms, but Arent Fox went out of its way to give attorneys a number of options in picking the room that suits them up to and including the massive, intimidating boardroom conference space, with separate entrances and exits for Arent Fox attorneys — leading back to their offices — and visitors. Different sizes, different layouts, different furniture. Encouraging collaboration has to recognize that not everyone is looking for the same collaborative experience. Offering choices between a small corner working space and a midsized conference room and a mid-floor war room helps draw attorneys out of their offices. And with these rooms decked out with the latest in teleconferencing equipment, attorneys can have that face-to-face interaction even when someone is on the road or working from home for the day.

And, yes, the corners are working spaces, with the partners ceding the vaunted corners to the greater good. They also took smaller offices to let the associates get a little more breathing room in their offices.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Par for the course for a new Biglaw office, Arent Fox boasts the latest high-tech bells and whistles, with a [Joan computerized conference room scheduling system](https://getjoan.com), dongles that plug into a computer to allow it to [toss things immediately up on the conference room screen from Barco](https://www.barco.com/en/clickshare), and giant [Microsoft Surface Hubs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-hub-2) in collaboration rooms. There’s a massive video screen at the landing between floors — the Landing Pad as they call — with a comfy couch, and a series of internal conference rooms that can open up into an all-hands meeting space.

Having the latest and greatest isn’t limited to the technological either. Each office is equipped with the ever popular adjustable sitting/standing desk. Silfen notes that the millennial attorneys are the ones most often found standing. For all the flack they get from the press, they’re generally aggressive go-getters and that spills over into their interest in spending the day standing.

Telecommuting presents a difficult balance for law firms. Traditionalists might just demand face time out of all attorneys, but this isn’t realistic. Working from home isn’t a perk for these attorneys, it’s an advantage they’re taking to cut a couple hours of dead commuting time out of their busy day. Yet young attorneys need mentoring and mid-level attorneys need guidance on how to become effective managers. Building an office space that makes people want to make the trek into work, building technology that facilitates face-to-face conversation from afar, and building it all somewhere easy to get — and let’s be fair, even though the firm only moved a couple of blocks, it moved a world away in terms of getting outside the tourist trap part of New York — is exactly how a firm strikes that balance.

# A Reminder During The Second Week Of July 2020

As I considered what to write this week, I considered not writing anything at all. Though I have a lot of things I would like to say and ideas to discuss, lately, I find myself struggling to do more than what is absolutely required on any given day. However, it strikes me that to publicly acknowledge this may be beneficial, so I write to you.

Without question 2020 has been the most stressful year of my life. I often wonder if this is due to the awareness that comes with growing older, or if there is truly something about 2020 that is vastly different. As the adage goes, “There is nothing new under the sun.” Still, I think there is something about life in 2020 America that feels weightier than years past. The combination of coronavirus threats, economic uncertainty, racial upheaval, and the mental and emotional impact of social distancing and physical isolation is not like the average hand of ups and downs we are dealt each year.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Moreover, as 2020 unfolds, it seems that each new incident we learn about is generally more upsetting and disturbing than the last. And the rapid rate at which the updates are unveiled is enough to push many people to the edge. Just this week alone we have seen: (1) America’s continual abdication of its role as an international leader with the announced departure from the World Health Organization; (2) a 50% increase in the number of U.S. coronavirus cases (to 3 million from 2 million) in one month, as many national and state leaders continue to downplay the severity of this crisis; and (3) rap artist Kanye West’s presidential campaign announcement. And, as I write this, it is only Wednesday.

Yet, amid all of this chaos and societal unrest, I have noticed on the news a prevailing attitude of “business as usual” where, despite acknowledgement from some leaders that the world is absolutely not operating in a normal, functional manner, there remain others who continue to ignore the impact that the outside world is having on their employees. In fact, there are even some political or corporate leaders who appear to be engaging in hyper-productivity, perhaps as a means to distract themselves or to quell the fears of economic instability.

If you rewind a few months to the initial onset of the pandemic, you may remember a large outpouring of compassion from businesses to consumers, companies to employees, even individuals to one another. “We’re in this together” was the message that resounded throughout the nation. But this was four months ago when there were hopes of a swift return to normalcy by summer. Fast forward to today, and you might agree that the compassion appears to be wearing off as impatience and general frustration bubble up to the surface.

For many in the workplace, the novelty of working from home is wearing off, parents (particularly working mothers) are reaching their tipping points, and we are seeing some business leaders begin to revert back to imposing pre-pandemic expectations of productivity and responsiveness on their colleagues. Of course, we all understand that work must continue to be done, and done well. As I have previously observed, the significance of retaining a job during an economic recession is not lost on anyone. But let us take a moment to sit with empathy and acknowledge that everyone is doing the best they can under very difficult circumstances.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I find it concerning that as 2020 continues to spiral, there appears to be a greater push to encourage the adoption of this “business as usual” mindset. I think it is fair to say that we are collectively exhausted by 2020 and ready to move to the next phase. But, our collective desire for something to be different is not always a sufficient precursor for instantaneous change. In life, we are not always able to have the control we desire. We cannot simply will away the ills of 2020 by ignoring reality. To operate under self-imposed fantasies is dangerous.

Having crossed the halfway mark of this year, I would like to encourage business leaders to take a temperature check of your teams. How you manage during this continuously difficult time will impact morale in both the short and long term. We can no longer afford to suffer under leadership that is lacking in courage and untethered from reality. Indeed, we all see the fruit America is reaping at the hands of a select group of individuals whose cowardice has previously prevented them from standing for what is right and true and good and just. The country is in a constant state of unrest and panic, and American morale is the[ lowest it has been](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/happiness-among-americans-dips-five-decade-low) in half a century. To be clear, I wholeheartedly believe that the current state of the country is a prelude to better times. America has long operated with an impressive amount of cognitive dissonance and now is undergoing a painful and therapeutic reckoning of what it has really been. But America is also wrestling to determine what it wants to be. As the citizenry reflects and decides the country’s fate, I am hopeful America will emerge from this season of trials with a renewed sense of identity and purpose, and an unwavering commitment to erase doublespeak and align actions with professed values.

But will the same be said for Biglaw, or will we exit out of this period only to return to office buildings, carrying on with “business as usual”? As many firms have embraced new operational methods, we have seen the implementation of a number of virtual events to foster connections: regular check-ins between partners and associates, firmwide talent shows, and team workout classes, just to name a few. These events are demonstrative of a tangible effort from Biglaw leaders to connect with their teams. I am encouraged, but this earnest effort at connection must continue — and not subside simply because the pandemic is lasting too long, and we want things to return to normal. We have a moment to meaningfully reconsider the status quo of the Biglaw attorney experience — for partners and associates alike. I think that the crux of meaningful change has started with firms’ underscoring everyone’s humanity — and the acknowledgment of this fundamental truth should continue. Even for the most motivated among us, at the end of the day, we are only human — a truth far too often trivialized. Continuing to acknowledge the difficult realities of this ongoing season will be a step toward improving the lives of all within the industry. Do not lose this opportunity. Continue to engage colleagues with benevolence, grace, and humility — in 2020 and beyond.

# Your Clients Now Want To Chat On Slack

The prospect of advances like AI-powered robot lawyers may grab the headlines, but today’s legal pros would also be well-served by refining their use of the tech of the early 2010s.

This is particularly so when it comes to pandemic-era communications, according to several “ask the expert” speakers at the recent Legal Geek technology conference, a live online event focused on innovation in the industry that also featured new product pitches and other offerings over the course of two days.

John Hand, a London-based legal counsel at the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team, for example, said he would “definitely” be interested in collaborating with law firms over chat-based tools like Slack during the course of a full project — particularly when a lack of ongoing communication can sometimes lead to law firm work products that don’t align with client needs.

At his organization, Hand said, chat-based tools were virtually absent back in February, but now they’re commonly used.

“It just shows the change in working styles that’s happened over the past six months or so,” he said, “and it’s brilliant that that means that others who were otherwise reluctant are now very much on board with that as a concept.” 

Hand later added that he also “would very much welcome” client portals that allow access to law firm information without needing to make calls or send emails to outside counsel to ask for an update.

Similar observations about the growing need for refined, consistent communications were common on the main stage of the virtual event. Here, we present a few takeaways from the featured speakers.

Building the Ferrari

At a macro level, multiple speakers advised those implementing new legal technology to consider starting small.

Unilever’s general counsel, Wei Ling Lim, and head of legal operations, Helen Loots, described their process for embarking on tech projects as winning hearts and minds by demonstrating utility across departments, while applying an agile approach to project rollouts that enables responsiveness to any changes that may arise. 

“The analogy I recently heard from one of our colleagues is that you can’t really jump into building a Ferrari,” Loots said. “You start small with the agile approach. From a bike, move into more sophistication, and keep the end goal in mind of where you want to get to and keep that vision as well.” 

A similar phenomenon applies to the world of legal tech startups, according to Srin Madipalli, a former Herbert Smith Freehills solicitor who founded a technology company that was ultimately acquired by Airbnb.

While many legal tech startups are focused on trying to sell their products to the world’s largest law firms, he said, the goal of building scale may be better achieved by first targeting smaller firms, which can have faster decision-making cycles and lower barriers to implementation. 

“If you’re trying to get your software into a big firm, I imagine that it’s a long, old slog,” he said.

Has your organization hired a “head of remote”? Are you starting your Zoom meetings with a “warmup” or “icebreaker”? Are workers still expected to keep set hours? 

Speakers at the conference described a variety of approaches to managing a remote workforce — a task that often dovetails with technology needs. 

Philip Merrills-Dearn, Twitter’s head of legal for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, noted that his company was one of the first to go to a fully remote workforce in 2020. From the outset, it polled its workers to determine the kinds of challenges individuals were facing and how the company could help.

The organization aimed to take an “empathetic” approach to this new set-up, Merrills-Dearn said, implementing measures to support its workforce that include compulsory days off in which everyone took the same day so emails would not pile up in their absence.

While the nature of legal work leaves law firms similarly well-positioned in the ability to conduct business remotely, a virtual workforce can present different challenges in an industry that has long prized in-person meetings and collaboration.

Susan Bright, the UK managing partner for Hogan Lovells, praised the collaboration possibilities provided by the physical space at the firm — for instance, its former library, which has been converted into a lounge where clients and lawyers could work together.

To adjust to the remote environment, many of Bright’s colleagues have “reinvented the hour,” she said, shortening it to 50 minutes to prevent Zoom fatigue. Additionally, like many of her peers at other firms, Bright is seeking to find the future’s “new equilibrium,” in which lawyers can collaborate and work together in person while also having more flexibility to work in different ways. 

“I’ve realized how much information I imparted and I received by walking the corridors and sticking my head around somebody’s door, and the coffee machine chat,” she said. “And I haven’t found the app for that.”

While there may not be an app just yet, some new technologies — and even new career paths — are specifically aimed at addressing this need, which was expressed by several speakers.  

Laila von Alvensleben is the head of culture and collaboration at Mural, an online workspace that allows for visual collaboration.

Like Bright, she noted that remote work presents major challenges to maintaining workplace culture, as individuals no longer bump into their colleagues in the hallway.

“I think we need to be more intentional about it as companies,” she said, adding that there are ways to build culture remotely.

These can include running workshops internally and for external clients, starting meetings with check-in questions dubbed “warmups” or “energizers,” holding virtual retreats, or even hiring a professional who focuses on strengthening remote teams.  

But while companies ought to be deliberate about maintaining connections among employees, micromanaging workflow isn’t the path to productivity. 

“What I’ve seen in distributed teams is that usually the best, most efficient teams focus on outcome rather than time, so it’s not so much about how much time you spent, but really on whether you’re getting the job done,” von Alvensleben said. 

“All of that, at the end of the day boils down to having trust within your company culture.”

Learning to Code

Amid today’s historic uncertainty, ensuring you are operating at the cutting edge of tech innovation is likely a wise career move, even for experienced lawyers. 

Susan Hackett, the former general counsel of the Association of Corporate Counsel and current CEO of the consulting practice Legal Executive Leadership, noted that when lawyers graduate from law school, they have a broad focus, but over time this gets funneled into a more and more narrow expertise. Now, she said, the challenge for senior lawyers is to move it the other way: becoming more agile and expansive in broadening a skillset. 

“No one is suggesting that by learning ‘new law’ we’re asking lawyers to suddenly become carpenters, right?” she said. “We’re asking you to stay in your professional lane, but become more agile.”

And there are the non-legal careers in which a J.D. may provide an advantage as well. 

In discussing the role of a legal background in entrepreneurship, Madipalli, the tech startup founder and former solicitor, may have added a new one to this list.

“A page of code is often similar in mindset and sort of underpinnings to a page of a contract,” he said, “in that it’s a set of instructions that are broken down to a really granular level.” 

“I actually think lawyers can make really good coders.”

# Biglaw Firm Raises Salaries AGAIN, And Enhances Its Bonuses To Boot

This past spring, before Davis Polk entered the scene with its glorious $205K starting salary scale, numerous firms raised associate salaries in the wake of [DLA Piper’s move to a national payscale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/dla-piper-2021-salary-raise/) (the former prevailing $190K salary scale) for all of its offices. Slowly but surely, other firms began to follow in DLA’s footsteps: first came [Alston & Bird](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/alston-bird-special-bonus-2021/), then came [King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/ks-special-bonuses/), and third in line was [Taft Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-shares-the-wealth-with-associates-by-raising-salaries/) (the firm formerly known as Taft Stettinius & Hollister prior to its merger with Briggs and Morgan).

With salaries now even higher than they were in April when the firm made its move, Taft has decided to increase salaries yet again. Since the firm’s first set of raises weren’t effective until July 1, management is going to allow those to marinate for a bit before enacting its new salary structure, which will be effective October 1.

- Chicago: From $190,000 to $195,000
- Cincinnati, Columbus, and Dayton: From $135,000 to $140,000
- Cleveland and Indianapolis: From $145,000 to $150,000
- Minneapolis: From $150,000 to $180,000

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Note that while all of these starting salaries aren’t matching the Davis Polk scale, that bump for Minneapolis associates really packs a punch.

According to a [press release](https://www.taftlaw.com/news-events/news/taft-increases-associate-compensation-and-enhances-its-bonus-program-for-associates?platform=hootsuite), in addition to increase for first-year attorneys, the firm will offer “corresponding increases in salaries for all associates throughout the firm, together with an enhanced firm-wide, incentive-based bonus program for all associates to reward both objective and intangible contributions to Taft.”

They may not be match the major market salaries, but more money is more money, so congratulations to all associates at the firm.

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Magic Circle Firms Continue To Spread The Wealth With Raises

Magic Circle firms with U.S. offices raised associate salaries more than one month ago, leaving associates across the pond wondering when they’d see more money magically appear in their bank accounts. That day has finally come for associates working in London — well, some of them.

Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, and Freshfields have all confirmed raises of varying amounts for their trainees and newly qualified lawyers (NQs). Thanks to [Legal Week](https://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2018/08/16/allen-overy-raises-london-salaries-lifting-nq-rate-to-83k/), we’ve got that information:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The firm’s NQ rate has risen by 2.5% to £83,000, up from £81,000, with first and second year trainee rates climbing by just over 2%.

First year trainee pay rises from £44,000 to £45,000, with second year pay increasing from £49,000 to £50,000. The firm will not confirm salaries for more senior lawyers or bonus rates.

Clifford Chance

Clifford Chance last week announced that maximum pay for its NQs, including salary and the highest performance-related bonus available, has risen to £91,000 up by more than 4% from £87,300 last year.

The firm has also raised trainee pay for both years by 4%, with first-year salaries up from £44,800 to £46,600 and second-year pay hiked from £50,500 to reach £52,500.
