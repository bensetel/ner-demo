# 3 Things I Miss About Law Firm Life
## In-house is great, but being at a law firm was not without its perks.

If you have been following me, you know that I love being in-house. I love it so much that I can’t imagine leaving to go back to a law firm. At the same time, I have to admit that I miss a few things about firm life.

An Administrative Assistant

When I left private practice, I shared an administrative assistant with three other attorneys. While she had to necessarily prioritize partners’ work, she helped me with many things: document formatting, looking things up, submitting expenses, responding to event invitations, scheduling, mailing (including personal), tracking down people and things. One assistant assisted me with my legal name change after marriage, helping me apply for admission at various courts, and even calling my husband if I was stuck in a meeting.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And while I do have access to one legal administrative assistant, I share her with 10 other attorneys in our group. Knowing how big we are and how much my manager may need her, I don’t ask her to do much. And I would never dare ask her to do anything that wasn’t directly related to work. Which is why I miss having an administrative assistant.

Traveling Luxe

I’d like to think that I’m not boujee — but this section may contradict that perception. This may depend upon the company you work for, but as in-house counsel, I am very mindful of my expenses. Where I used to travel business class at a firm, I now travel coach and as cheaply (but direct) as possible. Where I used to stay at the Four Seasons, I now do not, opting for places that are within company policy. Where I normally wouldn’t think twice about ordering a drink with my meal or ordering what I want to eat, as in-house counsel, I am careful about staying below a certain number even though we do not have a per diem. Travel is often discouraged unless necessary to do business. I definitely don’t mind not having to travel, but when I do, I miss some of the perks I used to have at a law firm.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As someone who loves to learn and actively seeks professional and personal development, I loved that the law firm I was at developed trainings for the associates. Besides deposition skills and project management, I remember receiving training on public speaking, business development, and building credibility. There were also opportunities to attend conferences and receive continuing legal education. In contrast, as in-house counsel, my experience has been that it is much more limited.

So many firms have announced [Davis Polk special bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) matches that we’re calling it: it may be spring, but it’s officially Biglaw bonus season.

The latest firm to join in on the bonus fun can be found near the tippy top of the Am Law rankings. It’s Morgan Lewis, an elite firm that brought in $2,265,000,000 gross revenue in 2019. The firm has obviously matched the incredibly generous Davis Polk scale. Here’s what the firm’s special bonus scale looks like (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/morgan-lewis-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

As noted above, the firm’s bonuses will be paid out in June and October. The good news doesn’t stop here: Morgan Lewis has committed to paying year-end bonuses that are “at or above market.” Congratulations, everyone!

P.S. Where you at, Cravath? Come on, now.

The Supreme Court returned to the shadowy depths to issue a 5-4 ruling allowing a racial gerrymander to continue through the next election. The Chief Justice dissented, lamenting the idea that a shadow docket ruling could effectively rubberstamp a “freebie” violation of the Voting Rights Act. You know… we [used to have a mechanism to prevent this sort of thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/john-roberts-suggests-some-kind-of-voting-rights-preclearance-like-the-one-he-personally-destroyed/), JOHN. We also discuss the latest [Georgetown Law racial slur incident](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/georgetown-law-really-has-a-knack-for-casual-racism/), which mercifully didn’t end in bad “academic freedom” takes. And we talk about Kirkland’s return to office announcement, which landed with a thud when the firm [didn’t package it with some market matching raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/kirkland-sends-announcement-to-salary-hungry-associates-about-office-return-date/).

# Law Firms Really Have The Urge To Merge In 2024
## Law firm merger interest is reportedly at an 'all-time high.'

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We do anticipate that 2024 [law firm] merger activity will be consistent with 2023. The interest in growth via merger continues to remain very, very high. I would even say it’s at an all-time high, in the 20-plus years I’ve been working with law firms.

— Kristin Stark, a law firm consultant and principal at Fairfax Associates, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/04/with-law-firm-merger-interest-at-all-time-high-consolidation-may-heat-up-in-2024/) on the “appetite” for law firm mergers in 2024. “Mergers are a very common strategic objective,” she continued, “and as a result, while it’s hard to predict, given the interest level, it’s also hard to see an outcome where it’s at a lower level [than 2023].” Fairfax Associates counted 48 total law firm mergers in 2023, including five “large-firm” mergers (i.e., combinations between firms with 100+ lawyers each).

There is an associate war all over, but nowhere like here. It’s an absolute crisis. Firms that have lost associates are desperate. It’s affecting their year to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.

— Suzanne Kane, a partner at recruiting firm Macrae, commenting on [Biglaw firms’ frenzied search for associates](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/10/28/calif-firms-risk-losing-out-on-revenue-and-client-relationships-amid-the-talent-shortage/) in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many firms have had to turn down new work because due to staffing issues, resulting in financial losses.

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm 'Matches' On Raises... Kind Of... But Not Yet
## There's also a 'bonus' in store for associates.

It wasn’t long ago that we wondered why more Biglaw firms [hadn’t announced raises yet](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/why-havent-more-biglaw-firms-announced-raises/). Milbank introduced its new salary scale more than two weeks ago, and while [quite a few firms have matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/), the bulk of Biglaw management committees seem to be sitting on their hands, leaving associates squirming. As the majority of firms continue to monitor the market to see where compensation is headed, this top 10 Biglaw firm has committed to a match — but not yet, and the salary scale the firm is matching isn’t yet clear.

On Friday afternoon, Morgan Lewis — a firm that brought in $2,446,000,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 7 in the most recent Am Law 100 — announced a match. Kind of. Sort of.

In a firmwide voicemail, associates were notified that while Morgan Lewis remains committed to providing top compensation, the firm’s “preference and practice is always to make changes in a calm, deliberative, and generous manner, rather than in a reflexive and reactionary way.” As such, the firm will award associates with salaries in line with whatever the prevailing market rate is on March 31, 2022, in their first April paycheck. Any backpay that is owed to associates will be made up with a “bonus” at that time.

Yes, you read that correctly. April. Morgan Lewis is waiting until April to officially make a match because firm leadership isn’t sure how these raises will shake out and they’re waiting for the market to settle.

Reactions from associates have been mixed. While some are happy that a raise is coming down the line in the future, others are downright disappointed that they have to wait until April, and even more are confused about why their delayed salary true-ups are being referred to as a “bonus.”

Will this move by Morgan Lewis encourage either Davis Polk or Cravath to make a move on salaries? Perhaps, but probably not. In the meantime, associates at MLB are left to wonder how exactly they’ll be compensated come April. It stinks that you have to wait, but pre-congratulations, everyone.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

If you thought the weekend would somehow stem the rising tide of layoffs, furloughs, and salary cuts that have become Biglaw’s new normal, then you were wrong. May the Fourth be with you if you’ve yet to hear what your law firm’s plans are, whether good or bad.

Today, we have news from Pillsbury, a firm that came in 62nd place in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, with $677,320,000 in gross revenue in 2019. Pillsbury’s chairman, David Dekker, sent a memo to all employees, describing the “shared sacrifice” that everyone would need to take part in to protect the firm from layoffs. “We know that any sacrifice can be painful,” he wrote, “and hope to scale them in a manner such that they are tolerable for all.” These are the firm’s austerity measures:

- Starting in April, partner monthly draws were reduced by a minimum of 25 percent, on a progressive scale so that the higher a partner sits in the draw, the larger his or her percentage reduction;
- Starting with May 15 payments, the firm will be temporarily reducing the compensation of associates and counsel in the United States by 20 percent; and
- Starting with May 15 payments, all staff compensation will be reduced by up to 15 percent for those who make more than $100,000, except for chief officers who volunteered to take higher reductions, commensurate with those of partners. Employees making less than $75,000 will not be impacted.
“We sincerely hope that this is a short-term measure, although at this point we cannot precisely forecast its duration,” Dekker cautioned. He says he’s hopeful that the firm will be able to offer an “expanded discretionary bonus program” in the future to make up for “at least some of the reductions experienced.”

We reached out to the firm for comment, and a spokesperson had this to say:

Pillsbury has had a strong start to 2020 but the pandemic is both unprecedented and unpredictable, and economic conditions around the world continue to deteriorate. We have therefore implemented a “shared sacrifice“ approach involving temporary reductions of partner draws and associate, counsel, and staff compensation. Partners are leading the way, with the largest reductions.

# If Biglaw Firms Want Loyalty, They Need To Care About Work/Life Balance
## If you want to keep the best and brightest at your Biglaw firm, you have to care about them as people.

The Biglaw lateral market favors the bold, and lawyers willing to change their employers are often rewarded — whether it be with a new title, fewer hours, or superior compensation. The lateral market is a feature, not a bug of the Biglaw system, with over 9,000 lateral moves tracked in the five years between 2014 and 2018.

But like any trend, some folks buck it. Law.com has a [feature](https://www.law.com/2019/04/02/law-firm-lifers-and-the-hot-lateral-market-292-43124/) on attorneys who are “lifers” — ones that have stayed with the same firm through thick and thin. Reading through the interviews is illuminating, but one theme stands out, attorneys are loyal to their firms (in part) because they are able to balance their home life with the demands of Biglaw.

Take Steven Weinstein who is the Managing Partner of K&L Gates’s Miami office. He says he’s “exceptionally” involved in his twin sons’ activities and acts as coach for their sports teams. Or Jennifer Olmedo-Rodriguez, Managing Partner of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney’s Miami office, who left the firm for three years to have her first child. She says she was welcomed back with “open arms” and her career didn’t suffer at all:

“They put me back into my class year, kept me on that track,” she said. “Even the code to get into the office and my computer was the same. … It was like I never left.”

And Joseph Rich, partner at Cozen O’Connor, says:

“I don’t feel like I’m ever missing out on family time,” Rich said. “I have a lot of friends that are attorneys, and they can’t say the same thing.”

The formula to keep the best talent seems clear. Compensation and top flight legal work are necessary, but not sufficient to keep the best and brightest at the firm. You actually need to let the attorneys at your firm have a life outside of the firm if you want them to stay.

# Production In Original Digital Format — The New Normal 
## The landscape of eDiscovery evolves rapidly as new sources of evidence change the definition and boundaries of what constitutes a “document.”

Ed. note: This article first appeared in ILTA’s Peer to Peer magazine. For more, [visit our ILTA on ATL channel here. ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ilta-on-atl/)

When handling electronic documents in litigation matters, one crucial decision to make is how to produce the data. The ILTA Litigation Practice Support Survey asked, “In what format do you most frequently produce?” The results showed that 41% of respondents produced data using TIFF / Text files with metadata load files, 36% produced data in PDF or Native format with or without load files, and 22% produced Native files. 

This article will proffer why Native production with or without load files is the most advantageous way to produce records. Please note that in the spirit of reconciliation with indigenous communities in Canada, Native production will be referred to as production in its Original Digital Format (“ODF”) as guided by the Sedona Canada 2022 principles.

The landscape of eDiscovery evolves rapidly as new sources of evidence change the definition and boundaries of what constitutes a “document.” Litigation support professionals manage a deluge of data from a variety of sources, including collaboration apps, social media, and mobile data, bringing challenges with embedded links, emoticons, and more. Production of this new data, along with standard file types (emails and eDocuments), needs to be managed with efficiency, diligence, and planning. Collaborating with counsel to develop a practical Electronically Stored Information (“ESI”) protocol and proactively discussing documentary disclosure will assist in avoiding rework and potential spoliation of evidence and ensure that evidence is produced in a practical, organized, and cost-effective manner.

ODF production involves exchanging documents in their original format. While TIFF production is necessary for documents that require redactions or the management of confidential information, ODF production offers several advantages that can significantly benefit legal proceedings. Below are five reasons why ODF production should be considered as the preferred approach in litigation matters:

1. Preserving Metadata

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Metadata, including date stamps, author information, and document properties, can be critical in litigation cases. ODF production maintains this vital data, ensuring its authenticity and reliability as evidence. TIFF images are stripped of metadata, which then requires the re-creation of that metadata and its separate production. Other document properties are simply lost in TIFF format. 

 2. Reduced Risk of Spoliation 

Spoliation, the alteration, destruction, concealed and/or lost evidence, is a constant concern in litigation. ODF files are less susceptible to allegations of spoliation, providing a higher level of document integrity. ODF production preserves the original content and appearance of documents, providing the reviewer with an indication of what the file looked like in its original form. This transparency can reduce disputes, as parties can see the unaltered documents, fostering trust in the legal process.

3. Cost Efficiency 

Converting files to different formats can be time-consuming and expensive. ODF production eliminates the need for conversion, resulting in cost savings and a streamlined process. TIFF productions are a costly relic of paper-based records. TIFF and PDF production increase the expense and reduce the practicality of the production.

4. Easier Review and Analysis 

The review and analysis of ODF documents is simpler, faster, and more straightforward for legal professionals, expediting decision-making. The more searchable metadata enables legal professionals to find relevant information and isolate critical documents more efficiently. This is invaluable for early case assessment and document searches during the litigation process.

5. Compatibility and hosting 

ODF production ensures compatibility with various platforms and software, reducing the likelihood of technical issues when accessing or presenting documents in a litigation setting. TIFF productions are often much larger in volume and size, significantly increasing the costs for responding parties to ingest and host. 

In summary, while ODF production offers numerous advantages, it is essential to consider the specific requirements and guidelines of your litigation matter. Even though the document production stage may be months or years, the production format should be discussed and agreed upon during early litigation planning and included in the ESI protocol. Consulting with legal professionals to determine the most suitable approach for your unique situation is crucial. In most instances, ODF production should be the preferred choice, providing greater accuracy, transparency, and efficiency in the legal process.

Gun violence in Chicago this weekend left one dead and more than two dozen wounded. On Monday night, another Chicago area person was shot and killed — and this person was the founder of a Biglaw firm’s Supreme Court practice group.

[Stephen Shapiro](https://www.mayerbrown.com/people/stephen-m-shapiro/), 72, was the founder of Mayer Brown’s Supreme Court and appellate practice, and he was gunned down in his own home on Monday in what police are saying was a domestic-related shooting. A suspect has been arrested. Here are more details from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/08/14/mayer-brown-supreme-court-practice-founder-shot-and-killed-in-chicago/):


Stephen M. Shapiro

The suspect, who is yet to be identified, had fled Shapiro’s home in Northfield, Illinois, and barricaded himself in his apartment in nearby Winnetka. His arrest occurred following a brief standoff with a SWAT team, according to local reports.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
According to Shapiro’s bio, the firm’s Supreme Court and appellate practice had grown to be the largest in the country under his leadership. Before his death, he argued 30 cases before the Supreme Court and brief more than 200 cases.

This is a developing story. When there is additional news, we will update this post.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Stephen Shapiro’s family, friends, and colleagues during this incredibly difficult time.

UPDATE (8/16/18): Charges have been filed against Shapiro’s accused killer, his brother-in-law, John Gately III. Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/charges-filed-in-murder-of-celebrated-supreme-court-litigator/) for more information.

# Elite West Coast Firm Matches $190K Market Salaries -- And Throws In Extra Money For Summer Associates
## Will any other law firms match this one's generosity towards summer associates? We certainly hope so.

Many associates on the West Coast seem to be waiting for Godot when it comes to their firms announcing the adoption of new $190K market salaries, but other firms have quickly gotten in gear and decided to pay associates what they owe them for their intense dedication to their jobs. Some firms really owe their associates — especially firms that were recently smacked around and shamed on social media for trying to force their summer associates to [sign binding arbitration agreements](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/) meant to cover all Title VII claims, including sex and race discrimination.

The firm we’re talking about is Munger Tolles & Olson, a preeminent Am Law 200 firm that we’ve likened to the Wachtell of the West for attracting top talent. In addition to having scrapped its mandatory arbitration clause for all employees earlier this spring, the firm has decided to match the new salary scale. In case you’ve somehow forgotten, this is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:

- Class of 2017: $190,000 / $5,000
- Class of 2016: $200,000 / $7,500
- Class of 2015: $220,000 / $10,000
- Class of 2014: $255,000 / $15,000
- Class of 2013: $280,000 / $20,000
- Class of 2012: $305,000 / $25,000
- Class of 2011: $325,000 / $25,000
- Class of 2010+: $340,000 / $25,000

In even brighter news — and perhaps as a more formal mea culpa to its summer associates — Munger is making its match for them retroactive to the beginning of the summer. That’s a pretty significant apology as far as dollars are concerned.

Congratulations to everyone at Munger Tolles on their raises and bonuses — especially the law students, who will now be the highest paid of all summer associates (along with summers at Jones Day) thanks to both firms’ decision to make their raises retroactive. Will any other law firms match Munger Tolles & Olson’s generosity towards summer associates? We certainly hope so!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important salary updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

The third time is not the charm for Jones Day. After advising Donald Trump in both of his prior White House bids, packing the administration [with its lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/jones-day-in-the-white-house-the-biglaw-firm-fills-top-jobs-in-the-trump-administration/), touting its [ties to the administration](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/jones-day-advertising-its-trump-admin-ties-because-they-have-no-shame/) to drum up business, watching its temporarily seconded attorneys mount a campaign to [pack the federal judiciary](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/a-look-inside-the-conservative-judge-making-machine/) — including with [the firm’s own associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/shocking-no-one-aba-thinks-biglaw-associate-not-ready-for-federal-bench/) — running up bills in [efforts to disenfranchise voters](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/), and then taking advantage of [the revolving door of returning administration officials](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/jones-day-hires-homeland-security-lawyer-doesnt-mention-kidnapped-immigrant-children-in-press-release/), Jones Day has decided not to advise Trump’s 2024 campaign according to [an exclusive report from Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/jones-day-wont-advise-trump-in-2024-white-house-campaign).

Maybe [Alina Habba departed the E. Jean Carroll case](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/trumps-new-lawyer-in-e-jean-carroll-case-is-an-odd-choice/) to bone up on election law.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Neither the firm nor Trump’s camp commented on the matter, but Bloomberg’s sources report that the firm is moving a different direction:

The law firm is not working on Trump’s 2024 campaign and does not plan to provide legal services related to the run, according to a source familiar with the situation. Jones Day lawyers are winding down “legacy matters” for committees affiliated with Trump’s previous campaigns, the person said.

The article flags the leadership transition with Greg Shumaker recently taking the reins from Stephen Brogan, whose lengthy run atop the firm saw its aggressive — [if unnoticed by the general public](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/) — branding as the marquee brand of the conservative legal movement. While the transition could signal [a business decision](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/biglaw-isnt-a-cancel-culture-its-a-business-that-cares-more-about-money-than-your-feelings/) to withdraw from right-wing causes in light of [mounting negative publicity](https://amzn.to/3WTfqXi) (affiliate link), it’s probably wise to take that theory with a full-sized salt lick.

There are [two Jones Days out there](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/jones-day-is-divided-between-maga-jones-day-and-lawyers-who-enable-maga-jones-day/): “MAGA Jones Day” and “Lawyers Who Enable MAGA Jones Day.” Plenty of law firms indulge unpopular legal work up until it begins to impact the bottom line, but Jones Day has spent so much time and effort orienting its business model around attorneys and clients who don’t just accept the Trump worldview but actively endorse it that it’s hard to imagine the firm stepping back.

More likely, the firm has decided it will pick another champion. Donald Trump did his part for the firm, but in the end he couldn’t even pull off a decent coup! Sorry, but Jones Day has no room for losers. Maybe Ron DeSantis — [whose chief of staff is a Jones Day alum](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1122536384) — can take things to the next level.

Jones Day’s dutiful work for Trump over two elections got results. When rioters stormed the Capitol, all the work Jones Day put in reached its zenith. They had spent years enabling the mob and could then collect their winnings and politely walk away. Those weren’t our people, the firm could say. And they weren’t… just the people the firm had worked hard to grant [outsized influence over American politics](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/gop-lawyer-slams-trump-for-undermining-election-confidence-despite-long-career-of-undermining-election-confidence/). Trump’s done his part. Someone else can take that energy into 2024.

Greatness achieved!

# BREAKING: Cravath Announces Annual Bonuses
## WOW -- bonuses are here!

Bonus season has come early this year!

Good news for all of the hard-working associates toiling away in the Biglaw mines: today, Cravath has officially kicked of the start of bonus season by announcing their 2018 bonus structure. Usually bonus season doesn’t start until after Thanksgiving, and with the holiday falling fairly early on this year’s calendar, it is pretty shocking Cravath decided to move on bonuses so early. In fact, only 11 percent of readers who took the [Above the Law poll](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/associate-bonus-watch-2018-bonus-season-is-here/) speculating on when bonus season would begin said pre-Thanksgiving (and frankly, I would have thought those folks were basing their votes on wishes, not reality, before today).

So, let’s get into the nitty gritty — what do the bonuses look like this year?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


These bonuses are in line with last year’s largess. But considering this year [associate salaries were also raised](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), well, that translates into a nice pay day for associates. Bonuses at the firm will be paid on December 14th, meaning associates will be able to splurge on all the holiday gifts they could want. Oh, and there is no billable hours requirement to receive these bonuses, which makes for a very merry holiday indeed.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Zain Atassi](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/196) is a Director with Lateral Link, where she recruits and places high-level attorneys with leading AmLaw firms, high-end boutiques, and Fortune 500 companies. Zain focuses on the individual needs of her clients and candidates, delivering the utmost personalized attention. Before joining Lateral Link, Zain gained significant experience as a legal recruiter with a national legal search firm. Prior to recruiting, she spent six years as a litigation attorney with Chicago-based law firms. Zain holds a J.D. from Washington University School of Law and a B.A. with Honors from Washington University in St. Louis.

‘Tis the season — for Biglaw bonuses, that is. But do associates have reason to rejoice? As we expected, firms are standing pat this year, pursuing an agenda of gradual change while they wait to see where the new market equilibrium falls. Firms are looking to the last round of salary raises as a guide for how to — or rather, how not to — implement a new pay scale.

This summer, Cravath’s new salary scale triggered a war of attrition for talent. With an increasing brain drain out of law, firms are fighting for an increasingly scarce supply of quality associates. However, with Cravath’s announcement (and the subsequent matching) of an unchanged bonus scale from last year, it seems unlikely that another firm will significantly up the ante on bonuses.

The last time we saw a Biglaw salary raise was in 2007. Compared to 2007, the current “MoneyLaw” scale is below the 2007 round of raises when factoring in Cravath-level bonuses in both nominal and real dollars. No associate in 2016 will make more than their 2007 counterparts in nominal dollars. What gives?

Taking lessons from the recession, firms are trying to maintain a margin that can absorb a shock. Because it is much easier to increase compensation and perks than roll back on it, firms are proceeding with caution. They are also still evaluating the financial impact of this summer’s “MoneyLaw” raises on law firm profitability. What’s more, the uncertainty wrought by the election is yet another factor likely nudging firms to play it safe.

So how will firms stop their top talent from leaving then? We will likely see more meritorious bonuses given with a black box dispersion. With few mechanisms for universally rewarding high-performing associates well above their peers, we expect to see more implicit deals and black-box bonuses to obscure any perceived inequity, and entice top-performing associates to stay.

Firms will also likely turn to short-term solutions to test the market before fully committing. For example, Dentons announced in July that they would be giving a performance bonus in lieu of a salary raise and would explore the possibility of raising salaries in January. With 7,000+ attorneys around the world, it is unsurprising that they are proceeding cautiously. We expect to see more of the firms that declined to match the Cravath salary scale issue one-off bonuses or performance incentives to test the impact on their bottom line before committing to a set scale.

The announcement of an unchanged bonus scale was not unexpected, and if I had to wager on next year, I would guess there will be a small increase of around $5,000, graduating upwards through class year, assuming profits hold steady and the new administration has a negligible impact on Biglaw. Should we see the reverse, layoffs are more likely than firms rolling-back salary and bonuses — the latter of which would trigger a massive amount of attrition.

If your firm doesn’t stack up this holiday season, team up with a good recruiter who has his or her finger on the market’s pulse and can help you land a better position. My colleagues and I at Lateral Link are happy to share market intel and discuss the legal job landscape with you.

# 5 Reasons Compensation For Women Partners Lags Behind That Of Male Partners
## Some of the factors keeping women back.

There’s been a lot of ink spilled over the [recent survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/from-the-obvious-files-male-biglaw-partners-make-more-than-female-ones/) which laid out the cold hard numbers that detail just how much less women partners make than their male counterparts — it’s 44 percent, for the record. Now Joan C. Williams and Marina Multhaup [for the National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202770527617/What-the-Partner-Pay-Gap-Tells-Us-About-Bias) have dug into all of the related data to determine concrete things that women partners deal with that keep their compensation, on average, behind the men’s.

Here are the top 5 reasons why women partners aren’t paid as much as the guys:

1. Women are pressured to remain service partners

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
This makes a terrible kind of twisted sense. Equity partners, with the origination credit, use guilt and a desire to benefit clients to keep good lawyers working on matters for their clients. Which… just happens to keep those good lawyers in a lower position at the firm. And wouldn’t you know it? Women face this pressure a lot more than men.

According to Williams and Multhaup:

In a forthcoming survey developed and conducted by the Center for WorkLife Law for the American Bar Association’s Commission on Women and the Minority Corporate Counsel Association, only 41 percent of white male lawyers, but 60 percent of women lawyers, reported this [t remain service partners] pressure.

2. They get bullied

So much of partner compensation comes down to who is getting credit for bringing the clients in the door. Given that reality, of course there are bound to be machinations and disputes behind the scenes that determine who is getting paid for the big clients. And Williams and Multhaup report on a survey which indicates women are getting bullied into backing down in those fights:

A 2010 survey of female lawyers found that almost one-third (27 percent) of white female equity partners reported “feeling that a partner had tried to intimidate, threaten, or bully them into backing down in a dispute over origination credit.”

For female partners of color, that number was even higher (36 percent). The same survey found that more than 80 percent of women partners reported being denied their fair share of origination credit in the past three years.

3. Men get more credit than they deserve

Welp, here’s a disturbing anecdote, and I am sure this survey respondent isn’t alone:

“Some of the young male partners are just handed shared origination because ‘their brains also brought in the client.’ I have not had the same level of shared financial opportunity, despite more years of helping to build the very clients whom I requested to share,” said one respondent to the 2010 survey.

The 2010 survey found that more than half of women equity partners reported being used as diverse “eye candy” on pitches but then not receiving origination credit or work resulting from successful pitches.

5. Women get jobbed for having babies

And of course, having babies only screws the professional prospects of one half of the baby-making equation:

These are only some of the issues that are keeping women behind in compensation.

I’ve seen associates that have built personal brands about their families experience negative performance reviews only attributable to their use of social media. I personally don’t believe there is any room within traditional law firms to build a meaningful personal brand. It’s a very fast way for a young attorney to destroy their career.

— [Eric Pacifici](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-b-pacifici/), the founding partner of SMB Law Group, in comments given to the Legal Intelligencer, on lawyers’ use of social media within the incredibly rigid confines of Biglaw. Pacifici is an alumnus of Gibson Dunn and Kirkland & Ellis, and he began tweeting anonymously while he still worked in Biglaw. “We’re a very risk-averse profession,” he said.

Technology and Life Sciences firm Fenwick & West has joined in the associate compensation fun with a Friday announcement of market raises for all associates. And by all associates, we mean all, with the firm’s China-based associates receiving the same salary bump.

Fenwick, a firm near the bottom of the Am Law 100 in gross revenue, has still managed to beat a bevy of higher grossing firms to the punch in the hunt for top talent.

One of my favorite classes in law school was “Law and Literature,” where the central conceit of the class was that literature (broadly defined as including both prose and cinema) had much to teach us about life as a lawyer. From reading Billy Budd, to watching Paul Newman’s unforgettable performance as a lawyer in The Verdict, we were tasked with analyzing how fictional portrayals of lawyers and the legal process could fine-tune our own approaches to legal practice. It was a fun class, and challenging in its own way. Perhaps informed by my experience in that class, I have always been drawn to studying fictional depictions of lawyers, with an eye to actually learning something along with my dose of escapist entertainment.

The undisputed heavyweight champion of the entertaining yet informative piece of fiction for lawyers is, of course, My Cousin Vinny. The movie is a paean to various aspects of trial practice, from cross-examination, to dealing with expert testimony, to avoiding contempt via proper courtroom attire and demeanor. But there are a host of worthwhile law-oriented pieces of fictional material, and over a recent vacation I found myself drawn into one of them — Amazon’s Goliath. The show, which netted star Billy Bob Thornton a Golden Globe, has been [reviewed in these pages](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/standard-of-review-amazons-goliath-is-half-of-a-very-good-show/?rf=1), and centers on a series of David v. Goliath (hence the title) battles — primarily between a dead former employee and the mega-corporation who was his employer, and between a washed-out Biglaw refugee and his former Biglaw firm. My favorite variation of the David v. Goliath theme, however, was the depiction of a Biglaw associate’s struggle to survive and thrive in the crucible of an important litigation for an indispensable firm client.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The successes and travails of the associate, known as Lucy Kittridge on the show, have been addressed elsewhere. In a October 2016 piece, [Big Law Business ](https://bol.bna.com/big-law-is-filled-with-big-drama-in-goliath/)notes that Lucy is the show’s “most realistic Biglaw character” while lamenting her struggle “working in a system where information is doled out selectively.” I submit, however, that Lucy’s challenges have less to do with the knowledge imbalance between partners and associates, and more to do with the power imbalance inherent in a hierarchical system. A system that works, mind you, for its primary purpose — to make as much money for the partners as possible through the provision of top-notch legal services. One look at the law firm offices in Goliath — especially when contrasted with the plaintiff lawyer’s “offices” in a motel room and storage locker — makes clear the contribution of associate labor to Biglaw profits.

Lucy’s successes and travails have a lot to teach associates, no matter what size firm they are employed by. As Bloomberg notes, understanding that as an associate you are operating in an environment where information is a limited resource dispensed from on high is an important first step. But what about the power imbalance inherent in the partner-associate dynamic? What about Lucy’s character arc can help associates successfully navigate across those perilous waters? I submit the following three lessons from Lucy’s story on Goliath.

First, it is critically important for associates to avoid deification of partners. Yes, they are more knowledgeable about the law, and may have already paid off their student loans. But partners are people, and are often people who have done a good job of masking their inherent flaws in arriving at their current position. Lucy’s interactions with the partners on Goliath, while perhaps exaggerated, are often defined by her ability to read and adapt to the flaws of each partner as she deals with them. Take her tryst with the managing partner of the firm, who doubles as the show’s “big bad” or villain. Yes, he is infinitely more powerful than her, but he also needs the validation of her affection to help calm the insecurity he feels as a result of his disfiguration. Again, this is an extreme example, and not a course of behavior I condone or suggest, but it is illustrative. Lucy’s success is directly tied to her ability to please the partners she works for, without trying to supplant them. The latter impulse is what can be destructive, for her and associates generally.

Recognizing that partners are flawed humans, as we all are, gives Lucy a fighting chance. Associates can and should understand what motivates the partners they work for, and attempt to help out by helping those partners cover their flaws. A more prosaic example: if the partner you work for is not the greatest writer, a smart approach for an associate who actually is a good writer would be to help the partner draft or polish written work product, while also allowing the partner to take the credit. Is it fair? No. But law firms are not designed for fairness.

Second, Lucy does her best work when she remembers that she is not the only associate at the firm. At one point in the show, she is seen trying to recruit other associates to help her. While she does not convince all of her colleagues to pitch in, her willingness to admit that she could use a helping hand inures to her benefit and is convincing enough for at least one other associate to help out. Remembering that you are part of team, as opposed to a one-person fortress, is an important characteristic for associates to have. There will be times when even the best associate could use some help, and there are also times when even the busiest associates must altruistically make some time to help out their colleagues. Building strong relationships with colleagues requires sacrifice. But those relationships can also be lifesavers, on many levels.

Third, Lucy operates with a level of self-awareness that associates should strive to achieve. In particular, Lucy understands that the law firm environment is often set up as one of disqualification, rather than elevation, for associates. Put another way, associates must always understand that their colleagues and superiors, by virtue of the competitive environment at law firms, are more likely looking for reasons to disqualify them, rather than advance them. In Lucy’s case, she is well aware that her stuttering problem is precisely the type of disqualifier that could make her tenure in Biglaw a short-lived one. Yes, you can argue about whether that should be the case, or whether it is fair, but that is not Lucy’s approach.

Lucy is at her most sympathetic and courageous when she is aware of her challenges, but plows ahead anyway. Everyone who has succeeded in a law firm has overcome various challenges. Knowing what challenges face you as an associate is the first step to overcoming them. I won’t spoil the show and let you know what Lucy’s fate is. Whether she makes partner or gets fired matters less to me than the lessons her characters offers us. Nearly every lawyer practicing today knows what is was like as an associate, and today’s associates know that they can take all the help they can get. Especially if they want to capture the crown like King David did.

Two years ago, many lamented the fact that Vault — one of the most trusted resources for law students and lawyers for more than two decades — seemed to have [disappeared overnight](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/vault-home-to-law-firm-prestige-rankings-becomes-firsthand-subsite-which-says-job-seekers-dont-care-about-prestige/), living on as merely a sub-site of Firsthand, a career mentoring and engagement platform for students and alumni.

Of course, since 2021, Vault continued to produce its valuable law firm rankings and offer law firm profiles based on insider perspectives, but something was missing. Where was all the fanfare that the Vault rankings once created? Had law students and lawyers stopped referring to their places of work as a V [insert number here] firm?

The powers that be at Vault knew that something needed to change, and in this case, a revival was in order. That’s right: Vault is officially back. Here’s an excerpt from [Vault’s announcement](https://vault.com/blogs/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/2023-vault-is-back):

We’re pleased to announce that, after two long years, Vault is making a comeback. We’ve come to this decision after reviewing the data and speaking with our students, university customers, corporate clients, and early talent professionals, and we are confident that reverting back to Vault as the core brand is the best way forward for all of our users.

Not only is the Vault domain name back, but the brand is promising to do what it does best — but even better. “We plan to expand on what we’re really good at—creating and delivering unparalleled career content—and we’re going to make it even better than before,” writes Eric Stutzke, Vault’s general manager.

Congratulations to Vault on making its big comeback! We can’t wait to cover the next edition of all of Vault’s rankings.

Now that the economy has turned a bit, I think it’s a reflection of the fact that the firms have more leverage than they did before.

— [Stephanie Biderman](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/stephanie-biderman?byconsultantorauthor=stephanie-biderman), a New York-based legal recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/wall-streets-davis-polk-moves-to-four-days-per-week-in-office) on Davis Polk’s decision to move to a [mandatory four-day in-office attendance policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/). Skadden announced a [similar office attendance policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/) last month. Although firms may risk losing associates as they increase attendance requirements, Biderman told [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/wall-streets-davis-polk-moves-to-four-days-per-week-in-office) that for some firms, “the risk/reward analysis of the in-person training and mentorship and all of that and the culture is outweighing the risk of losing people.”

Seriously. Shearman & Sterling didn’t waste all of its money [destroying its own logo](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/biglaw-firm-rebrands-and-the-new-logo-is-lets-just-say-unconventional/), because it is now the fourth Biglaw firm of the day to announce the fact that it has adopted the new $190K salary scale. All U.S. Track associates and all summer associates at the firm will see their salaries increase in the July 13 pay period.

This is what the new salary scale will look like at the firm:

- Class of 2017: $190,000 / $5,000
- Class of 2016: $200,000 / $7,500
- Class of 2015: $220,000 / $10,000
- Class of 2014: $255,000 / $15,000
- Class of 2013: $280,000 / $20,000
- Class of 2012: $305,000 / $25,000
- Class of 2011: $325,000 / $25,000
- Class of 2010+: $340,000 / $25,000

A sassy Shearman associate said it best with regard to the firm’s new salary scale:

Shearman is now 190 with bonus. After that multimillion-dollar re-branding effort it would have been fake news, an American tragedy if they didn’t pay me what they owe me. I’m very expensive, I know my worth. #BishBettaHaveMyMoney

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important salary updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Stat Of The Week: Biglaw Committing To Offices
## Will lawyers want to come back?

This week saw some encouraging legal news for the commercial real estate industry. For Biglaw associates who overwhelmingly support remote work policies, perhaps not so much. 

According to [data from Savills](https://www.savills.us/research_articles/256536/320248-0), law firms that use more than 20,000 square feet of office space leased 2.1 million square feet in large markets in the third quarter of 2021. This marks the highest quarterly total of the pandemic era, and a 51% increase from the previous quarter. 

Savills’ experts [told Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1432122/law-firm-leasing-reached-pandemic-era-high-in-q3) the increase signals a bet among law firms that lawyers can be convinced to return to the office, along with firms’ “renewed interest in long-term commitments” to physical office space.

# For Some Biglaw Firms, It's Compassion Over Cash-In

While COVID-19, economic downturn and protests against police brutality have turned many lives upside down, most lawyers are still doing great (financially, at least). But how many are doing good?

Quite a few, it turns out. I am happy to say that I know of hundreds of lawyers who have volunteered to help vulnerable people escape lonely, painful, and completely unnecessary prison deaths.

When COVID-19 began to spread in our nation’s federal prisons, the organization I lead, FAMM, joined with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil and Urban Affairs (WLC) on an emergency project to get as many sick and elderly people as possible out of harm’s way. We knew a viable mechanism existed called the federal compassionate release program.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For nearly 40 years, the federal government’s compassionate release program has given people in prison the chance to apply for early release if they could demonstrate they were dying or suffering from a debilitating, chronic illness. Until very recently, however, the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) controlled compassionate release, and it routinely ignored or denied everyone who requested compassionate release. Jailers gonna jail and all.

But in 2018, President Donald Trump signed the First Step Act, which included a provision to allow people in federal prison and their families to appeal BOP denials in federal court. The new law also said prisoners could go to court if the BOP failed to respond to their application within a reasonable time. Thousands of sick and elderly prisoners, many of whom did not need to be in prison any longer and who were now being targeted by a deadly disease, finally had a legitimate shot at early release.

Our organizations were ready to help them. Two problems: We had no money and no staff. We simply were not in a position to represent thousands of people who needed to file motions in federal court. What we needed were lawyers — check that, free lawyers — and lots of them. We started something called the Compassionate Release Clearinghouse with the goal of recruiting and training pro bono lawyers to represent federal prisoners and their families, especially in areas where the nation’s amazing federal public defenders were swamped.

That was in March. Over the past six months, hundreds of attorneys at law firms around the country have answered the call. They have donated thousands of hours to help at-risk federal prisoners and their anxious families try to secure compassionate release.

Some firms stepped up big time. Sidley Austin volunteered teams of paralegals to help screen the thousands of requests for help that poured in, and dozens of lawyers at the firm stepped up to represent prisoners. Talented attorneys from other firms, including DLA Piper, Blank Rome, Zuckerman Spaeder, Epstein Becker & Green, Mayer Brown, Jones Day, and Venable undertook representation of individuals in federal prisons across the country. Many knew little to nothing about compassionate release, but they were eager to receive training and start taking cases as quickly as possible.

Their efforts are saving lives. More than 1,400 vulnerable people have been granted compassionate release from federal prison this year. (Just 125 won early release last year.) These releases have also saved taxpayers millions of dollars.

Families have expressed overwhelming gratitude for the pro bono attorneys and federal defenders who rescued their parents, spouses, and children from dying alone in a prison cell. The volunteer lawyers have said the experience has changed their lives, too.

Elizabeth Bailey, an associate at Buckley LLP in Washington, D.C., won release of a man who was in a persistent vegetative state. She convinced the court that his continued incarceration served no purpose, especially during a deadly pandemic. After the ruling, Bailey said, “There was so much emotion and relief. When you work on something like this, you end up getting to know the most intimate details of a client’s life. You think about them when you’re not working, wonder how they are doing and worry for their family.” Even after the pandemic passes, she said, her work with the Compassionate Release Clearinghouse “will continue to color my practice and, indeed, my life.”

Sounds a bit more fulfilling than doc review.

We and our partners are immensely grateful to all of the attorneys and firms who have given, and continue to give, of their time and talent to help the families with whom we work. Their generosity belies every cliché about lawyers. They didn’t seek any recognition, but they certainly deserve some -– and now they’ve gotten it.

If any attorney or firm is interested in volunteering for the Clearinghouse, please contact Mary Price at mprice@famm.org.

You always knew Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom would, at the very least, match the market bonuses [set yesterday by competitor Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/). There was simply no way the Biglaw giant would do anything less.

Today, less than 24 hours after the first 2018 bonus was announced, Skadden has released their own bonus memo. The good news is that associates at Skadden will indeed be seeing market-level bonuses across all class years. The really good news is reserved for senior associates, who are eligible for “enhanced bonuses” for “extraordinary” performance — to the tune of a cool extra $10K.

Here is the firm’s bonus scale:

We shouldn’t be surprised senior associates are getting some extra love. After all, when associate raises were in the offing earlier this year, [Cravath came over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) of the [scale set by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) for senior associates. Trying to keep their most experienced associates happy at the firm is increasingly a concern at Biglaw, and there’s no better way to show an employee you appreciate them than by throwing extra cash their way.

[(The full memo from the firm is on the next page.)](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-giant-rolls-out-bonuses-with-extra-cash-available-for-senior-associates/2/)

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

It’s been over a week and no firm has yet to announce that it will match [Milbank’s latest series of raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/).

Meanwhile, [Cravath took the plunge on income partnerships](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-cracks-on-non-equity-partnerships/), becoming the latest firm to abandon the time-honored one-tier partnership model. And the turmoil over Nixon Peabody’s effort to sneak Donald Trump onboard as a client [sparks calls for leadership change](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/nixon-peabody-donald-trump-managing-partner-step-down-demand/).

# The Largest Law Firms With The Most Women Lawyers (2019)
## An important ranking to show which firms are helping women achieve successful careers in the law.

Earlier this week, thanks to the recently released National Law Journal 500 ranking, we found out which U.S.-centric Biglaw firms were the [biggest of them all in terms of headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/yet-another-biglaw-firm-ranking-for-those-that-like-to-count/). As a companion piece to the NLJ 500, today we’ve got the NLJ Women’s Scorecard, a ranking of the percentage of female attorneys and percentage of female partners at the largest 350 firms in the country.

For this ranking, both equity and nonequity partners were counted as partners, while nonpartner or “other” figures include special counsel, of counsel, and other staff attorneys. Temporary and contract attorneys aren’t included in the count. In the event of a tie, the higher rank is awarded to the firm with more female equity partners.

This year, 271 of the nation’s 350 largest law firms by head count answered the survey for the Women in Law Scorecard, which ranks the nation’s largest law firms by representation of women attorneys. Among all 271 firms surveyed, women comprised 36.5% of 141,466 attorneys in 2018. But the equity partnership ranks were only 23.5% women, out of 59,000 total partners. Women comprised 47% of the 67,166 associates at all 271 firms.

Without further ado, here is the NLJ Women’s Scorecard Top 10 for 2019:

- Berry Appleman & Leiden
- Fragomen
- Kubicki Draper
- Kaufman Borgeest & Ryan
- FordHarrison
- Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete
- Littler Mendelson
- Foley & Mansfield
- Hanson Bridgett
- Kelley Kronenberg
You may be wondering where the largest, namebrand Biglaw firms appear on this list. While the majority of the top 30 firms on the scorecard have a head count of fewer than 300, there were some exceptions, with Littler, Ogletree, Jackson Lewis, and Lewis Brisbois all making an appearance in the top 30. Other firms, like Ropes & Gray, O’Melveny, and Thompson Coburn made major strides in the right direction when it came to “not just about bringing women into the firm, but keeping them.”

Congratulations to all of the firms that succeeded in boosting their ranks in this year’s Women’s Scorecard by placing women in leadership roles and fostering a pipeline of female and diverse attorneys.

Chicago attorney Felipe Gomez is facing ethics charges following allegations he sent “extreme and egregious” harassing and threatening emails to opposing counsel at both Barnes & Thornburg and Fox Rothschild. The conduct allegedly caused the opposing attorneys to fear for their lives.

The [report and recommendation ](http://iardc.org/File/View/1458030?FileName=In%20re%20Felipe%20Nery%20Gomez%2C%20Attorney%20Number%206197210.pdf)by the hearing board of the Illinois Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission, while falling short of recommending disbarment, does recommend a three-year suspension to continue until further order of the court. The bulk of the ethics complaints come from a case where Gomez was a plaintiff against the Charles Schwab Corp. and Cubesmart. In that case, Cubesmart was represented by Christina Sanfelippo of Fox Rothschild, and Charles Schwab was represented by Vincent P. Schmeltz III of Barnes & Thornburg.

As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-accused-of-sending-harassing-emails-to-biglaw-opponents-had-previously-filed-abortion-suit) ABA Journal, the commission’s report detailed the following interactions (Steven Badger, general counsel at Barnes & Thornburg, and Jeffrey Widman, Fox Rothschild’s Chicago managing partner, were also involved in the correspondence as it escalated):

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
• Sent an email to Schmeltz on Easter 2019 that said, “You sir are despicable and unfit to practice law and I pledge to bring the full weight of justice down on you.” Gomez allegedly sent the email after Schmeltz told Gomez that a subpoena was premature because the parties had not yet conferred.

• Sent a second Easter email calling Schmeltz “Shmuchs” and telling him that he is “engaged in active tampering and obstruction.” The email said Gomez considered Schmeltz and his law firm “an active criminal.”

• Sent another Easter email calling Schmeltz “scum” and telling him to “resign and plea to FBI.”

• Sent an email to Badger asserting that Schmeltz and Barnes & Thornburg “are scum of the Earth and need to be abated. Under RICO I am private AG and doing the abating.” The email was sent after Badger asked Gomez to stop making improper personal attacks in communications.

• Sent an email to Sanfelippo saying he intended “to RICO you, personally, your firm, and your client.” He sent the email after Sanfelippo filed a motion for sanctions.

• Sent an email to Sanfelippo and Fox Rothschild’s managing partner that said: “Liars will be prosecuted. Sanfelippo is a Target … with your firm. I am dead serious.”

• Sent an email to Widman in May 2019 that told him to “get ready for judgment day.”

The commission also cited separate interactions with Chicago’s chief assistant corporation counsel:

• Left a voicemail with Chicago’s chief assistant corporation counsel, Amber Ritter, in September 2018 in which he sang “99 Bottles of Beer of the Wall.” Gomez left the voicemail after seeking city records.

• Sent dozens of emails to Ritter demanding that she resign and accusing her of police misconduct. Gomez sent the emails beginning in September 2018 after Ritter refused to shake Gomez’s hand in court because she considered prior emails and voicemail disturbing.

Gomez has denied the allegations, and claimed his actions are protected speech:

Gomez said in a press release the board report is a loss for the Illinois Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission’s litigation counsel, who had sought a penalty of disbarment during her closing argument.

The panel evidently rejected the request, “which is what the headline should be,” said the press release forwarded to reporters.

The press release said the ethics complaint did not mention any disbarment and is generic in its relief request.

“It is ironic that the discipliner feels it need not obey the rules while it pillories someone for emails that violate no rules but rather subjective ‘sensibilities’ of persons whom the emails were not intended for, not to mention the content is clearly ‘speech,’ not ‘conduct,’” the press release said.

The board report “is only a recommendation, to be parsed and then considered as part of a larger picture by [the Illinois Supreme Court], then SCOTUS if and as needed,” the press release said.

However, in April 2021, the Illinois Supreme Court [suspended](https://tmsnrt.rs/3n5uIt2) Gomez on an interim basis, as [reported by](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/lawyer-who-sued-texas-abortion-provider-faces-3-year-suspension-2022-01-07/) Reuters.

If Gomez’s name seems familiar, he[ is the same attorney](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/who-would-sue-doctor-over-texas-abortion-law-these-guys-2021-09-21/) that filed suit against a San Antonio doctor who wrote a [Washington Post op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/18/texas-abortion-provider-alan-braid) admitting to violating Texas’s SB8 that bans on abortions after 8 weeks.

# Biglaw Firm Is Done With The Waiting, Announces Associate Salary Raises
## Big bucks at this Biglaw firm.

It’s been three weeks since the latest edition of the associate salary wars began, thanks to a raise announcement by Milbank. While in the past, when one Biglaw firm announces across the board salary hikes the rest of the market has been quick to respond, [that has not been the case this time around](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/why-havent-more-biglaw-firms-announced-raises/). Yes, some firms have matched the new compensation scale, but large swaths of the industry seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach.

At least one Biglaw firm is done with the waiting. Choate, a firm that took in 274,746,000 in gross revenue in 2020 making it #119 on the Am Law 200, put their associates out of the salary limbo and announced raises. The new scale — retroactive to January 1 — mimics the [one set by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) last month.

The new salary scale at the firm is as follows:



The firm also announced raises for its patent agents and staff scientists, the scale for which can be found [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/choate-match-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

Time’s been funny during the pandemic. It can seem like not much has changed since we first shuttered our doors and began working exclusively from home back in March. But judging by the fortunes of Biglaw firms, things are improving. Increasingly, we are seeing Biglaw firms that cut salaries in the opening days of the pandemic change course, and rollback those cuts.

That’s exactly what’s happening at Kilpatrick Townsend.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Back in April,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-latest-in-biglaw-austerity-yet-another-am-law-100-firm-cutting-salaries/?rf=1) the firm cut partner draws by 10 percent. Associates and non-partner salaried employees saw a 5 percent pay cut. Secretaries moved to a 0.8 schedule but were not subject to the firmwide 5 percent salary reductions. But now it looks like the fears of a 15 percent revenue shortfall were overstated, and a rollback is in order.

Kilpatrick Townsend announced that associate salaries are being fully restored to pre-pandemic levels effective on September 1st, and reflected in the September 15th paycheck. Attorneys that had mandatory FTE reductions are being considered case by case, and secretaries will be returning to full time status.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

If you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Layoff Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the layoff alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each layoff, salary cut, or furlough announcement that we publish.

# Reinventing The Law Business: What Actually Is Work-Life Balance?
## It's an exercise in futility, or worse, to try to achieve a goal that everyone defines in different ways.

Bruce Stachenfeld

I keep hearing about “work-life balance.” I hear it all the time. It is respected – cherished – lauded – and overall held up as some sort of Holy Grail goal, and especially in the legal field. Witness the struggles of Biglaw firms touting their newfound respect for “work-life balance” in trying to recruit millennials. And witness smaller firms touting “work life balance” as a recruiting advantage over Biglaw, which is famous for not having “work-life balance”.

But before jumping into this debate, could we take a step back and see if we can even define what we are talking about? Indeed, it is very dangerous when a goal that is not properly defined becomes something that “should be” attained by a law firm. Let me delve here a bit……

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
First of all what is this mysterious “work-life balance”? Does it mean:

- Nine to five Monday through Friday?
- Hard work one week and next week off?
- Work five years hard to start a career then easy after that?
- Kill yourself to make partner and then easy after that?
- Mommy track or, now, daddy track?
- Non-stressful work?
- You get to decide when you work and not clients or others?
- You work less hard when you have kids at home but harder when they are gone?
- You work super-hard to achieve a goal, because that is cool, but otherwise you hang loose?
- Different things for different people?
Or 100 other things that I haven’t thought of?

To make the question more interesting, does the same person have a different view of work-life balance at different times in her day, in her week, in her month, in her year, in her career, in her life?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
My personal work-life balance is that I love what I do and I work crazy hard (probably over 70 hours every week). But it doesn’t feel like work to me because I love what I do so much. I am pretty happy almost all the time so I think my work-life balance is just peachy; however, most people think I am completely nuts and crazily “unbalanced.”

So what do we do now? Do we just chuck this goal as a waste of time? Not so fast. There is something else going on here, which is a lot deeper and of great importance, to be sure. I think what people are really talking about when they say the words “work-life balance” is that they want meaning in their jobs.

Is it possible to see the excitement in working literally around the clock to achieve an amazing goal? And is it possible to see the fulfillment in not having your job take over your life? In my opinion, each is completely reasonable depending on the goal, the person, the timing, the frequency, etc. Is it really fair to say that the latter or the former is the “right goal,” when it is only the goal for some people and not others?

So I don’t think a well-run law firm dumps the idea of work-life balance; instead, I think possibly a reframing of the issue is in order, which, quite simply, is whether our jobs are giving us meaningfulness in life and, if not, how we change things to do exactly that.

If you are reading this far, the first step for a law firm is to get out on the table what people really want in order to find meaning in their jobs. I suspect there is an enormous variation (as I outlined above). I would try to get this information anonymously for the most part, as I think people might be embarrassed to be truthful publicly. Does anyone want to stand up and admit that she wants to work around the clock and she just loves it! Or does anyone want to stand up and admit that he really just doesn’t want to work that hard?

Once that information is on the table, there are all sorts of ways to achieve an initiative at a law firm. These include committees, task forces, third-party consultants, managing partner edicts, management committee policies, etc.

But one thing is obvious to me, and that it is an exercise in futility, or worse, to try to achieve a goal that everyone defines in different ways.

The closer we get to Friday night, the more likely it is that Biglaw firms will announce bonus news that’s sure to delight.

Yet another firm has announced bonuses that reward associates for billing well above and beyond what was expected of them, except in this case, many associates were surprised by the fact that less was required of them than usual to achieve a market bonus — meaning that some may be receiving some unexpected additional cash.

The firm in question is Katten Muchin, and associates seem pretty thrilled:

Katten announced bonuses today! The big news this year is that the firm is paying market bonuses at 2000 hours. Previously, the threshold for market was 2100, with a smaller bonus at 2000. On top of that, the announcement this year is much earlier (previously mid-to-late January), as is the payment (previously mid February).

Here’s the scale for Katten’s over-the-top bonuses for high billers:



Note that there’s not even a pro-rated bonus included for the class of 2019. Ouch.

# Is The Spate Of Discrimination Class Actions Against Biglaw The Real Reason Behind The ABA’s Initiative On Women At Biglaw?
## Is this just cover?

To my regular readers, it should come as no surprise that I’m not a fan of the recently announced [ABA Initiative](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/why_are_women_lawyers_leaving_the_profession_mid_career_aba_initiative_hope) on why women lawyers leave the law — or more accurately, “why women lawyers leave Biglaw mid-career.” As I’ve pointed out [time ](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/why-doesnt-the-legal-profession-view-women-owned-solo-and-small-law-firms-as-relevant-to-diversity/)and [again](https://myshingle.com/2017/08/articles/parents-who-practice/the-legal-professions-invisible-women/) Biglaw isn’t the end all and be all of success in the law for women, and so long as organizations like the ABA view [women-owned law firms](https://www.womenownedlaw.org/) as second class citizens in the battle for equality, we’ll never eradicate discrimination in the profession.

I’m not the only woman lawyer who sounds like a broken record. Last week, Jill Switzer, one of my fellow columnists here at ATL penned another [column](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/the-only-way-for-the-legal-profession-to-change-for-women-may-be-through-litigation/) bemoaning the endless initiatives like the one recently announced by the ABA that launch enthusiastically and conclude with lofty calls for action that result in… the status quo. Sadly, after a distinguished 40-year career in the law, Ms. Switzer has grown so cynical about prospects for women that she discourages them from going to law school at all.

But both Switzer and another one of my ATL colleagues, Nicole Black have noticed a promising trend that may actually fix the gender problem at law firms. As Black [writes](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/women-lawyers-slowly-chipping-away-at-the-glass-ceiling/), there’s been a spate of class action discrimination suits against Biglaw over the past few years — and as Black predicts (and I concur), it’s very likely that these lawsuits may bring about change in the legal profession.

So if change is a coming to law firms through class action litigation, why do we need an ABA initiative now? Call me cynical, but I have to wonder whether the ABA initiative is as much about promoting gender equality as it is about protecting Biglaw from the consequences of its actions. Indeed, [Hilarie Bass](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/b/bass-hilarie) — the ABA’s current president and champion of the women’s initiative has first-hand experience with the impact of discrimination: her own law firm, Greenberg Traurig was [hit with](https://www.law360.com/articles/445037/greenberg-traurig-settles-atty-s-200m-gender-bias-action) [a $200 million gender discrimination lawsuit back in 2012](https://www.law360.com/articles/398182/greenberg-traurig-hit-with-200m-sex-bias-class-action) after a finding by the EEOC of probable discrimination. In fact, Bass [defended the firm](https://www.law360.com/articles/398182/greenberg-traurig-hit-with-200m-sex-bias-class-action) — which [subsequently settled the suit](https://www.law360.com/articles/946348/biglaw-bias-suits-new-wild-card-in-fight-for-gender-equity).

These days, law firms are no longer shielded from discrimination suits by threat of adverse repercussions. Back when I was an associate in the early 1990s, most lawyers never considered an action against their law firm for fear that “they’d never find work again,” as Switzer observed in her article. But times have changed and money matters more to law firms than compatibility. In other words, if a woman has a big book of business and Biglaw credentials, chances are she’ll be snapped up by a competing law firm — or may be invited to take a position in-house with one of her clients. Moreover, as the number of female equity partners remains the same each year, these recent discrimination actions take on added credibility.

Given that public shaming can’t stem the tide of discrimination lawsuits against Biglaw, what’s left but the ABA? The ABA Initiative can potentially afford great cover to law firms facing discrimination actions. Firms can send a couple of female partners to participate, hobnob with female general counsel and be able to put on an “of course, we support women” face during a deposition. Alternatively, the ABA Initiative — like all the well-intentioned suits that came before — may lead to the adoption of watered-down requirements for law firms which may also help to mitigate liability in a discrimination suit. But whatever the ABA Initiative may accomplish, one thing is clear: it’s as much about saving Biglaw as it is about helping women.

# Associate Compensation Scorecard: Which Firms Have Announced Bonuses?
## Is your firm listed here? If not, what are the partners waiting for?

Since we broke the news of the market bonus scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) on Monday, November 28, 2016 — many firms have quickly fallen in line and matched (or sometimes beaten) the scale. It’s still quite early in bonus season, so we’ve yet to hear from firms offering statements on why they’ve failed to match the market, and dozens upon dozens of firms have remained completely silent.

As we did when the [new associate salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) was announced by Cravath in June, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have already matched the new bonus scale, the markets where those bonus matches were made, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if available), and the date those bonuses will be paid. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on bonuses is announced. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs further clarification, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus%20Scorecard%20Correction).

Help us help you now (and if/when you decide to make a lateral move in the future). Let us know what your firm’s minimum billable hours targets are for bonus eligibility and when your firm will pay those bonuses. You generally must remain at your firm until the payout date to receive them, as stated in most memos, which could make it all the more difficult for you to leave your place of employment.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

Faith E. Gay & Philippe Z. Selendy

Big news in the world of lateral partner moves: longtime Quinn Emanuel partners Philippe Z. Selendy and Faith E. Gay, along with “a handful of colleagues,” are leaving the Biglaw giant.

As[ reported by](https://biglawbusiness.com/top-partners-to-leave-quinn-emanuel/) Big Law Business, the two high-powered financial litigators are opening up their own shop. The identities of those joining them have yet to be announced (though in addition to Selendy’s and Gay’s Quinn bio pages being taken down, the one for Selendy’s wife, Jennifer Selendy, is also gone).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
UPDATE (3:02 p.m.): Other lawyers leaving Quinn — as reflected in their bios having been removed from the QE website — include Sean Baldwin, Christine Chung, Andrew Dunlap, David Elsberg, and Maria Ginzburg. The new firm will be known as Selendy & Gay PLLC.

Philippe Selendy was chair of the firm’s securities and structured finance practices, and was referred to as the “[Man Who Took On Wall Street](https://www.ft.com/content/e9d3aa12-2e3f-11e4-b760-00144feabdc0)” for his role in the residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) litigation. Faith Gay was co-chair of the national trial practice and co-chair of the New York white-collar practice, with over 30 trials under her belt and a strong pro bono resume.

In a statement, Quinn Emanuel’s managing partner, John B. Quinn, said:

Our firm has never been stronger, and has never had a deeper bench of veteran and next generation talent.  We of course respect our valued colleagues’ decision to take their practice to a smaller platform, but we do not expect these departures to have any significant impact on our practice or our revenue.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
It’s certainly true that Quinn has a deep bench of great litigators, ranging from [Bill Burck](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/burck-william), the go-to lawyer for current and former [Trump Administration officials in the cross-hairs](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/quinn-emanuel-racks-up-another-former-trump-administration-client-steve-bannon/), and high-profile recent additions like [Alex Spiro](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/quinn-emanuel-pulls-off-coup-with-big-time-criminal-defense-hire/), [Luke Nikas](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/nikas-luke), and [Chris Landau](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/prominent-supreme-court-lawyer-jumps-from-kirkland-ellis-to-quinn-emanuel/). But the Selendy and Gay departures are still significant, as a litigation partner at a rival Biglaw firm told us:

These are the most visible younger partners in the financial litigation space. Quinn is acting like it is no big deal, but the new firm has many of their second-generation stars. Not sure what the new firm’s bread and butter will be, with financial crisis litigation winding down, but I expect they will find away to be a force to be reckoned with.

A second source suggested that the shifting ground in finance-related litigation might have had something to do with the moves:

One has to wonder whether this is linked to the settling of mortgage-backed securities litigation, which Selendy was known for having led. I also know Philippe had been interested in getting even more involved in pro bono work. Given the profit-driven nature of Quinn, I’m not sure how his endeavors meshed with the firm’s environment.

A desire to do more pro-bono or public-facing work is certainly one factor driving the trend of prominent partners leaving top Biglaw firms to launch boutiques. See, e.g., Roberta Kaplan [leaving Paul Weiss to launch Kaplan and Company](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/a-history-making-litigator-leaves-biglaw-to-launch-a-boutique/).

UPDATE (3:14 p.m.): Per [Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/top-partners-to-leave-quinn-emanuel/), “Selendy acknowledged Quinn Emanuel partners have different views on what cases they would like to handle, and characterized the firm as ‘fractious.’ Some lawyers prefer high profits while others are interested in public interest work, Selendy said.”

Peter E. Calamari, managing partner of the New York office of Quinn Emanuel, wished Faith Gay and Philippe Selendy — and those they take with them — success:

It is a sign of our firm’s maturity and great success that over the years we have seen individual lawyers in a number of our offices go off to start their own firms. We wish them all great success.

We here at Above the Law also wish the pair success as they enter the brave new world of boutique law firms.

# The Path To Generative AI Proficiency For Legal Professionals
## Even if the need to understand prompt engineering disappears over time, this foundational knowledge will likely still be useful in the future.

Have you been tracking the progress of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies? If not, the rapid advancements may feel overwhelming. I’ve been covering emerging technologies in the legal space for almost 20 years, and I’ve never seen anything like it.

So if you’re feeling a bit behind, you’re not alone. Technology is changing — and fast. GAI tools, including large language model (LLM) chatbots are taking the legal space by storm. Legal professionals are showing an incredible interest in learning about this technology, and the thirst for knowledge about artificial intelligence tools is both surprising and refreshing.

If you haven’t yet gotten up to speed on this emerging technology, the good news is that there are a lot of opportunities to learn about it. Whether it’s legal conferences, CLEs, articles, or online courses, an abundance of educational opportunities are available.

One key area of focus has been prompting. The current GAI tools provide better results when the prompts, or questions input, are well crafted and provide the necessary foundational information. However, prompt creation is a relatively new concept, and as a result, a novel one to most people. For that reason, many law firms and law schools are focusing on teaching, not only about GAI, but also the art of the prompt.

While some in the legal profession have reacted to generative AI with knee-jerk bans, others have taken a more innovative and forward-thinking stance. A great example is [Professor David Kempt’s approach](https://verdict.justia.com/2023/08/25/abandoning-precedent-the-case-for-bringing-chatgpt-into-law-schools).

Over the summer he taught a two-week course at [Rutgers Law School](https://law.rutgers.edu/) that focused on generative AI tools like ChatGPT. The course covered “the fundamentals of how ChatGPT works (and the essential vocabulary, like AI, ML, NLP, and LLMs), the strengths and weaknesses of the tool as applied to specific tasks within law practice, and the ethical considerations — with an emphasis on developing the ability to assess the suitability of any AI-driven tool for use in a legal practice setting.”

It’s not just being taught at law schools; law firms are also jumping into the AI fray. An increasing number of law firms are relying on online courses to teach the ins and outs of GAI, including the risks and benefits, prompt engineering, and appropriate use cases.

For example, the law firm [Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe](https://www.orrick.com/) has been working with [AltaClaro](https://www.altaclaro.com/), an experiential learning provider for legal professionals. AltaClaro  developed a course on GAI that includes training on prompt engineering. I recently spoke with AltaClaro co-founder and chief learning officer Julie Ryan, who explained that the course focuses on many different tools and is regularly updated to keep up with the rapidly changing technology.

According to Kate Orr, global head of practice innovation at Orrick, summer associates received training using the interactive online course. Due to the summer program’s success, there are plans to expand the training to other lawyers in the firm this fall.

Another example is [SkillBurst Interactive](https://www.skillburst.com/), which is developing an on-demand online series, Generative AI Fundamentals for Law Firms for a consortium of firms that include Eversheds Sutherland, Hogan Lovells, Perkins Coie, Taft, Thompson Coburn, Womble Bond Dickinson, and Norton Rose Fulbright. Steve Gluckman, CEO of SkillBurst, shared that the first two modules of the series have already been rolled out, “Generative AI: Facts and Foundations” and “Generative AI Security: An Overview of Risks.” Going forward, two additional modules will be released every month to participating firms.

In other words, opportunities abound when it comes to learning about GAI and crafting prompts, whether you are a legal professional or a law student. Of course understanding prompts may be a short-lived need. Because GAI is advancing at such a rapid clip, it’s entirely possible that in a year or less prompts may no longer be an issue.

Soon, the software may very well have built-in functionality that will automatically interpret your request and craft an appropriate prompt on the backend of the software. Some legal software already does this for you, and this trend will likely increase as time goes on.

However, in the interim, understanding prompt engineering is important since it’s currently the only way to obtain useful and accurate results, especially with commercially available tools. Even if the need to understand prompt engineering disappears over time, this foundational knowledge will likely still be useful in the future. Just as was the case with legal research and Boolean inputs, or blogging and HTML, it’s always helpful to have an understanding of what’s happening on the backend of a software tool, should you ever need to troubleshoot an issue that you may encounter.

The bottom line: the rapid pace at which GAI is advancing poses both a challenge and an opportunity for our profession. As GAI tools evolve, staying abreast of these rapid changes is imperative. Rather than ignore this reality, law schools, and law firms should embrace change. Providing robust GAI training will empower legal professionals to keep pace with this rapid technological evolution. Investing in education now lays the foundation for learning and ensures the full potential of GAI is realized in legal practice tomorrow.

# Power Niche Marketing: Turning Your Niche Into A Power Niche -- Augmenting Your Power
## Your power grows and grows; there is no stopping you now.

As you follow the steps to create a Power Niche, your ownership of your niche starts to grow in strength. Even with just reading a few articles on Google, you are growing little bits of “power” after just a few hours of work. And, after several weeks, well you are becoming a know-it-all!  Now let’s talk about how to grow this to the next level:

Happily, this is the easiest and simplest part of all… you just start telling everyone about what you are doing.

As an example, for a lawyer, you start to tell everyone: “I am going into fashion law – I am the fashion industry lawyer”.

You tell everyone, and I mean everyone!

You tell your mom, you tell your dad, you tell your entire family. And, you tell your relatives and your friends. You can even use Facebook and LinkedIn and other social media (if you are good at that stuff). This is one of the places it might be very useful.

You of course tell your co-workers, including peers, subordinates and, once you have your footing, your boss too.

You tell your friends. You tell everyone under the sun, especially those in the fashion industry that you start to get to know.

And – this is SUPER important — you tell them again and again and again and again. One email that announces it will not cut the mustard. You have to repeat what you are doing again and again and again and again and again and again….This is not because people are stupid or don’t care; it is because people are all barraged with constant information hitting their brains and if you don’t repeat your message it will just be forgotten. So you have to over-repeat your message.

There are some statistics about three times in 90 days or something like that. I don’t know about that statistic, but I can say that that is not even nearly enough and the more times the better. And there is even a quote from a hypothetical coach who says:

“Before the game I worry that I have repeated myself too many times, but then when the game happens I realize I haven’t repeated my message nearly enough times.”

By the way, have you noticed I just repeated this message a bunch of times.

Along the way, you pepper the lives of your friends and relatives and co-workers with your Power Niche, because every time you see them you turn the conversation to talking about your Power Niche. You are a veritable fire hose of information and repartee about your new passion.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
You work the Threebies in because you are out and about – you are crazy enthusiastic about your Power Niche – and you now have knowledge (power) in your growing Power Niche. And of course you don’t forget the fourth Threebie, so you follow up with everyone you meet that has potential interest in your Power Niche.

In any case, you keep talking about your message so much that people start to get (almost) sick of you. When they see you coming they can’t help but see the word FASHION tattooed across your forehead.

Having overemphasized this, of course, you should try not to be a butthead about it. You don’t want people to think of you as an idiot – but hopefully you get my point.

So as you keep on talking about what you are doing, then an amazing thing happens – all of these people start helping you!

It is the strangest thing but if you are like a broken record on the high end fashion industry legal stuff, people start sending you articles, links, ideas, connections, friends and, yes, even clients or job leads.

It becomes an incredible thing – a self-fulfilling prophecy – that because you held yourself out as an expert everyone helps you become more of an expert.

People simply can’t help themselves. They see a fashion industry article and they think: “Oh, Toby will want to see this” and they forward you the link. Or they meet someone in fashion and they can’t help saying:  “Oh you will want to meet my friend Toby. He just is SO into the fashion industry and he knows everything. I bet you guys will be fast friends immediately. He is a good guy too. Can I connect you with him?”

So, if you keep going with me here, in just a few weeks you know more than a lot of people on a topic. In a few months, you know more than just about everyone everywhere. Your power is growing and your niche is fast becoming a Power Niche.

Suddenly, without you realizing how easy it was, you are the best in the world at something. Wow!  Within your niche, everyone wants you around, and the more you are around, the more people you meet, the more your knowledge increases. It becomes an incredible virtuous cycle to grow the power of your Power Niche.

You not only are useful in your niche for “what you know”, but you are also starting to get to know everyone and therefore become useful also for “who you know”. You know people, and you have heard before that “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”  And trust me, that is very true. Now you know all the key players.

So your power grows and grows. There is no stopping you now.  You are the owner of a Power Niche!

It’s Friday afternoon, and you know what that means during bonus season: Biglaw associates across the country have been counting down the hours and repeatedly refreshing their email accounts to see if they’ve received any welcome news about whether their firm will match the market or come in over the top.

Today, lucky associates at one firm discovered that they’d wind up with some extra cash on top of their regular bonuses if they worked really, really hard this year. Which firm could be offering up the bountiful bonuses, and how much extra money are we talking?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

It’s Akin Gump, and the firm has matched Milbank for 2019 year-end bonuses. In case you’ve forgotten, this is what the scale looks like:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000
Class of 2011 – $100,000

Associates at the firm need to have worked 1950 or more hours (including pro bono hours, general counsel hours, business development hours, and up to 100 hours of time spent on recruiting, diversity & inclusion, and/or innovation activities) to be considered eligible for a full bonus this year.

Now, about the additional money highly productive associates at the firm can expect, let’s turn to an excerpt from this year’s bonus memo:

This year, as in the past, the firm will reward truly outstanding performers with bonuses that exceed the market bonus for their respective class (as set forth above). Those associates and counsel whose performance and productivity is deemed extraordinary will receive additional bonus amounts ranging from $5,000 – $25,000 above the market level for their class.

Congratulations to everyone at Akin — this seems like a fantastic cash haul. Bonuses at the firm will hit associate bank accounts in early 2020.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Akin Gump.)

The Biglaw firm of Fenwick & West is getting even bigger. The firm announced today they’re opening up a Souther California outpost in Santa Monica. The office will be led by corporate partner [Michael Brown,](https://www.fenwick.com/Professionals/Pages/michaelbrown.aspx) who is splitting his time between the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Santa Monica offices. Joining Brown in Santa Monica are partners Faisal Rashid and Ran Ben-Tzur, as well as a contingent of associates and other professionals.

As Fenwick chair, Richard Dickson said in a [statement](https://www.fenwick.com/media/pages/fenwick-opens-santa-monica-office-supporting-growing-technology-scene.aspx), the new office was created to better support their clients in the technology, life sciences and investment spaces:

“We take a client-centric approach to setting our growth strategy. Los Angeles is one of the top regions in the U.S. for emerging growth companies, and our practice there has grown substantially over the past few years. We’re making this investment to better serve our clients and to respond to the increasing demand in the Los Angeles technology, life sciences and investment communities.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Southern Cal has been a hotbed of technology and life sciences companies in recent years, so it’s fitting that Fenwick’s growth strategy would revolve around that area.

“Santa Monica is a leading center of technology and investment in Southern California and an area that Fenwick has been steadily investing in,” said Brown. “We have nearly 200 clients in the broader Los Angeles area, including some of the world’s most cutting-edge tech companies, and have built relationships with major VC firms and key incubators. We’re committed to fostering growth in the Los Angeles tech ecosystem, and our expanded presence puts us that much closer to our clients.”

Congrats to Fenwick on the new digs, and good luck trying to get this earwig of 90s nostalgia out of your head now.

He left the department last time with a good reputation for professionalism and integrity. That’s not true this time. And it’s not because of particular positions he took. It’s because of his lack of respect for the rule of law, his dishonesty while he was attorney general and his clear lack of respect for traditions of professionalism within the department.

— Stanford Law professor [David Alan Sklansky](https://law.stanford.edu/directory/david-alan-sklansky/), who worked as a federal prosecutor under Attorney General Bill Barr during the George H.W. Bush administration, commenting on the fact that Barr [may face a much more difficult job hunt](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1338421/bill-barr-s-on-the-job-market-will-any-law-firm-hire-him-) if he decides to go into private practice after he leaves the Trump administration.

Elena Deutsch

In my last post, I talked about the [importance of seeking help](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/why-lawyers-fear-seeing-therapists-and-why-we-should-do-it-anyway/) from a therapist when faced with a mental-health struggle. Therapists can help to identify illnesses and methodologies for treatment. They can help you explore the why behind your behaviors.

Coaches are different in that they help to clarify and achieve your goals. This can be in your career, in your business, or your personal life. Career coaches can help you explore the how. How do you get from here to there?

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For this post, I sat down with career coach, [Elena Deutsch](http://womeninterestedinleavinglaw.com/). Elena specifically works with Biglaw lawyers who are experiencing dissatisfaction and helps them find more fulfilling careers.

JC: Tell me briefly about you. 

ED: I offer senior and mid-level female associates a career transformation program to begin their path out of Biglaw, even if they’re scared and not sure what to do next. I do this through a program called, “WILL,” which stands for Women Interested in Leaving (Big) Law.

I’ve done years of leadership coaching with lawyers and executives across industries. I see a lot of pain and inertia in big firms. I offer WILL for women who want to leave a system that is not working for them or their lives.>

JC: What does a coach do? Why should lawyers considering leaving Biglaw work with a coach?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
ED: Coaches create dedicated time for clients to pause, reflect, and take action in pursuit of goals. Then, clients can be more intentional about how they spend their time and energy.

Coaches can help lawyers considering leaving Biglaw in a couple of ways.

First, by bringing attention to mindset. Coaching can uncover where we get stuck and help develop inner skills to be more conscious of how our thoughts influence our actions.

Second, coaches help clients clarify and set goals. If a lawyer wants to leave Biglaw, a coach can help them name their strengths, values, and what they want from their career and life. Then coaches provide support and accountability as client takes action towards their desired results.

JC: What are some common reasons why Biglaw attorneys choose to leave?

ED: Many attorneys I’ve spoken and worked with have no say over their schedules. Their lives lack any predictability or control.

It is extremely difficult to plan their evenings, or truly take a vacation or weekend off.

Many said Biglaw does not work for women. And this is not only said by women who have children. It is about the structure and culture of firms. Firm leaders are typically older men, who have been able to devote their life to the firm. That’s at odds for how many millennials and others operate.

Some firms are working to change this and are more on the cutting edge than others.

People I’ve spoken with want more agency, to plan a day off, shop and cook, or have friends over. If they have a partner and or kids, they want to spend time with them. If they are single, they want to date.

JC: What are some of the obstacles and limiting mindsets that big law attorneys must work with before change is possible?

ED: I see a number of common obstacles. People are afraid of what others will think. Some worry about parents, partners, or friends. Others don’t want anyone to think they “can’t hack it.” Some wonder what’s wrong with them if they don’t want to make partner.

Often people feel indebted to a mentor who has invested in them. They don’t want to disappoint that person by leaving.

Some find it hard to share they want out of the firm. It’s an implicit rejection.

Practicing law in a big firm is the only work many associates have known. They worry that their skills are too narrow and it’s hard to explore what’s out there while so enmeshed in the firm.

Underneath all this, is fear of the unknown. Fear wants to hold onto what’s known and familiar. To remain part of the tribe. This fear breeds inertia.

I ask people also to consider the risk of not acting, and staying indefinitely.

A coach can help refocus that mindset, on strengths, interests and values, so you get excited about new possibilities. Loving what you do is a legitimate goal!

JC: Can you share some of the next chapter’s Biglaw clients you’ve worked with found after leaving?

ED: Sure! I stay in touch with many of my clients.

When I began with one client, he said, “I could die in my office and no one would find me for weeks”. He was from abroad but working in a New York white-shoe firm. Now he is back in his home country.

He negotiated a great exit for himself. By the way, because of their negotiation skills, many past clients successfully sought, and won, good exit packages. He took a year off to travel and co-produce a TV show. He realized what he missed about law and did temporary legal work.

He ended up reconnecting with a colleague and went back into firm life, but in an in-house role. Now he goes home and has dinner with his partner every night. They put their phones away and talk.

Another woman moved back South and is at a Fortune 500 company, doing government relations. I’ve had clients land at startups here in New York City.

# Accelerate Advancement: Initiate Your Lateral Attorney Move Before Year-End For Optimal Career Opportunities
## Legal professionals should seize the strategic benefits hidden within an autumn lateral career move, uncovering uniquely fitting opportunities in a less competitive market ahead of the new year.

As the luminous spirit of the festive season begins to envelop the concluding chapters of the year, numerous legal professionals invariably defer their lateral career aspirations to the new year, succumbing to the pervasive notion that January heralds a more conducive environment for such transitions. “Often, attorneys believe that the beginning of a new year symbolizes a fresh start in many aspects, including career changes. However, what they may not realize is that initiating a lateral move in the final quarter of the year can actually unveil a wealth of untapped opportunities and set the stage for a prosperous transition,” notes [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) Managing Director, [Vered Krasna](https://laterallink.com/team/vered-krasna/). This prevalent conviction, while widely acknowledged, may inadvertently veil the untapped benefits and strategic footholds that can be gained by embarking on lateral career navigations sooner rather than later.

Challenging the Norms: The Undervalued Merits of a Preemptive Search

“Many Attorneys unintentionally place constraints on their career trajectories by adhering to the false notion that hiring processes do not occur in Q4.  The truth is, a larger number of hires in Q1 actually get underway in Q4,” observes [Zain Atassi](https://laterallink.com/team/zain-atassi/), Principal at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/). A significant spectrum of opportunity lies veiled in the fall, providing a backdrop where competition is considerably tempered, and unique opportunities manifest within a less congested market.

- The Perceived Awkwardness of December Onboarding:
“An integral facet often overlooked by candidates is that the prospect of starting anew amidst the holidays is, in actuality, relatively infrequent,” comments [Matt Bennett](https://laterallink.com/team/matt-bennett/), Director at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/). While the apprehension surrounding a mid-holiday employment transition is comprehensible, it is crucial to acknowledge that positions commencing in January or even February are far from scarce, providing ample space for strategic lateral moves without holiday encumbrance.

- Navigating the Bonus Conundrum:
Navigating through the anxieties concerning annual bonus preservation presents its own set of complexities. [Amy Savage](https://laterallink.com/team/amy-savage/), Chair of [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/)’s Government Enforcement and Regulatory Group, sheds light on this matter, stating, “Most firms, cognizant of the financial motivations and apprehensions of potential hires, will formulate pathways that either compensate any forsaken bonuses or create transition scenarios that ensure bonus retention from the present employer.”

- The Myth of the Year-End Interview Lull:
Countering the presumption that firms hibernate their interviewing activities as the year draws to a close, [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) Director, [Christine Berger](https://laterallink.com/team/christine-berger/), elucidates, “Every lateral move I made as an associate attorney was in October. Q4 is a crucial time for law firms. Firms use this time to (1) close open positions that support their existing business and (2) hire new associates to support anticipated business in Q1. The need to be fully staffed entering the new year allows candidates to apply to new and current opportunities.”

- The Energy Dilemma: The Exhaustion vs. Opportunity Dynamic:
Balancing energy conservation and seizing potential opportunities often puts candidates in a quandary. “Candidates, especially those navigating through the lateral move terrain for the first time, frequently perceive the process as more taxing than it practically is,” notes [Christina Ahn](https://laterallink.com/team/christina-ahn/), [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) Senior Director. An initial dialogue with a recruiter, albeit amidst perceived lethargy, might not only reveal unforeseen opportunities but might also rekindle latent career motivations and energies.

In an era where meticulous and strategic career mapping becomes pivotal, it’s essential to critically examine the widespread practice of postponing lateral searches until the commencement of the new year. Engaging with recruitment specialists before the year folds might just unearth those bespoke opportunities, allowing legal professionals to carve a distinctive presence in a momentarily sparse candidate market.

Understanding and masterfully navigating the intersect between market demands, personal career aspirations, and strategic timing enables legal professionals to adeptly steer through the tangible and perceived boundaries of lateral career moves, ensuring their professional pathways are not inadvertently sequestered by the cyclical boundaries of the annual calendar.

# Bad Blood: Even More Red Flags That Were Simply Ignored
## Theranos had both in-house and outside lawyers teams. What went wrong?

I recently wrote [Bad Blood: A Story Of Numerous Red Flags That Were Simply Ignored](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/bad-blood-a-story-of-numerous-red-flags-that-were-simply-ignored/), where I discussed the three red flags: toxic culture, an authoritative CEO, and a veil of secrecy, that may have led to the downfall of Theranos. Of course, John Carreyrou’s book, [Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X), paints a more in-depth picture of these events, so I invited my readers to share their observations. Generally speaking, I received two sets of comments.

Looks can be very deceiving

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A number of readers pointed out that looks may be deceiving and that all professionals should analyze their investments (time, money, and energy) beyond good looks, perceived leadership qualities, charm, grooming, and being well-dressed. I particularly liked the comment from David Springhetti, a teacher from Wisconsin:

Your Above the Law piece entitled Bad Blood was succinct and insightful. Thank you. I agree the three fundamental elements cited, toxic culture, authoritative CEO, and veil of secrecy are fundamental to this kind of fraud.

I won’t explain it away by citing greed, because greed is systemic, integral as in the air we breathe. I speak reticently.

There is something inherit, vested about trusting a well-groomed professional, especially a woman, especially in the field of medicine, even in a competitive entrepreneurial environment. Elizabeth Holmes’s pictures on Wikipedia, Forbes, Vanity Fair, The Verge, Fortune, Business Insider, Chicago Tribune, Times, Wired, Inc, and numerous other reputable publications all depict a beautiful lady, appropriately groomed, and, as you stated, depicting the gaze of honesty and integrity. Her looks are disarming. How can she deceive when she looks so trustworthy?

I believe her charm and attractive appearance played a role in disarming the media, investors, and business community. Of course, charm and deception are equal opportunity. A man could have as easily been in her place.

What about all the in-house lawyers?!

Theranos had both in-house and outside lawyers teams. In fact, according to the book, the lawyers may have had an instrumental role in carrying out the deception, keeping employees in line, and preserving the status quo. A number of my readers have pointed this out to me. For example, Joseph Fuisz, a lawyer who works predominantly in the pharmaceutical industry as the founder of Fuisz Pharma LLC.:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I am not sure Theranos ever had an  impartial, highly trained counsel. It seems that their early in-house counsel were absurdly inexperienced. Then, their GC was placed by Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, which did not have a conventional firm-client relationship with the company. For example, the firm is known for taking fees in stock. The fraud, to the extent missed, was missed by counsel deliberately picked to fail. This is consistent with a larger management picture of a CEO-COO pair with a relationship, and the CEO’s brother’s role at the Company.

Joseph Fuisz disclosed that Theranos accused him and his father, Richard Fuisz, of stealing documents of a patent they were to file. A parallel case against McDermott, Will & Emery was dismissed by a judge in late 2014, stating there was no evidence of theft.

Other readers questioned to what extent the in-house team was empowered to identify and address the deception and fraud, especially in light of what seemed like complex board and leadership dynamics. For example, Randy Heinig, attorney and Managing Director at Risk Compliance Analytics, observed:

I agree with your assessment that Theranos suffered from a toxic culture, an authoritarian leader, and an overwhelming cult of secrecy. This clearly would limit the role and effectiveness of its in-house counsel team (who were probably heavily staffed with IP lawyers, who would not have been given a larger view of the legal and corporate elements of the business). These factors wouldn’t have given the in-house legal team much of a voice or even much knowledge of the affairs of the two senior leaders of the company.

But there is another factor in the mess — David Boies. Boies is the #3 villain in Carreyrou’s story and plays an outsized role in the legal operations and tone (including, but not limited to, the fact that he was also an investor), even before he takes a seat in the boardroom. When an external lawyer is such a big figure, and has the ear of a secretive and authoritarian CEO/Founder, it limits the voice and role of the inside legal team. This set of conflicts (described [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/david-boiess-fall-from-grace/) by ATL and [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/business/david-boies-pleads-not-guilty.html) by the NYTimes) gets even thornier with the fact that Theranos’s GC was a former Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP partner who went back to the firm after Theranos. In my opinion, Boies is the linchpin of the legal story for Theranos (even for the in-house team) and it isn’t particularly flattering.

Stroock & Stroock & Lavan will [soon be dissolving](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-to-dissolve-close-its-doors-after-nearly-150-years-in-business/), and many of its partners are headed to Hogan Lovells. The top-ranked Biglaw firm recently announced that a group of 28 partners will be joining its ranks in its New York, Washington, D.C., Miami, and Los Angeles offices.

Hogan Lovells issued a [press release](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/news/hogan-lovells-expands-in-new-york-washington-dc-miami-and-los-angeles-with-stroock-lateral-partners) detailing the new members of its partnership who hail from Stroock, and many of them held leadership roles at their former firm. As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/08/hogan-to-welcome-fewer-than-expected-stroock-partners-but-many-were-firm-leaders/), they include:

Jeff Keitelman has served as co-managing partner of Stroock and co-chair of its national real estate group; Christopher Doyle served as chair of Stroock’s corporate practice; Jeffrey Uffner served as chair of Stroock’s tax practice; [James] Bernard was head of Stroock’s general litigation practice group; Joseph Giminaro, head of Stroock’s tax certiorari practice; Richard Madris served as head of the infrastructure funds practice.

The full list of partners who will be joining Hogan Lovells is available [here](https://www.hoganlovells.com/-/media/project/english-site/media/pdf/2023_11_08_stroockpartnerbrief.pdf). More Stroock partners may decide to join the firm in the future, as many are still making decisions as to their career plans.

Hogan Lovells CEO [Miguel Zaldivar](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/miguel-zaldivar) offered a [warm welcome](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/news/hogan-lovells-expands-in-new-york-washington-dc-miami-and-los-angeles-with-stroock-lateral-partners) to the new partners. “We are extremely happy to welcome this group to Hogan Lovells. They are an exceptionally talented group of lawyers, who will help us to grow our practices in key areas including real estate, commercial litigation, and corporate and transactional work,” he said. “Adding this group from Stroock aligns with our focus on growing in strategic markets such as New York by bringing in high-performing lateral groups who recognize Hogan Lovells as a destination for talent.”

The group of former Stroock partners is expected to officially join Hogan Lovells on November 15.

# In Search Of People Who Provide Useful Career Advice And Are Generally Helpful To Lost Attorneys
## In the past, finding good advice was a time-consuming process. Now, with the miracle of the internet and social media ... it's still a challenge.

A common complaint I hear from law students, young lawyers, and even some midcareer lawyers is that it is very difficult to find people who provide good career advice.

When the seekers try to reach out, most of the time, they are ignored. Of the remainder of advisors who do respond, most simply give the generic, vague advice we’ve all heard before: work hard, network, and pray.

I have experienced this firsthand. While it is very frustrating, it is not personal. Most of the time, it is bad timing. Other times, the advisors simply cannot provide the specific help and guidance being sought.

Similarly, those who are contemplating starting their own practice or who have already done so also find it hard to connect with the right mentors. Sometimes, the mentors are too busy or their personalities do not match the personalities of the mentees.

In the past, making connections was time consuming and expensive. The only way to make connections was to go to bar association events or to conferences.

The good news is that today more resources are available where you can connect with people, even without leaving your home or office. On Facebook and LinkedIn, you can search for specialized groups that focus on your practice area or your geographic location. The ABA’s [SoloSez](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/gpsolo/resources/solosez/) listserv is a discussion forum for solo and small firm lawyers which is available to everyone, including those who are not ABA members. Also, the [Legal Mentor Network](https://www.legalmentornetwork.org/) is devoted to connecting attorneys with mentors working in top companies and law firms.

But despite these additional resources, many might still have difficulty connecting with the right people who can provide career guidance because they do not know whom to turn to.

Please reach out to me if you have any recommendations. For now, there are no specific rules other than being generally helpful. There are also no limitations on the number of people I will list.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# White House Ethics Waivers Look Pretty Unethical
## Doesn't mean they are unethical, but as usual, Trump put up a bad look.

The White House has granted 17 undated ethics waivers to members of senior staff. On the list are such stars as Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, as well as Don McGahn and six lawyers from Jones Day.

If potentially “retroactive” ethics waivers sounds like something that shouldn’t be a thing, you are not alone. From the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/us/politics/stephen-bannon-white-house-ethics-waivers.html?_r=1):

Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, who has been critical of the Trump administration’s approach to ethics, said that backdating was not an acceptable approach.

“The only retroactive waiver I have ever heard of is called a pardon,” Mr. Painter wrote in an email.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The waivers, the Times reports, allow aides to communicate with news organizations, even if they involve a “a former employer or former client.” That sounds like something directed at Bannon and his suspected continuing ties to Breitbart, but who can no for sure with this White House. Again, they didn’t even put a date on the waiver.

What we do know is that these waivers seem to frustrate Trump’s own “swamp draining” executive order that barred his appointees from doing what they are now allowed to do.

For the lawyers, the [Washington Post reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/31/white-house-grants-ethics-waivers-to-17-appointees-including-four-former-lobbyists/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_ethics-1045pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.e3e6f9f90e5b):

In addition, six members of the White House counsel’s office — including counsel Donald McGahn — were granted waivers to participate in matters in which their former law firm, Jones Day, is representing the president, his campaign committee or other related political entities.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with the waiver. You could argue that Jones Day lawyers, for instance, should be waived.

The problem, if there is one, is that you can’t make a waiver for an ethics violation after one has occurred. So the slipperiness of the timing of these waivers is cause for concern.

It’s another one of those Trump things where you don’t know if the sin is maliciousness or just incompetence. But whatever it is, it’s not “normal.”

# What's Behind The New Am Law 200 Numbers?

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

Growth in Biglaw was tepid over the last year. Gross revenue increased by 1.5%, compared to 4% for 2015. RPL grew by 1.8%, and PPP was up around 2%. However, both metrics were down significantly compared to their 2015 growth of 3.3% and 5.5%, respectively; and both outpaced inflation.

Continuing trends in both fiscal and employment growth reveal diverging paths between the Am Law 100 and Am Law 200 firms. PPP growth for Am Law 100 firms from 2014-2015 was 4.6%. The following year, growth remained steady at 4.4%. Meanwhile, growth at firms in the bottom half of the Am Law 200 stalled from 3.7% to 1% in just one year.

This phenomenon is not limited to PPP. It seems Am Law 100 firms are outpacing Am Law 200 firms by almost every metric. Headcount at Am Law 100 firms is growing at a much higher rate, with Am Law 100 firms reporting an increase of 2.39%, compared to just .015% for Am Law 200 firms.

Additionally, Am Law 100 firms have been more successful in growing their equity partner ranks. The number of equity partners grew by .66% for Am Law 100 firms, compared to a -.23% decrease in the number of equity partners for Am Law 200 firms.

This is not simply a case of the Am Law 100 poaching fiscal and headcount gains from Am Law 200 firms. Lateral Link conducted a random sample of 3,000 attorneys moving into Am Law 100 firms. This sample revealed only 11% of lateral moves into Am Law 100 firms are coming from Am Law 200 firms. In fact, 42% are coming from firms, companies, and government positions outside the Am Law 200, and 46% come from other Am Law 100 firms.

Am Law 100 firms also surpassed their smaller counterparts in almost every other financial metric as well.

PPL at Am Law 100 firms grew 3.47% over the last year, compared to .98% for Am Law 200 firms.

Gross revenue increased by 4.43% for Am Law 100 firms compared to 2% for Am Law 200 firms.

Lastly, a common misconception is that a higher Am Law rank denotes a better or more prestigious firm. While not true for all firms, many firms at the top of the Am Law 100 sacrifice profitability for volume. In fact, many of the most prestigious firms, including Irell and Munger, occupy slots in the bottom half of the Am Law 200.

We ran a single-variable regression of a firm’s 2016 Am Law rank vs. their PPP and the results revealed a measured correlation between the two variables. Am Law rank accounted for just 32% of the variation in PPP. If we segment the Am Law 200 even further into four discrete parts, we can see that the correlation between PPP and Am Law rank greatly differs based on a firm’s position in the ranking.

Correlation Between PPP and Am Law Rank

[](http://laterallink.com/gen/pppvsamlaw)

By adding more nuance to this regression lines, we can see that Am Law rank correlates positively with PPP for the top 20 firms before dropping precipitously for the next 60, and then it finally evens out for the rest of the firms.

Quintic Regression Of PPP vs. Am Law Rank

If Am Law rank alone is not impetus behind this growing dichotomy, what is?

Forty-six firms posted a negative PPP growth from 2015 to 2016. Twenty-five of those firms were Am Law 200 firms. Three of the top four losses in PPP came from firms in the bottom half of the Am Law 200, and Am Law 200 firms exhibited more volatility in their PPP growth rates compared to Am Law 100 firms.

A closer look at PPP growth rates reveals that much of the Am Law 100’s growth is being augmented by steady growth at Am Law 50 firms.

PPP Growth Rates vs. Am Law Rank

[](http://laterallink.com/gen/pppgrowth)

It is important to note that the system of dividing Biglaw into two discrete parts engenders a disparate continuum whereby successful firms on the precipice of each group can potentially harm or help the other group. Mostly though, this construct hurts Am Law 200 firms. If two Am Law 200 firms merge into an Am Law 100 firm, one firm displaces the “bubble” firm at the start of the Am Law 200, while the Am Law 100 gains the benefits of two combined firms metrics, for one spot. Similarly, some firms in the Am Law 100 may realize sharp drops in profitability that will drop them into the Am Law 200, potentially displacing growing and profitable firms at the top of the Am Law 200.

This growing schism challenges the definition of Biglaw as we know it. Superfirms like Dentons, Baker & McKenzie, and DLA Piper are continually redefining the limits of Biglaw expansion, while firms like Latham, Skadden, and Gibson Dunn are showing that size and high profit margins are not mutually exclusive.

The coronavirus crisis really threw the legal profession for a loop in 2020. Now that the new year is just around the corner, there finally seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to the austerity measures that were instituted due COVID-19’s economic upheaval. Now, one of the wealthiest firms to cut salaries is doing a complete about face when it comes to compensation.

Since March, Reed Smith — which raked in $1,246,926,000 in 2019 gross revenue, making it 26th on the Am Law 100 ranking — has announced not one, not two, not three, but FOUR rounds of salary reductions for partners, associates, and staff. First, the firm announced that [partner cash distributions would be slowed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-back-partner-compensation-amid-covid-19-economic-upheaval/) as a “precaution” to “brac[e] for the short-term and potential long-term economic impacts of COVID-19. A short time later, in mid April, the firm came for associate salaries, announcing [15 percent cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/reed-smith-salary-cuts/) that would last from May through the end of August. About two weeks later, the firm announced that [partner bonuses were being deferred](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/reed-smith-partners-taking-another-covid-19-financial-hit/) and split into separate payments (and the same would happen for staff discretionary bonuses). Then, on June 1, the firm announced that its salary cuts for associates would not only last through the end of the year, but they’d [increase to 20 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-firm-announces-even-deeper-austerity-cuts/). On top of that, staff earning more than $100,000 would take a 10 percent salary hit while other professionals would see reduced workweeks, [reduced salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-firm-announces-even-deeper-austerity-cuts/), and furloughs.

Back in August, Reed Smith walked back its salary cuts for some — but not all — those affected, as of September 1. On October 1, the firm further reduced those cuts for attorneys and eliminated them entirely for staff earning more than $100,000. Now, the firm has decided to do something that’s sure to make all of its associates, counsel, and partners as happy as can be.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sandy Thomas, Reed Smith’s global managing partner, has just announced that all salaries at the firm will be fully restored as of November 1. Here’s a statement:

Throughout the pandemic, the firm has been dedicated to protecting the health and safety of our people and supporting our clients around the globe. Because of the incredibly hard work, shared sacrifice and commitment of our people, we are pleased to announce that we are fully restoring compensation to the 100% level for all of our lawyers and professional staff.

This is exciting news for everyone at the firm. “As we move into 2021, we will continue to be vigilant in protecting the health and safety of our people, conducting our business prudently and providing exemplary service to our clients,” Thomas said.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# With Layoffs Lurking, Does Biglaw Pass The Vibe Check?

It’s one thing for a firm to see profits drop 3-5-6% coming off some really good years. But if you see partners losing 40-50% of their retirement savings or the values of their houses drop as a result of economic conditions, then you’re faced with a fundamentally different situation.

They start bringing unhappiness into the workplace, there’s a loosening of the bonds of firm loyalty, and you start to see some bad behavior.

You get a pervasive unease that’s not good in any working environment.

— [Allen Fagin](https://validityfinance.com/about/team/allen-fagin/), former chair of Proskauer Rose, who led the firm through the Great Recession, in comments given to [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/01/26/the-law-firm-disrupted-how-are-the-vibes/) on the what happens when the vibes get bad in Biglaw due to the state of the economy. Faced with pessimistic partners and associates living in fear of layoffs, Fagin said he sometimes felt like the firm’s “psychiatrist in chief.” Luckily, to our knowledge, the vibes in Biglaw aren’t anywhere near this bad… yet.

# Biglaw Associates Offered Work/Life Balance Perks That Go Unused
## Are lawyers afraid that they'll be penalized in the future if they take advantage of these reduced-hours policies?

More and more Biglaw firms are offering associates unique perks geared toward improving their work/life balance, like the [ability to work remotely](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/telecommuting/), work for reduced hours, work on flexible time schedules, and more. But how many associates are actually taking advantage of the progressive offerings their firms have laid out on the table? According to the Diversity & Flexibility Alliance, the answer, quite shockingly, is “not many.”

In its Law Firm Flexibility Benchmarking Survey, 28 Biglaw firms were asked about the availability and usage of their flexible work policies. The Alliance found that while just about all of them (26) had formal flex-time policies offering reduced hours, flexible start-and-end schedules, and telecommuting options, just 8.8 percent of lawyers at those firms were working on reduced schedules. Here are some [highlights](http://dfalliance.com/survey-trends-law-firm-flexibility/) from the survey:

– Lawyers of color and LGBT lawyers remain underrepresented among reduced hours lawyers. While the share of lawyers of color and LGBT lawyers who work flexibly increased slightly from last year, both groups are still underrepresented among reduced hours lawyers (13 percent of reduced hours lawyers are attorneys of color and 1.1 percent are LGBT).

– Gender-Neutral Leave policies are becoming more common, however most firms still have a primary and secondary caregiver designation. Eighty-seven percent of the participating firms that have a gender-neutral leave policy include a primary and secondary caregiver designation and tier the amount of leave accordingly. The Alliance recommends that organizations remove the primary and secondary caregiver designation because it represents an antiquated view of family caregiving roles.

– While there has been an increase in firms with flex attorneys in leadership positions, flex schedules are more common among non-partnership track attorneys. Forty-three percent of participating firms have reduced hours attorneys in leadership roles including Chairs, Managing Partners, Department Chairs, and Office Heads. Yet, while 31.3 percent of Of Counsel attorneys have flex schedules, only 1.2 percent of Equity Partners have such schedules on a formal basis.

– Women constitute the largest share of reduced hours lawyers, yet continue to be underrepresented overall. Thirty-six percent of all attorneys are women, while sixty-eight percent of reduced hours attorneys are women.

This makes us wonder why associates aren’t using the perks that have been made available to them. Are they afraid that they’ll be penalized in the future — either vis-à-vis their paychecks or partnership prospects — if they take advantage of these reduced-hours policies? [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/law-firms-promote-flexible-work-arrangements-lawyers-dont-use/) reports on the firms that are treating lawyers fairly by giving them promotions and leadership opportunities, despite their flex-time arrangements:

Fourteen of the participating firms promoted at least one lawyer working a reduced schedule to partner in 2015, which is double than the previous year. Reduced hours lawyers are also represented among firm leadership in 12 of the 28 firms, including three chairs or managing partners, 11 department chairs or practice group leaders, and four office heads, the alliance found.

We’re curious as to why associates who crave better work/life balance aren’t opting in to take the fullest advantage of their firms’ flex-time programs. Is the fear of retribution really that bad? [Email us](mailto:staci@abovethelaw.com) and let us know why you aren’t using your firm’s flex-time policies. We may have more on this in the future if we receive enough responses.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2021/)Earlier this month, in partnership with our friends at [Lake Whillans](https://lakewhillans.com/), we released our [Outside Counsel rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2021/), a look at the Biglaw firms most trusted by corporate legal departments. Today, we look at the firms that were rated highest by in-house attorneys based on the industries in which they practice.

Drawing on input from GCs and in-house counsel from a range of business categories, we’ve compiled rankings for eight different industries: Consumer Products, Telecommunications, Energy, Defense, Media/Entertainment, Life Sciences/Healthcare, Finance, and Technology.

Thirteen firms appear on more than one of our industry lists; these three firms below show up on three or more:

- Kirkland & Ellis (Finance, Energy, Defense)
- Latham & Watkins (Energy, Finance, Consumer Products, Telecommunications)
- Gibson Dunn (Energy, Defense, Healthcare, Consumer Products, Media)
Once again — and consistent with our survey results last year — Gibson Dunn displays impressive range across five specialties. Congratulations to all the firms recognized.

# Biglaw Partner Fed Gruel, Prepares For White Walkers, To Understand Associate Life

[David S. Cohen](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/people/david-cohen) is a partner at WilmerHale and a former deputy director at the CIA. It would appear he’s lived a full, rich, and exciting life.

But his 15 minutes of fame started Sunday. Here’s a tweet from the CIA (which I didn’t know was ON Twitter even though I assumed they SPY ON everything anybody says on Twitter):

A perk of working for CIA is world travel. Apparently that sometimes extends to other realms…

“Little birds,” be on the lookout for a former deputy director of ours wandering through [#Westeros](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Westeros?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) in tonight’s episode of [#GameOfThrones](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameOfThrones?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). [pic.twitter.com/DBIzIFKoju](https://t.co/DBIzIFKoju)

— CIA (@CIA) [April 22, 2019](https://twitter.com/CIA/status/1120123885771476992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

[American Lawyer reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/22/its-wilmer-vs-white-walkers-as-big-law-partner-makes-game-of-thrones-cameo/) that Cohen is the brother-in-law of Game of Thrones showrunner David Benioff.

Nepotism is such a big part of Game of Thrones, I’m not at all surprised it worked to score a cameo. People are constantly being thrust into ridiculous situations simply because they’re related to some person who is actually important.

But Cohen also seems to have understood another important lesson from the show:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Cohen and his family were visiting Benioff over Thanksgiving in 2017 in Belfast, where the final season of the show was being filmed, he said. Cohen and his niece asked if they could be in the show and the pair then ventured out to Winterfell castle, located about an hour north of the city.

“We went out there and got our costumes and makeup and hair all done—and then spent six hours freezing because it was really cold,” Cohen said. “Winter had really come to Northern Ireland.”

Dude, if you volunteer to go to the Wall, somebody is going to send your ass to the Wall. And it’s going to be cold, and you’re going to have to wear an uncomfortable-looking pelt, and if you’re very lucky, Tormund Giantsbane won’t try to have sex with you.

Oh, I’m just making fun of Cohen because I’m extremely jealous. Watching Grey Worm and Missandei this season, I would so love to be the “other” black person in Winterfell. Maybe the black guy who has been there all along and then these two other black people show up and I act like we’ve been friends forever and then I could have one line: “Take me with you.”

I doubt Cohen’s character survives the next episode. The CIA ain’t got nothing on the Night King.

I did you a favor.  I read the entirety of William Baude and Michael Paulsen’s forthcoming [126-page magnum opus](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4532751) that will be published in “The University of Pennsylvania Law Review.” Now, you don’t have to read the thing (unless you’re a glutton for punishment).
As you probably already know, Baude and Paulsen argue that Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids former officeholders who engaged in insurrection or rebellion from again holding office. Baude and Paulsen assert that this provision is unambiguous and self-executing, that Donald Trump engaged in insurrection or rebellion, and that Trump is thus disqualified from again holding the presidency. Baude and Paulsen are conservative thinkers, and they base their argument on a conservative — originalist — view of the Constitution. Their argument should appeal both to liberals (because it disqualifies Trump from running again) and to conservatives (because it’s based on a textual interpretation of the Constitution).

Baude and Paulsen have been cheered by some, including Professor Laurence Tribe, who is a renowned liberal, and former judge Michael Luttig, who is a renowned conservative. Tribe and Luttig jointly supported Baude and Paulsen’s thesis in a piece in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trump-constitutionally-prohibited-presidency/675048/).

Baude and Paulsen have been criticized by others, including Harvard Professor Noah Feldman, who published an opinion column in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/20/14th-amendment-doesn-t-bar-trump-from-presidency-alas/b36a93e8-3f54-11ee-9677-53cc50eb3f77_story.html).

I’m not here to criticize any of these folks. To the contrary: These are extraordinarily smart people, up and down the line, and they all have intelligent things to say.

I’m just going to draw the perhaps obvious conclusion from this debate: Baude and Paulsen have opened Pandora’s Box. It’s hard to say where we go from here.

Each of our 50 states has created some system to decide whose name can properly appear on a ballot in either a primary or a general election. In some places, the secretary of state controls this decision; in other places, it’s some other election official. In some states, litigation about whether a person’s name has been properly included or excluded can be filed in state court; in other states, those challenges would be made in federal court. I have neither the ability nor the word count to discuss all of those variables in this short column.

But within the next couple of months, election officials will have to decide whether Trump’s name can appear on a ballot. Some election officials in deep red states will presumably decide that Trump’s name belongs on the ballot.  Democratic voters will then sue.

Some election officials in bright blue states will presumably decide that Trump’s name does not belong on the ballot. Trump will then sue.

At least one voter has jump-started this process and [filed a lawsuit](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/attorney-sues-trump-claims-he-is-constitutionally-ineligible-for-presidency/ar-AA1fMSt9) for a declaratory judgment that Trump’s name cannot appear on the Florida ballot.

The judicial system will have to move at breakneck speed: These lawsuits must start in trial courts, move up through appellate courts, and ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court before early voting starts in next year’s presidential election. (Arguably, the Supreme Court must decide even before that, to avoid the prejudice caused by primary voters considering a candidate who’s not eligible to serve as president.)

The outcome in the Supreme Court is by no means preordained. First, many justices believe their first duty is to the law, not to a political party, and those justices will try to render a ruling that is correct, whatever the consequences. You may consider that a naive point of view. If so, consider that, second, although the current Supreme Court is conservative, it is not MAGA conservative. For example, Chief Justice John Roberts, who was appointed by Bush 43, surely holds long-standing conservative positions, but he’s probably no supporter of Trump’s. If Roberts were ruling on the basis of politics, rather than law, Roberts might prefer that Trump not be able to run again for president. This might let the Republican Party return to its traditional form. No one can know, with certainty, how the Supreme Court will rule on the issue that Baude and Paulsen have identified.

Two things, however, are certain: First, Baude and Paulsen have raised a legitimate issue that ought to be decided by the courts. Now that they’ve identified that issue, the issue will be put to use by folks who want to keep Trump’s name off the ballot. The litigation over this issue in the next 15 months may not be as captivating as Trump criminal trials, but it’s actually more likely to influence the result of the election.

Second, if Baude and Paulsen’s argument succeeds, it doesn’t succeed only to keep Trump’s name off the 2024 presidential ballot. In the short term, the issue will be used to try to keep the names of other people who supported the January 6 rioters — perhaps Sen. Ted Cruz or Sen. Josh Hawley, perhaps other officials hidden deeper within levels of  government — off the ballot. In the long term, the issue will, of course, also be used against Democrats, as Republicans seek to keep the names of candidates they oppose off the ballot. And, in those later cases, Republicans will file their ballot challenges in deep red states, ensuring litigation before deep red judges, to increase the likelihood of the challenges succeeding.

That’s the nature of Pandora’s Box:  It’s easy to open.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The IPO market has been incredibly challenged. The technology deals completed in September did not usher in a wave of other transactions, and market conditions are generally viewed as unfavorable at present.

In some instances, we are seeing a resetting of valuation expectations and with that, more discussions about moving forward with deals than any time over the past 18 months. In many other cases, boards and management teams have opted to remain on the sidelines, focusing on their businesses for the remainder of the year while leaving optionality for IPOs in the second half of 2024.

— [Michael Nordtvedt](https://www.wsgr.com/en/people/michael-nordtvedt.html), co-leader of Wilson Sonsini’s capital markets practice, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/13/deal-watch-ipos-not-coming-back-in-2023/) on the state of the IPO market in 2023. “Hopefully, we will see the beginning of a return to a more normal market next year,” Nordtvedt said.

# Am Law 100 Firm's Furloughs Have Turned Into Layoffs
## But at least the firm is rolling back its salary cuts.

Biglaw firms are reversing their austerity measures in droves, and salary cut reductions now definitely trending among Biglaw firms. (We’ve been tracking the actions of those firms [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/the-great-salary-cut-rollback-tracker-where-does-your-law-firm-stand/).) Unfortunately, another thing that’s now trending is the good news/bad news announcement in relation to salary cut reversals. This one follows in the wake of [Baker McKenzie’s surprise news](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/baker-mckenzie-layoffs/) on salaries and layoffs.

Back in April, Davis Wright Tremaine — a firm that came in 92nd place in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, with $414,144,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — announced [across-the-board salary cuts and employee furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-some-slashes-salaries-for-all/). These cost-cutting measures ranged from from reduced partner distributions and salary cuts for associates and staff to furloughs and reduced schedules for staff. Now, thanks to a better than expected financial performance, many of those cuts are being dialed back.

Jeff Gray, Davis Wright’s managing partner, released the details in statement:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Despite the challenges of the past six months, our financial performance to date has exceeded expectations. Due to our focus on serving clients, developing new work, and managing billing and collections, we expect to finish the year better than we had previously modeled. As a result, effective today, we will be bringing back a number of our furloughed staff members and restoring 50% of the salary reductions we made in May. In addition, for equity partners, we will increase the third quarter distribution and are optimistic we’ll be able to do the same for the fourth quarter.

But wait, before you get too excited, Gray’s statement has a much more depressing second paragraph. This is where he mentions that people are about to lose their jobs:

However, we also have made the difficult decision to lay off some of the staff who had been furloughed, not knowing when, if ever, their previous work will return. This is the result of a fundamental shift in how we expect to operate and support our clients and lawyers going forward and not a cost-cutting measure. Those impacted will receive separation packages beyond what we normally provide, including increased severance payments, additional outplacement and coaching support, continued access to our Employee Disaster Relief Fund, and coverage of medical premiums through the end of the year for those on our plan.

If you recall, DWT’s Employee Disaster Relief Fund provides monetary relief to staff members who have suffered financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. These staff members will definitely be suffering after having been laid off, so at least the firm is offering them this last act of kindness as they’re forced out the door.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Senator Kamala Harris

Over the last week, while listening to the Senate testimony of Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions, I had to stop myself from yelling at the television multiple times. Most of the time I was yelling, “You didn’t scold the male senator who just did that!” or something along those lines. I realized that I was most annoyed every time the committee chair, often at the prompting of another male senator, admonished Senator Kamala Harris for the manner and substance of her questions.

Today the Washington Post, along with several other news outlets, noted the disparate treatment of Harris, as opposed to other male senators who were as aggressive with their questions, yet allowed to proceed without a [scolding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/14/as-a-prosecutor-kamala-d-harris-doggedness-was-praised-now-shes-hysterical/?utm_term=.94ac1610f499).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Harris, a career prosecutor before she came to Washington, D.C., is accustomed to conducting tough cross-examination of witnesses. The questions she posed to Rosenstein and Sessions, as well as the way she posed those questions and pursued answers, should be all too familiar to any experienced trial attorney. Yet, as the Washington Post noted, she was criticized by several commentators, one of whom even described her inquiries as ‘hysterical.” The way Harris was repeatedly slapped down by the committee chair during these hearings was reminiscent of Mitch McConnell’s censure of Senator Elizabeth Warren earlier this year (“Nevertheless, she persisted.”). Harris, like Warren, was simply trying to do the job she was elected to do by her constituents, yet her male peers in the Senate seem to think that she should do that job less aggressively and perhaps a bit more delicately than her male peers.

This seems like a new and awful pattern to the world watching the news these days. It is shocking and outrageous to many political commentators and the general public alike. And, like most hot-button political issues these days, it is viewed in exactly the opposite way by liberals versus conservatives.

This is not, however, new to any professional woman, particularly female attorneys. This is often our reality. While women are slowly increasing their ranks in leadership roles in law firms and leadership positions in the legal profession, the numbers are still much too low. The 2015 Law Firm Diversity Benchmarking Report issued by the New York City Bar Association reported that [1 in 4 law firms had no women](http://documents.nycbar.org/files/NYC_Bar_2015_Diversity_Benchmarking_Report.pdf) on their management committees and 1 in 8 firms had no women as practice group heads, among other deficiencies.

The lack of women in leadership positions, in law firms and in other areas of our profession, is one of the major reasons why women, no matter how experienced, talented, well regarded, and just plain excellent at what they do, are either not taken seriously by their male peers, jurists and other leaders or disregarded altogether, particularly in settings where they are the only woman in the room.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I had this highlighted for me every day during a three-month- long trial two summers ago. I was defending my client with my female associate as my second chair, along with three male attorneys and one other female attorney representing each of the other four co-defendants. Our judge was male and the two prosecutors we were up against were male. The whole trial was contentious and hard-fought, yet the women would get cut off by the judge more often, and I, in particular, would have the toughest time getting the judge to allow me to advocate for my client. Several times, an issue I raised and had disregarded by the judge was then seriously considered when raised by one of my male colleagues. The male attorneys were allowed to ramble on during cross-examination, while the other female attorney and I were often interrupted, cut off, and rushed by the judge.

After a while, the group caught on, and for issues that we all agreed upon, we would nominate someone the judge would actually listen to, which was always one of the males. When I had to advocate for my client on an issue solely pertaining to him, more than once I had other lawyers who had been watching in the audience come up to me after and comment on how hard the judge was on me and how impressed they were that I was able to stay calm and gracious, yet still aggressively advocate for my client despite the judge.

I have lost count of the number of times that I have been the only female attorney in a courtroom, at a hearing, trial, or even a deposition. I have lost count of the number of times that I have been asked “Are you an attorney?” or “Are you the court reporter?” Until they realize that it will not do any good or stop me in my tracks, many of my male adversaries will interrupt me, inappropriately object to my questions, talk over me to a judge, or otherwise just generally try to shush or shoo me away. They do all that until they see that it will not stop me, that I persist and that I often win.

Unfortunately, like Kamala Harris, so many female attorneys have to deal with male peers, superiors, and jurists who shut them down before they get the answer to the perfectly legitimate questions they pose or raise the points they want to address. There is only one way to overcome this. Female attorneys must continue to advocate hard. We cannot wait until we are allowed to have our say. The ethical mandate of zealous advocacy requires us to keep pushing until we are heard. We also have to keep pushing for those seats at the leadership table. They will not be handed to us. We just have to take them. Then we cannot be simply shut down. Simply put, we nevertheless must persist.

# Biglaw Partner Learns You Shouldn't Call Opposing Counsel A 'F**king Piece Of Sh*t Worthless Human' In Court
## The judge wasn't pleased, but declined to impose sanctions.

It’s really not a good look when a federal judge calls your behavior “unacceptable, deplorable.” But that’s exactly what happened to Taylor English partner [Nathan A. White](https://www.taylorenglish.com/person/nathan-white/) who was benchslapped by federal Judge Max O. Cogburn Jr. over his interaction with opposing counsel L. Michelle Gessner.

Gessner [filed a motion](https://www.abajournal.com/files/GassnerProtOrdMot.pdf) seeking sanctions for the way White treated her. As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sanctions-motion-claims-taylor-english-partner-used-f-word-while-calling-opponent-a-worthless-human) the ABA Journal, Gessner described a disturbing courtroom confrontation on February 28th, after jurors for the first phase of the trial were dismissed and court was in recess:

“Suddenly, and without warning or provocation,” White spoke to Gessner “very loudly and in a condescending tone,” asking her whether she was aware which defendants were represented by Dancy, the sanctions motion says. After Gessner responded that she was aware, White “exploded” and began yelling, the motion says.

“You are a f- – -ing piece of s- – – worthless human!” White allegedly said. “You know that?! You are a worthless human!”

Gessner said she responded that White doesn’t get to speak to her like that, and if he can’t speak to her with respect, he should not say anything at all.

Gessner left to gather her belongings from the attorney room and then returned to the courtroom. She asked the court clerk and the court reporter whether there was an audio or video recording of what had happened. Gessner said White was an officer of the court, and his behavior was unacceptable, according to the motion.

“At this point, Mr. White rushed up to Ms. Gessner and got within inches of her face, pointing his finger, close enough to strike her,” the motion says. He allegedly screamed, “I don’t care if it was recorded, you are a worthless f- – -ing piece of s- – -! You called me a liar yesterday!”

Gessner said she stood her ground.

Judge Cogburn [found](https://www.abajournal.com/files/CogburnOrder.pdf) White “did, in fact, use vulgar language against Ms. Gessner, approached her in an antagonistic manner, and otherwise acted towards Ms. Gessner in the manner she described in her motion.” And it is “undisputable” that White “engaged in multiple types of inexcusable professional misconduct by verbally attacking opposing counsel in the courtroom and in the presence of court staff and the court security officer.” Meanwhile Gessner, “at all times acted professionally during the verbal altercation.”

Congburn wrote, “Behavior such as this is unacceptable, deplorable, and not justified under any circumstances.”

White said he’d recently been admitted to the hospital for a medical issue and was stressed at the time of the incident.

Cogburn admonished White, writing, “His conduct was unprofessional, egregious, and unacceptable for an officer of the court.” But Judge Cogburn declined to impose sanctions, saying, “The court trusts that Mr. White’s conduct was an anomaly and therefore will not take further action today.”

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We managed expenses and head count reduction. When I look back at 2023, some of those decisions were difficult, but they paid off at the end of the year. We bent the curve on cost and delivered some excellent results for our partners.

— [Bill Malley](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/william-g-malley.html), managing partner of Perkins Coie, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/18/in-year-of-difficult-decisions-perkins-coie-grows-revenue-4-and-pep-7-6/) on the firm’s financial performance in 2023. The firm’s revenue rose to an an all-time high of $1.21 billion, and profits per equity partner climbed by 7.6%, to $1.6 million. Perkins Coie [conducted staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/perkins-coie-staff-layoffs/) in February, while [deferring associate start dates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/perkins-coie-is-the-next-firm-to-defer-incoming-associates/) (save for incoming IP associates) from fall 2023 to January 2024. “We were strong across regulatory and litigation of all kinds, but especially IP,” Malley continued. “We had more patent litigation cases than ever before, and we kept winning. We have invested in and built a premier IP practice.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Why Lawyers Fear Seeing Therapists, And Why We Should Do It Anyway
## Seeing a therapist is to acknowledge that you are human.

As mentioned [earlier today](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/some-law-firms-try-to-eliminate-stigma-from-attorneys-struggling-with-mental-health-issues/) by my colleague Staci Zaretsky, Sara Randazzo of the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/law-firms-finally-say-its-ok-to-see-a-therapist-1495381847) wrote an article reporting that “[s]ome U.S. law firms are tackling mental-health issues head-on. They’re offering on-site psychologists, training staff to spot problems and incorporating mental-health support alongside other wellness initiatives.”

Hooray for the law firms that are finally recognizing that lawyers are not robots. Lawyers are of course humans and we have emotions, feelings (yes, for real), mind, and body.

Thanks to the work of many, including Patrick Krill, we know that [lawyers are suffering](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/can-we-finally-talk-about-the-elephant-in-the-room-mental-health-of-lawyers/) from stress, anxiety, depression, and alcohol/substance abuse. Yet, little has been done to address these issues. The “solution” for many law firms seems to be denial. Let’s pretend that these numbers don’t apply to our lawyers. Let’s pretend that mental-health issues can be cured by paying a high enough salary and bonuses.

If you happen to be part of the 28% of the lawyer population struggling with depression, then you’re stigmatized — the depression seen as a personal failing. If you’re part of the 20.6% that screen positive for harmful alcohol-dependent drinking, then just QUIT drinking! If you’re part of the 19% and 23% that are struggling with anxiety and stress, well, quit whining. Just work harder! Bill that extra 0.1 hour.

I found Dentons global chairman Joseph Andrew’s view on what it means to see a therapist to be interesting. He said that while he applauded Hogan & Lovells for having an on-site psychologist, the fear of offering such a service is that “our competitors will say we have crazy lawyers.”

So, let’s review. Everyone knows there’s a 6 ton elephant sitting in the room — lawyers struggle with a disproportionately high levels of stress/anxiety, depression, and substance/alcohol abuse. This information isn’t a secret. EVERYONE knows it. Likely, including the clients. Yet, law firms aren’t willing to address the problem because they fear their clients will think the lawyers are “crazy.”

Setting aside the obvious point for a moment that depression and substance/alcohol problems do not make you “crazy” and that these are very treatable issues, it is precisely these types of stereotypes and stigmas that keep the lawyers in the vicious cycle of mental illness.

I’ve talked to so many lawyers who are suffering from various issues — insomnia, burnout, depression, stress/anxiety — but they fear by getting help because they will be seen as weak, seen as not effective, seen as a “failure,” or seen as “crazy,” so they don’t get the help they need. Of course, the problems then become worse over time, which only intensifies the fear of seeking help. So, the cycle continues, on and on.

It’s not unusual for lawyers to pay for therapy and other help out of pocket (and not bill it through the firm’s insurance) because even though it’s confidential, they still fear being found out.

Wellness isn’t just about having lack of illness. According to the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/en/), mental health is defined as a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.

As a law firm, don’t you want everyone to have mental, emotional, and physical health? Don’t you want to have productive members on your team? Is it really possible to have a firm that is servicing the clients optimally when a third of your workforce is struggling with mental-health issues?

Last year, at [Shape the Law Unconference](http://shapethelaw.com), we specifically addressed the issue of wellness. During one breakout session, one attorney shyly mentioned she sees a therapist weekly as part of her well-being strategy. There were perhaps 40 other attorneys in that session and approximately half also admitted they too see a therapist. We engaged in a fruitful conversations about the many benefits that comes from therapy and also the stigma attached to seeing a therapist.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
My fellow columnist and friend, Will Meyerhofer, former lawyer turned therapist, writes about therapy over on this blog, [The People’s Therapist](https://thepeoplestherapist.com/).

Over the years, I’ve met with therapists who practice various modalities. Cognitive behavioral therapists, somatic therapy, psychotherapy, mindfulness, psychiatry, in both individual and group settings.

Sometimes, I sought out a therapist because I was in crisis, and other times, I met with a therapist because I simply wanted to be more productive, and be my best self.

Seeing a therapist is to acknowledge that you are human and as humans, subject to human experiences. This includes a full set of emotions, feelings, and yes, sometimes, mental-health issues.

It doesn’t make you weak. It doesn’t mean you’ve failed as a lawyer or are “crazy.” It doesn’t mean you should leave the profession. It simply makes you human.

If you were experiencing chest pain, you’d go see a doctor, right? Similarly, you should go see a therapist when life feels overwhelming or you’d simply like more (or better) tools in your toolbox.

Therapy has allowed me to see that the things I struggle with aren’t unique to me. It’s part of being human. It’s given me tools for being a better communicator, a better problem solver, and being better at managing difficult emotions and conflicts. It’s taught me to be gentler with myself. It has helped me to pay attention to my own well-being.

# Two Of Biglaw's Best Contribute To Massive Spike In Commercial Bankruptcy Filings

While many were busy celebrating their loved ones in February, attorneys at two of the country’s most prestigious law firms were busy with… bankruptcy filings.

According to a new report from Epiq Bankruptcy and the American Bankruptcy Institute, commercial Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings increased by 118% in February 2024 over February 2023, and by 77% over January 2024’s filings. Which law firms were behind the colossal increase?

That would be Weil Gotshal and Kirkland & Ellis, which started and ended the month with major cases. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/05/kirkland-weil-contribute-to-118-uptick-in-commercial-chapter-11-filings/) has the details:

At the beginning of the month, Miami-based primary care provider Cano Health filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with $1.2 billion in assets and roughly $1.5 billion in liabilities.

Represented by Weil, Cano went public in a 2020 SPAC deal valued at $4.4 billion. Weil advised Cano on corporate matters and shareholder activist issues before the company hit financial turmoil, court records indicate, at which point Weil began advising Cano on restructuring matters. The firm received around $9 million from Cano during the 90 days before the filing and maintained a credit balance of $4.2 million at the time of filing. …

At the end of the month, Kirkland filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on behalf of 241 companies under the jointly administered bankruptcy of Thrasio Holdings, a third-party seller on Amazon. Thrasio filed with between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and $500 million to $1 billion in liabilities.

Together, the firms took on about 300 of last month’s Chapter 11 filings in jointly administered bankruptcies. Congratulations to Weil and Kirkland on all of their success.

Last week, Vault released the [2019 edition](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2019/) of its closely watched law firm rankings, proving that money — in the form of Cravath’s perennially competitive pay scale — can buy prestige.

But can that money buy happiness?

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to their overall quality of life, including satisfaction, firm culture, compensation, hours, selectivity, lateral/clerk integration, associate/partner relations, formal training, informal training and mentoring, pro bono, quality of work, business outlook, career outlook, and transparency. This may be surprising for some, but almost none of the firms that made the Top 10 list for being the most prestigious made the Top 10 list for being the best firms to work for.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Why’s that? “Prestige and compensation will always be important for law firms, but a stellar work environment is becoming non-negotiable for many attorneys,” said Matt Moody, Vault’s Senior Law Editor. “The modern workforce is much more focused on work/life balance, transparent communication, and inclusive cultures, and the legal industry is not immune from this trend.”

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms to Work For](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-to-work-for/?sRankID=27) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2019:

- [O’Melveny & Myers](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/omelveny-myers-llp/company-overview.aspx) (+2)
- [Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/fried,-frank,-harris,-shriver-jacobson-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Clifford Chance](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/clifford-chance-us-llp/company-overview.aspx) (not ranked; first time in Top 10)
- [Paul Hastings](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/paul-hastings-llp/company-overview.aspx) (-3)
- [White & Case](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/white-case-llp/company-overview.aspx) (not ranked; first time in Top 10)
- [Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/orrick,-herrington-sutcliffe-llp/company-overview.aspx) (-2)
- [Thompson & Knight](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/thompson-knight-llp/company-overview.aspx) (+1)

- [Crowell & Moring](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/crowell-moring-llp/company-overview.aspx) (not ranked; first time in Top 10)
- [Latham & Watkins](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/latham-watkins-llp/company-overview.aspx) (+9)
Latham is the only law firm that made it into the Top 10 on both of Vault’s rankings. Kudos on keeping your own associates so incredibly happy.

# This Biglaw Firm's Largest Office Is Virtual -- And It Helped Bolster A Fantastic Financial Performance
## Maybe your Am Law 100 firm should consider opening a remote office.

As Biglaw firms beckon attorneys with hybrid work policies that come complete with strong suggestions that employees physically go to the office — sometimes under threat of bonus reductions — one firm has embraced remote work to the point where its largest office is now virtual.

Husch Blackwell had an incredibly strong performance in 2022, increasing its gross revenue by about 17% to $555,836,000, landing at No. 81 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. During a time when so many firms struggled, Husch was also able to improve upon its revenue per lawyer, head count, and net income. How did that happen?

The firm’s growth can largely be attributed to its remote office, better known as “The Link.” We’ve previously discussed the firm’s [“work-from-anywhere” office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-100-firm-launches-work-from-anywhere-virtual-office/) when it first launched in 2020, and at that time, about 40 lawyers were working in the firm’s remote environment. Now, Husch’s Link has grown to epic proportions. [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/husch-blackwells-biggest-office-is-virtual-bucking-big-law) has the details:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Launched in 2020, it now includes more lawyers than any of the firm’s 21 physical offices. It’s dubbed “The Link,” and next week it will hit 200 lawyers working from homes in 28 states and Washington, D.C.

While other firms pressure lawyers to return to office—or risk portions of their bonus—Husch Blackwell has gone all-in on the remote work model. The firm says it’s proving to be a differentiator.

It’s helped recruit lawyers from firms that were less accommodating, allowed the firm to retain lawyers whose lives benefited from staying at home with young families, and it’s bringing the firm more work from clients in cities that previously would have required an expensive office roll-out.

“We’ve brought scores of talented and high-power people to our law firm who wouldn’t be at Husch Blackwell if we didn’t have The Link to offer them,” J.Y. Miller, The Link’s managing partner, told Bloomberg.

What would your firm’s finances look like if a virtual office existed? What would your firm’s recruiting picture look like if a virtual office were involved? How many more talented attorneys would your firm have been able to retain if it were possible for them to continuing working remotely, without worries about heading to an office?

These may be things for law firm leaders to consider going into the future as economic headwinds blow in the direction of a possible recession.

Memorial Day is rapidly approaching — I know I’ve mentally checked out of this week in anticipation of the long weekend already. And with summer’s arrival, Biglaw firms are increasingly ironing out the details for their return to the office.

The latest Biglaw firm to announce their reopening plan is Weil Gotshal, a firm that took in $1,657,603,000 in gross revenue last year, making it #17 on the Am Law 100 ranking. The firm’s memo on reopening emphasizes that it’s a gradual process to a full reopening, but ready or not, the process will start next week, on June 1st.

In the U.S., full return to the office will be after Labor Day, on Tuesday September 7th. But the New York, Boston, D.C., Miami, Dallas, and Houston offices will be opened at 100 percent capacity beginning in June. The Silicon Valley office will be at 25 percent capacity on June 1, with the intent to be at 100 percent capacity (consistent with local rules) on June 15th. Although office attendance isn’t strictly required throughout the summer, the firm “encourage[s] people to return to the office on some basis, as it is part of the return to the new normal.”

As for those coming back to in-person Biglaw life, the firm has made it clear, they should get themselves vaccinated, saying, “it is our expectation that all Weil employees will be vaccinated against Covid-19, barring any religious or medical proscriptions to vaccination.” In what Above the Law believes is a first in Biglaw, vaccinated employees are also expected to self-report their vaccination status. As for the unvaxxed, they may have to undergo COVID testing (just [like at Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/skadden-reopening-plan/)):

As a reminder, everyone who has been fully vaccinated – meaning that they have waited the requisite amount of time following their final dose of vaccine – should send their proper CDC card verifying vaccination to [redacted]@weil.com. Please bear in mind that everyone will be required to self-report their vaccination status prior to the full return and that, thereafter, unvaccinated individuals may be required to undergo periodic testing for Covid-19.

As we’ve noted, the firm has stressed that returning to the office is a gradual process, and has put a lot of emphasis on being comfortable in the new normal:

We recognize and understand that some people may have anxiety or apprehension surrounding the full return to the office, as was the case at the start of the pandemic when we were all transitioning to working remotely for the first time. Just as was true then, we will adjust back to this new normal together, as has always been the case with the Weil family. As Barry has said in his weekly communications, during this period of voluntary return, we continue to encourage people to go into the office on some basis to regain a comfort level prior to the full return. And we understand that further questions will arise for people as we move closer to September, so please bear in mind that this is certainly not the final communication from the Task Force. We continue to work on the policies that will govern our full return to the office, and everyone will know the protocols that are being put in place by the Firm and the expectations that Weil will have of its people well prior to that time.

But ATL tipsters have expressed concern that those who aren’t yet okay with coming back to the office — or who have structural issues that prevent them from doing so, such as location or child care issues — will be at a disadvantage compared with peers who are able to go back to the office immediately. Walking that hybrid line, particularly in the short term, will be a tricky matter.

The firm has also committed to making virtual work a feature going forward, though the specifics of a work-from-home policy have yet to be hammered out:

Additionally, our remote working policies are being revised and will be more liberal for both lawyers and administrative staff than prior to the pandemic.

It was just this afternoon that we once again sounded the warning that the [layoffs were coming](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/be-prepared-because-more-biglaw-layoffs-are-coming/) during the third quarter thanks to the pandemic.

Lo and behold, here they are.

Today, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner co-chairs Steve Baumer and Lisa Mayhew sent a firmwide email letting everyone know that it will be laying off attorneys and staff as a result of the coronavirus crisis. On top of that, the firm will be shuttering its Beijing office. Here’s a relevant excerpt from that email (available in full on the next page):

The exact size, shape, and speed of global economic recovery remains unclear as we look ahead. In the near term, we do not anticipate a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of economic activity, nor perhaps, even on a more extended basis. Although some pockets of our Firm remain exceptionally busy, our overall capacity is in excess of demand and how we should be structured to best serve our clients.

All of this together has led to our decision to undertake targeted reductions across some practices to ensure that our talent and resources are best aligned to meet client needs. These reductions will impact a small proportion of our global workforce, including lawyers and business services staff. We will also be tightening our footprint in Asia, where we will be closing our small Beijing office as part of these efforts.

BCLP will offer severance to the affected lawyers and staff based on the higher salaries they received prior to the cuts that the firm instituted in April and reimburse the 15 percent salary cuts to those who are laid off before they leave the firm. The firm will also offer outplacement coaching and counseling to those who are let go.

Sources have already told us that associates in the firm’s Phoenix and Dallas offices have been affected by the layoffs. Let us know if your office has been impacted.

UPDATE (6:00 p.m.): We’ve been told that associates have also been laid off in the firm’s Irvine, San Francisco, D.C., Atlanta, and St. Louis offices.

On the bright side, after the firm’s deadline for salary cuts expires later this summer, those reductions will be halved to 7.5 percent, instead of the current 15 percent. These reduced cuts will be extended through the end of 2020. The firm will also be creating a bonus pool for those who “contributed highly” during the first half of the year. Way to rub salt in the wound for those who were just let go.

Best of luck to all those who are affected by the layoffs at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.

Allison Jones Rushing has a sterling academic record, high-profile clerkship experience, and doubtless a solid vote for protecting the rights of fetuses as, based on her résumé, she still is one. Rushing graduated from Wake Forest in 2004 and Duke Law School in 2007. After three clerkships — with then-Judge Gorsuch, Judge Sentelle, and Justice Thomas — she joined the ranks of Williams & Connolly where she’s practiced actual law for a mere seven years.

Doesn’t anyone think we’re, forgive me, “rushing” this? She could go to her 10-year Gorsuch clerkship anniversary already a federal appellate judge herself. Before this administration is over, a 3L serving as FedSoc Treasurer at Ole Miss could get a district court nod and not a single goddamned one of you will be shocked.

Obviously, Rushing’s clerkships speak to her academic acumen and her work at as a rising star at Williams & Connolly are nothing to sneeze at. Certainly a far cry from the last mid-thirties nominee the administration tried to stuff into an adult-sized robe in the form of [ghost hunter](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/trump-judicial-nominee-is-a-ghost-hunter-proving-the-bar-can-always-go-a-little-lower/) and [KKK enthusiast](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/judicial-nominee-brett-talley-loves-ghosts-so-much-he-apparently-thinks-the-kkk-were-kind-of-cool/) Brett Talley. But the operative word in the phrase “rising star” is “rising.” Rushing was building a résumé that could very well earn her a place on the bench after another 10 or 20 years of practice. But the grifters holding the White House despite losing the popular vote by millions know they’re likely not getting another crack at this for a decade and are ready to throw anyone into these seats who’ll still be on the bench in 2056 when Tomi Lahren’s as-yet-unborn son is ready to serve as Barron Trump’s running mate.

Is it unfair that an accomplished young lawyer is going to be stuck with this belittling image as a baby judge? No. It is, however, unfortunate and that’s on the administration for putting her in this position even after they saw what happened to Talley’s nomination, which, people may forget, was already going to hell on the youth issue before we learned about his bizarre habits.

The irony is, despite her dearth of practical experience, Rushing is potentially one of the better selections in Trump’s cavalcade of mostly laughable judicial nominations. Beyond the aforementioned Talley, we’ve had [Jeff “Satan Boy” Mateer](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/another-day-another-comically-unfit-judicial-nominee/), [Matthew “the dog ate my homework” Petersen](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/if-your-problem-with-a-judicial-nominee-is-a-lack-of-trial-experience-youre-missing-the-point/), and [Ryan “what I meant when I said minorities were whiny ethnics was…” Bounds](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/law-school-students-just-saw-a-radical-shift-in-the-pathway-to-success/). At least she’s not in any danger of getting an ABA “not-qualified” tag like now confirmed [Judge L. Steven Grasz](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/senate_confirms_appeals_nominee_grasz_who_was_rated_not_qualified_by_aba_co) and her appellate practice is certainly a better résumé line item than “anti-gay blogger” like confirmed [Judge John Bush](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/07/20/senate_confirms_john_k_bush_anti_gay_blogger_to_the_6th_circuit.html). When your expectations are so low, the little things matter.

It seems as though Trump’s circuit court nominations largely fall into three categories: comically inexperienced, so embarrassingly ideological that [even conservatives blush](https://twitter.com/orinkerr/status/987016941461098496?lang=en), or both. Rushing seems to fit the first category. Whether or not she fits into the third remains to be seen, but with the joint Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation vetting process, it’s hard to imagine they picked the next David Souter.

# More Details From The Offensive Simpson Thacher 'Pregnant' Email
## Wait, how has no one apologized yet?

Assuming you don’t have pregnancy brain, you remember the story of the [Simpson Thacher associate who emailed an entire deal team calling out a Freshfields associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/probably-not-how-you-should-talk-to-pregnant-associates-a-biglaw-play-in-four-acts/) with “understand you are pregnant and may forget things from time to time.” It was a wildly inappropriate comment designed to undermine a woman in front of her professional colleagues and peers. Thankfully, Freshfields flagged it as such.

In our original story, it appears we got the timeline a little twisted. It turns out, the infamous “pregnant” email — which also included the comically threatening “hope you don’t let your pride get in the way of this deal” — was actually the last email in the chain.

A tipster with knowledge of the unredacted emails outlines the whole affair:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The three pictures are taken directly from the email chain, in reverse-chronological order, with sensitive information redacted and re-scanned into pictures. As you would see, the conversation starts with lousy performance of this [Simpson Associate] being identified by opposing counsel from Freshfields in order to expedite the closing process. [Simpson Associate] again to blasts out her random, last-minute one-line response to make a global change to a key document, which a good lawyer should have done seven days ago through a clear DOC file with track changes enabled. Then the Freshfields associate responded with “yes your majesty” with a sarcastic tone at 8:39pm on December 4. Apparently this [Simpson Associate] took it as a compliment and went “always happy to teach you more” at 8:54pm. Thereafter, there were some further exchange on legal terms, until this [Simpson Associate] completely lost it and lashed out at 9:23pm her discrimination against this pregnant Freshfields associate in a email chain with more than 50 people copied. The Freshfields partner’s email followed soon after. In short, the four screenshot of email lines in your article actually took place in the order of 2, 3, […] 1, 4.

So that’s how this episode of “When Transactional Attorneys Attack” went down.

The tipster, who is not from either Simpson nor Freshfields, informs us that they’ve not heard of any response out of Simpson other than to confirm receipt of the complaint from Freshfields. What?

This isn’t difficult. There should be an email sent to everyone on the distribution list apologizing wholeheartedly for the comment. Whether it comes from Simpson leadership, the Simpson partner on the deal, or the associate herself, someone needs to take responsibility for this and effusively fall on the sword. How has this not happened yet?

# Latham Just Shocked Us All With Fall Bonuses!
## Plus they announced a charitable giving program.

I had pretty much[ given up hope](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/if-you-havent-already-gotten-a-biglaw-fall-bonus-you-probably-wont/) that any other Biglaw firms would be handing out fall appreciation bonuses.

I mean, it was great when Cooley started the [COVID appreciation bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) trend, and then [Davis Polk ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/)upped the ante. And when firms [quickly](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/) started [piling](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/) on this [new bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/) [scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/debevoise-bonuses/), Biglaw watchers just kinda assumed that’s where the market was heading. But then Kirkland — the [world’s richest law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/the-global-100-the-richest-law-firms-in-the-world-2020/) — [begged off](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) fall special bonuses, and seemed to be asking the market not to follow the trend. Then [Cravath said no](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) to fall bonuses, and where they go, most of Biglaw follows. At this point, actual bonus [news is sporadic](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/white-case-no-bonus/), and it’s only rarely [good news](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/akin-gump-surprises-associates-with-good-news-fall-bonuses/).

So color us all surprised that Latham & Watkins just announced special fall bonuses! They’re matching the scale set by Davis Polk, which, since it’s been a while, is between $7,500 and $40,000 depending on class year according to the following schedule:

1st years – $7,500
2nd years – $10,000
3rd years – $20,000
4th years – $27,500
5th years – $32,500
6th years – $37,000
7th years and above – $40,000

The bonuses — which will be in addition to the firm’s normal year-end bonuses — will be payable on November 30th. You can read the firm’s [full announcement on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/latham-bonuses/2/)

In addition to the bonuses, the firm also announced a charitable giving initiative, “Giving Thanks By Giving Back.” The firm will make an initial contribution of $1,000,000 to fight hunger in local communities, and will match employee contributions up to another million dollars, hoping that Lathamites will “be inspired to give generously at this time of year to help those in need.”

Yes, it’s a gloomy and rainy day here on the East Coast, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to celebrate. There’s Biglaw bonus news coming in and when it’s raining money, well, that’s sure to add a little shimmer of sunshine to your day.

Yesterday, Fenwick & West — a firm with $723,259,000 in gross revenue in 2021, ranking 64th on the Am Law 100 — announced its year-end bonuses. And like so many of its peers, the firm is matching the prevailing Biglaw standard set by Baker McKenzie last month.

Associates in good standing with at least 1,950 creditable hours will receive bonuses on the following schedule:


Associates that billed 2,100 creditable hours will be eligible for additional rewards between $3,000 and $12,000 as part of the firm’s “Triple R” rest, recreation, and relaxation program. The firm is also bringing back its condominium program, paused during the pandemic, for associates that made extraordinary contributions to the firm:

We are bringing this program back for 2023 with condo locations in Hawaii and St. Thomas. This year we will award condo weeks to our attorneys who demonstrated extraordinary institutional contributions to the firm as well as attorneys who were booked to travel to Hawaii or St. Thomas in 2020 but opted out of the condo options offered at that time.

Bonuses will be paid on December 30th. You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/fenwick-bonus-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Solo/Small Exit Plan: The Biglaw Buyout
## Could this be your potential end game?

The path from startup to buyout is a widely recognized exit strategy in the tech world — and indeed, one that has become a more [popular](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/06/ipos-vs-mergers-buyouts-blow-away-ipos-when-investors-cash-out.html) strategy than aiming to take a company public. With IPO activity still far short of the levels it reached back in the late 1990s, [buyouts](https://www.pehub.com/2017/09/is-the-buyout-the-new-exit-strategy-for-venture-backed-software/) are an [equally attractive](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/03/are-buyouts-the-new-ipos/) path to growing a small company.

When most lawyers start firms, they’re thinking neither of IPOs nor buyouts. Because of the ban on outside ownership of law firms, selling shares in a firm to investors still remains verboten under today’s ethics rules. As for buyouts, startup lawyers typically have their eye on growing their practice rather than priming it for acquisition by another firm.

Still, in the past couple of days, I’ve noticed a string of small, specialty law firms that have been willingly swallowed up by bigger fish.  Earlier this week, newly formed Womble Bond (a [mashup ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/01/as-womble-bond-dickinson-goes-live-winston-the-bulldog-goes-down/)of Womble Carlyle and British firm Bond Dickerson) [acquired](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2017/12/04/womble-bond-dickinson-bolts-on-dc-telecom-boutique/) Bennett and Bennett, a D.C.-based, husband and wife-run telecom boutique.  Also this week, Squire Patton and Boggs [scooped up](http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20171204/news/144471/squire-patton-boggs-buys-small-dallas-firm-bolster-cybersecurity-data) the Yarborough Law Group, a small shop focused on cybersecurity and data privacy.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
To be sure, large firms have always merged and absorbed other practices. But these recent acquisitions seem to be more deliberative than assimilation just to add bodies — a problem that fellow ATL columnist Mark Herrmann wrote about [here,](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/the-degradation-of-law-firm-quality/) expressing concern that these mergers could dilute law firm quality. Instead, the Womble/Bennett and Squire/Yarborough acquisitions appear to have been targeted as a quick way for the large firm to incorporate a new and highly specialized practice area that could otherwise take years to cultivate. It’s very much like Airbnb’s [recent acquisition](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/16/technology/airbnb-acquires-accomable/index.html) of Accommable — a site that connects disabled travelers with accessible rentals — which gave Airbnb a shortcut to come into compliance with disability laws.

Given that large firms are becoming more deliberate about buying out small practices, maybe it’s time for solos and smalls starting out to think about a Biglaw buyout as a potential end game.

[Carolyn Elefant](http://myshingle.com/about/about-carolyn/) has been blogging about solo and small firm practice at [MyShingle.com](http://myshingle.com/)since 2002 and operated her firm, the [Law Offices of Carolyn Elefant PLLC](http://www.lawofficesofcarolynelefant.com/), even longer than that. She’s also authored a bunch of books on topics like [starting a law practice](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0940675625/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0940675625&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20), [social media](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604429208/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1604429208&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20), and [21st century lawyer representation agreements](http://www.lulu.com/shop/carolyn-elefant/the-art-science-ethics-of-the-21st-century-retainer-agreement/ebook/product-20376406.html) (affiliate links).

# Michael Sussmann Not Guilty As Trumpland's Great Stupid Hope Falls Predictably Flat

The Trump world put a lot of faith in John Durham.

After spending years and considerable money searching for the smoking gun to “Lock Her Up” Hillary Clinton in Gitmo, his confusing mess of a probe ran aground on the shores of reality. Former Perkins Coie partner Michael Sussmann was acquitted of lying to the FBI today, just like every competent legal commentator patiently explained would happen.

Speaking of competent legal commentators… [Jonathan Turley is gonna be very confused at this outcome](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/durham-probe-media-major-story-jonathan-turley).

As will a lot of folks who never understood this case outside the lens of right-wing media. Watching Fox News, one might have thought Sussmann handing over information about a Russian bank communicating with the Trump campaign was a great criminal lie. But that had nothing to do with the case: Sussmann was charged with not telling the FBI’s general counsel that he also worked for the Clinton campaign.

Which the senior FBI lawyer knew. Because everyone in Washington knew Perkins Coie also represented the Clinton campaign. So it wasn’t misleading and hence… not guilty.

But conservatives never really grasped that and probably won’t for a long time.

The coverage they watched described this specific story as “connected” to the Steele dossier, to give it the taint of “pee tape” allegations despite being a distinct claim. Or saw the network deploy certified joke analysts like former [Acting-But-Not-Legally-Acting AG Matthew Whitaker](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/fake-attorney-general-opines-on-fake-michael-sussmann-case-questions-dc-jury-of-uh-you-know-which-uh/) to deliberately muddy the description of the case. Whitaker recently described how FBI agents could have figured out that the Trump server allegations were false, which might make you think the case was about Sussmann lying about the information he handed over.

Those charges were never brought because they only existed in the fever dreams of the MAGA-geniuses. Because whether or not there’s an innocent explanation for the Russian pings on the Trump server, Sussmann didn’t lie when he flagged those.

The investigation was baseless, basically an inquiry into [whether Sussmann billed his time to the right client](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/perkins-coie-partner-indicted-because-he-forgot-to-bill-to-professional-reading/), and Durham dumped it on the docket at the last second provided by the statute of limitations to stretch out his grift for a few months more.

And it’s over now.

A right-wing former federal prosecutor speculates that Special Counsel Durham brought a losing case with a long indictment packed with material irrelevant to the charge in order to “establish in the public record the existence of the plot” for ideological allies.

# Biglaw Partner Could Face A Felony Charge Following Boat Crash
## Partner Douglas McWilliams is fighting back.

Douglas McWilliams

A Vinson & Elkins retreat on the weekend of May 10th took a turn for the upsetting when several partners were involved in a boat crash on Lake Travis, Texas. Two of the firm’s attorneys had to be taken to the hospital to treat their injuries, and another, Douglas McWilliams, a partner in the Capital Market and Mergers & Acquisitions group, is facing a felony charge for leaving the scene of the accident.

A group of V&E attorneys were having dinner at McWilliams’s vacation home on the lake in advance of a corporate retreat the next day. At the end of the evening when they went to return to their hotel, they found their shuttle bus had mechanical troubles and McWilliams offered to take them back in his boat. During this journey, the boat crashed onto land, near a place ominously called Graveyard Point.

During the accident, McWilliams was thrown from the boat. He says he left the scene to get help for his injured colleagues, since cell phone service was poor. McWilliams was not heard from for five hours following the crash — police had even begun a search for him. According to a [report](https://www.mystatesman.com/news/prominent-houston-lawyer-faces-felony-charge-lake-travis-boat-crash/znRPhJrwGPKhy92XQfguBI/) from the Austin American-Statesman, investigators are characterizing it as “suspect fled the location.”

“Suspect’s time at the scene after the collision was so brief that the victims and witnesses involved were uncertain if they even saw the suspect after the crash,” [parks and wildlife investigator Adam Alvarez in an arrest affidavit] wrote. “These uncertain reports led emergency personnel to search the surrounding water and to check for suspect’s body.”

McWilliams says he must have passed out, and that accounts for the missing time:

“After finding out what time it was when EMS arrived, I believe I must have fainted or passed out for several hours from the combination of extreme pain I was under, the shock of the accident and the incredible stress I was under,” McWilliams wrote in a statement. “It’s the only explanation I can think of to account for the amount of time that passed before finally finding a place where I could call 911.”

The arrest warrant also notes that, according to interviews, “the suspect had been drinking” prior to the crash. But McWilliams has fought back against that claim in a statement about the charge. He has also provided multiple affidavits — include from the firm’s chairman — saying he was not drunk that night.

In his statement, McWilliams said, “I was not hiding from anyone as I had nothing to hide. I was not intoxicated when the wreck occurred, or for that matter, at any time during the night, and it’s ridiculous and insulting to me to suggest that I’d run and hide while my colleagues were suffering in an attempt to avoid responsibility for anything.”

A warrant was issued for McWilliams’s arrest but withdrawn to allow him to go on a previously scheduled trip abroad. McWilliams’s attorney has requested the district attorney’s office independently evaluate the charge against his client.

UPDATE: Additional details about the accident, along with a lengthy statement from McWilliams’s lawyer, Austin criminal defense lawyer Brian Roark of Botsford & Roark, are available at [Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/27/boating-accident-triggers-troubles-for-ve-practice-leader/).

# Quinn Emanuel Announces Pay Raises For Associates
## This firm could've been a contender to beat the market for raises. Did it happen?

We’ve already heard from several West Coast firms in Salary Wars 2016 (e.g., [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/); [Irell & Manella](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-west-coast-firm-adopts-the-180k-salary-structure/)), and both of them have matched Cravath’s new salary scale. We, and many others, had been waiting with bated breath for the other shoe [sandal](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-white-sandal-elite-the-go-to-law-firms-of-silicon-valley/) to drop. After so many other firms had made their announcements, why hadn’t Quinn Emanuel announced what it intended to do with its associates’ salaries yet? Would the firm raise salaries to exceed the $180,000 base?

In an [earlier poll](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-an-addendum-on-leverage/), 27 percent of our readers thought that the West Coast litigation powerhouse would be the first to move on Biglaw base salary raises. With $4.4 million in profits per partner and low leverage, the firm seemed like it would be a very likely contender to lead the market on this front. Quinn Emanuel, however, did not see fit to do so, and according to new documents we’ve reviewed, it has not seen fit to exceed Cravath’s generous raises for associates. Quinn Emanuel has officially matched Cravath.

Associates were notified about their raises via an email from [Richard Schirtzer](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/schirtzer-richard-a), head of complex litigation at the firm. QE has announced raises for everyone up to seventh-year associates, and will “look[] at individual adjustments for more senior associates and others.” (Note that Cravath announced raises for the Class of 2008 as well, at $315,000. Perhaps if Quinn has associates who are that senior, they will receive the same amount.)

# No, Sidley Has Not Increased Their Compensation Scale
## Above the Law has always been on top of the associate compensation game.

Assuming you’re an associate in good standing, every year in Biglaw you get a “promotion.” First-years become second-years, second-years become third-years, and so on and so forth up until that murky time when associates become counsel and/or partner. With that also comes a corresponding increase in salary, so, every year associates (again, assuming they are in good standing) get a raise. Yay for those getting raises!

But when we talk about “Biglaw raises,” this is not what we mean.

Earlier this year, Davis Polk led the industry in boosting the compensation scale as a whole. That’s what we mean by Biglaw raises.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Today, [Sidley announced their bonuses.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/sidley-bonuses-21/) The announcement also included information that folks were — as they do every year — moving up the existing compensation scale. Yet, other legal industry publications ran with stories and alerts (that you probably clicked on!) boasting of a new “round of raises.” And ATL tipsters have demanded to know why we aren’t reporting on this.

Although the Class of 2020 got a raise to $215,000, it is not because the grid has been upped — it’s because the Class of 2021 now occupies the “first-year associate” role and every other class shifted upward accordingly. First-years will still be paid the $205,000. There is no new change to the existing Biglaw world order.

We know the Biglaw compensation market has been absurd this year, but two rounds of raises in one year? LOL. No.

Above the Law first won your hearts and minds because we were willing to spill the tea on associate compensation. So, come to your friends at ATL if things seem a little too good to be true.

# Biglaw Firm Creates C-Suite Role To Guide Firm On Artificial Intelligence
## Welcome to Biglaw, Big AI.

The legal profession can best be described as risk averse when it comes to adopting new technologies, with many attorneys doing so begrudgingly, and many more refusing to do so at all. But one Biglaw firm is buying in when it comes to the rise of artificial intelligence — in fact, it’s one of the first firms to create a C-suite position specifically for AI.

Michael Best — a firm that brought in $185,190,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 167 in the most recent Am Law 200 — recently brought on Sarah Alt as the firm’s first chief process and AI officer. Alt will use her expertise in IT and ethical AI practices to guide the firm into the future. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/26/michael-best-creates-ai-focused-c-suite-role/) has additional details:

Alt joined Am Law 200 firm Michael Best in April 2021 as chief business process officer, but her new role expands her responsibilities as AI becomes a larger issue for the firm and clients. She said she will lead the firm’s approach to AI as well as advise the firm’s clients as a consultant.

“We recalibrated my role to absorb the AI leadership role for the firm and still keep the internal processes and technology [responsibilities],” she said.

Alt, a fellow with the Ethical AI Consortium who created the first-ever Ethical AI Professional certification, said of her new role, “Certainly firms are advertising an AI practice, but to name an AI officer at the C-suite level? This is not something.”

Although the firm has banned the use of generative AI like ChatGPT because of its “risk profile,” Alt said some clients, depending on their industry, are trying to use it “responsibly.”

Best of luck to Alt as she navigates AI at Michael Best. Will any other Biglaw firms introduce C-suite-level roles to manage and guide their use artificial intelligence?

A legacy firm of what Biglaw giant was co-founded by noted Supreme Court jurist Justice Abe Fortas?

Hint: He co-founded the firm with a fellow former Yale Law School professor known for his trust-busting work as Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division under FDR. Fortas’s name was taken off the masthead in 1965 when he became a justice on the Supreme Court.

See the answer on the next page.

# What Are Millennial Lawyers’ Hopes And Dreams?

As the path to law firm partnership continues to see new offshoots, to what extent are millennial lawyers looking to veer in a new direction? 

To gather some answers, we have partnered with our friends at Major Lindsey & Africa to run a series of (very brief, we promise) surveys designed to capture the perspective of lawyers in various stages of their careers. 

[In this survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8c5uQBXjhMxEC7I) (the second of three), we examine “Goals,” with the hope of understanding the motivations associates’ path to their dream gig.

We’d appreciate it if you would take a couple of minutes and [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8c5uQBXjhMxEC7I). (And please note we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take the survey!)

[](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8c5uQBXjhMxEC7I)

If you have not taken the first survey in our series, “Priorities,” [you can do so here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EayshZZjGVlJ5Q).

# Biglaw Associate Layoffs In 2020 Were 'Reminiscent Of 2009 And The Great Recession'
## Gee, we could've told you that. Thanks a lot, stealth layoffs.

Thanks to the pandemic, Biglaw firms attempted to manage their expenses throughout 2020 by using the cost-cutting measures of salary cuts, furloughs, and layoffs. While staff members seemed to be the target of the vast majority of the outright cuts, law firm associate head counts began to curiously shrink through a series of stealth layoffs. Of course, the Biglaw firms in question wouldn’t admit to doing such a thing, but the numbers don’t lie.

According to a new Thomson Reuters Peer Monitor Index report, Biglaw firms started casting associates aside by the third quarter of 2020. If you remember what happened back in 2009, when thousands of lawyers lost their jobs thanks to the recession, you may be starting to have some flashbacks. The report notes that associates were the “primary targets of reductions amongst lawyers,” but didn’t specify how the reductions were made (hmmm…). When all was said and done, Biglaw firms, on average, employed 1.6 percent fewer attorneys in 2020 than at the same point in 2019, and the job cuts came at “a pace reminiscent of 2009 and the Great Recession.” We weren’t kidding about the flashbacks.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2021/02/02/associates-bore-the-brunt-of-attorney-cuts-in-2020-405-76242/) has some additional coverage on the report:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The head count drop in 2020 was a result of decreased demand in general as well as clients and firms funneling work to more senior-level lawyers, said Mike Abbott, vice president of market insights and thought leadership at Thomson Reuters, in an interview Monday.

Firms “were hearing directly from the clients, that in a period of uncertainty, ‘We really want to rely heavily on the counsel of individuals who know our business best, who have longstanding relationships,’” Abbott said. “And that’s frequently the partner level. So a lot of that work was staying with or actually going to more senior people at the law firms.”

So, what came of all of the layoffs — aside from misery amid economic uncertainty for all those affected by them? A 1.4 percent increase in productivity and increased billing rates for attorneys, that’s what. But wait, there’s more:

[A]ggressive cutting and “sky-high” worked rates in the final months of 2020 propelled law firm market performance to near-record levels. The Thomson Reuters [Peer Monitor Index](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/reports/2020-q4-peer-monitor-index-pmi#form)—a composite of factors affecting law firm profitability such as demand, rates, productivity and expenses—hit 69 in Q4. It’s the highest score since 2006.

According to the Peer Monitor report, profit per equity partner growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased by about 15% in the Am Law 100 and about 13% for the Second Hundred, relative to the fourth quarter in 2019. The average for all firms was about 11.5% in the fourth quarter.

The profit increases are in line with [Wells Fargo’s survey results](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/01/after-profits-soared-in-2020-firms-optimistic-about-revenue-uptick-this-year/) Monday, which showed net income growth was up an average 9.9% in 2020 across 130 firms and 12.7% up for Am Law 50 firms.

At least the associates who lost their jobs did it for a good cause. Ugh.

You’ve got a crazy story, we just know it.

After I took to the skies last week in [a helicopter commute to JFK](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/the-smartest-trip-youll-ever-take-in-your-biglaw-career/), it got me thinking about the wackiest business travel stories I’ve heard over the years. There was the partner and associate who routed their return through Vegas and gave themselves a 10-hour layover to hit the strip — and won $5000 each. There was the drive to Topeka where the rental car blew out a tire and no one knew what to do. Or the scores of “so I was in the Delta lounge when [insert celebrity here] came in and got drunk with us” tales. Or the time you [took the train and let your layoffs slip](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-new-yorkor-pillsbury-associates-brace-yourselves/).

So we here at ATL want to hear your wildest, craziest story of traveling for work. It doesn’t even have to be a long-distance trip either. Anything involving transit counts in this contest, so your misadventures with the subway count. And you’re welcome to use someone else’s story… if we hear the same saga twice, the “winner” will be the one who told it best in our estimation.
