# The 500 Largest Law Firms In America (2023)
## Because size matters in the legal profession. Which is America's largest law firm?

There are many different and exciting ways to rank law firms. How prestigious are they? How much money are they making? How much do partners earn? How much are associates earning in cash compensation? How big are they?

Yes, size matters, and because the legal profession is obsessed with every single measurable and quantifiable factor law firms have to offer, there’s obviously a ranking for that.

So, which Biglaw firm is the biggest of them all?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Today, the National Law Journal unleashed its annual [NLJ 500](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2023/06/20/the-2023-nlj-500-ranked-by-head-count/), a ranking of largest law firms in the United States covering the previous calendar year. If you’ve ever wondered about precise law firm headcounts, this is the ranking for you.

These are the 10 largest law firms in America, according to NLJ, along with some insights on the list:

- Baker McKenzie
- DLA Piper
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Latham & Watkins
- Norton Rose Fulbright
- White & Case
- Hogan Lovells
- Greenberg Traurig
- Jones Day
- Morgan Lewis
Law firms across the nation continued to grow their headcount in 2022, especially in the associate and nonequity ranks, despite a slowdown in demand amid financial headwinds that categorized the latter half of the year. The majority of the largest firms recorded moderate head count growth, leading to several ranking adjustments at the top of the NLJ 500.

Baker McKenzie (No. 1) and DLA Piper (No. 2) retained their positions. Baker McKenzie maintained the top spot despite slightly decreasing its headcount by 0.3% from 4,795 to 4,779 full-time equivalent attorneys. DLA Piper stayed steady in second place, growing its bench by 5.6% to 4,255 attorneys. …

The larger the firm, the more it can gain lawyers or lose them without significantly impacting its overall head count or position. That can be seen through firms that had large percentage increases or decreases, yet retained their prior position or only moved up or down a few slots from last year’s NLJ 500 leaderboard. Unlike last year, however, head count growth at the biggest law firms accelerated.

Congratulations go out to Baker McKenzie for employing more lawyers than any other firm. Once again, this firm wins the award for putting the “big” in Biglaw. Give a round of applause to the rest of the Top 10 for keeping their Biglaw firms bigger than all the rest. As for every other firm, keep growing and someday you’ll be a Biglaw behemoth too.

# Everything You Need To Know About The Associate Salary Raises In One Image
## Spoiler alert: not every Biglaw firm is going to follow.

The salary bump of 2018 will be markedly different than the 2016 raises. In 2016, [everyone and their mother](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/) hopped on board with the new pay scale — even firms that probably couldn’t afford it. But salaries had been stagnant for almost a decade, and so, even if it meant tightening the belt, firms felt they really had to move with the market. Now, only two years removed from that market pressure, for a lot of firms, the calculus is different.

Used to be anything tagged with the Biglaw moniker — roughly defined as the Am Law 200 — had pretty robust financial prospects. Firms believed that to ride with the Biglaw crew, you had to offer market salaries to incoming associates. But the [2018 financial picture for law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-am-law-200-is-out-what-does-it-tell-us-about-the-legal-landscape/) really shows a bifurcated market — the rich are getting richer and the second tier of Biglaw firms are struggling to innovate and keep up.

So what does that mean for firms [considering keeping up with the Milbankses](https://www.law.com/2018/06/04/fewer-firms-expected-to-follow-milbanks-associate-pay-boost/)? It’s a tough question. Those that do decide to move with the market will establish themselves as the very top of the Biglaw world and they’ll be competing for the same, elite associate pool. For the firms whose balance sheets reveal a different story, they’re looking at Milbank as incredulously as LeBron James looked at JR Smith. How could you do this to me indeed?

Earlier this month, in partnership with our friends at [Lake Whillans](https://lakewhillans.com/), we released our [Outside Counsel rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2022/), an annual look at the Biglaw firms most trusted by corporate legal departments. Today, we focus on the firms rated highest by in-house counsel based on the industries in which they practice.

Drawing on input from hundreds of GCs and in-house lawyers from a range of business categories, we’ve compiled rankings for six different industries: Consumer Products/Retail, Energy, Finance/Banking, Healthcare/Life Sciences, Real Estate, and Technology. (Note that because there were a handful of tied scores in the Healthcare/Life Sciences category, that list includes 13 firms instead of 10.)

Thirteen firms appear on more than one of our industry lists, and the following four firms show up on three different lists:

# Top Ranked Biglaw Firm Hands Out Market Bonuses -- But Only For Some Associates
## More Biglaw bonus news -- but it isn't great for everyone.

Norton Rose Fulbright, which made $1,877,933,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 13th on the Am Law 100, announced it is handing out bonuses, of both the year-end and special variety. But there’s a twist — only some of the firm’s associates will see the[ headline-grabbing big numbers](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/) making their way [around Biglaw.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/)

As has [become a tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/nrf-special-bonus-2021/) at Norton Rose, only associates in California, New York, Texas, and Washington, D.C. will be receiving the bonuses outlined in that chart. We still haven’t heard exactly what associates in Denver, St. Louis, and Minneapolis will take home, though it’s likely a “regional scale” below the Biglaw market numbers.

There are additional compensation updates for some folks outside of the major markets, as per the firm email:

-
Effective for the 2022 performance year, Denver associates will move to the Firm’s national base compensation and productivity bonus scale.

-
Effective for the 2022 performance year, Minneapolis associates will adopt a new lockstep base compensation scale that will begin at $180,000 for entry level associates, and will move to the national productivity bonus scale.

-
Denver, Minneapolis and St. Louis associates will be eligible for the revised productivity bonus scale above based on achieving certain performance criteria in the 2021 performance year.

Noted one tipster: “surprising NRF matched this early. Given the number of departures this year, maybe management is taking note.”

# Former Biglaw Partner Suspended From Practice Of Law After Insider Trading Conviction

The saga of Robert M. Schulman — former intellectual property litigation partner at Hunton & Williams and Arent Fox, who was [convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/biglaw-partner-convicted-of-insider-trading-after-jury-trial/?rf=1) in 2017 — has seemingly reached its conclusion. Schulman was already sentenced to three years probation, fined $50,000 and ordered to forfeit about $15,500 and required to serve 2,000 hours of community service, but now the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ad hoc committee on professional responsibility has weighed in on the matter. In a[ negotiated discipline](https://www.abajournal.com/files/Schulman_June_16_report.pdf), Schulman has agreed to a three year suspension, retroactive to June 28, 2018.

Way back in 2010 Schulman allegedly [got drunk](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/09/tipsy-partner-tipped-insider-trading-defendant-sec-alleges/) before sharing inside information about a planned M&A deal with a friend and investment adviser, Tibor Klein. He hinted that his client King Pharmaceuticals was going to merge with Pfizer, saying, “It would be nice to be King for a day.”

In a [statement to ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-biglaw-partner-agrees-to-suspension-after-insider-trading-conviction), Schulman points to a life beyond Biglaw and his previous patent law speciality:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Schulman said he was grateful that the hearing committee and a case manager “expended the effort to look beneath the surface into the specifics of my case.”

“The patent office has likewise handled this matter in a very professional manner,” he said. “Should the D.C. Court of Appeals agree to the settlement, I do not know that I would practice again, though it would be nice to have that as an option.

“Even after the passage of more than three years since the verdict, I still wrestle with what has happened. But it did happen. I have tried to learn and grow from it and not become embittered. I am grateful for the support of family and friends who saw me through this. There are a lot of great people, both clients and former colleagues, whom I miss dearly. I am still in touch with many of them.

“I’ve tried to use my extra time in a meaningful way. I’ve become a master gardener and am pursuing a master’s in agriculture and life sciences from Virginia Tech. I’ve also been teaching ESL classes.

“At this point, I’m enjoying my vegetable gardening, including a lot of volunteering, my grandchildren and, with any luck, some baseball soon. There is in fact life after patent law after all!”

# For How Much Biglaw Associates Are Billing, They Aren't Expecting Anything Special This Bonus Season
## No special bonuses? Come on, someone please throw these associates more cash for their hard work!

With Halloween nearly upon us, that means bonus season is right around the corner. In years past, Biglaw firms were all about treats, offering pandemic-related special bonuses amid a white-hot lateral market. But here in 2023, some firms are handing out tricks — like $0 in special bonus cash and reduced payouts based on attendance compliance — thanks to our “newest” normal returning to the way things were. Associates are eagerly awaiting their year-end bonuses, even if they may seem indifferent about them. In fact, the 500-plus respondents to our annual bonus season survey think 2023’s overall bonus compensation will look just like last year’s bonuses.

As a little reminder — as if you really needed one — this is what last year’s [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cravath-bonuses-22/) bonuses looked like:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
Bonus money remained the same in 2022 after Cravath increased the size of its bonuses across all class years in 2021. Everyone saw more money, and the most senior associates in Biglaw received $115,000 instead of the usual $100,000. (Last year, Baker McKenzie kicked off bonus season by offering more money to most junior associates, leaving other firms to decide whether to offer Cravath’s $15K bonuses or Baker’s elevated $20K bonuses.) Once again, it was a great year for bonuses. With all of that background, let’s turn to this year’s bonuses.

Considering current economic conditions, what will 2023 bonuses look like?


More than three-fourths of associates (76%) predict that 2023 bonuses will look similar to 2022. Among those who foresee changes, more associates are optimistic about an increase; 14% think bonuses will be higher than 2022, compared to 10% who believe they will be lower. Biglaw firms better not disappoint when it comes to bonus payouts this year, because we can’t even imagine the state of uproar it would cause among associates.

Will any other money be headed associates’ way? Our respondents seem pretty pessimistic when it comes to bonuses on top of bonuses in 2023.

Considering current economic conditions, do you think any additional special bonuses will be offered?



Few associates (12%) expect to see any special bonuses this year. While a small percentage of respondents aren’t sure, the vast majority (83%) said they do not believe any additional special bonuses will be offered. This isn’t surprising, especially since [Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/quinn-emanuel-announces-special-fall-bonuses/) was the only firm (that we know of) to offer fall bonuses to associates. Cross your fingers and hold out hope that any other firm will swoop in to make this bonus season extra special. 

For those of you who are wondering when your bank accounts will be a little more flush, here’s a list of the dates when year-end market bonuses hit Biglaw since 2006, the very first year Above the Law started publishing bonus news. Take a look:

For the past few years, since 2018, bonus announcements had been made in early to mid-November until Cravath stretched the timeline by a smidge in 2021. Let’s see when our respondents think this year’s first bonus will be announced.

When do you think 2023 bonuses will be announced?



Most respondents (68%) believe that bonuses won’t be announced until the week of Thanksgiving or later.  The most popular prediction is the first week of December. This (sort of) lines up with past precedent set by Cravath — if we assume that Cravath will be the first firm on bonuses this year, that is.

Cravath tends to stick to a schedule as far as these things are concerned, and the firm tends to announce its bonus news on either the last Monday in November or the first Monday in the first week of December. But with other firms in the mix — will Baker McKenzie try to announce first again this year? — it’s really hard to say what will happen. There may be no rhyme nor reason when it comes to this year’s big bonus announcements.

While associates are busy counting down the hours until Bonus Day, they’re likely even busier counting up the hours they’re on track to bill in 2023 to meet bonus eligibility targets. Just how much are associates billing now? The answer is… nearly as much as they billed last year. Here are the full survey results.

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2023?



The largest group of associates (20%) said they are on track to bill between 2000 and 2099 hours this year. More than 40% expect to bill even more. These figures are comparable to those reported in 2022. This year, 37% of associates said they were on track to record fewer than 2000 hours, which is the same as last year. Maybe this is why associates are still worried about the prospect of layoffs….

But why sour the mood with talk of layoffs? Biglaw associates can soon look forward to their bank accounts being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkeys they’ll gobble down at the end of next month.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”).

I think it’s quite possible, and maybe even likely. If you look at the economics, firms are in a tight squeeze in terms of their expense ratios.

— Jim Jones, author of the 2023 Report on the State of the Legal Market by the Thomson Reuters Institute and the Center of Ethics and the Legal Profession at Georgetown Law, predicting in an interview with [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firms-face-daunting-2023-amid-falling-profits-demand-2023-01-10/) that more layoffs are to come this year. The report suggests that law firms will face a particularly challenging time in 2023, with lawyer productivity at a more than 20-year low.

# The Glass Ceiling Report: 'Slow Progress' For Women In The Legal Profession
## The future is female, and perhaps Biglaw would be best served with more women-led firms.

Despite the fact that in the new #MeToo era, women across the country are taking charge and leading movements for gender equality and equal pay, women continue to be underrepresented in private practice, especially when it comes to attaining leadership roles. In fact, in the last year at the average law firm, from associate to equity partner, women’s representation has increased by no more than a percentage point, a statistic that’s been depressingly static for years.

There are now more women in law school than ever before, but men still lead the pack when it comes to private practice, making up about two-thirds of attorneys in this sector of the legal profession with gender-discrimination suits being filed by women at breakneck speeds. What’s more (but more accurately, less) is that within those private practice firms, only 21.5 percent of equity partners are women.

How can progress for women in the law be made when the odds seem to be against them in private practice? Some law firms are leading the way, and thanks to Law360’s annual [Glass Ceiling Report](https://www.law360.com/articles/1164440/the-2019-law360-glass-ceiling-report), we now know which ones are the best for women.

Law360 surveyed more than 300 U.S. firms, or vereins with a U.S. component, about the demographics of their lawyer workforce as of December 31, 2018. Firms were then grouped into tiers based on U.S. attorney headcount, and ranked by the percentage of female nonpartners and female partners at the firm.

In the biggest of Biglaw category, those with 600+ attorneys, the top 5 firms are:

1. Littler
2. Jackson Lewis
2. Ogletree Deakins
2. Akerman
4. Baker McKenzie
4. Faegre

For Biglaw firms with slightly smaller headcount, 300-599 attorneys, the top 5 are:

1. Fragomen
2. Quarles & Brady
3. Davis Wright Tremaine
4. Shook Hardy
5. Fisher Phillips

You can check out [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1162859) (sub. req.) for rankings of smaller law firms.

How can women in private practice ensure they’ll have a say when it comes to the direction of their firms? According to Law360’s data (coupled with disheartening caveats, of course), having a woman in charge will be of great service to them:

Our data shows that firms helmed by women have slightly higher rates of women overall and in the partnership ranks.

Still, only about 14% of the firms that gave us complete data on their demographics reported that they have a woman in charge.

And even at these firms, women represent just under 30% of partners. Of all the law firms surveyed this year, women made up 24.8% of partners in 2018.

Firms that are paving the way to a more equitable profession should be applauded for their efforts, but there is still much more work to be done. The future is female, and perhaps Biglaw would be best served with more women-led firms.

# Top 50 Am Law Firm's Leader Explains His Decision On Layoffs, Deferrals Amid Turbulent Economy
## Turns out these layoffs were for the greater good of the firm.

Earlier this summer, several firms conducted layoffs and deferred their incoming associate classes, with some offering more transparency than others as to the reasons why such decisions were made. Now, the CEO of a top 50 Am Law firm that [cut 6% of its global workforce](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/orrick-layoffs-deferral/) in June is offering his insights on why, exactly, layoffs took place at his firm.

Mitch Zuklie, the leader of Orrick — a firm that brought in $1,379,702,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 32 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — recently sat down for an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/19/orrick-ceo-unpacks-latest-layoff-decision-in-the-face-of-uncertainty/) to discuss what led up to last month’s reduction in force.

At the time, when Biglaw firms were feeling the effects of the tech industry’s implosion, Orrick cited “reduced client demand” related to “market uncertainty.” Zuklie got real about that in his chat with Am Law.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“The reality is tech is a big part of our business,” Zuklie said. According to the firm, the tech sector accounts for about half of its overall revenues. The firm’s other primary sectors—energy and infrastructure, and finance—account for about 20% and 25% of revenues, respectively, with a variety of other sectors accounting for the remaining 5%.

“Things haven’t fallen off a cliff, but they haven’t been on fire,” Zuklie said of the tech group. “The economy is at a moment where there is a down market and we’re in a service industry. When our clients are pausing, it’s not surprising that we need to do so as well.”

While other firms overhired during the 2021 talent wars and used outright and stealth layoffs as a way to cut their oversized head counts throughout 2023, Orrick took a more reasoned approach to hiring and is using its own layoffs and deferrals as a service to its remaining attorneys and staff.

“The truth of the matter is, if we don’t have enough work for everyone to get the required experience to advance their careers in a thorough way, it’s not healthy and it doesn’t provide the best results for our clients,” Zuklie said. “We want inspired lawyers who are getting opportunities to progress with a full plate of work, not a situation where no one gets those opportunities.

“We thought it was the responsible thing to do for Orrick, for our clients and for the people who are relying on us to create career advancement opportunities,” Zuklie told Am Law. “We hope we did it in a way that was transparent and fair to everyone with whom we’re cutting ties.”

John G. Balestriere

Much of the conventional wisdom about how to build a legal career is outright unwise for many people. Be careful. And be confident that things will work out.

One of [the lawyers](http://balestrierefariello.com/people/) at my firm recently was on trial and worked the nonstop-nonstop hours for days on end that most good trial work demands.  After trial she was doing what all good trial lawyers do, telling war stories about the crazy things that happen on trial to anyone who will listen (or at least doesn’t run away when we don’t stop talking). When she was sharing her stories, one of her friends couldn’t understand why my colleague wasn’t angry about the long hours she worked for the better part of a month. How could my colleague actually enjoy such nonstop work? Didn’t she hate the way work took over her life for a few weeks? No, thankfully, she didn’t (and it’s obviously a tough balance, especially when you have a family). Quite the contrary: she and others on trial with her had a fantastic time.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But the interesting part of this to me is that my colleague’s friend was a law school classmate of my colleague who himself was a practicing litigator at a big firm. He routinely worked long hours. He sought out that big firm job in law school. He did so because of the “training” countless people told him, countless times during law school, that he would receive at that elite big firm. While he certainly learned something in his half decade at a big firm, he wasn’t sure how much he had learned (especially compared to my colleague) and learned to resent the long hours he put in, week after week, month after month, and not for trials and hearings, but for regular old junior associate work.

That advice — go to big firms for training — is common wisdom. While I can’t dispute its commonality, I seriously question its wisdom. I struggle to think of anyone with whom I started law school more than two decades ago who speaks glowingly of the “training” he or she received at a big firm. It was nice to pay off debt and it sure is prestigious, but I’m not sure who feels well trained in those early (or not so early) days in a big firm.

I don’t intend to write a screed against big firms, but instead to caution lawyers, especially young ones, about adopting any common “wisdoms” as they pursue what they should view as their calling. Lots and lots of people can say the same thing, and say it over and over, and still be very wrong. And — while obvious, I still need to write it — maybe such advice is wise, sometimes, but simply doesn’t apply to everyone.

I had such a drive to become a prosecutor in law school and was blessed enough to attend a school with a generous loan repayment program so I was never tempted by the big firm. I thought that I would get training at a big firm (since that’s what everyone said, right?) but not the training I wanted as a prosecutor, so I didn’t even apply to any firms for post-graduation jobs. Ironically, twenty years later, I’m at [a firm](http://balestrierefariello.com/) that focuses on [complex business disputes,](http://balestrierefariello.com/practice-areas/business-and-risk-sharing-litigation/) generally [international ones](http://balestrierefariello.com/practice-areas/international-litigation/), which at one time only those big firms handled.

I promise you I still don’t wish I would have worked at a big firm. It simply and very clearly wasn’t for me, even if I’m sure I would have considered big firms in law school if I knew I’d eventually focus my work on business litigation. Yet, things worked out for me, even though I rejected the common wisdom. Just as this is not an anti-big-firm piece, it’s not a religious one on the first of the [theological virtues](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_virtues). But young lawyers in particular need to be reminded (because this is hardly a commonly shared view): in our careers, if we work hard, maintain our integrity, and don’t worry so damned much, things really do tend to work out.

When making your own career choices take care to hear, but challenge, any common wisdoms or rules (absolutely including anything I write with purported authority in this column). And do so with the confidence that as a lawyer in America you’ve already won the lottery and are amongst the most fortunate people alive. Things will work out.

When we speak about the perks of working in Biglaw, we often discuss bonuses. But if there’s anything better than a bountiful bonus, it’s a parental leave policy that associates will benefit from for years to come. Today, Clyde & Co — a top international firm that ranked 71st on the Global 200 list in 2022 — announced an exciting update to their parental leave policy. The new policy applies on global basis, including the firm’s 15 U.S. offices.

This is part of a growing trend, with Biglaw firms launching enhanced, gender-neutral leave programs. This is good news we should — and are! — celebrating. But we also hope to build the pressure and shame on the firms whose policies are entrenched in the past.

So what are the details on Clyde & Co’s new policy? Effective May 1, firm is offering 26 weeks of fully paid leave (except where local legislation allows for more), regardless of gender or parental role, and it includes those who are adopting. Clyde & Co senior partner [Carolena Gordon](https://www.clydeco.com/en/people/g/carolena-gordon) said of the new policy, “Having access, no matter your gender to consistent and flexible parental leave is crucial to so many people both within our firm and across the wider world of work.” We love seeing policies that are gender neutral and without a primary caregiver stipulation.

Gordon continued, saying, “We know how much goes into starting a family and the challenges that balancing home and work brings, especially when working in a high-performance environment. We want to help our people build careers with us and fulfill their potential here. We also believe our offering is an important means of improving gender diversity, particularly at a senior level where law firms have typically struggled to make significant progress.”

On top of the extended leave time, the firm will provide support to all new parents as they transition back to work, as well as support them as they attempt to balance work responsibilities with family care. But wait, there’s even more! Here are some additional elements of Clyde & Co’s new parental leave offerings:

- 10 days fully paid leave for fertility treatment
- 4 weeks fully paid (before 20 weeks pregnancy) pregnancy loss leave for women or anyone suffering a pregnancy loss directly and up to 26 weeks’ paid leave after 20 weeks pregnancy for all, regardless of gender
- Up to 12 additional weeks’ paid leave for parents with children in neonatal care
- Consistent access to back-up childcare provision and five days emergency leave a year
- Parental transition coaching and parental leave sponsors for fee earners
Here’s one of the best things about Clyde & Co’s new policy: the firm is offering access to all of these enhancements to those who are currently on parental leave or recently returned from parental leave.

Kate Mathias, the firm’s chief people officer, had this to say:

“We are pleased to provide one of the most comprehensive offerings in the industry and one that aligns clearly with our values. People are at the heart of our success as a firm, and we want to ensure everyone is supported to build long and fulfilling careers with us. This initiative was developed following conversations with our firm’s gender equality network and through our employee listening activities.”

Congratulations to Clyde & Co! Exciting news like this is sure to put a smile on employees’ faces.

With more firms stepping up, expanded gender-neutral leave policies may start to feel de rigueur, and that’s a good thing by itself. But we should also remember it’s an important step, one [experts say will help ameliorate the gender pay gap. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/everything-you-need-to-know-about-biglaw-parental-leave/)And that’s good news we can all get behind.

# Tinder Lawsuit Swipes Right Into Trial
## Billionaires fighting millionaires.

The long-running dispute between Tinder’s founders and Barry Diller’s IAC Holdings appears primed for trial, with Diller [adding Bill Carmody of Susman Godfrey a couple weeks back](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/match-iac-bring-in-new-trial-lawyer-for-2-billion-tinder-suit) — a sign that the defendants see this case going the distance. One might have thought the [summary judgment decision](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/11/Judges-MSJ-Order.pdf) that tossed some of the bigger claims brought by the founders might force some negotiation, but apparently not.

Tinder’s founders feel cheated by Diller, who bought the company now nuzzled into the Match group portfolio of dating apps designed to cover the whole range of hookups from “one-night stands” to “grist for years of therapy.” According to the Tinder side, the company was undervalued in a strategy to deprive them of agreed upon awards. Except, putting aside that there’s no dispute that the banks acted independently, many of the founders’ claims boil down to “we got jobbed by a bad contract.”

Which… welcome to contract law.

It’s never pleasant to find yourself siding with billionaires, but it seems that whenever billionaires and millionaires get into a dispute all that money isn’t enough to overcome the basic truism that contracts generally can’t bind the richer party forever.

When Scarlett Johansson squared off against Disney, arguing that the decision to stream Black Widow robbed her of a portion of her promised take of the box office, all I could say is, “Yeah… probably should have put something in your contract about that.” Because contracts are great equalizers right up until the unexpected hits and at that point the more powerful party is almost always going to find themselves unchecked by whatever agreement they signed before. Is it fair to put the burden on Johansson’s legal team to have considered the possibility that an unprecedented pandemic and the meteoric rise of streaming subscriptions would combine to artificially depress opening weekend box office receipts? Check your “fairness” talk at the door 1L year — this is the deal and it’s why lawyers get paid big bucks to think of absurd contingencies.

Fortunately for Johansson, she was able to settle with a bigger actor who prized the idea of dispensing with bad blood more than a few extra million. Not every millionaire is so lucky and almost no one below that tax bracket gets that benefit.

Tinder’s founders argued that the Match group intentionally withheld the release of Tinder Gold to keep the value down. As the court said, “nothing in the parties’ agreements purported to control or regulate the timing of the release of new products or any other aspect of Tinder’s business.” They complain that the acquisition morphed the corporate structure in a way that robbed them of scheduled puts? The contract has language authorizing that. Just because the plaintiffs may not have contemplated it doesn’t mean it’s not allowed.

The plaintiffs still have claims that survived summary judgment and, it seems, everyone is convinced that they will pursue them. But whatever happens, in contractual disputes, there’s no perfect protection. You take some risks when you put yourself out there. You’d think the dating app people would understand that.

If you’re a lawyer, I bet there’s been more than a time or two you’ve elicited eye rolls from nonlegal friends and family by dropping legal Latin into everyday conversation. We use it enough at work, it’s going to eventually slip into our social lives, right?

But how many of us can also recall a time where, without realizing quite what we were doing, we managed to turn a polite chat with a friend or spouse into a full-blown cross-examination and closing argument? How many of us have used the Socratic method to ruthlessly disassemble an acquaintance’s ill-considered opinion? How many of us have, without even trying, escalated a minor dispute into a world-shattering contest of wills?

Being a lawyer changes who you are in many ways –- for better and worse. When you do something 40-plus hours a week for a number of years, you’re going to probably keep doing it outside those 40-plus hours. As Carl Jung said, “We are what we do.” But because the practice of law is so inherently adversarial, it begs another adage, “He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster.”

The Jerk Store Called

Most attorneys spend their days engaged in one form of conflict or another. Transactional attorneys have to negotiate constantly, both with the other sides of deals and even within their clients’ own corporate structures, jockeying for resources or priority. Litigators literally dispute things for a living, all day every day, on paper and in front of judges and juries. We lawyers spend thousands of hours a year in advocate mode, pushing and prodding others to try to achieve our clients’ goals.

We build up tough shells and learn not to take arguments personally, because even when opposing counsel is accusing you of fraud, malpractice, and bad fashion sense, lawyers know it’s just business. We have to be able to take it as well as we plan to dish it out.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In short, the practice of law teaches us to be jerks. It conditions us to spend our days dealing with others in a sharp, rough-and-tumble, arm’s-length manner. By the time most of us had finished our fifth years as attorneys, we had over 10,000 hours of practice at being professional pains in the rear. If you believe [Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule?verso=true), that was the point where we functionally mastered the art of being insufferable and argumentative. For those of us at the 20,000, 30,000, or 40,000 hour mark, it can be increasingly difficult to keep those instincts compartmentalized to the work day.

The problem is that, to a certain degree, being a jerk can be good for business. I’ve had countless potential clients tell me over the years that they want to hire a bulldog, a ruthlessly aggressive attorney who’s not afraid to step on toes if it gets them a good result. Attorneys who are willing to go scorched-earth in the name of pleasing their clients seem to earn a huge degree of loyalty from their clients (at least until the client gets the bill for all the unnecessary fights their attorney picked). And in fairness, it’s hard to be an effective lawyer without being willing to strategically take stances and actions that you know will anger your opponents. We can’t control how others react, so why not do what’s most effective for our side and not worry about feelings across the aisle?

Maybe this state of affairs is an expected byproduct of an adversarial legal system. Maybe it’s just how the legal culture has evolved in the competitive early twenty-first century landscape. But no matter how you slice it, the norms of the legal world are not normal, pro-social human behavior. The way lawyers interact with one another is not generally healthy for people that want to have warm social interactions. And it’s hard to spend your days arguing with and cajoling others without those instincts spilling over into other areas of life; areas where strident advocacy and sharp elbows are far less welcome.

Taking Off Your Advocate Hat

I’m not naïve enough to think the practice of law will change with an appeal to be nicer to one another. The world is trending ever more away from professional camaraderie and toward arm’s-length, one-off dealing. And sadly, being a jerk to opposing counsel is an effective enough client-management strategy that there will always be incentives pushing some in the profession in that direction.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
What I do think we can focus on, though, is openly acknowledging that our work lives and social lives need to be subject to different rules and expectations. Being an effective lawyer may mean taking tough stances in the office, but we need to train ourselves and the oncoming generations that even if you have to sharpen your elbows at the office, you better soften them when you get home. Telling the attorney on the other side of a negotiation to take the deal or pound sand may be poor form; telling your spouse or family to do the same is interpersonal malpractice.

The Warren Buffett Approach

The practice of law doesn’t have to suck our souls out. It can and should make its practitioners better people, just like it did for us back in law school. The legal mindset is a tool, one that can be used for good or for ill. We can choose to use it well. It’s just that sometimes that means not using it at all. Keeping our lawyerly habits at the office for the sake of our loved ones should be part of our basic professional training.

One can measure success in dollars or trial victories, but perhaps we should consider the [Warren Buffett approach](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/billionaire-warren-buffett-says-this-is-the-only-measure-of-success-that-matters.html) to assessing success: How many people do you want to have love you, and how many of those actually love you? If you’re still in the market for a new year’s resolution, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better goal to work toward.

# Another Firm Showers Associates With Special Bonus Money
## More firms decide associates are worth the extra cash.

The spring special bonus war has really taken off, with more and more firms deciding to shower associates with big bucks to keep them happy.

Canadian law firm Torys has joined in the special bonus madness — at least for their New York office. Earlier today, the firm announced bonuses in line with the Davis Polk standard set last month. The payments will be divided equally between June and November payment. There is no hours requirement for the June payment, but associates have to bill 1900 annualized for the November payment. If an associate misses the hours threshold for the November payment but makes up the hours by year end, they’ll get a make-up payment.

The schedule of bonuses is as follows:

# Are You A Biglaw Associate With Low Hours? Sorry, But There's A 'Target On Your Back'

It is happening—all the firms are letting people go and letting people out at higher rates more than the last couple of years. This is just the ordinary course when the markets are down and no firm wants to be seen doing [layoffs], so they are simply being more aggressive in their reviews.

[When demand is high, law firms] turn a blind eye [to low hours] and don’t do anything about it. When things are slow, hours are a big factor. So associates with extremely low hours are much more vulnerable. When things are really busy, even weaker associates are busy, [but] when the tide is low, you can really see what’s going on beneath the surface.

— Matthew Bersani, a legal recruiter and consultant at Cliff Group and former Shearman & Sterling partner, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/21/as-firms-seek-alternate-means-of-managing-capacity-layoffs-are-a-last-resort/), on how Biglaw firms are managing their associate ranks through the use of a “tougher review cycle.” Bersani continued, saying that “[w]ith the decrease in demand, the strong associates are mainly busy,” but that other associates “naturally have lower hours, which puts a target on their back.”

# Biglaw Associates Battle It Out Over Custody Of Mini Poodle
## This Biglaw squabble is getting ugly.

[Taylor Leighton](https://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/taylor-scott-leighton) is an associate at Akin Gump, working in the corporate restructuring department but he’s using his legal acumen for something decidedly more personal. He’s [filed a lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24602893-leighton-v-greess-affidavit) in New York State Court against his ex — Winson & Strawn litigation associate [Nathan Greess](https://www.winston.com/en/professionals/greess-nathan-c) — over the ownership of their mini poodle, Raven. (Yes, named after Raven-Symoné, per the court filing, “I chose the name Raven because she was black in color like the bird and because my favorite actor as a child was Raven-Symoné from Disney Channel’s That’s So Raven.”)

In the filing, Leighton speaks passionately about his love for the dog.

“Raven is more than a dog to me. I consider her to be my child. As an illustration to this Court of my love for Raven, I planned an extravagant first birthday party for her in the apartment. I spent several days planning and decorating, including blowing up hundreds of balloons and placing decals on the wall to give Raven a special day. Defendant, of course, participated in the festivities but it was me who took the lead on all planning and implementation.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Leighton accuses Greess of dognapping Raven and refusing to let Leighton see the dog. He argues Greess is using the dog as a tool to specifically hurt Leighton, “While I believe I have approached this situation from a position of love for Raven, Defendant has used her to hurt me. I do not believe he is acting out of love for her. I know it is in Raven’s best interests to be with me. I can support her financially and provide her with a loving and nurturing environment. She should come back home.”

As a result, Leighton is seeking $100,000 for intentional infliction of emotional distress, $100,000 for negligent infliction of emotional distress, an additional $7,791 for the purchase of Raven and the cost of her care, and attorney’s fees.

Greess’s attorney Emily Pollock [told The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/elite-nyc-lawyers-locked-in-bitter-custody-feud-over-beloved-mini-poodle), “Mr. Greess has not been served with any filing relating to his dog, Raven, and does not wish to litigate this personal matter in the media. But he strongly disputes that Mr. Leighton has superior possessory or ownership rights to Raven or that it would be best for Raven to live with Mr. Leighton instead of Mr. Greess, particularly in light of Mr. Leighton’s conduct throughout the parties’ relationship. Should Mr. Leighton pursue his claims, we are confident that Mr. Greess will prevail and Raven will remain with him.”

# First Impressions Matter
## Client experiences can be contingent on whether a human is available to speak to callers.

Have you ever had a bad experience with an apathetic waiter or a horrible administrative assistant? When I have encountered people in these circumstances, it negatively affects my first impression of the establishment I chose to patronize. Similarly, it’s scary how much power to build or break your business is held by employees who answer phones and respond to inquiries.

I recently contracted with a company to provide my law firm intake and call answering services. My Austin office is a shared office space that provides a receptionist to answer calls and take messages — for a fee. Our receptionist answered the phones for several other businesses in the building. Initially, I just set up my voicemail because I didn’t want to pay extra for the answering service. I missed many calls because people didn’t want to leave messages. Finally, I decided to hire the office receptionist to answer phone calls for my law practice. Adding the human touch increased my volume of clients.

As I mature as a firm owner, I see that client experiences can be contingent on whether a human is available to speak to callers. I know I have lost a lot of business when the receptionist at the office is away from her desk, talking to someone else on another line, and so on. I also got basic information from the receptionist — name, email, phone number, and summary of their matter. I then would have my part-time admin follow up to book the consultation and collect payment; this was time-consuming, expensive, and clunky.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I am finally switching to a 24-hour call-answering service to gather potential clients’ information more efficiently. The call-answering service collects contact information, determines whether I can help with a potential client’s matter, and gives general information about the firm. Answering services can also provide intake, schedule, and even collect payment over the phone. They will also transfer calls, take detailed messages, collect data on why a potential client didn’t book a consultation, and even counter objections from tire kickers. You can even get bilingual assistance from some answering services, expanding your reach for business. These options are game-changers in my office!

If you are in the same position as me, try an answering service and see whether it makes a difference. I was hesitant to do so because I had already established my phone line — they could transfer it! I was hesitant because I felt like I wasn’t getting that many phone calls — now I know that I am getting all my relevant calls!

The onboarding process was detailed, and I was able to share specific questions for qualifying potential clients and then informational questions. I also shared a sales script with the answering service for when people balk at having to pay for consultations or want to know what the cost of services is going to be before they even move forward. I used to hold pricing close to the vest, but now, knowing how consumers approach their services, I’m happy to share a price range of what it might cost them to work with our law firm.

Have you gone through this process of hiring an answering service? Many lawyers can’t afford a full-time admin who can sit by the phones and wait for calls. I’d love to hear where you stand on this issue. If you are interested in using a phone service, email me at info@iffyibekwe.com so I can tell you the one I use, and you can list me as a referral (we both get a discount)!

# David Boies Dishes On Firm's Transition Strategy
## A newly formed Management Committee will gradually assume day-to-day firm operations.

“People don’t really ask what happens to the firm if I or Jonathan get hit by a bus tomorrow,” David Boies told me. As Boies Schiller Flexner has grown from an upstart firm to an established powerhouse, the public perception of the firm as beholden entirely to the fortunes of its name partners has diminished. With 15 offices and over 300 attorneys, the firm is an entity unto itself, poised to carry on long after its founders have stepped aside.

The key to this evolution is the firm’s long commitment to transition planning, a process kicked off over 15 years ago with the managing partners establishing an Executive Committee and eventually creating an Administrative Partner role to devolve certain management tasks from the exclusive province of the founders. While important steps in moving the firm into something more than the sum of the reputations of the names on the door, ultimate authority for the most significant firm management tasks remained in the hands of the managing partners.

Today, the firm took another big step toward a future with the announcement of a Management Committee — a four-partner team of Executive Committee members who will take on the day-to-day firm management tasks. Karen Dunn, Nick Gravante, Phil Korologos, and Damien Marshall will take on the management mantle, with Boies and Schiller serving as advisors to ease the transition. The Executive Committee, comprised of the Management Committee, Boies and Schiller, firm Vice Chair Bill Isaacson, Karen Dyer, Natasha Harrison, Alan Vickery, and Steve Zack, will have ultimate supervisory authority.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At first blush, this might all look like a plan for Boies to ease away from the practice, but if anything this is a clever ploy to step up his workload. In the first six months of 2018, he generated $35 million in billings, bringing in more money and a higher share of the firm’s total revenue than the average of the last three years by a substantial margin. Under the guise of a transition, Boies may just be clearing his plate of mundane management tasks so he can devote even more time to the real work of lawyering.

He’s got a trial next week on a high-profile Nazi art theft case, he’s working a matter best described as “the sun never sets on private equity litigation” — a series of overlapping arbitrations from London to Hong Kong that requires round-the-clock coordination — and he’s taking the reins from Judge Posner and Matthew Dowd in [William Bond’s pro se battle](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/worlds-most-fortunate-pro-se-litigant-represented-by-judge-posner-now-also-represented-by-david-boies/). On top of all that, he’s delivering a keynote at the University of Miami Law School on the future of class actions and preparing to the chair the firm’s 22nd annual meeting. Hardly the schedule of someone looking to back away.

Management Committee member Phil Korologos, who bills himself as “the last of the single-digit employee numbers,” having come over from Cravath in 1998, says this is exactly what the firm gets out of this transition. “It’s great for the firm because it brings in young leadership at a time when David and Jonathan are still very much active and we want to be able to leverage that. This lets them concentrate on the good and fun work of lawyering… that’s a major benefit for the firm.”

As the Management Committee prepares to take the reins, the pace of the transition of management tasks will be gradual. Boies says some tasks — like billing and collections — will be handed over almost immediately, while others, like personnel, make take some time to fully transition away from the managing partners. Is he slyly pawning off the most annoying — if essential — tasks first?

# Stealth Layoffs Strike Once Again At World's Wealthiest Biglaw Firm
## Kirkland & Ellis is letting associates go following performance reviews.

The most successful Biglaw firm in the world has reportedly conducted stealth layoffs across at least four of its office. This is the [second time in less than six months](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/) that the firm has laid off associates.

According to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/kirkland-ellis-lays-off-associates-across-us-offices), Kirkland — which brought home $6,042,000,000 gross revenue in 2021 — recently parted ways with “an unknown number of associates.” The layoffs occurred following performance reviews at the firm’s California, Texas, Chicago, and Salt Lake City offices. Here are some additional details:

Laid off Kirkland associates will receive full salary and benefits and stay on the firm’s website until July 31st, said a Kirkland associate who was included in the cuts.

“It’s been frustrating to see what looks like reckless overhiring,” the Kirkland associate said.

Ugh, what’s that smell? This absolutely reeks of the classic form of stealth layoffs. For those who might be hearing the term for the first time, stealth layoffs allow firms to cut headcount without confirming financially motivated layoffs. The firm will let associates go or give the associates X number of months/weeks to find a new job and the firm frequently couches the reductions in terms of performance, that coincidentally, happen in the midst of an economic downturn — or perhaps in this case, in the wake of a post-pandemic hiring bonanza that can no longer be supported. This toxic business practice is designed to push the blame for the cuts on the associates themselves, when, if the economy remained just a bit stronger, those same associates would likely still be getting stellar reviews and full bonuses.

UPDATE: A spokesperson for Kirkland claims that these cuts “were not layoffs.” That’s exactly what happened back in November, when the firm conducted its first round of stealth layoffs. ”These were performance-based decisions resulting directly from our attorney review process, just like we do every year for all attorneys at all levels,” the spokesperson said.

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Kirkland & Ellis.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

We are compiling our annual list of the [top outside counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-rankings-2023/) and, as always, we turn to those who know best — the clients.

If you are an in-house attorney, we want to know which law firms you rely on and what level of work you entrust to them.

As always, the survey is both short and anonymous.

I’m not usually one to fall all over myself over Biglaw perks. I mean — meals, cars and the occasional booze are all par for the course. But WOW, I was not prepared for the onslaught of perks in this virtual tour of Clifford Chance’s London office.

The clip, posted to [Instagram by Lucy Cole ](https://www.instagram.com/lucydoeslaw/)a future trainee solicitor at the firm, features some truly jaw dropping perks. Yes, there are some nice, though expected, perks at the firm like a coffee shop and cafeteria. But some are over the top. We are talking a hair salon, squash court, bar, spin studio, and yes a POOL.

Take a peek for yourself.

Yes, this may all be a ploy to keep folks in the office (when you’re allowed back to the office, that is). BUT — at least attorneys working their butts off can get a (tiny) break thanks to Clifford Chance’s swanky perks.

# As The Revolving Door Turns: Robert Mueller Rejoins Wilmer Hale
## A D.C. economy of changing hats remains undisturbed as Mueller re-enters private practice.

Having diligently built criminal cases against everyone but the one guy he wasn’t allowed to charge, Robert Mueller has gone and done what every high-profile public servant does at this point — immediately cashed in with a high-paying private sector job. That sting of [having the Attorney General lie about you](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/30/18524663/mueller-barr-letter-trump-russia) can be salved with a few million bucks.

Mueller, who left Wilmer to take on the special counsel job, can now return to defending the sort of government investigations he ran for the last several months. Technically, I suppose the Ukraine facts don’t overlap with the Russia investigation — maybe he can represent some of his old DOJ bosses when that hits the fan in a couple of years. It can be a nice little reunion!

The revolving door between government and private practice is a dodgy thing, but there’s not much reason to fault Mueller his payday. Both sides of the public-private divide demand the highest levels of expertise and there really aren’t a limitless supply of Bob Muellers in the world. While constantly handing key public service positions to folks in a cloistered network invites stale thinking and industry capture, transitioning from conducting an investigation to defending other investigations doesn’t really raise the most egregious of these issues.

If anything, more prosecutors should be drawn from the ranks of those who’ve spent some time on the defense side — the kind of people capable of entertaining the best possible read of suspicious evidence and sympathetic to the potential abuse of the awesome power of the state. There’s something to be said about corporate defense attorneys moving into prosecutorial roles and taking it easier on the white-collar clients they’re used to hobnobbing with while dropping the hammer on everyone else. But Mueller didn’t seem to pull any punches on the D.C. crowd other than those the DOJ ordered him to, so this time let’s allow the guy to go back to his job in peace.

Lady Barbara Judge has a helluva résumé.

She received her BA in medieval history at University of Pennsylvania and went on to get her JD from NYU Law, where she was an editor of the Law Review. After graduation, she worked in the corporate department of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. She then lateraled to Kaye Scholer, and within five years she made partner there.

In 1980, Judge became the youngest-ever SEC commissioner. When she returned to the private sector, she served as executive director at a British merchant bank. She later became the first woman executive director of Rupert Murdoch’s News International. She’s served on numerous corporate boards, received the Commander of the Order of the British Empire honor, and been called the [most well-connected woman in the UK.](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/barbara-judge-profile-the-best-connected-woman-in-britain)

Her most recent role was as chair of the Institute of Directors (IoD), a UK members organization that works to promote company directors and corporate governance. Amid a scandal that alleges she bullied her staff and made racist and sexist comments, [she stepped down from that role](https://www.law.com/2018/03/09/hill-dickinson-centre-stage-as-institute-of-directors-suspends-chair-lady-barbara-judge/), after an  investigation by British firm Hill Dickinson.

There were 41 allegations of inappropriate behavior against Judge, and one incident of racist and sexist comments was allegedly caught on audio tape. Judge resigned after a five-hour meeting of the IoD council where the results of the Hill Dickinson investigation were discussed, and after the council decided to suspend her.

As the Guardian [reports, ](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/09/institute-of-directors-suspends-barbara-judge-amid-claims-of-racism)Judge’s comments, thought to have been covertly recorded by the IoD director general, disparage both black and pregnant employees:

She is also claimed to have said: “We have three inexperienced people doing a job [on the IoD’s secretariat] when one experienced person could do it and they are making mistakes. And so the problem is we have one black and we have one pregnant woman and that is the worst combination we could possibly have. No, two blacks and one pregnant woman. I couldn’t believe it!”

The words are understood to have been recorded covertly by the IoD’s director general, Stephen Martin.

Despite the shocking words that were allegedly recorded, Judge denies the allegations. She may have resigned, but that doesn’t mean she is going quietly into that good night. Her resignation letter “strongly refute[s] the allegations” and calls the investigation into the allegations flawed:

In her resignation letter Judge said: “I continue to strongly refute the allegations made against me and remain deeply disturbed by the gross and conspiratorial mishandling of the process which has led to the damaging circumstances in which I and the institute are now placed.

“The clear flaws in this process were identified in the statement I read to the council yesterday, which included the institute’s failure to give me an opportunity to reply to the allegations, the leaking of a confidential legal document to the press and the misrepresentations made by the institute and its investigators to my legal advisers.”

Deputy chair Sir Ken Olisa and non-executive Arnold Wagner also resigned alongside Judge, and Olisa did not mince any words when criticizing the IoD for its handling of the process:

Olisa, who is also the first black lord-lieutenant of Greater London, wrote in his resignation letter: “Instead of showcasing good governance, we have found ourselves in a surreal world of flawed processes, flagrant disregard for the principles of natural justice and a roughshod journey over the laws of the Institute.

“Senior leaders covertly recording private conversations, systemically disregarding due process and leaking confidential material to the press have combined to make the IoD a laughing stock in the court of public opinion.”

Regardless of whether the proper procedure was followed, it’s clear Judge’s exemplary pedigree didn’t provide a shield against the allegations against her.

# Biglaw Firm Brings On Technology Development Ninjas
## Why wait for a legal tech solution when you can build it yourself.

Legal technology is typically the domain of third-party vendors and startups busting their humps to build a better mousetrap that presumably leverages machine learning and blockchain. It’s the logical division of labor: let lawyers be lawyers and let techies be techies. But in the Bay Area law firms have a penchant for blurring the lines between themselves and the startups that surround them.

[The result is Orrick Labs](https://biglawbusiness.com/law-firm-creates-internal-skunkworks-to-develop-tech/), a small project under the Orrick roof that looks to build products that its lawyers need:

Jackson Ratcliffe, a recruit who had been consulting for the firm on several technology projects, joined as Orrick Lab’s technology architect in July. One of the lab’s first products is a dashboard system for the firm’s technology practice group that helps the lawyers organize client documents, and provide useful, if mundane, information like lists of directors and fax numbers designed to expedite service.

Ratcliffe had an epiphany while attending a Google Cloud conference in San Francisco last spring, he said. He could build an enterprise document collaboration tool for all the firm’s lawyers that took advantage of cloud-based tools such as translation and workflow checklists.

Frankly it’s shocking that more big firms aren’t doing this. With the resources large firms can bring to bear, they have the opportunity to build bespoke solutions that take advantage of their existing processes easier than a third-party vendor can adapt their existing products to fit a firm’s legacy systems. No one’s saying that Orrick is going to replace the big-ticket solutions out there, but for certain collaborative functions, building the right solution from the ground up will generally be better than backing a general product into particular constraints.

Zuklie said not only clients, but laterals and even law school students ask what the firm is doing to innovate and provide legal services in a more efficient way — and Orrick Labs is part of the firm’s response.

“I think we’re at a tipping point,” where advancements in technology, client demands, a war for talent, AI, and disaggregation are creating an environment for innovation, Zuklie said. “We’re an industry that has lagged behind.”

Note the past tense there. We’ve all given the legal profession a world of grief over failing to embrace technology as it comes, but that’s all changed in the last few years. Firms understand that remaining competitive requires innovation. Now some firms are realizing that they don’t have to wait on the market — they can go out and build the solutions they need themselves.

# Biglaw Firm's Raises Met With Skepticism From Associates
## It's all about the conditions.

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/perkins-raises-24/&text=Biglaw%20Firm’s%20Raises%20Met%20With%20Skepticism%20From%20Associates)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/perkins-raises-24/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/perkins-raises-24/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
We’re halfway through February already, but that doesn’t mean Biglaw is done giving out raises. Just today, Perkins Coie, a firm that made $1,163,764,000 in gross revenue in 2022, making it #42 on the Am Law 100, announced its own set of associate raises.

Here’s the new compensation scale at the firm:


That sure *looks* a lot like the market compensation scale that debuted in late 2023 — and it’s even retroactive to January 1. But there’s a catch. Junior associates, classes 1-3, will get the raises, no questions asked. However, midlevel and senior associates must have met the hours requirement from the previous year (1950 hours) to get the raises. If an associate who misses the raise cut off hits 2000 hours this year (the hours expectation for 2024), they’ll receive a bonus equal to the raise amount to be made whole.

According to insiders at the firm, folks are not pleased with the terms and conditions placed on the firm’s largesse. That’s because there are apparently plenty of associates who didn’t hit their hours — not because they didn’t want to, but because there’s not enough work to go around in many offices. As a tipster said, “this policy is basically asking them to leave if their practice group doesn’t have enough work for them.”

You can read the firm’s full memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/perkins-raises-24/2/).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Where In The World Are... Your Summer Bonuses?
## Shouldn't someone else have announced by now?

Back in the 90s, Gunderson Dettmer managed to kick off a wholesale reevaluation of associate salaries, driving the entire legal industry to radically boost its model of compensation. There’s an argument to be had that Gunderson’s move represented a more significant jolt to the legal world than any of the more recent salary hikes.

But that was then and this is now. [Gunderson announced that it would be offering summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/gunderson-announces-summer-bonuses-your-move-am-law-100/) to hard-working associates this year and put the legal community on blast that it was time to dig down and give a little for the folks who [helped drive up revenue for the first part of the year](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/law-firm-revenue-is-up-because-were-just-making-people-pay-more-for-less/).

Biglaw mostly responded with silence.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Worse, actually, to the extent that Kirkland spent a recent firm meeting telling everyone how they’re basically printing money in the basement but [aren’t planning on sharing this new boon with associates any time soon](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-holds-firm-meeting-to-say-theyre-making-tons-of-money-and-wont-be-giving-it-to-associates-kirkland/).

Like a classic episode of Carmen Sandiego, observers are looking across the skyline and wondering, “What happened to Biglaw peer pressure?” There was a time not too long ago when a firm like Gunderson could force every firm to jump in the wild race to generate the maximum goodwill for recruiting talent. What’s happened?

Ironically, the least consequential raise in memory might go down as the one that broke the Biglaw lockstep. Last year’s salary bump was functionally a slight cost-of-living adjustment but somehow it’s become the line in the sand. Around [70 percent of “Biglaw” firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/law-firm-revenue-is-up-because-were-just-making-people-pay-more-for-less/) — at least when measured by headcount — refused to match last year’s $190K scale. Presumably, they’ve decided that they aren’t suffering for coming in at a lower price point.

Not every firm has to keep up with the Cravaths of the world and it’s probably healthier for the industry that the Am Law second hundred start organizing themselves around a lower pay scale that fits with a lower price point for services. When it comes to these summer bonuses, it’s the elite who are suddenly balking. And balking while telling the world that the firms are performing well.

Since we broke the news of the new $225K salary scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) on Tuesday, November 7, 2023, and finally one-upped three weeks later by Cravath on Tuesday, November 28, 2023, complete with higher salaries for midlevel and senior associates — firms are quickly falling in line to match the scale. In addition to these hefty new salaries, Biglaw firms are also rolling out their year-end bonuses. When will your firm announce its new salary and bonus scales for associates?

Today, for your viewing pleasure, we unveil a table of all of the firms that have already matched the new salary scale (or instituted raises, generally, because of the new salary scale) and bonus scale, the date those matches were made, the minimum hours required to receive bonuses (if available), and the date bonuses will be paid. We presume all raises are retroactive to January 1, 2024. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on raises and bonuses unfolds. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, let us know.

We are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) — when you know of a firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. Sources are kept confidential.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each compensation announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus and raise season, everyone!

# Top 10 Am Law Firm Announces 3 Mandatory In-Office Days Per Week
## Another top law firm is now requiring three set days of office attendance each week.

We’re about a month into the second quarter of the year, the COVID-19 public health emergency has officially ended, and Biglaw firms would really, really like it if their associates would return to the office.

We’ve recently learned that another elite Biglaw firm, Morgan Lewis — a firm that brought in $2,745,251,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 8th place in the most recent Am Law 100 — has decided to require its attorneys to physically attend the office on three set office days each week, after initially requiring only one or two office days per week.

Way back in 2017, the firm launched an [“innovative” program](https://www.morganlewis.com/news/2017/03/morgan-lewis-announces-innovative-associate-remote-working-program) that would allow associates to work one or two days remotely each week, so the firm was prepared for the pandemic before it even started. Now, in the wake of COVID-19, it’s being mandated that associates return to the office. This process started about a year ago. For example, sources tell us that in November 2022, the firm announced that it would require attorneys in certain practice groups (at least in New York) to come to the office every Tuesday and Wednesday on a mandatory basis.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[J. Gordon Cooney Jr.](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/jgcooney), leader of the firm’s litigation practice group, sent out a memo to all U.S. litigation attorneys (available on the next page) setting out the new marching orders, noting that other practice groups and offices have already announced similar scheduling changes:

[S]tarting June 1, the LPG will be shifting to having the expectation that all of our attorneys (including partners) will be in the office every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. … You should keep the colleagues with whom you were working informed of your schedule. We believe that this new schedule will not only provide our summer associates with a more meaningful summer experience, but will also provide all of us with further opportunities to create the connections and build the relationships that are key to long-term success in the law.

A source says that the firm originally “promised flexibility,” and seems upset that Morgan Lewis is now requiring that attorneys “adjust their schedules” to meet the demands of working from the office.

Now that this trend has taken off, will other Biglaw firms follow? If your firm is requiring you to come into the office three (or more) days each week, please let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Attendance) or text us (646-820-8477).

# September Reopening For Baker McKenzie, With Remote Work Still On The Table
## But just how much remote work are we talking about?

Now that it’s mid-May, Biglaw firms have realized that it’s time to get in gear when it comes to planning a return to their offices in the wake of the pandemic. One of the largest law firms in the country by head count and gross revenue has entered the scene to announce a course of action that sounds relatively familiar at this point.

Baker McKenzie, the law firm that made a huge impact by [kicking off Biglaw bonus season](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) in 2020, is expecting that employees in North America will come back to the office in the beginning of September. With that, the firm echoes the vast majority of post-Labor Day reopening announcements that have already been made.

Colin Murray, the firm’s North American CEO, said that work from home will undoubtedly be a part of Baker McKenzie’s path to the future, but that a bit of in-person contact will be critical going forward. He elaborated on that in a recent interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/05/11/baker-mckenzie-plans-september-return-eyeing-mix-of-virtual-and-office-work/):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

“We enjoy interaction with each other,” Murray said. “We enjoy the culture of interaction with our clients, and at some level, there have been challenges, because you’re not bumping into each other in the kitchen, you’re not stopping into each other’s office to say ‘Hi,’ so there is an aspect of it that leaves us now eager to get back in.”

At the same time, Murray acknowledged that the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic had fundamentally altered how his firm, and others, will operate. But Baker McKenzie will not yet be joining the small list of firms that have expressed an openness to fully remote partners or associates.

“We don’t always need to have in-person meetings. We can now do things virtually, and I think that will continue,” he said, but adding “I don’t see us evolving towards a model where our people are scattered all over the place. We’ve got 16 offices in North America, and I think we’ll have an expectation that, if you’re affiliated with an office, that’s your home base of operations.”

Just how much time will Baker McKenzie afford for associates to work at home? That remains to be seen, but at other peer firms, lawyers can at least expect an end to the five-day, in-office workweek. If you have any details on how these plans are shaping up at the firm, please reach out to us and let us know.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# What’s Your Why? Women’s Bar Groups And Mother Attorneys
## Involvement in a women’s bar group can be an essential piece of a woman lawyer’s toolkit in navigating her personal and professional development. Women bar groups can provide essential support, training, mentorship, leadership, and opportunity to grow professionally and personally.

Women lawyers are unique and diverse individuals; we do not have the same specific goals in our pursuit of personal and professional advancement and development. The past twelve months drove home, many times over, the crucial ways in which women bar groups can support and empower to improve the status of women in the profession. As a director and officer of the [National Conference of Women’s Bar Associations](https://ncwba.org/) (NCWBA), a national “bar association for women’s bar associations” that advocates for equality in the legal profession and in society by mobilizing and uniting women’s bar associations, I have seen firsthand these benefits in action.

Based on my anecdotal research (questioning women lawyers I know), it seems a familiar path into participation in women’s lawyer groups is: someone made me go! Similarly, as a military spouse, I have leaned heavily on various bar groups throughout my career when landing in a new legal market. Depending on the size of a community, the local (city/county) bar group and, often, the women’s bar group are a natural place to join to meet the locals and become integrated into the legal community. Participation in national bar associations further expands our network, especially as virtual event popularity has increased. [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/) is one of my go-to virtual groups as a mother to three young kids and is an essential piece of the lawyer toolkit for moms. And although not exclusively a women’s bar group, the [Military Spouse JD Network](https://www.msjdn.org/) has been another crucial virtual community for me throughout my career. (They just “get it,” they are everywhere, and they know everything!) Through the NCWBA, I engage with dynamic women leaders from across the world. Personally, my involvement in women lawyer groups has opened up a robust network of women attorneys from which I draw inspiration, motivation, and support. I encourage you to increase your involvement in women bar groups!

When I speak of “women’s bar groups,” I’m not only referencing the formal, established bar associations, with dues and bylaws -– any group of women attorneys collaborating may provide essential support for women in the profession in various capacities. You may find great support in person and virtually from groups of women lawyers brought together with even more specific interests: spin bikes, motherhood, practice area, an interest in law firm management, social justice, hiking, and even a love of a certain grocery store or an interest in drinking tea, to name a few. Not every women’s lawyer group will be the perfect fit for you. It may take some time, trial and error, and luck to find “your” group, but your time will be well spent. Chances are, if you have an interest and you are a woman lawyer, there’s a women’s bar group for that (especially on social media)! The NCWBA’s Annual Women’s Bar Leadership Summit (August 2021) will explore the theme, “What is Your Why?” surrounding issues important to women in the legal profession. To find a group that is right for you — you might consider, What is your Why?

You might be a new mom searching for support from attorney moms who have been-there-done-that: navigating parental leave policies, finding or creating lactation rooms in courthouses, navigating child-care tips and tricks, finding a way to work a flexible schedule, weighing the risks and rewards of taking some extended time off — there’s a bar group for that.

You might just work so much that you never have time to socialize. You need some friends who get it. There’s a bar group for that.

You might be ready to refer out cases to trusted members of your profession, have more work than time and be ready to hire some associate attorneys, or co-counsel. There’s a bar group for that.

You might be on the path to partner at your firm; but you’re the first woman there; you are seeking mentorship from women partners elsewhere as you lay your path to success. There’s a bar group for that.

You might be in-house counsel or the only attorney at a start-up or a solo practitioner looking to scale your business and seeking colleagues to bounce ideas off and collaborate. There’s a bar group for that.

You might be searching for leadership training and opportunities. There are MANY bar groups for that. (Seriously, check the list at ncwba.org or e-mail me, I’ll find you somewhere to volunteer.)

You might be ready to retire, but not ready to abandon your legacy or leave your clients. You wonder what life without billable hours may have in store for you. There’s a bar group for that.

The past twelve months were rough. Personally, I got by with a lot of support from my friends, mostly virtually, and many of them attorney moms I only know through involvement in women’s bar groups. If you have not yet found “your people” in the legal profession, I urge you to do some exploring — it can be very low risk while so many events are being held virtually –- you can even keep your camera off. Or, if you prefer in-person events, find a few attorneys in your local community to have a socially distanced coffee or attend a meeting of an established bar group in your community. On social media, searching for groups of lawyers related to an interest you have may help you connect.  Once you have found your people, bring someone along the next time you attend an event — growing our networks helps everyone succeed!

# The Boston Legal Market In The Era Of COVID-19
## Three months in, here's a look at the numbers.

COVID-19 and the resulting stay-at-home orders put an unexpected halt to hiring at many law firms and in a number of practice areas. However, not all firms and practice areas put lateral hiring on hold.

Take the Boston market, where a handful of firms are still pushing full-force ahead. And even among those that have slowed or ceased associate hiring, most are still hiring at the partner level. We will take a look at the numbers for the Boston lateral market now that we are three months into this unchartered pandemic era to see more concretely where lateral hiring is headed.

Associate Hiring: An Overview

On the associate hiring side, firms generally fall into one of three categories:

- The firm conducted layoffs or furloughs and/or reduced associate salaries. If they are hiring at all, they are hiring only extremely selectively in COVID-specific practice areas, such as bankruptcy and restructuring, insurance coverage litigation, general litigation, labor and employment, and healthcare law.
- The firm avoided layoffs and salary cuts but is playing it very safe. They are hiring only for COVID-specific practice areas.
- The firm is busier than ever and confident as to its financial stability. The firm recognizes that this uncertain time offers a unique opportunity to seek out top talent with less competition than usual from other firms. They are moving forward with pre-COVID hiring needs, conducting Zoom interviews and even onboarding remotely. But even these firms are less likely right now to consider more “opportunistic” résumés, i.e., for practices or seniorities not covered by a concrete job opening.
In Boston, there are currently active associate openings primarily for the following practice areas: restructuring, general finance, borrower-side debt finance, general corporate/private equity, life sciences transactional, patent litigation, patent prosecution, insurance/reinsurance and insurance coverage litigation, cybersecurity and privacy, tax, and healthcare. These are all openings that have been posted since March 15th.

Partner Hiring: An Overview

Economic ups and downs may force firms to reconsider their short- and medium-term strategic needs. So-called COVID-related practices may be more in demand these days. But given the right book of business, law firms will consider partners in any economy if that partner’s practice fits the firm’s strategic needs. Partners look to move in good economies and bad. Billing rate pressures are in fact driving many partners to consider a move these days to a firm where there is more rate flexibility. The lateral partner market is historically much stronger than the associate market during recessions. And our experience to date shows this trend is holding true in this COVID-19 era. 

Partner and Associate Hiring: The Numbers

Let’s take a look at the numbers[[1]](#f1) to get a clearer idea of what is happening in the current Boston legal market:

- Between March 15, 2020 and June 15, 2020, a total of 33 partners and 62 associates were hired into Boston firms. (The numbers show 22 partners and 39 associates for this time period if we’re looking only at Am Law 200 firms.)
Let’s look at the top three practice areas for lateral hiring:

- Corporate: there were a total of 10 partners and 11 associates hired into Boston firms’ corporate groups between March 15, 2020 and June 15, 2020.
- Litigation: there were a total of 11 partners and 23 associates hired into Boston firms’ litigation groups between March 15, 2020 and June 15, 2020.
- Intellectual Property: there were a total of 5 partners and 11 associates hired into Boston firms’ IP groups between March 15, 2020 and June 15, 2020.
What does this all mean? Not all that much unless we compare it to the same period last year:

- Between March 15, 2019 and June 15, 2019, a total of 29 partners and 102 associates were hired into Boston firms. Of these hires, 5 partners and 30 associates were in corporate, 10 partners and 28 associates were in litigation, and 4 partners and 17 associates were in IP.
So what does this tell us? It tells me that the associate hiring market has slowed significantly, down 39 percent over the same period last year, but the lateral partner market is still strong.

Associate Hiring: New Searches

Hires made between March 15 and June 15 were for the most part already in process before March 15, before we understood the consequences of COVID-19 for the economy. What about new associate job postings?

New associate job postings in Boston (from our internal Lateral Link database, including published and non-published searches) were as follows:

- 82 new jobs from June 15, 2019 to September 15, 2019
- 55 new jobs from September 15, 2019 to December 15, 2019
- 50 new jobs from December 15, 2019 to March 15, 2020
- 32 new jobs from March 15, 2020 to June 15, 2020
Comparing only published active job openings for associates in Boston, we see 33 jobs on March 15, 2019 versus 5 jobs on March 15, 2020.[[2]](#f2)

These new postings are still not 100% indicative of the state of the market. They do not take into account that most firms will consider résumés where there is not a specific job opening. But as I mentioned earlier, firms’ willingness to consider opportunistic submissions for associates has dropped to close to nil during the pandemic.

I have not included partner openings here as firms rarely publish partner hiring needs. A firm’s interest in a partner candidate often has more to do with a partner’s book of business than a specific need, or where there is a specific need, the firm will often engage a recruiting firm “offline” for a more measured and effective approach to the recruiting process. Here at Lateral Link, we work with many law firms in this way.

Conclusions

The Boston lateral market has been booming in recent years. A number of top international firms have opened new offices in Boston recently, and work in the life sciences and tech arenas in particular is abundant. Firms’ specific lateral partner needs are influenced by economic pressures. But there are always needs, when the book of business is right.

We expect the lateral market for Boston law firm partners to be stronger than ever in the coming months. Firms with the stability and the means are taking advantage of the uncertainty experienced by some other firms to bring on top talent and reach their strategic goals.

While associate hiring in Boston has slowed significantly, some firms are still hiring, especially in certain practice areas. This can be a great opportunity to move to a more financially stable firm and work on the most complex and sophisticated matters. We will keep a close eye on the numbers in hopes that the associate market across all firm ranks rebounds soon and quickly.

If you are a law firm or boutique or company of any size considering engaging a legal recruiter to assist with specific searches or for general hiring consultations, I’d love to connect. If you are a partner, counsel or associate who is considering a move, I’d be happy to have a conversation about specific firms that are hiring. I’m also always happy to set up an introductory call if you’re not looking to move in the near future but would like to stay in touch with a legal recruiter for legal market updates and career guidance going forward.

Please reach out to me at [agordon@laterallink.com](mailto:agordon@laterallink.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbygordon). I look forward to hearing from you.

# Myths About The Path To In-House
## There may be ways that are more common than others, but as with all things legal, the answer is often 'it depends.'

For those of us who are in-house, we are often asked, “What’s the path?  How do I get to where you are?”

But inherent in that line of questioning is the fallacy that there is only a single path or that there is some secret formula or recipe that need only be followed for the in-house door to open.

Certainly, there may be ways that are more common than others, but as with all things legal, the answer is often “it depends.”

Myth: You Have To Know Somebody

The myth is that you absolutely have to “know somebody,” and as I have previously shared, my career path was small firm, big firm, and a cold application to in-house (I didn’t know anyone in the company). And based on all the feedback I received via email and LinkedIn messages after sharing my experience, the “cold” application path is not as uncommon as presumed. It does take accurately matching what a company is looking for (which depends on the company and hiring manager), and that matching is usually within the purview of a recruiter.

For example, my associate general counsel was looking for either an experienced employment lawyer with in-house experience or someone with at least 10 years of employment experience at a firm with a reputation for excellence in employment law, and my status as a senior associate at Littler Mendelson, the largest employment law firm at the time, fit the bill.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It definitely makes sense that it’s probably easier to know someone at the company who is willing to vouch for you or pass along your resume, but it’s not a prerequisite. At the same time, I have to acknowledge that I know a handful of in-house counsel who were recruited in-house by their clients (with whom they obviously had great relationships).

Myth: No One Goes In-House Right Out Of Law School 

The myth is that no one gets hired in-house right out of law school. While I may agree that it is not very common, I know a handful of folks who were. One of my colleagues, who has been in-house her entire career at Toyota, started out as an intern in law school. When she graduated, she was offered a position. Likewise, I distinctly remember a law student with whom I served on the board of a bar association. She took an opportunity to intern at a local hospital’s legal department, which was initially adamant that there was no possibility of hire after law school because of lack of headcount. That summer turned into an externship during the law school year, which grew into the next summer, and despite the “lack of headcount” message, she was indeed hired after law school because of the value she brought to the legal team. I have also heard of direct-from-law-school opportunities with smaller companies.

Myth: You Have To Have Biglaw Experience

The myth is that the only way to go in-house is to have Biglaw experience. For some companies, there may be comfort in knowing that their lawyer has gone through formal training and has seen large litigation or some big deals, which is prevalent in Biglaw. It may also be about branding or the reputation of the law firm. But not all in-house lawyers have Biglaw experience (as made obvious by those who enter in-house right out of law school). One particular inspirational general counsel that comes to mind had a unique path — from serving in the U.S. Army to becoming a paralegal and an associate to the public sector (the federal government) to now serving as the GC of a public HBCU.

While these myths emphasize that there is no single path to in-house, which may be disappointing for those who dislike the ambiguity, I anticipate that after the disappointment dissipates, all the possibilities actually give all those who want to go in-house some hope.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Small Bonus Pool Makes For Sad Associates

Pepper Hamilton may have been in every sports page in 2016, the firm was [hired to investigate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/ken-starrs-defense-of-his-baylor-tenure-is-not-compelling/) the Title IX violations at Baylor, which eventually led to the [ouster of Ken Starr](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/ken-starr-completely-out-at-baylor-law-school/), but that doesn’t mean it’s been smooth sailing for the firm.

Associates received notice of their bonuses, and the bad news is that the overall bonus pool is smaller than the year before. But, in an effort at transparency, the firm made clear that the smaller pool was not due to the raises everyone got mid-2016, it was just because they had a crappy year. So I guess that’s better? Below is an excerpt of the email sent to associates:


And only 56% of associates got bonuses. That’s gotta sting. As a tipster noted:

Lots of associates at Pepper Hamilton are not happy because of this year’s
bonus situation.

Yeah. I can imagine.

So, Pepper attorneys, how do you feel about the bonuses and are you actually going to see the money? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Firm Telling Associates They Won't Be Getting Bonuses After Claiming To Match Market
## This feels like the rug getting pulled out.

[UPDATES: There are several below!]

I wonder if this speaks to why [Shearman & Sterling is so hot to get a merger done with Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/hogan-lovells-and-shearman-sterling-potential-merger-on-the-horizon/).

A lot of law firms suffered slowdowns over 2022, but bonus season reminded us all that Biglaw mostly remains resilient in the face of some economic speedbumps. We thought Shearman was no exception when it first informed that it would match the Baker McKenzie bonus scale.

But the promise to meet the market was a little less than advertised. One Shearman tipster reports:

they had a zoom meeting towards the end of the year announcing there would be an hours requirement in order to get your bonus when previously Shearman has been known to not have billable hours requirements. Since the firm has been slow this year they are telling associates they didn’t meet the hours requirement and are not eligible for a bonus.

Hourly requirements are common across Biglaw, but adding one at this juncture is just an effort to pawn off a slow year on the employees with the least responsibility for the firm’s problems. [UPDATE: Tipsters say that it’s worth noting that the hours requirement was presented to them as a requirement for the 2023 bonus. But reports are that some associates are losing their 2022 bonuses with the firm citing the hours requirement (More on this below).]

And another tipster suggests that the hours requirement is just one piece of a multi-pronged effort to get out of paying bonuses:

After Shearman & Sterling announced that it will pay bonuses to on track associates earlier this month, we are now being informed by phone calls that despite being on track and in good standing we will not get any bonus this year. They started calling associates earlier this week just a few days before payment day and did not provide any other explanation.

[UPDATE 1: After publishing this story, another tipster shed more light on the discrepancy between these tips:

My understanding is that bonuses shenanigans are different dependent on department and utilization. So some practice groups aren’t paying bonuses at all, while others are paying a percentage based on the number of billable hours.

What this means practically is that some associates will be getting nothing regardless of hours while associates in departments that are getting paid a bonus will receive a percentage of the market bonus depending on their hours.]

[UPDATE 1/5/23: As things crystalize, we’re getting a better picture of what happened. Shearman historically had no hours requirement, but instituted one explicitly intended for 2023 of 1900 billable plus 150 “other” hours, which could include pro bono, marketing, CLE, D&I, mentoring, etc.

Last week, associates learned that “market bonuses” would be paid on the following scale using (1) a 10-month look back period (1/1-10/31); (2) applying a prorated utilization of 2050 hours; and (3) counting only billable and pro bono hours. Using this 2050 utilization baseline:

110%+ utilization = market bonus
100-109% utilization = 90% of market bonus
90-99% utilization = 75% of market bonus
0-89% utilization = 0% of market bonus

So it’s apparently even worse than just springing a new, retroactive hours requirement… associates needed to exceed the new hours requirement.]

This isn’t a complete picture and it’s entirely possible that some associates are still getting bonuses on the prior announced scale. But adding requirements and making last second individual “bonus condolence” calls paint an unflattering picture.

# Am Law 200 Firm Slashes Salaries, But Refuses To Conduct Layoffs
## Leaving people without work during a global pandemic isn't part of 'prudent' law firm management.

Another day, another round of salary cuts among some of America’s wealthiest and most well-known law firms. As opposed to conducting layoffs en masse like happened during the Great Recession, to combat the economic toll of the coronavirus crisis, many law firms have decided to institute pay cuts across all employee levels instead.

Today, we have news from Am Law 200 firm Smith Gambrell, which last year posted a record 17 percent increase in revenue to $133.4 million and a 32.4 percent increase in net income to $49.7 million. Unfortunately, these successes are no match for the COVID-19 storm to come. The firm is cutting pay for all employees by 10 percent and deferring partner draws by 20 percent. The pay cuts took effect on April 1.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Smith Gambrell has [reportedly](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/13/smith-gambrell-cuts-pay-for-all-but-nixes-layoffs-as-prudent-management/) decided against furloughs and layoffs, even though it’s not feasible for some of its employees to do their jobs in a work-from-home setting.

The firm’s ethos is “we are in this together,” [chairman Stephen] Forte explained. “We want the team fully intact when the curtain comes down on the virus.”

“Prudent management in the face of this approaching tsunami-pandemic motivated us to get ahead of the curve, while we are all working hard to flatten it,” Forte said. He added that one of his favorite quotes, which he’s been repeating to Smith Gambrell’s lawyers and staff, is: “Disasters remind us that we depend on each other.”

Smith Gambrell reported record revenue and profit in 2019, and Forte said that for the first quarter, “we are well ahead of last year’s record performance.” That gives the firm a financial buffer as the pandemic’s economic toll continues.

On the bright side, Smith Gambrell has “committed to equitably restore lost compensation due to the adjustment when we see our way clear of the effects of this crisis.” At least employees have true-up bonuses to look forward to when this is over.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# How Did Small Law Firms Survive -- And Recruit -- After The Market Went To $180K?
## Not every firm is capable of keeping up with the Cravathians.

“Breaking: NY To $180K!!! Cravath Raises Associate Base Salaries!!!” That was [the headline](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) right here at Above the Law on June 6, 2016, when Cravath rocked the world of Biglaw compensation — which hadn’t seen an increase in base salary in almost a decade — by increasing lockstep pay across all class years. This MoneyLaw standard soon became the industry norm, as over [100 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/) joined in offering the new scale — even in second-tier markets (think [Charlotte and Dallas](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/)), where the money goes a whole lot further.

But not every firm is capable of keeping up with the Cravathians. While some boutique firms have lots of [cash to throw around](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associate-bonus-watch-firm-beats-cravath-scale-for-all-associates/?rf=1), lots of small and mid-sized law firms are not able to play with bankrolls that large. As Law.com [reports ](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/sites/dailybusinessreview/2018/01/11/how-small-and-midsize-law-firms-survived-the-big-law-salary-hikes/)in a recent survey, firms that can’t offer the biggest paydays on the block worry about their ability to recruit and retain the best talent:

A recent Robert Half Legal survey revealed 62 percent of lawyers at small and midsize firms said finding skilled legal professionals is somewhat or very challenging, while 31 percent of survey respondents expressed concern about losing legal personnel to other job opportunities in the next six months.

But there are benefits for those who choose a legal career away from Biglaw. Career advancement and challenging work are tools that smaller firms are able to leverage in recruiting:

One of the biggest advantages small and midsize firms have over large firms is partnership track offerings. While it certainly depends on the experience level of the attorney, more small firms are offering partnership track upfront in place of a higher starting salary during job negotiations. Another benefit for employees of small firms? Opportunities for more responsibilities on a higher volume of projects.

Top candidates still respond well to these non-monetary perks:

In the same survey, 28 percent of lawyers said that, aside from compensation or bonus, flexible work arrangements provide the greatest incentive for legal professionals to remain with an employer. Challenging work or variety of assignments ranked second, receiving 26 percent of the survey response, followed by professional development opportunities, at 20 percent.

There is also the matter of reducing the stresses of a high-powered legal career. [Another survey](http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2017-11-30-Survey-Four-In-10-Lawyers-Object-To-Workplace-Stress) reports 42 percent of lawyers cite reduced stress levels as the top part of their job they would change. While employers can’t do much about irritating opposing counsel or a demanding judge, they can offer flexible work schedules, telecommuting, and casual work environments to entice talented attorneys.

The big payday Biglaw offers is certainly nice, but it really isn’t everything.

# Summer Associate Offer Rates (2019): Which Firms Had 100 Percent Offer Rates?
## Did everyone at your firm receive an offer? Let us know!

‘We got offers!’

We’ve had yet another incredibly slow season in terms of summer associate gossip. We suspect that one of the main reasons for that — on top of their fears of indebtedness and unemployment — is that summer associates were happily working in the hopes of earning HUGE paychecks after graduating from law school. Not all law firms boosted [first-year associate salaries to $190K](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), but summers at those that were on their very best behavior.

Money makes the Biglaw world go ’round, and it also makes summer associates act like a bunch of little goody two-shoes. That being the case, you’d think that this summer’s offer rates would be absolutely awesome. But are they? Let’s find out which firms have handed out offers to 100 percent of their summers — information that rising 2Ls will want to know as on-campus interviewing season is already in progress or about to begin at many of the country’s most elite law schools.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While we know that many firms have already issued offers, some are still waiting until summer associates are back in school. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been a peep about a 100 percent offer rate at a single law firm yet — not because it isn’t happening per se, but because we simply haven’t heard about it yet.

And what about the Biglaw firms that were hesitant to raise salaries in the first place but made the leap nonetheless? Was that pie-in-the-sky $190K starting salary a bit too high for firms to willingly make offers to entire summer classes? That’s a scary thought for those awaiting offers.

If you have offer rate information to share, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Summer Associate Offer Rates”), or text us (646-820-8477). We’ll keep you anonymous. If and when we receive enough information, we’ll do a follow-up story.

Thanks a bunch, and to those of you who have already landed offers, congratulations!

# What The Legal Teams Of The Future Do Differently
## Legal teams that embrace new technology will be leading the future of eDiscovery. Here are a few changes you can start making today to set yourself up for long-term success.

[](https://bit.ly/2PRWl7Y)Over the past few decades, the technologies businesses rely on have evolved tremendously.  From a mass migration to the cloud to an increasingly remote workforce, the ability to work anytime, anywhere has become invaluable. The level of communication and collaboration that cloud-based platforms like G Suite, Slack, Zoom, and more have afforded workers has not only accelerated productivity, but also skyrocketed the production of unstructured data.  In fact, the average company manages 162.9TB of data hosted on an average of 88 applications. The data businesses are producing is scattered amongst different applications, jam-packed with dynamic metadata, and trickier to preserve.

If you’re a law firm, service provider, or any other [eDiscovery professional](https://bit.ly/2PRWl7Y), new platforms can make eDiscovery feel like finding a grain of sand in an ocean of information. However, with the right approach to these new platforms, there are ways to get ahead of the challenges they present. In this article, we’ll discuss a few changes you can start making today to set yourself up for eDiscovery success as information technology evolves.

Get to know the platforms you’re collecting from

It seems simple, but not enough people take the time to truly understand the platforms they’re collecting from. Whether it’s Box eDiscovery or Zoom eDiscovery, unless you’re using the platform everyday, it’s hard to comprehend the bells and whistles of the interface. If you’re a beginner in Slack for instance, you may not understand the difference between a workspace, a channel, or a multi-party message, which makes understanding the context behind information challenging.

If you don’t understand what the platform actually does and how its users interact with it, you’re not going to know how to search for the information you need. The days of collecting every last shred of data from platforms are over — with hundreds of thousands of messages, files, and users to sort through, narrowing down what you’re looking for is the best way to work smart and save time and money. To do this, you must educate yourself and your team on the ins and outs of the platform at hand and step into the user’s shoes. If you don’t know where to begin, get connected with an IT advocate who does. There’s no doubt the worlds of IT and legal are merging, and the technological knowledge gap when it comes to these platforms is a great reason why they should operate as a single unit.

Build relationships with vendors

It’s just as important to get to know the platforms you’re collecting from as it is to get to know the people behind them. When your client or team is assessing a new platform, their priorities are typically much different from yours. Where they might be assessing the platform’s efficiency and functionalities for their line of work, you’re assessing the platform’s eDiscovery capabilities. Not knowing the platform’s native capabilities and limitations from the start can have damaging effects to your eDiscovery process later on. For example, if the platform can’t process and
export its data in a comprehensive format, you’ll have trouble tracking down defensible data when the time comes.

For these reasons and more, it’s critical to connect with technology vendors and ask point blank what the platform’s legal limitations are. Consider questions like: What do your retention settings look like? Is there a legal hold functionality? Do you have a solution partner for defensible collection? The sooner you begin building relationships with your vendors, the sooner you’ll become an expert on the eDiscovery side of the platform leading to a quicker and more agile process.

Leave the knock-on-wood strategy behind

Even now, too many legal teams have a reactive rather than a proactive approach to eDiscovery. Whether it’s a client or even your own team, occasionally you’ll run into a “knock-on-wood” eDiscovery strategy where teams don’t prepare for eDiscovery until they’re forced to. The truth is that if you’re waiting for litigation to thrust you into learning about the eDiscovery capabilities of a platform for the first time, you’re already too late. Worst case scenario, you’ll come to find out important information was deleted, risky information was kept, or you simply can’t find what you need.

With rising data privacy laws like [GDPR and CCPA](https://bit.ly/2PRWl7Y), increasing security vulnerabilities, and the lax, chatroom-like nature of messaging platforms prompting more inappropriate workplace communication, waiting until litigation strikes is no longer an option. Understanding the nature of new technologies, the data they produce, and where that data lives, will help you assess risk and spot critical gaps that need to be filled before the time for eDiscovery comes. To be a proactive eDiscovery professional in the age of emerging technology, you have to ask the right questions, do the research, and assume you’re behind before you even start.

Embrace the velocity of innovation

Every new technology comes with new benefits, but also new risk — and risk is usually the opposite of what the legal community wants to engage with. However, this fact shouldn’t deter you from embracing innovation, instead it should motivate you. The technologies developed over the past few decades have broken down so many barriers. They’ve connected teams across the globe, empowered people through access to knowledge at an unprecedented scale, and allowed us to work smarter and faster with productivity automations. It is changing the way we operate for the better.  At times, it can feel impossible to keep up with rapid changes in tech, however, not being able to keep up is a good problem to have. We should challenge ourselves to shift our mindset on this front. Instead of scratching our heads at new technological terms, let’s learn what they mean. Instead of harboring our frustrations to ourselves, let’s express them to vendors and call on them to make native eDiscovery features more standard. There’s no way to simply hop on board the eDiscovery train of the future, we need to be the ones driving it. The bottom line is that wherever there’s electronically-stored information, there’s eDiscovery — and we’re not seeing a decline in ESI volume anytime soon. Instead of being the passengers of the future of eDiscovery, we need to be the drivers — and the ones steering the way will take a proactive, self-educational approach with every new platform that comes their way

People fret about politicians: Can Congress achieve anything? Can or should the Democrats eliminate the filibuster? Which political party is doing more to destroy America’s greatness — the “cancel culture” of the left or the destruction of voting rights on the right?

It’s enough to make your head spin.

Meanwhile, corporations — yes, corporations — are taking the lead on many issues.

Think about diversity and inclusion. Politicians may or may not be able to pass laws, but corporations can move ahead fairly easily. Increasingly, public companies have board subcommittees assigned to monitor progress on the diversity front. Is the board diverse and inclusive? Is the company? And, of course, critically: Are managers’ bonuses affected by whether the corporation is becoming more diverse and inclusive? Once money is on the line, results will follow.

Who cares what the politicians think?

It’s the same for many other issues, which now travel under the rubric of “environmental, social, and governance.” A [quarter of the money](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/1579898635453349233) that flowed into stock and bond mutual funds last year flowed into ESG funds. That’s a lot of money. ESG funds captured $51 billion of new investments in 2020, up from $21 billion in 2019. That’s a lot of momentum.

If companies want to attract investments from ESG funds, the companies must have ESG-friendly policies. Companies that oppose climate change and favor inequality need not apply.

Who cares what the politicians think?

And companies themselves are of course getting ahead of the curve. You’re not seeing auto manufacturers commit to producing electric vehicles because that seems like a nice idea. You’re seeing those commitments because money is (or is anticipated to be) flowing into those products.

CEOs aren’t announcing the dates by which their corporations will be carbon neutral as an academic exercise. CEOs make those announcements because the CEOs fear being grilled by analysts at the next quarter’s conference call if the corporation isn’t doing the things that money perceives to be correct.

Corporations don’t have opinions on the culture wars: Corporations generally don’t favor or oppose abortion or the death penalty, and corporations don’t care who uses which bathroom. But on things that can affect profitability, corporations are remarkably astute. And on those issues, corporations are pursuing a new, and different, agenda.

‘We made partner!’

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Millennial attorneys are getting older, so partnership is easier to see, and it’s a closer ring for them to achieve. Another issue is where we’re sitting in the economy right now. A lot of millennial attorneys have seen folks go in-house and be unhappy, or be unhappy in compensation, or get laid off. That is also a big factor.

— [Ru Bhatt](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/ru-bhatt?byconsultantorauthor=ru-bhatt), a partner at Major, Lindsey & Africa in New York, [commenting](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/20/more-millennial-lawyers-now-say-they-want-to-make-partner/) on the results of a survey on millennial lawyers’ perspectives created by MLA and Above the Law, which found that nearly 45% of associates said they would like to make partner at their firms (up from 23.5% in 2021).

# Lawyers Often Shouldn't Refer Matters That Can't Be Monetized To Other Lawyers
## Not all referrals are created equal, and lawyers should often not refer work that cannot be monetized simply because they do not want to deal with the matter themselves.

Referrals are a common practice within the legal profession, and this column has previously discussed how [referrals can have advantages for both the referring attorney and the lawyer receiving the referral](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/referrals-are-good-for-everyone-involved/). If a lawyer is too busy with work, or they do not have expertise in a particular subject matter, they may refer the matter to another lawyer who can more easily handle the work. However, not all referrals are created equal, and lawyers should often not refer work that cannot be monetized simply because they do not want to deal with the matter themselves.

Shortly after beginning my law practice, I received all kinds of referrals. Some of the referrals helped me expand my practice and assisted me in building the financial foundation upon which I relied as a self-employed lawyer. However, I also received a number of referrals that were not helpful and took time away from better referrals that could help me expand my firm.

For instance, shortly after beginning my own law firm, a former colleague of mine asked me if I handled real estate matters, and I said that I did. This lawyer then told me that his family friend had a real estate matter that he wishes to discuss with a lawyer. When I talked to this person’s friend, I found out that the friend was disputing around $500 in charges that his landlord had deducted from his deposit for alleged damages to his apartment. The friend asked me for advice about whether the charges were legally justified and whether to take legal action against the landlord.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I was frustrated by the other lawyer for referring this matter to me. Since the matter was only worth $500 in total, there was almost no way that I could monetize the matter. However, I had to be considerate to the person who had the legal issue since I did not want this person to write a negative review of me or have a bad experience with my practice. I ended up spending considerable time on the phone with this person and communicating by email to make sure that this person had a solid grasp of his legal rights with respect to his deposit.

It was obvious to me that this lawyer friend of mine should have simply assisted the friend himself and not passed this person along to me. The lawyer friend could have easily searched for relevant information and assisted the person with his legal needs. This lawyer friend of mine had a prior connection to this person that I did not have, so if anyone was going to assist this person without a financial incentive, it should be my lawyer friend and not me. However, the lawyer friend used me as a “garbage disposal” instead of handling the matter himself, and I even suspect the lawyer thought he was doing me a favor by setting me up with the person who had legal questions!

To make it perfectly clear, I am not saying lawyers should never offer advice for free. Indeed, I am often generous when it comes to handling small matters without charge to friends and family because I have a connection to the people I am serving. Sometimes, handling tasks for free can lead to additional work, and I even remember a time when I was in Biglaw in which we handled a matter for free for the relative of a client so that we would get more work.

However, if a lawyer is approached by a friend or relative with a legal issue that likely cannot be monetized, they should try to handle the matter rather than refer it to someone else. Before lawyers refer work to others, they should think about whether a matter can be monetized or whether it is the type of matter that they can handle as a favor to a friend or relative.

## Yet another firm is pushing back its broader reopening date. Will your firm be next?

Day by day, and even hour by hour, return-to-office plans continue to change for law firms across the country thanks to the Delta variant of COVID-19. Some firms avoided this issue entirely by choosing not to make employees return to the office in 2021, but for the firms that went a different route, it’s getting a little complicated. Many firms have decided to push back their original reopening dates, and others are now mandating vaccination for all lawyers and staff if they wish to step foot into the office.

For reference, the following firms are requiring all employees to be vaccinated before they return to the office: [Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Arent Fox](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ballard Spahr](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Boies Schiller Flexner](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Carlton Fields](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/skadden-mandates-vaccines-for-all-sidley-remains-mum-on-vaccination-but-pushes-back-reopening-date/), [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Cozen O’Connor](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Crowell & Moring](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Davis & Gilbert](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Debevoise & Plimpton](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Dickinson Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Hanson Bridgett](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/company/social-meteor/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Patterson Belknap](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/top-biglaw-firms-chair-beseeches-lawyers-staff-to-get-vaccinated/?rf=1), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), [Schiff Hardin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Seyfarth Shaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Sheppard Mulllin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1), [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/skadden-mandates-vaccines-for-all-sidley-remains-mum-on-vaccination-but-pushes-back-reopening-date/), [Stroock & Stroock & Lavan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/), [Wilson Sonsini](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/wsgr-delays-opening-delta/), and [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1).

Last week, Ropes & Gray notified all employees that effective August 9, they would not be able to enter the office [without proof of vaccination](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/top-biglaw-firms-chair-beseeches-lawyers-staff-to-get-vaccinated/?rf=1). At this point, the firm is still within Phase 1 of its reopening plan (i.e., permissive office use). Today, the firm notified lawyers and staff that it would be moving to Phase 2, a broader reopening for all personnel, on October 18, a bit later than originally imagined. On top of that, Ropes will require vaccination for all, “subject only to exceptions approved by HR for valid medical or religious reasons.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s memo (available on the next page):

As we mentioned last week, the vaccination rates of our people are high. Close to 99 percent of our lawyers and more than 92 percent of our business support team are already fully vaccinated. Many colleagues who were previously reluctant to be vaccinated got their first shot last week and we expect others may do so upon full FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine which is anticipated soon. We continue to strongly urge members of the Ropes community to be vaccinated.

The firm will continue to offer free food for all lawyers and staff who come into the office prior to a full return in mid-October.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# At Lunch With David Boies, 20 Years After His Departure From Cravath

Twenty years ago this month, [David Boies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Boies) left the storied partnership of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. And the world of Biglaw — or the legal world in general, or even the world at large — hasn’t been the same since.

This legendary litigator — yes, I like alliteration, but the sobriquet truly applies here — needs no introduction to readers of Above the Law, or to informed citizens more generally. [David Boies](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/david-boies.html) is the nation’s [most famous practicing lawyer](https://bol.bna.com/big-laws-most-famous-practicing-lawyer-is/) (no, Judge Judy doesn’t count). It seems he’s been involved in every major litigation of the past 50 years, from the IBM and Microsoft antitrust cases, to [Bush v. Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore), to [Hollingsworth v. Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollingsworth_v._Perry) and the battle for marriage equality.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

These high-stakes cases explain why even your non-lawyer relatives and friends know of David Boies. But within Biglaw circles, he’s also famous for founding [Boies Schiller Flexner](https://www.bsfllp.com/index.html) (“BSF”). The spectacularly successful firm, with more than 300 lawyers across [14 offices](https://www.bsfllp.com/about-us/overview.html), enjoys a reputation as a [“national litigation powerhouse.”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB954975765562566916) And it has the financial rewards to prove it: profits per partner of [$3.15 million](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784617547) in 2016, according to the latest [Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/), and associate bonuses as high as [$350,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k-again/).

Based on how much you’ve read about Boies over the years, you might feel you know him already; few lawyers have generated as many media mentions. At his Georgian-style mansion in the tony suburb of Armonk, New York, a hallway connecting his two wine cellars is lined with his press clippings. And then there are the books, including legal journalist Karen Donovan’s [v. Goliath: The Trials of David Boies](http://amzn.to/2rv5gl9) and Boies’s own (superb) memoir, [Courting Justice](http://amzn.to/2rrxOMj).

But how well do you really know David Boies? How much do you know about this legal superhero’s “origin story”?

Those of us of a certain age are familiar with his involvement in cases like Bush v. Gore or Hollingsworth v. Perry because we followed them in real time. Less well known, but no less fascinating, are his early days as a lawyer post-Cravath — how he quit the partnership of one of the world’s most prestigious and profitable law firms to go hang a shingle in the suburbs — a tale to which I now turn.

A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of lunching with Boies at [Sparks Steak House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparks_Steak_House).[[1]](#f1) Boies used to be a regular at the Four Seasons, where he [estimates](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/dining/the-fate-of-the-four-seasons-restaurant-hangs-in-the-balance.html) he has dined more than 500 times, sometimes twice in the same day; but after that renowned restaurant closed last year, he patronizes a rotating set of midtown eateries.

When I arrived shortly before our noon meeting time, Boies was already ensconced in his regular corner table — an excellent spot, visible to the entire room and yet not within earshot of other diners. We were joined by his longtime publicist, Dawn Schneider, an unobtrusive presence; she occasionally jumped in with helpful questions and comments, but Boies is an old hand when it comes to talking to journalists.

Part of the David Boies legend is his rejection of high fashion. He’s a millionaire many times over, and many aspects of his lifestyle reflect what I’m guessing is a nine-figure net worth — his [primary residence](http://www.westchestermagazine.com/Westchester-Magazine/January-2005/The-Go-To-Guy/), an 8,000-square-foot mansion on almost 10 acres; an [$8 million pied-à-terre](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/lawyerly-lairs-boiess-bargainthe-legendary-litigator-snaps-up-an-8-million-apartment/) here in New York City, at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel; and a [racing yacht](http://www.superyachtnews.com/owner/racing_zenji), because you’re nobody until you have a yacht. But his wealth doesn’t go into his wardrobe. He eschews Prada and Patek Philippe in favor of navy blue suits [from Sears or Lands’ End](http://archive.fortune.com/2010/10/19/news/companies/david_boies_profile_full.fortune/index.htm), inexpensive [plastic wristwatches](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/crimelaw/features/4404/) (worn over his sleeve), and what [look like](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/clash-of-the-biglaw-titans-ted-olson-and-david-boies-meet-in-second-circuit-showdown/4/) black sneakers (but are actually [walking shoes](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/magazine/an-open-case.html) by [Merrell](http://www.merrell.com/US/en/home)).

So I was pleasantly surprised by his appearance on the day we met. The 76-year-old Boies was looking trim and healthy, sporting a summery, button-down shirt in blue gingham under a well-fitted blue blazer. If the shirt and jacket were inexpensive, they didn’t look it.

Soon after my arrival, our waiter — an old-school “waiter,” an older white male with a hard-to-place European accent, not a chirpy “server” fresh out of hospitality school — hustled over to pour wine for “Mr. David” and his guests. I’m not much of a drinker (thanks to the [“Asian flush”](https://www.healthxchange.sg/food-nutrition/food-tips/asian-flush-alcohol-red-face)), and certainly not a midday drinker, but this pour I couldn’t refuse.

Hawk and Horse Vineyards

Boies is an oenophile, an avid wine collector (his collection contains [more than 8,000 bottles](http://www.winespectator.com/magazine/show/id/53073)), and also a winemaker. He’s the founder and owner of [Hawk and Horse Vineyards](https://www.hawkandhorsevineyards.com/) in Lake County, California, from where our [cabernet](https://www.hawkandhorsevineyards.com/wines) came. I usually find cabernet sauvignon a bit oaky and overpowering, but this wine was perfect — well balanced, yet robust enough to stand up to a steak lunch.

After tasting the (delightful) wine, we placed our orders. Boies went with a shrimp cocktail to start and vacillated between the filet mignon and the lamb chops, before going with the lamb — medium, charred on the outside. After hearing the waiter advise Boies that the lamb was healthier than the filet, I went with the filet. We declined the sides like hash browns or baked potatoes (no carbs for this lean litigator), then dove into our discussion.

In 1997, Cravath, Swaine & Moore (“CSM”) was arguably the nation’s number-one law firm (a status it maintains to this day, although its grip on the crown was even stronger back then). It’s rare to see partners [leave Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/), and it was even more rare 20 years ago.


This New York Times Magazine cover story, featuring a baby-faced Boies, came out in June 1986, when he was still at Cravath.

David Boies was then one of Cravath’s most prominent partners, thanks to his [successful handling](http://archive.fortune.com/2010/10/19/news/companies/david_boies_profile_full.fortune/index.htm) of IBM’s antitrust litigation and CBS’s defense of a libel lawsuit from General William Westmoreland. Boies was 56, seemingly in the prime of his career, earning a reported [$2.1 million a year](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/15/nyregion/to-avoid-conflict-over-yankees-suit-lawyer-quits-firm.html) (a much bigger deal in 1997 than today). He had been at Cravath for some thirty years, the entirety of his legal career since graduating from Yale Law School in 1966 (except for two years working on antitrust and judiciary issues for the U.S. Senate).

Why on earth would Boies want to leave the [Death Star](http://lawoffashion.com/blog/story/07/28/2011/77) to become an [Ewok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewok) in the wilds of Westchester? As it turned out, he didn’t have much of a choice.

At the time Boies was representing the New York Yankees in an antitrust dispute with Major League Baseball over a practice called “revenue sharing.” This did not sit well with Time Warner, one of Cravath’s most longstanding and lucrative clients, which had recently acquired Turner Broadcasting System — owner of the Atlanta Braves, a potential defendant in the Yankees/MLB litigation.

This was a business conflict rather than a true conflict in the legal-ethics sense (as ethics experts like Geoffrey Hazard of Penn Law and Stephen Gillers of NYU Law said at the time). If anything, ethical considerations pointed in the direction of not abandoning a client midstream because of objections from a different client — which is why Boies was determined to stand by the Yankees, no matter what.

Time Warner, however, stood firm in its opposition to Cravath working for the Yankees — a position that CEO Gerald Levin communicated in a Friday afternoon phone call to [Samuel Butler](https://www.cravath.com/sbutler/), Cravath’s presiding partner (and the relationship partner for Time Warner). Butler in turn conveyed this to Boies, on vacation in Las Vegas, that same afternoon. By the time Boies walked from his room at Caesar’s Palace back to the craps table, he had a sense that he might have to leave Cravath.[[2]](#f2)

The next few days passed in a blur. Boies returned to New York on Saturday night, a day earlier than planned. Over the weekend, he consulted with his wife (and fellow lawyer), [Mary McInnis Boies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Boies); some of his partners, including Sam Butler and Tom Barr, another [top Cravath litigator](https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/01/28/law-blog-obituary-tom-barr-of-cravath-swaine-moore/); and his client George Steinbrenner, owner of the Yankees. Boies proposed a compromise — not naming the Braves as a defendant in the Yankees’ yet-to-be-filed lawsuit, which Steinbrenner was fine with — but Time Warner remained adamant.[[3]](#f3)

Torn between loyalty to his client and to his firm, Boies felt that the best solution for all involved would be for him to resign from Cravath. And that’s [exactly what he did](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/why-david-boies-left-cravath) when the weekend was over.

On Friday afternoon, David Boies was a partner at Cravath with three or four active cases and a dozen lawyers working for him. On Tuesday afternoon, he had no colleagues and one client, the Yankees. As he said to a reporter at the time, “When I graduated from law school, I had zero clients, and now I have one client, the Yankees. So I see myself as ahead of the game.”

And he quickly had more than one client. Within hours of the news breaking, Boies received calls from the general counsel of DuPont, the general counsel of Georgia Pacific, and real estate magnate Sheldon Solow. Each of them said, “Now you have two clients.”[[4]](#f4)

With four (and soon more) clients, Boies confronted a different problem: no lawyers. When he left Cravath, a parting both sides described as [amicable](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/15/nyregion/to-avoid-conflict-over-yankees-suit-lawyer-quits-firm.html) (at least [officially](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB864255165233512500)), the firm was supportive and helpful; CSM gave him furniture, including his old desk, and help from its IT staff in setting up his new office. But Boies, for his part, agreed not to take anyone out of Cravath for a year.

Luckily, one of Boies’s most trusted colleagues from his Cravath days, fellow Yale Law grad Robert Silver, was no longer at the firm, having returned to YLS on an academic fellowship. When Boies reached out to Silver, Silver joined his former mentor without hesitation.[[5]](#f5)

Another lawyer who couldn’t resist the call of David Boies: his son Jonathan, graduating from Tulane Law School that year. Jonathan was scheduled to join Kaye Scholer, but when David called his good friend and Kaye Scholer partner Jonathan Schiller and said “I need my son,” Schiller understood.

The next issue: office space, or the lack thereof. David Boies initially moved into the offices of his wife Mary’s successful boutique firm, Boies & McInnis, in nearby Bedford. Mary had launched her firm in 1988, after serving as an in-house lawyer at CBS and on the White House Domestic Policy Staff, and the firm had grown to include about a half-dozen lawyers. David thought that Mary’s business model could become his model: a thriving boutique, with a handful of associates, located just a few miles from his home.

As we all know, that isn’t how things turned out. What happened?

“What I didn’t take into account was that Mary was much more disciplined and capable of saying no than I am,” Boies told me (seemingly indifferent to the fat, juicy shrimp arrayed before him, as I dug into my wedge salad). “I had a hard time turning down cases. And for the types of complex cases we wanted to do, we needed a critical mass of lawyers, so it was hard to keep to that small-firm model.”

And it was hard for David to remain in Mary’s offices.

“It lasted about 48 hours,” he recalled. “As Mary has said, it was a choice between continuing to share office space, or continuing to stay married. I totally destroyed everything — papers everywhere, her phone lines tied up, her fax lines tied up.” (For those of you who don’t know what a fax is, see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/this-social-media-thing-might-not-be-a-fad-law-firms-acknowledge/old-fax-machine-2/).)

“On Friday afternoon, Mary popped in said, ‘Sweetheart, how about we drive around and see if we can find you some offices?”

David and Mary Boies found a loft in Armonk, about four miles from their home, that fit the bill. It was a huge open space, with no private offices, so it needed some work. But because it had been previously occupied by a direct-mail and telemarketing firm, it had phone jacks galore (which was important back then; [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) was not a thing yet). After going to Costco to buy bookshelves and folding tables to complement David’s old Cravath desk, they were up and running.

I raised an eyebrow at the Costco furniture. Shouldn’t a law office smell of [leather-bound books and rich mahogany?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCQGcZdIcBc) But fancy furniture was not a priority for Boies: “I work wherever I am. It’s the trial mentality. When you’re on trial, you work out of a war room.”


Jonathan Schiller (via Boies Schiller Flexner)

For the first few months, David Boies & Associates consisted of David, his son Jonathan, Bob Silver, and one or two other lawyers. The next big change came in September 1997, when [Jonathan Schiller](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/jonathan-d-schiller.html) left the D.C. office of Kaye Scholer to join David Boies. The two men had been co-counsel on several matters over the years and had talked from time to time about joining forces; in fact, when Boies was leaving Cravath, Schiller tried to lure him to Kaye Scholer. But Boies didn’t want to go to another large firm and instead tried to convince Schiller to leave Kaye Scholer. It took Schiller a few months to make it happen, but happen it did. With his arrival, the firm became Boies & Schiller.[[6]](#f6)

Schiller was based out of Washington (we previously profiled his D.C. [Lawyerly Lair](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/08/lawyerly-lairs-a-powerful-partners-5-million-mansion/)), and his joining gave the firm a second office. Schiller also brought in additional colleagues, including [William “Bill” Isaacson](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/william-a-isaacson.html), then a junior partner at Kaye Scholer.[[7]](#f7)

Lawyers are great and all, but as everyone knows, a firm can’t survive without its staff. Having left Cravath, which had (and still has) some of the best staff in the business, Boies suddenly had to deal with all the issues that were magically taken care of when he was at CSM. As legal journalist Karen Donovan wrote in [v. Goliath: The Trials of David Boies](http://amzn.to/2rv5gl9), David’s wife Mary “could not imagine Boies divorced from the elaborate and intricate services that Cravath provided to its partners. ‘He had never bothered with the details that can grind you down.'”

I asked Boies: in the early days of the firm, how did you handle such matters? Finance and billing, information technology, human resources, and compliance with laws and regulations, whether federal or state or local?

“In the beginning,” he said with a sheepish smile, “I’m not sure we complied.”

In the first few years, Boies and his lawyers were so busy litigating cases and representing clients that they didn’t focus much on administrative issues — and sometimes things fell through the cracks. For instance, well after opening its Oakland office, the firm learned it had neglected to pay a certain city tax — which it had to pay belatedly, with interest and apologies.

Yes, Boies & Schiller added staffers, but not many. Administrative functions were initially overseen by a partner’s girlfriend. The firm didn’t get a bookkeeper until a year or so after launch (and even then, she worked only part-time). There was no recruiting or human resources department per se; personnel matters were handled by several different staffers, none of whom had experience in HR.

So as of September 1997, Boies & Schiller had about ten lawyers and a similar number of staffers working out of two offices, in Armonk and Washington. The firm did not have a presence in New York City, interestingly enough, and would not have a Manhattan office for quite some time.

“We number our offices,” Boies told me. “Armonk is #1, D.C. is #2, Orlando is #3 — we opened there in October 1997 — and New York is somewhere around #6.”

Orlando? I briefly imagined David Boies exclaiming, “I just left Cravath — I’m going to [Disney World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_going_to_Disney_World!)”

“One of our first clients was Florida Power and Light,” he explained. “The lawyers who launched our Orlando office worked with FPL. Some of them had worked with Jonathan at Kaye Scholer, and one of them I knew from my work at Cravath, so there was a certain logic to it.”

Launching in Orlando before New York or San Francisco reflected a truth about the early days of Boies Schiller. Although David Boies and Jonathan Schiller knew what types of matters they wanted — the most complex, interesting, and challenging cases around, for defendants and plaintiffs, sometimes on a contingency-fee basis — they did not have a grand plan for growing their firm. Instead of unfolding according to some detailed blueprint or business plan, the firm grew organically and opportunistically.


Joel Klein (via Wikimedia)

One crucial opportunity for growth came near the end of 1997. Prior to joining Kaye Scholer, Schiller had been partners at a boutique firm with a leading antitrust lawyer, Joel Klein. Klein went on to become the assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice, the nation’s top antitrust enforcement official, under President Bill Clinton.

In November 1997, Joel Klein reached out to Jonathan Schiller to see if Boies & Schiller would be interested in representing the Justice Department in a possible antitrust action against the software giant Microsoft. Today Microsoft and Windows have lost some of their mojo to Apple and Google and Facebook, but back then, Microsoft was both dominant in tech and wildly popular. As Fortune reported in February 1998, “Americans love Microsoft. They love its products. They admire its CEO.” Microsoft was the world’s most valuable company, having surpassed rivals like IBM and Exxon in market capitalization, and CEO Bill Gates was the richest man on the planet.

The idea of going up against Microsoft was daunting, even for veteran litigators like Boies and Schiller. The company had seemingly limitless resources, enabling it to hire the best legal and public-relations talent that money could buy. Its deep coffers also meant it could go the distance, dragging litigation out for years — much like the government’s legal battle against IBM, where Cravath and Boies prevailed against the government after thirteen long years.

Microsoft did not look like an ideal matter for a brand-new firm of a dozen or so lawyers. Boies admitted as much: “We had just gotten started, and we were already in way over our heads — far too much work, far too few lawyers. At Cravath, you worked hard but you had a lot of resources. Here, we were resource-constrained.”

Given all these considerations, why did Boies & Schiller agree to take on United States v. Microsoft?

“It was a case we just couldn’t turn down.”

On the bright side, the initial work called primarily for legal analysis as opposed to manpower. Boies was an antitrust expert, thanks to his work on the IBM case and on Capitol Hill, and capable of seeing things from a company’s point of view as opposed to the government’s. The DOJ wanted Boies to determine, as a threshold matter, whether or not there was a viable case against Microsoft for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.

After Boies concluded that there was in fact a strong case against Microsoft, Attorney General Janet Reno approved the lawsuit. Boies and the antitrust division prepared a draft complaint. The government took its concerns to Microsoft and tried to resolve matters prior to filing suit. After those talks broke down, United States v. Microsoft got filed — in May 1998, just one short year after Boies left Cravath to go out on his own.


John Warden (via Sullivan & Cromwell)

Determined not to let Microsoft drag on like the IBM litigation, Boies and the government outlined a plan for trying the case in fall 1998. Microsoft, represented by [John Warden](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/JohnL-Warden) and Sullivan & Cromwell, argued that any trial date before 1999 was unrealistic. But Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson — an experienced, no-nonsense jurist, and a trial lawyer himself before taking the bench — agreed with the government and set a trial date for September 1998.

Discovery got underway in June 1998 and finished in five months — an impressively short period, given the size and complexity of the case (but it’s amazing what well-resourced Biglaw firms can do when a court holds their feet to the fire). In October, the bench trial before Judge Jackson commenced.


Bill Gates at his deposition (via YouTube)

The most important part of the case, Boies told me, was persuading Judge Jackson that he couldn’t just take everything Microsoft told him at face value (especially as to complicated technological matters). Boies and his colleagues achieved this goal by catching Microsoft witnesses — including Bill Gates, whose deposition testimony was played at trial, to devastating effect — in statements that were evasive, not entirely accurate, or inconsistent with documents or plain common sense.

Gates, perhaps suffering from “smartest guy in the room” syndrome, sparred with Boies over the meaning of words like “ask” and “browser.” When asked who typed “Importance: High” on an email, he said, “A computer.” Such antics might have made Gates feel good at the time, but didn’t go over well with Judge Jackson.


Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson (via Wikimedia)

In November 1999, Judge Jackson issued detailed findings of fact that were devastating to Microsoft, laying out the company’s monopoly power and anticompetitive conduct in some 412 numbered paragraphs. In April 2000, after unsuccessful mediation talks presided over by Judge Richard Posner — if anyone could have resolved this matter, it would have been Posner — Judge Jackson issued his conclusions of law. He held that Microsoft had engaged in monopolization and [tying](https://www.justice.gov/atr/chapter-5-antitrust-issues-tying-and-bundling-intellectual-property-rights), in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In June, he ordered Microsoft to change its business practices and to break up its operating systems and applications programming businesses into two separate companies.

Judge Jackson’s order on remedy was stayed as Microsoft appealed to the D.C. Circuit (fun fact: future Chief Justice John Roberts, then in the Solicitor General’s office, argued in the case). The D.C. Circuit [affirmed in part, reversed in part](https://cyber.harvard.edu/msdoj/msft_ruling.html), and remanded for reconsideration of the remedy. The Justice Department, by now under the more business-friendly Bush Administration, settled with Microsoft on terms widely viewed as favorable to the company — the proverbial slap on the wrist, according to critics.

In light of the settlement, which fell far short of a breakup of Microsoft, what did United States v. Microsoft achieve?

“A key question in the Microsoft case was the applicability of the antitrust laws to high-tech industries,” Boies said, noting the argument [by some](https://www.cato.org/policy-report/marchapril-1999/policy-forum-milton-friedman-business-suicide), including Microsoft, that traditional antitrust analysis can’t apply to dynamic industries in the technology space. “One of the accomplishments of the case was to show that you can apply the antitrust laws to technology — and this understanding made room for the next generation of innovators, the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, to come along.”

Reasonable minds can disagree over United States v. Microsoft and whether it was good or bad for antitrust law, high-tech industries, or innovation. But what can’t be disputed is that Microsoft, which David Boies picked up just a few months after leaving Cravath, took him and Boies & Schiller to a new level of fame (and fortune, given the lucrative matters that came their way as a result).

To use tech-world parlance, Microsoft is when Boies “went viral.” The case introduced Boies to a whole generation of Americans too young to remember [Westmoreland v. CBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmoreland_v._CBS) or the [IBM antitrust litigation](http://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/09/business/why-baxter-dropped-the-ibm-suit.html). And it helped Boies Schiller obtain the cases and clients that fueled its growth into what it is today.

As our lunch drew to a close — having enjoyed my steak, I now had a post-meal cup of coffee before me — I asked Boies: if he could identify a secret to BSF’s success over the last two decades, what would he point to?

“One of the things we did right, from the very beginning, was that we did not bring on any lawyer who was not absolutely the best,” Boies said, in between sips of the Diet Coke he ordered instead of coffee. “We stuck to this policy even when we desperately needed more resources and were turning away business — and nobody wants to turn away business. In the short run, we left money on the table, but in the long run, this served us well.” (Jonathan Schiller said essentially the same thing — in a nutshell, “it’s the talent, stupid” — in his recent [Forbes interview](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/on-the-future-of-boies-schiller/) with David Parnell.)

It’s helpful to know what successful law firms and lawyers have done right. But it’s perhaps just as helpful to learn about mistakes and cautionary tales (which we cover extensively on Above the Law). I next asked Boies: looking back on both your career and on the history of Boies Schiller Flexner, what would you have done differently?

“When things work out well, it’s hard to know what you would have done differently,” he noted — but after this observation, which led me to fear he was dodging, he did what a good advocate does and answered the question.


Boies Schiller Flexner’s office in Palo Alto

First, Boies and his partners could have plotted out the firm’s growth more carefully, launching in locations in a way that was less opportunistic and more strategic. If they had launched in Palo Alto earlier, for example, their high-tech practice might have grown at a faster rate.

Second, regarding administrative matters, “we were wildly inefficient in the early days.” The firm should have hired more support staff, at an earlier point in its history, to manage the many functions that come with the territory of having a world-class law firm.

Third, BSF in the beginning provided too little in the way of formal training for our lawyers. “We’ve improved, and I’d now give us a B+ on training,” Boies said. “But in the early days, we were probably a C-.”

All this said, Boies doesn’t have much in the way of regrets. It’s quite possible that these perceived shortcomings actually contributed to the firm’s success in unexpected ways.

“If we had focused more on administrative things, we might not have been as focused on our cases,” Boies said. “If we had less of a sink-or-swim environment, our associates might not have gotten the early responsibility that helped them grow as lawyers very quickly.”

Despite improvements in training, feedback, and mentoring, BSF will never be a hand-holding sort of environment for young attorneys: “This is still, and probably always will be, a firm where lawyers get enormous responsibility early on.”

There are two reasons for this. First, there’s the firm’s structure. Because BSF has relatively low leverage, i.e., a low ratio of associates to partners, it can’t “tier” as much as other firms, with junior associates reporting to midlevels, and midlevels reporting to seniors. If BSF fields a team of four lawyers for a matter that a different firm would have assigned eight or twelve lawyers to handle, those four lawyers will get much more responsibility.

Second, there’s the firm’s extensive use of alternative fee arrangements (AFAs). Although BSF lawyers do have hourly rates — Boies reportedly charges [$2,000 an hour](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/2000-an-hour-lawyers-thats-one-way-to-fund-salary-increases/) (so my lunch was, in a sense, a $3,000 lunch) — about 50 percent of the firm’s work is done on AFAs, including flat fees or contingent fees. Because the firm isn’t getting paid to drag out matters, its lawyers must be efficient, which puts pressure on young lawyers.

Of course, BSF associates are paid well for their work. Under the firm’s [unusual compensation system](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k-again/), associates essentially get a portion of the revenue they generate for the firm. So if they work unusually long hours, handle a contingency fee case that hits big, or bring in a lucrative matter, that gets reflected in their year-end bonuses — which routinely [hit six figures](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schillers-bounty/), even for junior associates.

Boies stressed a point he has [made to me before](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-300k-bonus-at-boies-schiller/) in our annual December chats about BSF bonuses: “Our compensation system is based not on generosity but on fairness. We pay people the way we do because they’re operating from the start like owners of the business. In the early days, if we wanted to recruit the top people, we had to figure out how to distinguish ourselves — and this was one way of doing that.”

Associates at Boies Schiller work hard for the money — and so does David Boies. He’s now 76, with no need for more fame or fortune, but he continues to do what he does best: try cases.

Over his five-decade career, Boies has tried [more than 85 cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/business/dealbook/the-legal-odds-are-shifting-in-the-aig-case.html?_r=0), including ten where more than $1 billion was at stake. The high-profile Hank Greenberg trial, in which Boies defended the former CEO of AIG against civil accounting fraud charges, took place just last fall (and was [settled in February](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/business/dealbook/former-aig-executives-reach-settlement-in-accounting-fraud-case.html) for less than $10 million — a fraction of the $50 million sought by New York State, and a “nuisance settlement” in Boies’s view).

Given the demands of trial work, it’s hard to imagine a career as long as Boies’s. Boies told me about how a reporter covering the Microsoft case approached him and said, “My father watched your father try a case 25 years ago.” Boies, whose father was a teacher, said that couldn’t be right. The reporter said, “No, no, I remember what my dad said — it was this libel case against CBS.” Boies said, “That wasn’t my father….”

Indeed, the impressively modest, surprisingly soft-spoken Boies chalks up much of his success to sheer longevity: “When you do this as long as I’ve done it, if you did only two trials a year, that would be one hundred trials. A lot of things I’ve accomplished simply because I’ve stayed in the game as long as I have.”

Because of BSF’s growth, it’s no longer possible for David Boies to be involved (or potentially involved) in every matter at the firm. And it’s no longer the case that clients retain BSF with the hope or expectation that Boies himself will personally handle their matters (for example, trying a case if it doesn’t settle).

“For more than five years, I’ve been very selective in my cases,” Boies told me. “We have a whole firm of great trial lawyers, and a lot of the cases we have going on, important and fascinating cases, I’m not involved in at all.”


Karen Dunn

BSF represents several “new economy” companies like Uber and Airbnb; Boies has no personal connection to those cases. Oracle is a longtime firm client, but its last few trials were covered by other attorneys — longtime partners like [Bill Isaacson](https://www.law360.com/articles/684072/trial-ace-boies-schiller-s-william-isaacson), and young superstars like [Karen Dunn](http://www.insidecounsel.com/2015/12/30/boies-schillers-dunn-helps-guide-oracle-to-copyrig) (previously [profiled](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/boies-schiller-expands-in-d-c-by-hiring-young-legal-superstars/) in these pages). As Jonathan Schiller mentioned in his recent [Forbes interview](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/on-the-future-of-boies-schiller/), BSF no longer relies on a small group of rainmakers; several dozen partners have significant client relationships and books of business.

The firm that started off as David Boies camped out in his wife’s office now boasts more than 300 lawyers — and continues to grow. In the first few months of 2017, the firm made notable lateral hires, including [Dominic Roughton](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/boies-schiller-flexner-appoints-dominic-roughton-to-its-international-arbitration-team-in-london.html), who joined the international arbitration practice in London; [Travis LeBlanc](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/former-fcc-enforcement-chief-travis-leblanc-joins-boies-schiller-flexner.html), former Chief of the Enforcement Bureau at the Federal Communications Commission; and [Ann O’Leary](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/ann-oleary-to-join-boies-schiller-flexner.html), a top adviser to Hilary Clinton.[[8]](#f8)

In April, Boies Schiller Flexner expanded to Los Angeles by [combining with Caldwell Leslie & Proctor](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/boies-schiller-picks-up-a-top-boutique/), a leading litigation boutique. Integration is key when it comes to mergers, so David Boies and Jonathan Schiller recently visited BSF’s new L.A. offices, a bright, modern space on the 31st floor of [Ernst & Young Plaza](https://www.brookfieldproperties.com/portfolio/los-angeles/downtown-la/ernst-young-plaza/) in downtown Los Angeles. While there, they met with a key client and led a workshop with their new colleagues — reflecting their belief that even in our technologically advanced age, there’s still value in spending shoe leather to meet people face to face.

Boies expects the firm to keep growing, at about three to five percent a year: “If you don’t grow, you stagnate. You can’t attract the very best young lawyers unless they see opportunities for themselves that are created by growth.”

These opportunities — to handle cutting-edge cases, to represent clients to the best of one’s ability, to advance the public good, to improve as a litigator — are what draw aspiring trial lawyers to Boies Schiller Flexner. Yes, the money’s nice too — but as I wrote years ago, in a piece about the culture at Cravath, [Biglaw isn’t all about the benjamins](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/).

That’s a sentiment that David Boies surely agrees with, even if his time at Cravath is two decades in the rearview mirror. He might have been an odd duck at a firm famous for consistency and even conformity (look up the [“Cravath walk”](https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/03/07/law-blog-flashback-the-1992-death-of-cravath-partner-david-schwartz/)), but he does share his former firm’s commitment to excellence in lawyering and client service, with money as just a byproduct.

“At this point in my career, I’m most interested in the cases and the clients,” Boies told me. “The finances take care of themselves.”

To tweak an [old saying](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/314053/early-usage-you-can-take-the-boy-out-of-the-country): you can take the Boies out of Cravath, but you can’t take the Cravath out of the Boies.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Wows Associates With Move To Cravath Salary Scale
## Woohoo, big money!
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

One by one, almost every single member of the Am Law 50 — excepting a few — has raised salaries to match the now-prevailing Cravath scale. That means associates at these firms are raking in the big bucks to the tune of $215,000 for entry-level attorneys to $415,000 for the most experienced attorneys of all. That’s quite the payday!

Which firm is the latest to hail Cravath with its compensation?

That would be Wilson Sonsini, a West Coast mainstay that found itself at No. 36 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking after having brought in $1,130,000,000 in gross revenue in 2020. If you recall, the firm [matched the Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/wsgr-raises-22/) in mid-February, just days before [Davis Polk announced even higher salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/).

This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:

When the firm was still on the Milbank scale, ninth-years were receiving more money than eighth-years, but now on the Cravath scale, all of the firm’s most senior associates will receive the same salaries — and a $415K salary is certainly nothing to sneeze at.

Wilson Sonsini associates will see their raises reflected in their first April paychecks, retroactive to February 1. Congrats to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Wilson Sonsini.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# Navigating Strategic Relocations For Career And Lifestyle Advancement
## The decision to make a lateral move, especially one that involves relocating to a different city or state, is not to be taken lightly.

As the cost of living skyrockets in major hubs, the allure of cities like Atlanta and Houston grows stronger, tempting professionals to reconsider what they value most in their lives and careers. The days of practicing with one firm for your entire career are long gone. The intracity lateral movement that replaced it laid the foundation for the accelerating intercity lateral movement we see in the lateral market.

The prospect of relocating one’s professional and personal life to an unfamiliar environment presents significant challenges. Law firms recognize these concerns and consequently evaluate candidates’ connections to the prospective region as an indicator of their long-term commitment. Typically, firms prefer candidates who have prior residency, familial connections, or other significant reasons for moving to a new city. Strong local ties are deemed advantageous, although less substantial connections can be mitigated with appropriate justification, which can be enabled by working with a legal recruitment firm with a strong national platform to facilitate these cross-city moves. Increasingly, it is both common and accepted for legal professionals to seek relocation primarily for the purpose of enhancing their lifestyle.

Firm openings in markets like Atlanta and Texas – where King and Spalding just launched their Dallas office –  are attracting associates from other major markets, who seek relief from their comparatively onerous costs of living. New York associates in particular need help justifying the seemingly exponential cost differences relative to most other major cities. For associates not on the partner track, the cost savings alone can be a parachute for that precipitous drop into the unknown “next.” Our [Texas office](https://laterallink.com/locations/?region=Texas) has a wealth of experience assisting these cross-border moves into Texas and would be happy to help you explore your options in the largest state in the contiguous United States.



Back when I started [Lateral Link](http://www.laterallink.com) nearly 20 years ago, there was far less standardization in Biglaw rates among cities. Now, Biglaw associates in New York command the same rates as Biglaw associates in Houston. This might seem counterintuitive given the enormous cost of living differences between the cities, but the driver for these salaries is the bill rates that clients are willing to pay for premier legal services. By adjusting for the cost of living between New York and these other markets, we can visualize what your Biglaw salary can buy you.



Traditionally, a junior lawyer in New York City has been afforded the chance to represent some of the most prestigious and significant clients. The potential for achieving partnership offers substantial benefits, yet the demands on one’s lifestyle can be just as intense.

Washington, D.C. presents an attractive option for lawyers seeking growth in primary markets. Its flexible bar admission policies, including waivers for junior associates who meet specific criteria, make D.C. a desirable destination. The city’s legal scene is shaped by its proximity to federal agencies, offering leading roles in regulatory and appellate practices. Furthermore, the government sector provides valuable exit opportunities for those considering a shift from private practice, with dedicated support from industry experts like our Senior Principal and National Head of the Government Transitions Group, [Amy Savage](https://laterallink.com/team/amy-savage/), to facilitate these transitions. This scenario underscores the diverse challenges and opportunities across major legal markets, emphasizing the professional development and support available to attorneys.

While Biglaw continues to celebrate new frontiers in base salary and total compensation, the reality is that total compensation, eroded by one full-blown recession and a global pandemic, has never again reached the same levels it did when Simpson Thatcher set the new standard in 2007.



In today’s legal landscape, Biglaw associates are required to be more strategic and inventive than their predecessors, navigating a world where rising costs and stagnating wages pose unprecedented challenges. The financial pressures of living in major urban centers, coupled with a competitive job market, have made resourcefulness a necessity rather than a virtue. Associates are finding themselves in a position where they must carefully weigh the benefits of staying in expensive cities against the opportunities and quality of life that more affordable locales offer. The ability to adapt to these economic pressures by considering lateral moves to markets with a lower cost of living can significantly impact an associate’s personal and professional satisfaction. This shift necessitates a keen understanding of the legal market and a strategic approach to career planning, underscoring the importance of working with a knowledgeable and experienced legal recruitment firm.

As we observe these trends, it’s clear that the legal profession is at a pivotal point. The decision to make a lateral move, especially one that involves relocating to a different city or state, is not to be taken lightly. It requires a deep understanding of one’s career goals, the ability to navigate the complexities of the legal market, and the support of a trusted advisor who can guide you through the process. If you are considering a lateral move to enhance your career, improve your quality of life, or simply explore new opportunities, we invite you to reach out to us. Our team at [Lateral Link](http://laterallink.com), with our extensive experience and national platform, is uniquely positioned to facilitate your journey.

# Legacies, Unions, And Omnipresent AI. And A Dollop Of Girardi.
## Much like the horizon, the end of the tale of Tom Girardi continues to recede as we approach it.

The word “[legacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legacy)” seems to be top of mind these days. Legacy can have different meanings — some good, some not so good. A legacy can be a gift, something received from a predecessor, or connote special status because of a familial relationship.

Recently, legacy has taken on several unsavory meanings. One example: In the United States, the Department of Education is [looking into Harvard’s legacy admissions history](https://apnews.com/article/legacy-admissions-harvard-affirmative-action-diversity-24321f3814d5feec6d380d18c8b6c2e1), especially in light of the recent Supreme Court decision banning considerations of race in admissions policy.

Meanwhile, closer to home, the legacy of disgraced, disbarred lawyer Tom Girardi continues. In the most recent iteration, the state bar has suspended approximately 1600 lawyers for noncompliance with the client-trust account reporting rules put into place after the Girardi debacle, where he allegedly pilfered millions in settlement funds that were due to clients. The new [Client Trust Account Protection Program](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-28/california-bar-suspends-nearly-1-600-attorneys-for-violating-rules-set-up-after-tom-girardi-scandal) “requires attorneys to register their client trust accounts annually with the state bar, complete a yearly self-assessment of their practices managing client trust accounts and certify with the state bar that they comply and understand the requirements for safekeeping funds.” The suspensions are administrative, not disciplinary. There are no allegations in the suspensions that any attorney in that cohort has ripped off any client.

The bar wants to be proactive in taking measures to make sure that active attorneys who have client trust accounts (and that’s not necessarily all active lawyers as there are some active lawyers who do not handle client funds) toe the trust account reporting lines. No one, least of all the bar, which is under constant legislative scrutiny, wants the Girardi legacy to continue.

On another Girardi front, the hearing as to whether Girardi is competent to stand trial on the various criminal charges is set for later in August. The hearing may well turn into [a battle of experts](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2023/07/21/girardi-competency-judge-considers-lay-witnesses-theres-a-lot-in-this-case-about-credibility/). There are already mental health professionals for both sides. However, the court may allow lay witnesses on the issue of whether Girardi was faking or whether he truly had lost mental capacity at the times at issue in the criminal cases.

Given the writers and actors strikes here in Tinseltown (losing its luster as the strikes wear on), the unionization of associates at a firm raises all sorts of interesting issues, including, but not limited to [ethical ones](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/associates-at-this-law-firm-just-unionized-will-associates-at-other-firms-follow-along/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=268234132&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--jKJpPjRoJFzRer10ToC60VvNeLu-2yCE9nFbdGHAxgBjlSMB26aHAlu2odd7WZWW8Kt5lIsDhZ9IqJsyV80jx3vC-4A&utm_content=268234132&utm_source=hs_email). Is this the first event in a trend toward unions of associates in law firms? If so, what would that mean for pay, promotions, and other aspects of employment? What if unionized associates walk off the job in a dispute? Would that be considered client abandonment? (Yes, I know that the partners would need to get the work done, but how would that happen?) If there are no associates to do the work, how does the work get done? How are clients handled? What about immovable deadlines such as statutes of limitations? I’m just asking.

One of the major bones of contention in both the writers’ and actors’ strikes is the use of AI and whether it will replace actors (use of likenesses, etc.) and writers (ChatGPT). One law school has OK’d [the use of AI in the admissions process](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/top-law-school-welcomes-the-use-of-chatgpt-in-its-admissions-process/). Arizona State University says it’s confident in its ability to suss out misuse and be able to maintain integrity of the process. Isn’t that [the kind of thinking that the plaintiff lawyers used](https://www.lawnext.com/2023/06/court-imposes-sanctions-on-lawyers-who-filed-bogus-cases-after-relying-on-chatgpt-for-legal-research.html) in the recent case that brought sanctions down on them because they relied on ChatGPT to their detriment?

What if law firms were to use AI to replace striking associates? What about the impact of AI on paralegals and legal assistants? Can AI be trusted? Relied upon to provide accurate legal research? The ultimate responsibility for legal assistants and paralegals lies in the lap of the supervising attorney. AI doesn’t have to stand in front of an irritated court and try to explain an “oopsie.” Nor does AI pay sanctions.

Various judges have been urging law firms to give junior lawyers opportunities to argue motions, a skill that junior lawyers need to have if they are ever able to progress as lawyers appearing in court. However, one district court judge has a different take on that: if a court strongly suggests that a more junior lawyer be allowed to argue a motion, [could that be seen as interfering with the attorney client relationship](https://www.lawnext.com/2023/06/court-imposes-sanctions-on-lawyers-who-filed-bogus-cases-after-relying-on-chatgpt-for-legal-research.html)? Whose client is it? The firm’s? The relationship lawyer’s? [What do you think](https://www.abajournal.com/files/JohnstonOrder.pdf)? It’s the age-old conundrum of how do you gain the experience you need in order to be permitted to perform those tasks that give you experience? Briefcase carrying is not why peeps went to law school.

And I am not making this up. Sharing racy videos on TikTok is not in any judicial job description. A [New Jersey Superior Court judge](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/acjc/GaryWilcoxComplaint.pdf) faces disciplinary charges for a number of those videos, which [show him lip-syncing](https://www.thirteen.org/programs/nj-spotlight-news/nj-judge-under-investigation-for-tiktok-videos-1688590153/) rap songs from various locations, including the courthouse. Conduct unbecoming? What was he thinking?

Just another example of the perils of social media.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

We’ve written… a lot about COVID-19-inspired austerity measures. As Biglaw struggles with cash flow, collectables, and cost-cutting there are actually firms going the opposite direction. [Culhane Meadows](https://www.culhanemeadows.com/) is already the largest woman-owned, national law firm in the country, and rather than sit on that achievement, they’re actually looking to add to their roster of diverse voices at the firm.

In the latest episode of The Jabot podcast, I talk with Kelly Rittenberry Culhane and James Meadows about running a law firm during a global pandemic. We also chat about the importance of diversity, what other firms can do to make sure they are as diverse as possible, leaving Biglaw to start a firm, and what’s like to be responsible for keeping the lights on at their own firm.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Hot on the heels of the news that Paul Manafort was subjected to a [predawn raid](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/the-predawn-raid-on-paul-manaforts-house/?rf=1) at his home, with a search warrant suggesting that the special counsel questions whether Manafort can be trusted to properly turn over subpoenaed documents, Manafort is now switching up his legal representation.

Manafort is saying goodbye to Biglaw, giving [Reginald Brown](https://www.wilmerhale.com/Reginald_Brown/) and WilmerHale the boot. It’s not clear why — Reg Brown, head of the firm’s congressional investigations practice, is an experienced and highly regarded lawyer — but it’s worth noting that WilmerHale is the [former firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/biglaw-partner-named-special-counsel-in-russia-investigation/) of special counsel Robert Mueller.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Manafort has decided to go with the boutique firm of Miller & Chevalier, as [reported](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/10/hold-manafort-switching-legal-team-as-feds-crank-up-heat-on-him-hold-241507) by Politico:

A spokesman confirmed the change. “Mr. Manafort is in the process of retaining his former counsel, Miller & Chevalier, to represent him in the office of special counsel investigation. As of today, WilmerHale no longer represents Mr. Manafort,” Jason Maloni said in a statement.

[Kevin Downing](https://www.millerchevalier.com/professional/kevin-m-downing) will be heading the legal team. Downing has experience at the Department of Justice in cases involving tax fraud, Bank Secrecy Act violations, money laundering, mail and wire fraud, mortgage fraud, and securities fraud. Sounds like the Manafort team expects the heat to be turned up even higher.

# How Does Alex Spiro, Lawyer To The Stars, Get It All Done?
## He spills the beans on his 'special secret sauce' in a wide-ranging interview.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I have a photographic memory, basically—that’s my special secret sauce. That and my ability to sleep three and a half hours a day and process information quickly. If it weren’t for those things, I would have zero chance of survival.

— [Alex Spiro](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/spiro-alex/), a partner at Quinn Emanuel, in comments featured in the [New Yorker’s in-depth profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/how-alex-spiro-keeps-the-rich-and-famous-above-the-law) of the lawyer to the stars. From a young age, exemplified the traits necessary to become a successful lawyer. “At eighteen months, he talked like he does now,” his mother, Cynthia Kaplan, told the magazine. “I remember him saying, ‘Actually, Mom,’ at that age.” Later in life, his mentor’s assistant told him, “You won’t shut up. You should go to law school.” Now, as a Biglaw partner, he sometimes wonders if should choose another profession, but he just can’t seem to leave — the cases are too enthralling. “There’s no other fight like this,” Spiro said. “What other sophisticated profession is this binary, where somebody wins and somebody loses?”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Partner Up And Quits Her Job Because Biglaw Is The Worst

Reddit user [feeling-likealoser](https://www.reddit.com/user/feeling-likealoser/) asks the relationship subreddit how to deal with reactions when she tells them yes, she’s leaving her law firm job and no, she doesn’t have another job lined up.

The OP says they feel like a loser — hence the screen name — for taking some time off of the law firm rat race, but for my $.02, all I see is smart woman who knows what she needs even if it isn’t the same thing she’s worked the last 13 years for:

I (38F) resigned from being a partner at my law firm only to be unemployed and everyone around me questioning my decision.

I (38F) recently resigned from my position as a partner at a law firm that I have worked at for 13 years. I’ve been killing myself taking crazy assignments and working intense hours in order to further my career. I sacrificed so much for this company. Once I made it as partner, I realized that I was putting myself through a lot and the money just wasn’t worth it. While I made good money, I was not pulling in even 50% of the comp compared to my male partners that managed a book of business about 1/3 of my size. I’ve felt this way for a long long time but finally pulled the trigger after the partner in charge of my department didn’t make any of the changes I’d requested. I’m so burnt out I’m not looking for another position. I just want to be free of that toxic place and take the next 6 months or so to recover. Ever since I resigned, everyone in my life other than my husband has been questioning my decision even when I have clearly set boundaries. I have 3 more weeks with the firm and have agreed to transition the clients. Every client, coworker, family member, and friend has been in shock that I don’t have something lined up. They think it’s crazy to leave at the peak of my career in the middle of a pandemic. Honestly after all of this, I just need some time to myself. I’m completely drained. I don’t know how to best respond to this without ruining relationships or being way to personal with people that I don’t feel comfortable sharing my innermost thoughts. I feel like a complete loser that I don’t have something lined up but I really don’t have the energy anymore to put even a tiny bit of effort to find the next job.

What would you say to people when they ask why you are leaving and where you are going when 1) some are people you are not close with and 2) some are people you are very close with and care deeply about? Some coworkers I’ve known for a long time and I have really gone through the trenches. I don’t want to say anything that makes them feel bad about staying. I also feel like a complete failure when I say I’m taking time off. People are baffled and don’t understand why I wouldn’t work in my 30s.

TL;DR! I’m leaving my job of 13 years and don’t know how to respond to people that are baffled as to why I’m leaving at the height of my career to go nowhere.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For the record, in the comments the OP says she has no immediate financial concerns about her looming unemployment. So… yeah, she’s winning, because… Biglaw is fucking toxic. You can practically feel the misery seeping from her words, the brutal hours, the unfair origination credit, the sexism, and the desperation.

Maybe it’s just because as a recovering Biglaw attorney, I know a lot of former Biglaw people. And they are all happier now than they were in the midst of their Biglaw hell. I’d advise the OP that it doesn’t matter what other people think, and just tell them you’re doing what’s best for you right now. It’s both true and vague enough not to ruffle the feathers she’s concerned about.

And when the OP checks back in with folks after leaving her law firm far behind, they’ll be able to see the weight that’s been lifted off of her shoulders and how much happier she is, and they’ll understand why she had to leave.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

What’s the difference between litigating at a law firm and litigating in-house?

That obviously varies, both by firm and by corporation. Some corporations hire in-house lawyers to try cases. Life for those in-house lawyers may resemble life for outside litigators (although the in-house lawyers are spared the need to develop business and probably handle a different range of cases).

What if in-house lawyers don’t try cases?

The rest is irrelevant.

Well, it’s not really irrelevant; it’s actually quite important. But it’s stuff that’s undervalued by many firms. The “irrelevant” stuff includes clearing conflicts, and (maybe I’m being too harsh on some firms here) developing associates, and raising the firm’s profile (such as by writing articles or giving speeches that don’t directly generate business), and answering 1700 interrogatories, and fighting with opposing counsel about whether the deposition will be in Houston or Dallas, and firm management, and proof-reading bills, and on and on and on.

How does life as an in-house litigator differ?

Scratch “develop business” off the list. You have one client, and business will take care of itself.

Scratch “bill time” off the list. Although you still obviously have to do your job, most (but not all) corporations don’t require their in-house lawyers to track time.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Win cases” stays on the list. You may not be arguing motions (as you were at a law firm), but you still must ensure that the right arguments are being made by your counsel in the most persuasive way.

But “winning cases” is just one item among many. Here are the other chores that you must handle in-house:

Keep the business in the loop: Senior folks in the business don’t naturally know what cases are pending against their business and when key events in those cases may occur. You’re at the helm; share that information.

Keep finance in the loop: Finance doesn’t know anything about your lawsuits, but finance is keenly interested in what reserves you’re taking, what events are on the horizon (such as trials, mediations, or summary judgment motions) that might require you to take reserves, the amounts of likely reserves, and so on. You’re at the helm; share that information.

Keep internal audit and external auditors fully informed: Depending on the situation, these folks might care about litigation. Someone must remember to tell them.

Ensure that proper processes are followed: Specified people within the organization probably have to approve settlement offers at certain levels. When some guy in the business unilaterally offers $1 million to avoid losing a client that’s important to him personally, you’re responsible for explaining the rules to that guy. Under Sarbanes-Oxley, you have a system for tracking litigation and related reserves. You must ensure that people use that system and that it’s accurate. When the auditors periodically (and at least quarterly) ask you to confirm that the system remains up-to-date, that’s your responsibility.

Improve the engagement of your team: Folks on your team should find their jobs engaging and satisfying. That’s your job. (And it’s probably a part of your job that’s quite different from anything you thought about at a law firm.)

Develop your team: In-house litigators may be one-trick ponies — they’re litigators, not generalist corporate lawyers — with little opportunity either to advance or to move into other parts of the business. If people on your team have an interest in moving up in your organization (or sideways, or even out), you must find those opportunities. Identify “stretch projects” that expand the skill sets of people on your team, and otherwise tend to the people who report to you.

Promote diversity: This may be a corporate goal, and you may be partly responsible for achieving it.

I’m trying to be neutral about this. Some people may read this list and think that, on reflection, jobs at law firms sound very attractive. Some people may read this list and think that in-house jobs sound better. I’m not passing judgment here. I’m simply explaining the difference between those two types of jobs, so people can make an informed choice between them.

With on-campus recruiting season nearly upon us, rising 2Ls across the country are trying to create some meaningful distinction between the firms they hope to score interviews with. May we suggest looking at the firms’ pro bono numbers?

Over the course of the last year, members of the legal profession have sprung into action to deal with crisis after crisis after crisis, offering their services without cost to those in need. From travel bans to natural disasters to border family separations to the fight for reproductive rights, lawyers in America were inspired to do their very best to help those who needed their assistance the very most.

But which law firms were able to contribute the most to society?

The American Lawyer has compiled a ranking of Am Law 200 firms based on their pro bono work in 2018. Half of their scores come from the average number of pro bono hours per lawyer, while the other half represents the percentage of lawyers who performed more than 20 hours of pro bono work.

Here are the [top 10 firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/06/26/the-american-lawyers-2019-national-pro-bono-rankings/) when it came to pro bono emergencies in 2018:

- Jenner & Block
- Covington & Burling
- Patterson Belknap
- WilmerHale
- Orrick
- Hughes Hubbard
- Skadden
- Paul Hastings
- Dechert
- Ropes & Gray

# How Do I Research For A Lateral Interview?
## Here are some helpful, publicly available resources.

Everyone tells you it’s imperative to research for your upcoming interview. But they don’t often advise on how or where to research.

Here are some helpful resources that are publicly available:

- The firm bios of the interviewers, as well as their LinkedIn profiles (if available).
- The practice group’s website, as well as the latest press releases and news articles about the group.
- Social media: follow the firm on LinkedIn and on Twitter.
- A Google news search: Set up an alert ([https://www.google.com/alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts))!
- Legal 500 ([https://www.legal500.com/](https://www.legal500.com/)): Learn about a practice and notable practitioners, and see how the firm’s group ranks compared to those of peer firms.
- Chambers and Partners ([https://chambers.com/](https://chambers.com/)): Similar to Legal 500, see how the group ranks in the local market and who are the top practitioners.
- Chambers Associate ([https://www.chambers-associate.com/](https://www.chambers-associate.com/)): While Chambers and Partners is geared more towards potential clients, Chambers Associate addresses associate experiences at various law firms. A caveat when it comes to this guide and Vault (below): complaining sells more than happy associates, so take what you read with a grain of salt.
- Vault ([https://www.vault.com/vault-guides/law](https://www.vault.com/vault-guides/law)): While you have to pay for the full firm profiles, some information is available at no charge.
- NALP ([https://www.nalpdirectory.com/](https://www.nalpdirectory.com/)): This directory is my go-to resource for information on compensation, partnership tracks, and diversity initiatives. Information is provided by each law firm.
One major advantage to working with an experienced legal recruiter is that we will help you prepare and share our research. When I work with you as my candidate, I will:

- help you articulate your personal story, your reasons for looking to move, and why you would be an asset to the new employer;
- provide you with detailed interview tips, sample questions to prepare, and an “interview prep worksheet,” so you can focus your prep time;
- give you intel on the interviewers, the firm, and the group that is not publicly available; and
- even conduct a mock interview, if you feel it would be useful.
Please also see my article on [12 Lateral Interview Tips from a Legal Recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/12-lateral-interview-tips-from-a-legal-recruiter/), and please [reach out to me](mailto:AGordon@laterallink.com?subject=Your%20ATL%20article) if you are looking to explore new opportunities or would like to learn more about the legal market and the lateral hiring process.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Say Farewell To OCI Hell: Biglaw Firms Are Now Relying On Precruiting To Fill Their Summer Associate Classes
## The earlier Biglaw firms can interview eligible candidates, the better.

Biglaw’s on-campus interview (OCI) process seems to start earlier and earlier each year, with fall interviews having crept into the summer. But as it turns out, some firms now seem eager to avoid OCI altogether with their own precruiting of eligible law students. In fact, just last year, Biglaw firms made more early offers than ever recorded by National Association for Law Placement — 23.3% of all offers to second-year students (3,145 offers, to be exact) came as a result of early recruiting.

NALP executive director Niki Gray refers to these precruiting measures as a “free market alternative” to OCI, which for some Biglaw firms, is working out smashingly. [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/09/13/bye-bye-oci-law-firms-pursue-free-market-alternatives-to-artificial-campus-recruiting/) has additional details on how well it’s worked out for Wilson Sonsini, with its new Accelerated Consideration for Employment (ACE) program:

Through Wilson Sonsini’s early recruiting, law school applicants have tended to receive and accept offers at higher rates than candidates recruited through the traditional on-campus interviewing process, according to Cherie Beffa, the senior director of attorney recruiting at Wilson Sonsini. …

This year, after formally launching its ACE program, Wilson Sonsini had an offer acceptance rate of 57%, above the industry average of 41%, per NALP. Further, the ACE acceptances represent 68% of the firm’s 2024 summer class, according to Beffa.

“ACE accomplished what we were hoping: students who knew that they wanted to be at Wilson Sonsini were able to stand out and show us their excitement about our firm specifically,” Beffa said. “They secured their summer employment early and were able to move their focus back to their classes, journals … and other important law school experiences.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As precruiting offers are handed out, more and more firms wish to do the same to fill their summer classes early. “It’s a bit of a FOMO effect,” Gray told [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/09/13/bye-bye-oci-law-firms-pursue-free-market-alternatives-to-artificial-campus-recruiting/). “There are firms who believe they need to do this to get to the top talent so they’re not competing with other firms in OCI, and the more firms that do this to feel competitive, the more other firms join in.”

Goodwin Procter has also gotten in on the early recruiting action, with Ashley Nelson, the managing director of the firm’s legal recruitment department noting that the firm is “committed to recruiting top talent, including pre-recruiting if necessary.” Nelson went on to say that the firm used precruiting to hire more than half of its 2023 summer associates.

Meanwhile, firms like Sheppard Mullin are getting nervous about the amount of early interviews that are going on. Caroline Menes, the firm’s director of legal recruiting, told [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/09/13/bye-bye-oci-law-firms-pursue-free-market-alternatives-to-artificial-campus-recruiting/) that she was concerned because “that is [hundreds] of students I won’t have the chance to impress.” Because Sheppard Mullin doesn’t want to “get shut out of the race for talent,” the firm is going to give some more thought to precruiting law students next year.

Is your firm using early interviews outside of the OCI process to recruit new talent? If it’s not, perhaps it should be, because this is where entry-level recruitment seems to be headed.

# Resolutions Revisited
## Why Jerry Springer’s advice may be the key to 2021 law firm success.

Most of 2020 has felt like a bad Jerry Springer episode. Just when you think it can’t get worse, it does. Most of us have aged about a decade in the past nine months, but the vaccine is here, and hope for a better 2021 is on the horizon. Through it all, the legal industry seems to just keep on keepin’ on, muscling through at least the third once-in-a-century event of the past 20 years.

Last year, [I made some New Year’s resolutions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/5-steps-every-law-firm-leader-should-take-now-to-prepare-for-2019/) for myself, my firm, and my industry with the goal of having a stronger, healthier, more profitable future. As the days get shorter and the holidays approach, I’d like to revisit some of those resolutions through a post-COVID lens to talk about where we’ve all been since and how we’ve done.

Prepare For A Potential Downturn — Check!

I’ve long been beating the drum that the legal industry hadn’t adequately prepared itself for the next economic downturn. It took us nearly a decade following the Great Recession just to claw back our losses, a recovery that lagged far behind the broader business world. Our industry’s general aversion to adopting new technology and business practices certainly didn’t help, and much of the Biglaw middle class saw business shifting either up the ladder to the highest of the high-prestige outfits, down to low-cost boutiques, or out of the traditional industry altogether, either to in-house attorneys or alternative legal service providers. We haven’t exactly poised the industry for success, and so, when COVID-19 emerged, people were rightly concerned.

I’m happy to say, it seems to have gone overall better than expected. Many firms were able to tighten their belts or get aggressive on collecting AR to cover the shortfalls suffered in Q2 as businesses shut down and lawyers everywhere switched to working remotely. After things settled down, we saw incredible scrappiness and hustle from attorneys everywhere. Instead of fearing change, many people embraced it — or at least didn’t let their fear of it stop them. By and large, the industry managed to keep the lights on, with most firms putting out performances in Q3 and Q4 that outpaced what anybody could have expected back in March. Part of that was luck: white-collar workers like ourselves were able to adapt to COVID-19 in ways other segments of the workforce logistically couldn’t. But much of it was an industry of hard-working professionals rising to a historic moment. I’m proud of what we did, and hope firms keep this newfound discipline and ingenuity in place going forward.

Back when we could amble into a conference room, grab a cup of coffee, gossip for a few minutes, and then get down to business, meeting management was a constant problem. Meetings tended to get set without sufficient thought and would often swerve off the rails into unrelated topics or over the allotted time. They were far more pleasant to be involved with, but they were often more of a drag on efficiency than they needed to be.

For as little as many of us enjoy the concept of yet another Zoom meeting, I have to say that forcing people to sit down, log in, and show their face onscreen has been surprisingly good for keeping meetings focused and high-quality. I wouldn’t recommend dropping in-person meetings altogether when we can safely hold them, but the past few months have forced many of us to reconsider the purpose of a meeting, and to think more carefully about how to best craft individual meetings to meet the goals of those in attendance.

Pandemic life has been hard, especially on those with families to care for and juggle during the workday. This time spent going through that experience together has made the lawyers I know come to value their own time more highly, and each other’s. While that upside may pale in comparison to the overall tragedy of COVID-19, it’s at least something good that most of us will take away from this awful time.

Resolutions Where Your Mileage May Vary

My list encouraged attorneys to build up their nonlegal networks and knowledge bases, and to spend more time listening and less time talking, and to engage in self-care. These were personal challenges, not really susceptible to industry-wide interpretation. COVID-19 gave some of us unprecedented opportunities to succeed, while for others it took the chance away entirely.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Networking, either within or outside of the legal industry, has been massively hampered by COVID-19. Having lunch or splitting drinks with strangers and business acquaintances is basically the opposite of everything medical professionals have been asking us to do for the past nine months.

Building nonlegal knowledge bases has been a more achievable goal. Many of us have used the past few months to develop our skill sets. Some have learned to code, play an instrument, or paint. Sourdough breadmaking memes were a big thing on Instagram for most of April. Whether out of boredom, the desire to better ourselves, or just something forcing us to stay put for a while, many of us have made good use of their quarantine. These kinds of things both make us more well-rounded humans, and in surprising ways can circle back and help us out professionally.

Listening to one another has both been easier and harder in the world of remote workplaces. I’ve seen some teams that do a great job checking in with one another regularly, and that have become far more deliberate about seeking out feedback and making everyone feel heard. Other teams I’ve seen drift off into their own silos, with communication falling down to a minimum. It takes more effort to talk these days, which means we have fewer chances to hear what our teammates are really saying. Listening is a challenge, one that many of us need to continue to work on to improve, even after the lockdowns have lifted. We need to vow to maintain the relationships we’ve built during this time and repair the ones that have fallen off.

Finally, self-care has been more important than ever. For most of us, the past few months have been a grueling mental and emotional marathon. Finding ways to relieve that tension in healthy avenues has been a literal necessity. Law is hard, and lawyers can be hard on one another.

Back to where we started: Jerry Springer. In addition to holding a J.D. from Northwestern, he’s a man who’s seen more than his fair share of craziness. So perhaps as we move forward into 2021 we should take the advice he offered at the close of every episode: “Take care of yourself … and each other.”

Biglaw firms are mandating office attendance across the country, and while some are holding bonus eligibility over associates’ heads, others now seem to be doing something that could be considered even more drastic. Some attorneys are hurting for billable hours, and the best way to get them at this Am Law 100 firm is to head to the office, because that’s where partners will be assigning them to associates.

Cozen O’Connor — a firm that brought in $619,017,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 74 on the Am Law 100 — has suggested that its attorneys spend three days in the office each week, and is now suggesting that partners favor those who are complying with the firm’s return-to-office policy when it comes to handing out work.

Here are some additional details from the [Legal Intelligencer](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2023/09/26/cozen-oconnor-looks-to-favor-officegoers-in-work-allocation/):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

“What we have said is we will encourage partners to give work to those who are in office,” said firm executive chairman and CEO Michael Heller. “But obviously client needs and services are top priority. … We will allocate work based primarily on who is best able to handle it.” …

Instead [of going after bonuses], the firm is looking to “really impact those who made the decision that they don’t agree with our position that being in the office is better than not being in the office, and they’re making the unilateral decision to stay out of the office,” Heller explained.

As far as the firm threatening associate bonuses based on their office attendance, Heller said, “[W]e don’t want to go there. Bonuses are based on lots of information—it’s not a quantifiable, formulaic measure for us.” (But aren’t those bonuses based, at least in part, on billable hours, which will now be more difficult to obtain if associates aren’t in the office?)

Heller went on to tell the Legal Intelligencer that Cozen has learned that the “quality of work is not necessarily impaired by being in office or not in office,” and yet, this new billable-hours policy for partners still came to be.

On the plus side, Heller did note that Cozen will never have an official attendance mandate because he assumes that “the significant majority of our lawyers will comply with our encouragement and expectations.” While a number of other firms have moved into requiring four days of office attendance each week, Heller said that the only thing that’s certain for his firm is that the five-day in-office work week is over.

“I don’t have a crystal ball to know whether we end up in a three-day or four-day schedule,” Heller said, leaving the firm’s options open when it comes to future attendance. “[But] I can say definitively the five-day workweek, in my judgment, will never resurface.”

Ultimately, Heller emphasized that the revision to the firm’s policy did not constitute a mandate, noting that the firm’s philosophy when it comes to its RTO policy is “to encourage people to get the best experience they can get as a lawyer at the firm.”

Cozen O’Connor’s new billable hours policy is one that may hurt attorneys even more than dipping into their bonuses for noncompliance with attendance requirements. Is your firm considering offering billable hours only to those who are present in the office?

# From 'Are We Having Fun Yet?' To 'Are We There Yet?'
## He stuck a fork in himself.

Are we having fun yet? An old friend of mine decided to retire from the bench when he realized that he wasn’t having fun anymore. He made that decision after spending close to 20 years as a judge, but when the COVID-19 lockdown came, he realized that all he was doing was continuing cases into the “ether,” and he decided he was done. He did not want to continue to do something that had lost interest for him. He was a great judge, patient and decisive (would there were more of those). He concluded that not only was he done with judging, but he didn’t want to sit by assignment, nor did he want to wander off into the realm of private judging. He had stuck a fork in himself, and he was done, kaput, finished, and he’s never looked back. Good for him. Practicing law and then being on the bench were means but not ends. There’s a lesson for all of us here.

What struck me the most about what he told me was that he was no longer having fun. Let’s stipulate that judging is serious work, from small claims to death penalty matters, but he was no longer enjoying what he was doing, thus, his motivation to retire. Practicing law and fun, judging and fun are oxymorons, aren’t they? But should they be? It depends upon the definition of fun, which everyone defines differently.

I’m not saying that being happy practicing law is a condition subsequent, but I do think that there must be something in the practice that makes it worthwhile, even fun from time to time. Fun is certainly not in the cards every day (and we can thank opposing counsel, difficult clients who don’t see the value in our advice and push back about paying for it, and the courts for “not having fun” days). However, we have to find some sense of enjoyment from what an unbearable grind daily law practice can be. I am sure that there were days, even weeks, when my friend didn’t have fun, but my overall impression is that he enjoyed the work, he enjoyed his colleagues, and he felt that it was all worthwhile. As I said, everyone has a different definition of fun. One lawyer’s fun might be torturing opposing counsel, another lawyer’s definition might be seeing a “hot mess” case resolve. This is not “one size fits all.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But this all goes back to whether lawyers have any senses of humor. And [in a column](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/old-lady-lawyer-what-is-an-soh/), I wrote some years back, the jury (pun intentional) is still out on that.   There’s a big difference between taking the work seriously, which we all do, and taking ourselves seriously, which we should not. Being able to laugh at some of the ridiculousness we all confront as lawyers helps us to keep ourselves on even keels. My retired judge friend has a wicked sense of humor that held him in good stead on bad days.

I understand well the pressure that lawyers are under; I was under such pressure more times than I can count. But what got me through the worst of the times — and there were definitely some doozies, both external and good old corporate infighting (watch your front, watch your back, etc.) — was a sense of humor, that all this will pass at some point. And it does, just not necessarily fast enough. Hang in there.

Turning to the “are we there yet” department, there’s new data that women who hold faculty and administrative positions at law schools are [still second-class citizens](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/when-nine-are-not-enough-where-are-the-female-law-school-deans/). As Chris Williams points out, nine (!) female deans at all ABA approved law schools are not enough. Nine may not even be enough for the Supreme Court, but that’s a topic for another time.

Law school deanship data show that we are not even close to being there yet in terms of parity of female leadership of law schools. The low percentage of female deans is shocking, especially in this third decade of the twenty-first century. Not only deanships, but faculty positions as well. How many women are on the non-tenure track, teaching legal writing and research? How many women have tenure? Why aren’t there more women as deans? What’s the problem here? Shouldn’t the law school administrations and faculty look more like the law school classes, which are now more than 50% women?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the old days, ads were “help wanted male” and “help wanted female.” The EEOC put the kibosh on [gender-specific want ads](https://www.inforum.com/community/tracy-briggs-help-wanted-male-vs-help-wanted-female-ads-might-be-why-women-were-burning-their-bras) in 1968, a little more than 50 years ago. Just look at the differences in the available jobs for men and those for women. I especially liked the ad in the “help wanted female” category that says, “train for a full-time career in being nice to people.” I am not making this up.

But it’s not just the paucity of female deans and faculty. [Who is getting the corporate work](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/the-inequity-of-who-gets-the-corporate-work/?utm_campaign=ATL%20Weekly&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=224557598&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--urS02QgALWp7kNnAoXMPl57fevL9HCd3GdKG96-k7pqIomE_SRegyKmP1k9kTpW7gBA-uZtfd4irqpX33y-ybs3GtwQ&utm_content=224557598&utm_source=hs_email)? Not women-owned law firms, not even 20%.

Law school administration and faculty, Biglaw equity partners and chairpersons, general counsels, the panoply of positions that women should fill, and we are still not there yet. What is it going to take and how much longer? I know, I know, “Don’t ask a question you don’t know the answer to.”

# The Global 100: Fractured Futures At The Richest Law Firms In The World (2017)
## Uncertain times may be ahead of us given their financial performance.

The American Lawyer just released its latest edition of the Global 100, a ranking of the world’s 100 largest law firms by total revenue. How did these firms do in the year that was? As we learned from the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, revenue per lawyer flatlined, and that statistic was rather telling; in fact, it was one that could “mark the beginning of the end” for this period of post-recession recovery. On a global scale, things were rough in 2016.

Here is some analysis from the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202798448937/For-Global-Law-Firms-Is-This-as-Good-as-It-Gets?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

[T]his year’s Global 100 survey suggests that conditions for the world’s largest law firms are getting even more challenging. Total Global 100 revenue rose just 2.8 percent in 2016, to $99.3 billion—the lowest annual gain since the recession and the second consecutive year of slowing growth. (Group revenue is still likely to pass $100 billion next year for the first time ever, however, requiring an increase of just 0.7 percent to hit that milestone.)

Having fallen by 2.1 percent in 2015, the group’s average revenue per lawyer (RPL)—a key measure of law firm health and efficiency—remained essentially flat last year, at $813,000. Global 100 RPL has increased by just 5.7 percent over the six years since the end of the recession—far below the rate of inflation.

An even more alarming picture is emerging at the bottom line, with total net income growth plummeting from 8.6 percent in 2015 to just 2.7 percent last year.

This resulted in the first decrease in average Global 100 profit per equity partner (PPP) in seven years, with that metric dropping half a percent, to $1.59 million.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This is worrisome. From the sounds of it, the future for Biglaw firms across the globe will be challenging and uncertain. As Chris Johnson of the American Lawyer wondered, is this as good as it gets for global law firms? We will continue to watch these trends over the course of this year.

Here are the top 10 firms of the 2017 Global 100 (i.e., the top 10 firms ranked by 2016 revenue). This is the second time in history that the top 5 firms are U.S.-based:

- Latham & Watkins: $2,823,000,000
- Baker McKenzie: $2,670,000,000
- Kirkland & Ellis: $2,651,000,000
- Skadden Arps: $2,495,000,000
- DLA Piper: $2,470,000,000
- Dentons: $2,205,000,000
- Clifford Chance: $2,087,500,000
- Allen & Overy: $2,059,500,000
- Jones Day $1,977,000,000
- Linklaters: $1,950,000,000
There was a bit of disruption in this year’s rankings, thanks to Kirkland’s meteoric rise. Not only did the firm’s gross revenue jump by 15 percent, but its profits per partner surpassed $4 million for the first time ever. DLA Piper, on the other hand, dropped two places this year, and it’s the first time the firm has placed outside of the top three since 2011 (when Am Law first began treating DLA’s American and global arms as a single firm). Jones Day made its way back into the top 10, and Freshfields was forced out entirely (in fact, the firm is now in 14th place, its lowest ever position since Am Law started this ranking almost two decades ago).

# Skadden's Hiring Practices Under Scrutiny: Greg Craig Attorneys Say There's Nothing Wrong With Helping Paul Manafort's Kid Get A Biglaw Job

[Last week we told you](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/why-did-skadden-hire-paul-manaforts-daughter-the-government-has-a-theory/?rf=1) that the curious case of Andrea Shand’s employment at Biglaw giant Skadden Arps was making news. Why is Shand’s job as an associate from 2012 – 2016 a hot topic? Well Shand’s dad is none other than Paul Manafort. You may remember that Manafort engaged Skadden on behalf of the Ukrainian government. As part of that representation, the firm wrote a report (which was [a featured part](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/the-biglaw-bill-taking-center-stage-at-the-second-manafort-trial/) of the Mueller investigation’s case against Manafort) justifying the prosecution of former Russian-aligned Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s political rivals.

The engagement has also led to charges against former Skadden counsel Greg Craig. Craig, [the first prominent Democrat](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/ex-skadden-counsel-has-honor-of-being-first-prominent-democrat-charged-in-mueller-probe/) to face charges as part of the Mueller probe, was indicted in April for making false statements to the Department of Justice in connection with his work at Skadden. (Former Skadden associate, Alex van der Zwaan, already [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/) to lying to investigators in the Russia probe about his communications with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates.)

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

In an earlier filing in the Craig case, the government argued that Craig was instrumental in getting Shand (née Manafort) hired by Skadden. Craig even wrote to firm management saying “perhaps one of the most important” reasons to hire Shand was the “potential for significant future business” with her father. The government argued his actions on behalf of Shand demonstrates how far Craig was willing to go to keep Manafort’s business.

Now Craig’s lawyers have responded, seeking to prevent prosecutors from making the argument Craig got Shand hired by Skadden in front of the jury. Oh, no, it’s not because Craig didn’t influence the hiring decision, but, because it was no big deal. As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/05/17/greg-craig-says-nothing-tawdry-about-helping-manaforts-daughter-get-a-skadden-job/) Law.com:

“No one can dispute that, by introducing Andrea Manafort to his law firm’s management, Mr. Craig performed a favor for Mr. Manafort. But in performing that favor, Mr. Craig was not acting alone or in secret, nor did he violate some firm policy or practice,” the defense lawyers said. “The law firm as a whole became engaged in reviewing Ms. Manafort’s credentials and her prospects for success as an associate. The favor performed by Mr. Craig was unremarkable and benign; he crossed no lines in taking actions that benefitted not only Ms. Manafort but the law firm as well.”

Remember, Craig intervened in Shand’s potential employment after she’d received a rejection letter from Skadden (internal emails later refer to this as an administrative “screw up”). But Craig’s team says this type of behavior is typical at “any law firm”:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“The favor that Mr. Craig performed was the type of action that any partner at any law firm might have taken on behalf of a client or a professional colleague,” Craig’s defense team at Zuckerman Spaeder said. “With this evidence, however, the government implies that, to curry favor with Mr. Manafort and thereby potentially bring in new business for Skadden, Mr. Craig was willing to cross some line—ethical, moral, procedural—to assist Mr. Manafort.”

Craig’s lawyers also argue that lay people in the jury couldn’t possibly understand the complex scratching of backs that they say is typical in Biglaw:

“The government hopes that jurors, who are not familiar with law firm hiring practices and protocols, will find something improper or tawdry in Mr. Craig’s acts, and thereby be more apt to find that he did something unlawful in his interaction with [Foreign Agents Registration Act].”

There was certainly nothing illegal in Craig acting to get Manafort’s daughter hired by Skadden. But were Craig’s actions part of a routine practice? Well, that has to give even Biglaw experts some pause. Let’s not forget Shand was hired in 2012 — during one of the biggest downturns the legal industry has ever seen. Indeed, Shand was only applying to Skadden because the firm she summered at — Dewey & LeBoeuf — was imploding, taking her job offer along with it. The 2012 downturn derailed a lot of young lawyers’ Biglaw dreams, well, those that didn’t have an influential father go to bat for them.

# What In The World Can Be Done About Millennial Lawyers?

Millennials at your firm?

Millennial lawyers! Am I right? They’re so needy and lack motivation. They expect instant gratification and immediate promotions and accolades. Who do they think they are? And what in the world are we going to do about them?

Are you nodding your head in agreement right now? Then, let me guess — you’re probably a Baby Boomer or Gen X managing partner. And all of your new millennial hires are the bane of your existence. You have no idea what to do about them other than hold internal seminars at your firm, where you learn a bit about this generation. During these events, everyone wrings their hands and frets over the lack of ambition and drive exhibited by the latest round of associates — and then leaves feeling frustrated, with no actionable ideas or plans.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If this sounds like you or your firm, then guess what? Your limited — and limiting — perspective is a contributing factor to the millennial associate issues that your firm is facing. Don’t believe me? Then read “[What Millennial Lawyers Want](https://smile.amazon.com/What-Millennial-Lawyers-Want-Practice/dp/1543805310?sa-no-redirect=1),” a recently published book written by Susan Smith Blakely. In it she explains what makes this generation tick, and how managing law firm partners can change their outlook and embrace the many qualities that make this generation unique and valuable to law firms seeking to thrive in the coming years.

But before we get to some of the strategies she suggests that firms undertake in order to make the most of their millennial lawyers, let’s learn a bit about them.

First off, there are three times as many millennials as there are Gen Xers. And, in just two years, this generation will make up over half of the workforce; within a decade their numbers will increase to nearly 75 percent. In 2017, millennials represented two thirds of the workforce and nearly 25 percent of all lawyers were from this generation. And Baby Boomers are retiring at too fast a rate for the much smaller group of Gen Xers to fill their shoes. In other words, in just a few years, the future of your firm will be built upon the shoulders of millennial lawyers. Or maybe robots. Take your pick.

So whether you like it or not, millennial lawyers are here to stay and if your firm envisions growth in its future, you’d better figure out how to get along with them and get the most out of them. Great news, though: there’s lots of advice in this book that will help you do just that.

First off, you need to acknowledge the many positive attributes of members of this generation. As someone who works for a fairly large California-based tech company (in case you’d like to look it up, it’s MyCase, an AppFolio company) I work with them all the time and can assure you that they are smart, hard working, and driven to succeed. But as Blakely explains, their definition of success may very well differ from that of you and your more-seasoned colleagues:

“(M)illennial lawyers care less about big salaries and bonuses and extravagant social events than they care about healthy law firm cultures and work/life balance, and they understand that law firm prestige is often based on false indicators. They still aspire to be partners in law firms, but they want to be partners on terms that make sense to them and within the context of their lives.”

Next, she offered steps that law firms can take to keep millennials at their firms — some of which are based on input from millennial lawyers. Here were her recommendations:

- Develop training programs to help them understand your law firm so that they can more easily and quickly integrate into it.
- Ask them for feedback about changes they’d like to see and respond to their input.
- Provide them with more information on the business of law so that they better understand — and have confidence in — the firm’s strategies for success in the future.
- Place lawyers in management positions who are strong leaders; good lawyers aren’t necessarily good leaders.
- Don’t base associate value on billable hours alone; instead focus on factors like the quality and quantity of work, involvement in the firm, involvement in pro bono matters, and community involvement as a channel for business development.
- Create a work environment where associates feel as if they’re working with someone rather than for them and de-emphasize requirements of hierarchy.
- Provide more meaningful opportunities earlier in their careers.
- Use communication styles that are familiar and comfortable to them.
- Provide greater flexibility as to when and where they work.
- Emphasize intergenerational team building so that there are more opportunities for senior members to share their wisdom with junior lawyers.
- Educate all lawyers on unconscious bias.
- Embrace and take advantage of their love of technology.
- Increase transparency.
These are just a few actionable ideas. There are lots more where this came from in the book. Also useful is the second half of this book, which provides an assortment of stories designed to showcase the lessons that can be learned from the generation of lawyers that preceded Baby Boomers.

I found this section of the book to be a bit of an unexpected departure from the first section, but the stories provide some useful insight and could conceivably be used to encourage discussion during a firm workshop on working with and providing value to — and getting value form — millennial lawyers.

Of course, it’s not just about catering the needs — and whims — of millennial lawyers. Part of ensuring the success of millennial lawyers in law firms for year to come also involves some deep navel gazing on the part of millennials, a fact that Blakely acknowledges and addresses.

So for the millennial lawyers reading this post, rest assured that you’re not entirely off the hook. You’ve got some work to do as well. So tune in in two weeks for my next column which will provide advice to millennial lawyers to help them thrive in the law firms created and run by their predecessors. No doubt they have some work to do, but you’ve got to meet them halfway, and next week, I’ll tell you how to do that.

# Biglaw Firm's Leader Thinks Partners Need To Return To The Office To Guide Associates Back
## Partners need to get their butts to the office -- or else. Start this trend, Biglaw.

‘This could’ve been done on Zoom, but I have to be here just like you.’

Biglaw firms really, really want their lawyers to come back to the office. While many firms have encouraged associates to spend three days in the office each week, others have mandated those three days, and some have even gone so far as to tie bonus eligibility to office attendance. Thus far, the focus seems to be on forcing associates back into the office — but what about the partners?

One Biglaw firm has got the right idea, and its managing partner is looking into ways to get partners to lead the way back into the office.

Bob Bodian of Mintz Levin — a firm that brought in $617,700,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 75th place on the most recent Am Law 100 — says that office attendance “starts and ends with the partners.” And why are the partners so important when it comes to getting attorneys back to their desks? “They have to buy into it and see a reason to be in and start coming in more,” he said. “It’s definitely an issue.”

As noted by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/mintz-chief-wants-partners-to-lead-associates-back-to-office), Mintz currently has a “flexible” hybrid policy, with lawyers expected to spend 60% of their time in the offices. Bodian isn’t too keen on mandating an attendance policy right now because a great deal of the firm’s partners are still working remotely. “It’s not really our style,” he told Bloomberg. “Once you do that, you have to enforce it.”

“We have less attorneys coming to the office than I’d like to see, or less frequently than I like to see,” he added. “So, I’m trying to figure out how to sort of change that without making too many rules.”

Bodian is correct, of course, when he says that partners must be the first to return to the office. Biglaw firms need to lead by example, and who better to set the example than the partners? If we want hybrid work schedules to actually work well, the partners need a voice.

Perhaps if partners were to raise objections over the time wasted on their commutes when they could have been working from home instead, that would matter. And if those partners were to complain about a having a set schedule of in-office days, that would matter too. Stop threatening associate bonuses, and start insisting that partner pay could be in jeopardy. Laughable, right? Mandating that partners come to the office before associates could be a game changer.

In his wide-ranging interview with Bloomberg — which covered the firm’s financial successes (its gross revenue was up about 5% from 2021), a new Toronto office, and plans for a Miami office — everything came back to office attendance at the end of the day:

“I’m trying to balance the size of the place, and the profitability and the culture and not getting picked apart,” Bodian said.

His approach to office attendance is part of the calculus.

“I think about making sure that the firm is someplace where my partners want to be, and where associates want to be,” Bodian said. “Not make too many rules, but also try to make it more business-like and be big enough to continue to drive the profit.”

Biglaw firms should make some rules for partners when it comes to returning to the office. Let’s see how that works out. Maybe associates wouldn’t be getting the short end of the stick if the office-return rules applied equally to everyone, top to bottom.

# Some Job Perks Are Better Than Salary
## Sometimes, perks are a lot better than just free coffee.

‘Yessssss! This is awesome!’

As regular readers of this column know, I am a huge fan of “The Office,” which I watch almost every day. In one episode, the main character (Michael Scott) tries to explain that salary isn’t everything in a job and that sometimes job perks can make up for a lower salary. Although the things that the main character points to as being job perks that are better than higher salary are laughable, many job perks can make up for being paid less. The most obvious job perk that can offset salary is the ability to work remotely, but there are others.

Travel

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I once worked at a job that required me to be on the road about 80% of my time in order to attend court conferences, depositions, and other appearances. I spent over 70 nights a year in hotels, and the rest of the time I was out of the office at appearances close to my home. While traveling, I had all of my expenses — food, airfare, hotel costs, and so on — reimbursed by the firm’s clients.

The value of all those reimbursements could easily be in the tens of thousands of dollars. Having my food reimbursed was a huge perk; I love to eat, and I often had meals at great restaurants on my clients’ dime. When it came to hotels, airfare, and other costs, I would put this all on my credit card before being reimbursed and earned credit card points worth thousands of dollars in value. I also earned rewards points from hotels and airlines so that I could travel extensively for free on my own. Moreover, all of the travel was fun since I got to meet new people and be away from the office.

Of course, attorney travel has been substantially reduced in the post-COVID world of appearing virtually. However, if you have the opportunity to work at a job that requires travel, it might warrant accepting a lower salary in return.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I can get a little stir crazy, and I do not like being in an office. Not only is sitting in one place and working for an extended period difficult for me, I don’t always like to see my bosses when we are all forced to share an office together. Earlier in my career, I worked at a job that required me to attend court conferences all over the city close to where I lived three or four times per week. I also had to take a deposition every week or two, attend site inspections, hold client meetings, and fulfill other obligations that kept me out of the office for long periods.

While working at this job, I usually would spend my mornings in court, mostly sitting around with people I knew from past court experiences, having a fun time with acquaintances from around the courthouse. I typically would not return to the office until around lunch, and then I only needed to spend a brief time in the office before heading home at the end of the day. If I attended a deposition or another longer court appearance, I would usually head home if I could not be back at the office by midafternoon. Most of the time that I billed was due to appearances, so I spent much less time on the more boring tasks like dealing with discovery and drafting motion papers. Again, there are fewer jobs like this in the post-COVID world, but lawyers might consider taking less money for such a job.

All told, Michael Scott is likely right, and money is not the only thing that might motivate people to accept certain jobs. In some cases, job perks can convince a lawyer to accept a position that pays less.

# Biglaw Firm Tells Lawyers To Bill Clients For Time Spent On Toilet
## If you ever receive crappy advice from this mega-firm, you know who to blame.

Late last week, word began to spread that the world may soon witness [another Biglaw mega-merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/morning-docket-09-30-16/) between international firm Nabarro and London-based firms CMS and Olswang. The combined entity would have more than 3,000 lawyers, and the firm would likely generate more than $1.5 billion in revenue.

Considering the current economic climate, how would this Biglaw behemoth be able to produce so much money during the transitional phase that typically follows a merger? Perhaps the combined firm will adopt Nabarro’s time-recording policy, which instructs attorneys to bill clients for any break of up to six minutes (bathroom breaks, etc.), as they’ll likely continue to be thinking about the matter they were working on.

The [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3826800/Law-firm-charges-clients-100-time-spend-toilet-thinking-clients.html) picked up the story today, which made waves across the pond sometime this summer thanks to [RollOnFriday’s](http://www.rollonfriday.com/InsideInfo/LawFirmEuropeNews/tabid/382/FirmId/12/Id/4665/fromTab/68/currentIndex/1/Default.aspx) excellent reporting. Here’s Nabarro’s policy:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


When asked to explain this billing policy, a spokesperson from Nabarro said:

This approach to time recording is not unusual. Most businesses build natural breaks into the cost of their services. Indeed, some of our best legal minds have their best legal insights when they get up for a short break. Lunch is a different matter.

If you ever receive crappy advice from this mega-firm, you know who to blame.

# Why Do Lawyers Curse When They Work At Law Firms?

Why do lawyers curse when they work at law firms?

I hear you in chorus: “Because they hate their lives!” “Because their opponents in litigation are jerks!”

Fair points, I suppose, but that’s not what I’m thinking about today.

I recently had dinner with a lawyer-friend and his wife, and the wife said that she really didn’t like the lawyer working from home. His home-office was right above the room where she worked, and she could hear him cursing a blue streak all day. It bothered her.

Which got me to thinking: Do lawyers who work at firms curse more than in-house lawyers do?

I speak mainly from two long-term job experiences: Twenty years at one of the largest law firms in the world and 12 years in-house at a huge international company. Based on that experience, I offer this thought:  Lawyers in fact curse more when they work at law firms than when they work in-house.

I witnessed it.  

But is it coincidence, or is it generally true?

It just might be true. Here’s why:

Lawyers tend to have certain personality traits, including skepticism, urgency, and autonomy.  

Lawyers at firms tend to operate as fiefdoms: I have my clients and my lawyers who work with me. I speak whatever words the firm likes to hear about operating for the common good, but we all know that my clients are my power, and I’m not giving them up lightly.

Lawyers at firms are focused externally. They’re routinely dealing with opposing counsel and courts, and those players exasperate them.

Law firms tend to give short shrift to human resources departments. Human resources is basically: “You do the work; we pay you. We also teach you some stuff, largely by osmosis. Over time, there’s an outside chance we’ll invite you into the partnership. If you become a partner, we pay you more. If you like that arrangement, then stay. If you don’t like that arrangement, then leave.  Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.”

In that sort of environment, people curse.

The environment encourages you to curse, and there’s nothing controlling you.

In-house lawyers of course started with the same personality traits, but the traits have moderated over time.

In-house lawyers are not operating in fiefdoms. By definition, in-house lawyers have no portable clients. There are things to protect at a corporation, but your client base is not one of them.

In-house lawyers are working with internal clients far more than they’re working with opposing counsel. At many corporations, external counsel deal with opposing counsel in litigation. The in-house lawyers handle relationships with others in their corporation — the in-house lawyers’ “clients” — and with the corporation’s external counsel. Those folks don’t treat you quite as rudely as opposing counsel do, and there are reasons for you to treat those people with respect.

Corporations have large human resources departments, and those departments want everyone to be happy. Lawyers (even junior ones) and staff should be happy. Why would anyone curse on the job?

And in-house lawyers have less power to ignore rules than do lawyers at firms. Heavy-hitters at law firms curse, get criticized, and respond: “Screw you! I’ll take my clients and leave.” The firms decide that, on reflection, they can live with the cursing.

In-house lawyers who reacted this way would probably be told they didn’t have the right attitude, were ruining the corporate culture, and should consider a career change.

Do lawyers at firms curse more than in-house lawyers do?

I’ve lived it, and I can think of reasons why it might just be true.

# Associate Salaries And Bonuses Are Bigger Than Ever -- But They're Still Not Big Enough

It’s an increase, but it still lags behind how much more partners have been making. [Junior lawyers are] more or less making the same as associates made in 2008, adjusted for inflation, while partner comp has doubled.

— a midlevel corporate associate, offering just one of the reasons why [associates are dissatisfied with salary and bonus increases this year](https://www.businessinsider.com/big-law-firms-are-hiking-associate-bonuses-up-to-115000-2021-11), during a conversation with Insider. Equity partners at the associate’s New York City-based firm made more than $3 million each last year. Over the course of the past 10 years, partner profits soared by 85%, but associate salaries climbed by just 44% during the same period of time. According to [Biglaw Investor](https://www.biglawinvestor.com/biglaw-salary-scale/), law firms’ most junior associates do, in fact, make less than they did in 2008 (accounting for inflation), while associates with three or more years of experience are making more now than even before the Great Recession.

# Promising Young Biglaw Associate Killed In Plane Crash

We have some incredibly unfortunate news to report out of the Washington legal community, where a young Cooley associate recently passed away. [Gabrielle Hanna](https://www.cooley.com/news/coverage/2022/2022-09-06-gabrielle-hanna-memoriam), 29, was litigation associate for Cooley in San Diego before she moved to the firm’s Seattle office in August 2020.

According to news reports, Hanna died in a floatplane crash into the Puget Sound off the coast of Whidbey Island, just north of Seattle, over the Labor Day holiday weekend. She was returning home from a friend’s wedding. All 10 people who were aboard the plane were killed. The incident is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The [Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/whidbey-island-plane-crash-wreckage-not-yet-located-ntsb-says/) has details on what happened:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[Tom] Chapman [of the NTSB] said the agency hasn’t determined the cause of the crash and will not “speculate” about what caused the plane to plunge into the Puget Sound.

He confirmed witness reports that the plane likely entered the water nose first, at high speed.

The plane was in the air for around 35 minutes before the crash and was flying at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. The pilot had taken the plane on other trips earlier the same day.

Officials have yet to locate the plane’s wreckage, and Chapman said that while “efforts are ongoing,” it may be “hard to predict how long it’s going to take.”

Cooley offered this [statement](https://www.cooley.com/news/coverage/2022/2022-09-06-gabrielle-hanna-memoriam) in a memoriam posted on the firm’s website:

Starting as a summer associate with us, Gabby spent the entirety of her all-too-brief legal career with Cooley. In her few years with the firm, Gabby had already established herself as a true talent and team player who was dedicated to providing our clients with service and advice of the highest quality. As importantly, Gabby was always quick to smile and was a true believer in – and contributor to – the Cooley culture. She will be deeply missed.

In an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/07/cooley-associate-one-of-10-victims-in-seattle-area-plane-crash/), Jeff Lombard, a senior associate at the firm who worked on the same litigation team as Hanna, said that she was “a burgeoning star in our group of associates.” Lombard said the news of her death was “absolutely devastating.”

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Gabrielle Hanna’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

# Biglaw Firm Gets Smacked Down, Has To Have Homework Signed By Mommy

When a judge gives you a pretty clear discovery order to follow, you should go ahead and follow it.

But that isn’t what West Coast powerhouse firm, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe did, and oh, boy is U.S. District Judge James Robart pissed off. Orrick is defending its client Microsoft in a gender bias case. As per ush, there was a discovery dispute regarding the date range of responsive documents. Judge Robart ordered the defendant to produce documents from January 2010 forward. Except Orrick refused to produce anything prior to September 2012. Rut-roh.

Robart was not happy to basically have to issue orders twice on the same issue. And he told them so, [as per the Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/judge-microsoft-hasnt-followed-orders-in-bias-case/):

Mark Parris, a Seattle-based attorney with Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe who is representing Microsoft, told the court the company’s legal team was acting in good faith. They believed they were complying with the court’s orders, he said.

“Well, it is clear that I do not speak Orrick,” Robart replied. “It is also clear to me, at this point, that the Orrick firm doesn’t speak English.”

Burn.

And the judge is going to make sure such nonsense doesn’t happen again. He’s really got a unique solution — all filings have to be physically signed off by Microsoft:

Robart ordered Microsoft’s outside attorneys to have the company’s chief legal officer or director of litigation sign off on all future filings in the case.

# New York Times Stands Up To Biglaw Firm, NFL
## Consider this an early salvo in the battle over NFL concussions.

The Gray Lady is going to the mat in defense of its reporting on the National Football League. After writing an [epic piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/sports/football/nfl-concussion-research-tobacco.html?_r=1) detailing flaws in the way the League collected and reported concussion data for years as well as ties between the NFL and the tobacco industry, the New York Times received a letter from a Biglaw firm demanding the story be retracted.

The NFL immediately responded to the piece; Politico Media [details](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2016/03/8595089/nfl-demands-retraction-times-article-player-concussions) their efforts:

[NFL] Spokesman Joe Lockhart published a 2,500-word rebuttal on the league’s website, arguing that “the paper published pages of false innuendo and sheer speculation based on a mere handful of anecdotal and cursory references, twisted and contorted out of context, from a smattering of documents out of millions found on the tobacco litigation website.”

Additionally, the NFL ran ads on nytimes.com to promote the steps it says it has taken to advance player safety; at least one of the ads appeared in a banner placement directly above the concussions story. The NFL also paid to promote its rebuttal on Twitter.

But the League was far from done. The NFL tapped Paul Weiss chair [Brad S. Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp.aspx) to do what Biglaw does best in these situations: write a [threatening letter](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/NFL-NYT-letter.pdf). The letter claims the Times article was “false and defamatory”:

Its sensational headline notwithstanding, the story did not show any meaningful “ties to the tobacco industry.” Nor did it present a shred of evidence to support its thesis that the NFL intentionally concealed concussion research data. By publishing the story, fully aware of the falsity of the underlying facts, the Times recklessly disregarded the truth and defamed the NFL, even under the public-figure Sullivan test.

And there is probably a hold notice circulating around the halls of the paper of record. In a move that will not shock fellow litigators, the NFL is reserving their rights against the Times:

Accordingly, we demand that the story immediately be retracted, and we reserve our rights more broadly. We also request that the Times’s reporters and editors who worked on this story preserve their notes, correspondence, emails, recordings and work papers and all other electronic and hard copy documents generated or received in connection with their work.

Karp even boasts about his representation of the League on this issue in his [Paul Weiss bio](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp.aspx#sthash.UCdgVIrq.dpuf):

[Karp’s significant representations include] The National Football League in several matters, including its defense and recent settlement of hundreds of lawsuits filed by thousands of former NFL players seeking to hold the League liable for allegedly concealing the risks associated with concussions sustained while playing professional football, as well as its investigation of workplace issues at the Miami Dolphins;

I guess he, like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, was unmoved by Will Smith’s performance in [Concussion](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322364/).

In the face of the full power and might of the NFL and a Biglaw firm, the Times is holding fast (and should this turn into litigation, the paper will almost assuredly be repped by their own Biglaw shop). As Politico Media [reports](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2016/03/8595251/new-york-times-wont-retract-or-post-correction-nfl-story), there will be no correction or update to the Times’ story:

[I]n a Wednesday response to NFL attorney Brad Karp, Times assistant general counsel Dave McCraw wrote that, while the Times has a policy of promptly correcting factual errors, “nowhere does your letter identify any factual errors that we made in our reporting on the ties between the NFL and the tobacco industry.”

The Times letter, which was shared first with POLITICO after we reported Tuesday on the NFL’s retraction demand, also reiterated the article’s central assertion: That the NFL’s research on concussions sustained by pro football players “was deeply flawed and incomplete,” and that there were ties between the NFL and the tobacco industry.

# Biglaw Firm Gives Out Special Bonuses, But The Amount Leaves Associates Wanting More
## The discontent is best expressed in meme form.

Yes, February is waning and the temperatures in the Northeast are inching up bringing the first, fleeting glance of spring, but that doesn’t mean Biglaw is done with the 2020 bonus cycle. Lots of firms ponied up year-end and special bonuses already, but not every firm got on board.

Back in January, Cadwalader announced that employees would be reimbursed for the salary cuts they sustained in 2020, as part of the firm’s response to COVID-19. (in full for administrative staff without any billable requirements, and in full for legal staff who had billed 1400 or more client hours in 2020.) They [also announced ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/cadwalader-bonus-2020/) year-end bonuses matching the Cravath year-end scale for associates and special counsel — if they billed 1900 client hours. But there was no mention of the special bonuses that top Biglaw firms were giving out to associates.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now, at last, comes word about Cadwalader special bonuses. According to insiders at the firm, Cadwalader told associates they’d do special bonuses, but they’d be black boxed, meaning there’d be no easy to understand schedule of how much associates would be given based on class year or hours billed or any objective measure. Instead special bonus amounts would be communicated individually.

Hmmmm, but what would that actually mean for associates’ bank accounts? Then came this detail from a tipster:

Cadwalader managing partner told associates that the new special bonus scale tops out at about half of the NY market rate. He tried to justify the cut by saying 2020 revenue was down 1.5% firm-wide, so CWT did not have a windfall year like other firms, despite a very busy and profitable year for some practice groups.

So it’ll be difficult wind up with a full market bonuses. (Update: Other tipsters have reached out to note to Above the Law that in combination with Cadwalader’s extra bonus for super high billable hours, it *is* possible to hit a market bonus, and maybe even get a tiny bit over that mark — you’ll just have to bill your butt off. “They way they did it was that in combination with CWT’s existing super bonus policy (where they give you 120% of the regular bonus amount if you hit 2200), the special bonuses they announced actually put people a little above market IF they billed over 2200 hours.” And considering many Biglaw firms are giving those special bonuses with no or a lowered hours requirement, well, it has to sting to have to hit the 2200 threshold to finally hit market money.) From what we hear, associate reaction can best be summed up by this meme that’s making the rounds:

# Another Firm Raises Salaries Right Before Labor Day

Lost in the shuffle of the Labor Day holiday and the Kavanaugh circus, we got another Biglaw firm raising salaries. Consider it something of a Labor Day present.

Loeb & Loeb is joining the $190K club for first-year associates, but the older you get, the less exciting the news… at least when it comes to base salary. Let’s take a look:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So things match up until the third year and then get a little crunched. The third year comes up $10K short, fourth is $35K short, fifth and sixth are both $55K under, seventh is $60K light, and the eighth year falls $65K shy. But just when you think this is bad news for Loeb associates, let’s check out the bonus side:



When I first saw this and thought these were summer bonuses, which would be wonderful news. However, these are the firm’s end-of-year bonuses, which are actually below market too until roughly the 2100 hour mark. The heavy billers are getting a decent chunk of change though.

[This story was updated to correct the misperception that the chart addressed summer bonuses]

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Skadden Confirms The Inevitable -- No Fall Bonuses
## Wait till year-end is becoming a common refrain.

As per usual, the majority of Biglaw is playing “Follow Cravath.” Unfortunately for associates, this year that means no Fall bonuses for them.

Special shout out to[ the firms that opened their pocketbooks](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/?rf=1) to dish out special appreciation bonuses to their associates. But, well, Biglaw isn’t really known for its boldness. And after perennial market leader Cravath noped out of the bonus game, it opened the door for other firms to do the same.

The latest firm to delay their associates’ bonuses is Skadden. The firm circulated a video message from Executive Partner Eric Friedman revealing the firm’s bonus plan (transcription of the message provided by tipsters):

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“I am sure you have all been following the fall special bonus announcements made by some of our peer firms. They have taken a variety of different approaches. The Firm is grateful for the dedication and hard work that you’ve demonstrated during these unprecedented times, and we intend to recognize your efforts in our upcoming year-end bonuses.

Our 2020 bonuses will take into account the special bonuses given by other firms in order to keep pace with top tier compensation. By providing a longer determination window, we hope those whose hours have been more impacted by COVID will have additional time to qualify for bonuses.”

At least the firm seems to be committed to making sure their attorneys get full market compensation, just months later. And that seems to be the consensus from insiders at the firm:

I hope Skadden follows through with the video message, and at least matches Sullivan Cromwell and Davis Polk here in terms of total compensation. Skadden recently became a Vault #2 firm, and I think compensation has to at least follow those firms — if not exceed them.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Kirkland & Ellis's Lateral Partner Pickups Are Pure Fire
## At K&E, they do everything bigger, even lateral hires.

Fresh off its ascension to the top of the [Am Law 100 ranking by gross revenue](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/theres-a-new-biggest-law-firm-by-gross-revenue-in-town/), Kirkland & Ellis has gone on a bit of a binge, racking up big-name lateral partners all year long. But when you have $3.165 billion to throw around, well, that’ll buy you a lot of lawyers.

As [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/10/11/kirkland-nabs-new-partners-from-davis-polk-simpson-thacher/) by Law.com, the latest lateral making their way to K&E is capital markets partner [Sophia Hudson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia-hudson-2b97aa6/),  leaving from Davis Polk & Wardwell. As is typical in lateral moves, the firm getting the attorney is filled with glowing things to say about their new hire:

“Sophia is a talented lawyer and we are delighted to welcome her to Kirkland and look forward to integrating her into our New York and global capital markets team,” said a statement from a Kirkland spokeswoman.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But this is K&E and they do everything bigger. Over the past year, they’ve added a lot more people to their partnership than just Hudson. They added to the partnership of their corporate department with the additions of former Simpson Thacher & Bartlett associate [Michael Reeves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lawmike) and former Weil counsel [Kevin Crews](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-crews-23975a5). They lured former K&E associate [Robert Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-allen-70106b25) back to the firm as a partner after a stint as a federal prosecutor. Health care transactional partner [Chad Ehrenkranz](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=13105) joined K&E from DLA Piper, former Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer associate [Leon Daoud](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/leon-daoud-5bb88a2a) joined K&E as a funds practice partner, ex-Shearman & Sterling associate [Wanda Woo](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12889) joined K&E as a corporate partner, and former Steptoe & Johnson international trade and national security attorney [Anthony Rapa](https://www.kirkland.com/arapa) also joined the K&E partnership. And there was former counsel at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, [Ryan Gorsche](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12938), who joined K&E as a partner. Two former Morrison & Foerster attorneys, financial regulatory and compliance partner [Robert Fleishman](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12992) and international trade and natural security of counsel[ Ali Zaidi](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=13024), joined this summer. Plus there was the addition of former Cravath litigation attorney [Rachel Fritzler,](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12995) former Davis Polk private equity attorney [Abhishek Kolay](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12959), corporate partner [David D’Souza](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=13003) from Clifford Chance, and tax partner [Karen Lee](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemid=12967) from Skadden.

But wait! There’s more: Former Choate, Hall & Stewart private equity co-chair [Christian Atwood](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12740) joined K&E this year, as did two Debevoise & Plimpton bigwigs, [Erica Berthou](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemid=12686), former global head of the investment management and funds group, and former deputy corporate chair[ Jordan Murray](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemid=12685). Plus former DLA Piper partner [Dennis Williams](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12963) joined the K&E corporate practice in New York and former chair of the IP Transactions Practice and Technology & Sourcing Practice at Jenner & Block, [Adam Petravicius](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemid=12797), joined the firm. [Jennifer Perkins](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12789), formerly the co-chair of Latham & Watkins’ global private equity practice, joined K&E, as did former Norton Rose Fulbright project finance partner [Rohit Chaudhry](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=12803).

That’s… a lot of new partners, plus the firm had its [biggest ever class of new partners](http://www.law.com/international/sites/international/2018/10/03/kirkland-makes-up-10-city-partners-in-largest-ever-global-promotions-round-396-7622/) in 2018. But since K&E is known for its large, non-equity tier of partners, not everyone is going to get a bite of the firm’s impressive revenue.

# The Top Law Schools With The Best Employment Outcomes
## How did things turn out for the class of 2016 at your law school?

Anyone who is applying to law school these days knows how important employment statistics are. The ability to find a job after law school can mean the difference between a comfortable life and a life spent struggling under the crushing weight of student debt. Prospective law students who already submitted their seat deposits did so without complete information, as jobs data from the class of 2016 hadn’t been released yet.

Those who opted to wait were wise, because all of the top law schools posted their employment information within the past week or two, ahead of the American Bar Association announcing how the entire class of 2016 fared in the job market. While we still don’t know how the class of 2016 did nationally, we do know how things worked out at individual law schools. Today, we’ll share that data with our readers.

Below, you can find a ranking of the top 21 law schools, as ranked by [U.S. News](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings), listed in order of their employment statistics for the class of 2016. All percentages listed are for those who were employed 10 months after graduation in full-time, long-term jobs where bar passage was required. This ranking does not take class size into account, and school-funded employment is not included in these percentages. Take a look:

How did things turn out for the class of 2016 at your law school? You can find this information listed on your law school’s website. We imagine the ABA will soon release national statistics, and when they’re available, we’ll provide coverage of those numbers in full. Stay tuned for the 2017 edition of the Above the Law Top 50 Law School Rankings, which weigh employment data and quality jobs quite heavily.

We’re a lot further along in the investments we’ve made.

# Ex-Jones Day Partner Avoids Jail Time For Telling Client To 'Burn' Evidence
## He got off with a slap on the wrist on the criminal contempt charge.

So, Above the Law isn’t really in the habit of giving out practice pointers for lawyers. After all, we’re just a silly little blog read by lawyers, not a law school clinic. But, um, here’s a free tip that is guaranteed to make your practice better: don’t tell clients to “burn” evidence — yes, even if the contents are potentially embarrassing. Your career will inevitably turn out worse than if you had just sucked up the impact of whatever those documents are.

That brings us to the case of private equity specialist and former Jones Day partner Raymond McKeeve. A British High Court judge found him[ guilty of criminal contempt of court](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/former-jones-day-partner-found-guilty-on-criminal-contempt-charges/) after it was revealed he instructed his client to destroy potential evidence.

McKeeve advised Jonathan Faiman, founder of online grocer Ocado, while developing a rival grocer, Today Development Partners, with another ex-Ocado employee, Jon Hillary. They used an internal messaging app (3XC) to communicate. But Ocado sued McKeeve’s client and, after a search order had been issued that would ostensibly include messages on the app, McKeeve contacted the head of IT and told him to “burn” the app. And when McKeeve gave a reason for the bold destruction instruction, he pointed to potential messages on the app about his wife, a politician.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Though jail time was a possibility, High Court Judge Adam Johnson spared McKeeve that outcome, opting to fine him £25,000 ($28,000). Judge Johnson found a fine, plus the loss of his practice that resulted from this incident, is punishment enough. As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1537440) Law360:

Judge Johnson also observed that McKeeve should have known what he was doing, but accepted that he had acted in a panic rather than with premeditation.

McKeeve did the “exact opposite” of what his role required, Judge Johnson said. But he acted “impulsively and stupidly” out of sense of personal embarrassment rather than intending to subvert the underlying litigation. According to the judgment, McKeeve’s loss of his career and the apology he offered to the court showed he understood the seriousness of his actions and showed a “sense of shame and embarrassment.”

Judge Johnson rejected Ocado’s argument that the former lawyer “fought tooth and nail” at every stage against the allegations, pointing out that McKeeve had every right to advance what were largely points of law, given what was at stake. But the judge rejected the argument by McKeeve’s counsel that no further sanction was needed beyond the contempt finding because the trial and publicity had left an “indelible mark” on his reputation and ended his career.

Judge Johnson stressed that McKeeve’s position as a solicitor made this a very serious matter, but questioned the necessity in this case of a prison sentence to send a strong message. The judge noted McKeeve’s loss of his position as a “respectful practitioner,” his tarnished reputation and the fact that he was subject to a contempt of court finding.

“It’s naive to think that such a combination of factors will not also have a deterrent effect on other legal professionals,” Judge Johnson wrote.

One would certainly hope this case — plus basically every cannon of legal ethics — would prevent others from making the same foolish mistake.

# Am Law 100 Firm Conducting Layoffs Among Partners, Counsel
## Cold comfort if you suddenly find yourself unexpectedly out of work right before the holidays.

Some partners and counsel at Am Law 100 firm Husch Blackwell are not having a very happy holiday this year. The firm has announced they are conducting layoffs among partners and counsel; no associates will be impacted by the cuts. And we were just telling you about all the jobs the [legal sector lost…](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/legal-sector-loses-1100-jobs-in-october/)

Precise numbers of those getting pink slips in their stocking are hard to ascertain, though the firm [has confirmed](http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/husch-blackwell-pares-lawyers-from-roster/article_ac36693e-d78e-5fb0-a690-f2fb147478fa.html) approximately 40 attorneys will be off their payroll in some combination of layoffs and retirement. That’s… a big loss in the most senior ranks of the firm. The cuts come only a year after Husch Blackwell acquired Wisconsin-based regional firm Whyte Hirschboeck Dudek — a move that [launched the firm into the Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/20/husch-blackwell-layoffs-hit-partner-counsel-ranks/).

In a statement, the firm maintains the changes are all a matter of right-sizing, and that with new hires made throughout the year, there isn’t much net change in the firm’s size:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Husch Blackwell CEO Greg Smith and Chairman Maurice Watson said Friday in a prepared statement: “With retirements and other year-end transitions, approximately 40 attorneys, all partners or counsels, are expected to leave the firm. Such departures are offset, in part, by new attorney hires throughout the year, and our firm had a net increase of 12 attorneys for the 12-month period ending October 31, 2017. Given our firm’s size and scale, these attorney transitions are expected and normal.”

Which is cold comfort if you suddenly find yourself unexpectedly out of work right before the holidays.

# Big Salaries, Big Bonuses, Big Billables: Are Firms Treating Lawyers Fairly?
## Are your law firm's work expectations unreasonable? Many of your colleagues think so.

For more than a year and a half, lawyers and legal staff have largely worked from home thanks to the pandemic. Despite widespread vaccination protocols, the coronavirus crisis is still prominently featured in our lives due to the Delta variant, with firms across the country now putting their reopening plans on hold. But all the while, many lawyers have been living large, so to speak, with salaries hitting new heights, and special bonuses being handed out not once, but twice. On the flip side of the coin, law firms have become even more demanding, and in turn, their profits have soared.

This got us to wondering: do law firm personnel think they’re being treated fairly? We polled almost 400 attorneys and staff members across hundreds of Biglaw and boutique law firms from almost every state in America to find out. With all of this money being tossed around, the answer may surprise you.

As we all could have guessed, lawyers are working incredibly hard this year. According to our survey, those who actually record billable hours are doing a lot of heavy lifting, making the work-life balance line disappear while working remotely. The largest cohort of respondents who selected hours reported that they would be billing more than 2,399 in 2021. See the chart below.

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2021?



That said, we asked those who took our poll to rate their firm’s work expectations. The largest cohort of respondents (almost 42%) reported that their law firm’s work expectations are somewhat unreasonable. The next largest cohort (almost 40%) reported work expectations to be fair.

So, is all of this hard work worth it? You’d think so, but let’s take a look at the details. How are lawyers and staff being compensated during the pandemic?

Did you receive a salary raise in 2021?



The majority of respondents, approximately 80%, reported that they did receive a salary raise in 2021. Now, let’s break that down by law firm size.



As you can see, salary raises were prolific throughout the legal profession over the course of the past year, but the smaller the firm, the less likely it was that personnel would receive a raise (and definitely not a match of the now-prevailing Biglaw salary scale).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now let’s take a look at salary raises by job title, where associates ruled over everyone else by quite a bit, trailed by staff and counsel.



The “other” job titles represented here were senior financial analyst; analyst; paralegal; document review attorney; executive director; staff attorney; and senior counsel. As noted earlier, everyone got raises, with partners trickling in for last place among those who did. Don’t worry, their PPP will be way up.

Did you receive a bonus in 2021?


Once again, almost everyone received a bonus. Let’s break it down by law firm size, where again, the smaller the firm size gets, the less likely it was that personnel would receive a bonus.



Oof, more people working in small law firms did not receive a bonus in 2021 than those who did. Ouch. Let’s break this down further, this time by job title.


While the majority of counsel, associates, and staff received bonuses, it was a wash for partners and others. (But once again, partners don’t need to be worried about bonuses because their profits are sure to have skyrocketed this year.)

Let’s get down to brass tacks when it comes to compensation and the insane amounts of work that attorneys and staff have been doing this year.

Do you believe your overall compensation reflects your contribution to your firm?



Almost 60 percent of respondents reported that they did not believe their overall compensation was reflective of their contribution to their firm. Consider that alongside the fact that a majority of respondents (82%) reported that their firm’s work expectations were a mix between somewhat unreasonable and fair. Those polled really spoke their minds and some common themes emerged. Here are some select responses that we thought would really resonate with others.

- “They repeatedly tell us how much they care about our self-actualization, mental health, etc., but their compensation and treatment of “counsel” is hidden from scrutiny, unlike its compensation and treatment of associates, where everything is about keeping up with other top-tier law firms, and because how they treat us is hidden, they treat us very unfairly, and often reprehensibly.”
- “We’re carrying more weight than ever before, I’ve billed in excess of $2m and will take home after taxes far less than 10% of that.”
The majority of lawyers and staff polled do not think they’re being treated fairly when it comes to their compensation and the amount of work they’ve been doing during the pandemic years. Will this change? Some firms have been handing out additional financial and experience perks as thank-yous, but will that improve things? Sometimes money just isn’t enough, but only time will tell.

# Biglaw Firm Gives First-Year Associates Raise, Leaves Everyone Else Hanging
## Not everyone will share in the wealth.

It may be August, but that doesn’t mean that Biglaw firms have finished raising associate salaries. Hunton Andrews Kurth announced that it will be raising associate salaries, but not everyone is getting more money.

The good news is for the first-year associates — those in the New York, D.C., California, and Texas offices are getting bumped up to market rates, their starting salary will be $190,000. Miami and Richmond first-years will start at $175,000. But after that everything gets a lot more murky. As the firm put it in its email to associates:

The firm currently is reviewing compensation for all other associates in all of our U.S. markets and will make additional adjustments as appropriate to continue to provide competitive and market-based compensation. These adjustments will be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account individual performance and all relevant market factors, including any recent adjustments in salary scales announced by peer firms in the applicable market

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That doesn’t instill much confidence that everyone will get market raises.

And from what we’re hearing from tipsters at the firm, lots of associates are getting left out in the cold:

The twist is that for associates other than entry-level, salaries will be determined on a “case-by-case” basis. This is effectively how things have been done since 2016, when the firm supposedly moved away from a lock-step system. But the word from management is that it means Richmond office associates in the Class of 2014 and above will see no raises, which has most people in those classes frustrated. Not sure if this “case-by-case” approach is resulting in salary compression in the other offices as well. Probably a safe bet that it is though.

And sources say those left out of the raise party aren’t taking it well:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
When the mood visibly turned for the mid- and senior-associates, the associates were told that it’s because they don’t work as hard as NY associates, despite making less salary and bonuses than our NY colleagues.

The firm’s made no statement about any special summer bonus, like many in the industry are doing. Associates lucky enough to be getting a raise from the firm will get them effective August 1.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# When Is It Fair To Charge Different Clients Different Rates?
## Sometimes, it makes sense to charge different clients different rates.

As many people already know, lawyers often charge varying rates depending on their experience, training, education, and other factors. Indeed, in some situations, lawyers might charge a client four or five times more than what another lawyer might charge depending on the circumstances. In many instances, lawyers even charge different clients of theirs different rates depending on the circumstances. Some might think it is unfair to charge clients different rates when it is the same lawyer handling the work for the different clients. However, in my experience, in a few situations, it makes sense to charge different clients different rates.

Volume Clients

At many law firms, lawyers may charge clients lower rates with the understanding that the client will give them a large amount of legal work which makes up for the lower rate. In a number of other industries, the price that clients pay for goods and services might be different depending on the volume involved, and this is also true in the legal industry. Since it is generally more efficient to work with fewer larger clients than many smaller clients, and since law firms might make up the difference in rates through more work, charging volume clients less seems reasonable.

I first encountered this aspect of fee arrangements when I was working at an insurance defense firm a long time ago. The firm charged much less for insurance defense work than I had been used to at different firms. Partners at the firm explained that some insurance companies had given the firm hundreds of cases to handle, so it was fine accepting a lower rate for the volume of additional work. When the firm worked for one-off clients, it usually charged more, but this seemed fair as well since the firm was less familiar with these one-off smaller clients, and it was generally less efficient to work on such matters. If law firms agree with clients on a lower rate in exchange for a higher volume of work, this seems reasonable to me notwithstanding that other clients might be charged more.

Low Bono

Most people know pro bono is when a lawyer works for free in order to fulfill a charitable cause. Fewer people might be familiar with the term “low bono” — when a lawyer discounts rates for clients in order to help reduce the burden of legal fees for charities and underserved clients who may not have the resources to pay a lawyer a typical rate. It is usually much easier for lawyers to do low bono rather than pro bono work, especially lawyers who work at smaller shops and cannot spread the hit of not accepting a fee around a larger operation.

If a lawyer served a nonprofit or other underserved client, it is fair for them to charge less than their normal rates. The legal profession should have a public interest component to it (although this might just be pie-in-the-sky optimism). Typical clients of the firm should not be offended if they discover that nonprofits and underserved clients are paying lower legal rates due to the circumstances of their particular cases. If lawyers haven’t considered low bono work before, I highly suggest that attorneys consider it. Not only does it give lawyers a chance to contribute to a solid cause, it can also lead to additional business development opportunities in the right circumstances.

New Companies

Earlier this week, I published [an article about how lawyers should nurture startup companies and other smaller clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/lawyers-should-nurture-smaller-clients/), and perhaps should give them a break in terms of fees. Startups and smaller companies often do not have large budgets so legal fees can have a huge impact on their bottom line. Moreover, if a lawyer nurtures startups or smaller companies, they may one day become larger companies, which can send large amounts of legal work to a law firm. Over the course of my career, I have seen otherwise smaller companies and startups become larger operations, and since they were grateful for a break on fees in the beginning, they might be likely to refer more work to a law firm at higher legal fees. Of course, everyone should use their best judgment on how far of a discount they should give smaller companies, but this can be a rewarding strategy.

All told, law firms like other types of businesses may charge different rates to different clients. Lawyers should consider a few circumstances when deciding if they will charge different clients different rates.

I was recently listening to a podcast that discussed the impact private equity ownership has had on the medical profession in recent years. Although I am definitely not an expert in that field, apparently, private equity firms have been buying up healthcare practices, and priorities within the healthcare industry have shifted as a result. Allegedly, after private equity firms take over practices, physicians complain that management focuses far more on efficiency and profitability that the softer side of practicing medicine. This could have a negative impact on how physicians deliver care to patients. The podcast explained that some physicians even suffer from a moral injury since they are forced to promote a profit motive and other goals at the expense of having a human connection with patients.

My initial reaction to this information was to question how this can be permitted in the medical industry. As professionals, physicians should not have their judgment impacted by people who are not trained in medicine. The podcast explained that some states have regulations that prohibit certain medical establishments from being owned by people other than physicians. However, some private equity firms have ways around these requirements, and some physicians seem to be complicit in efforts to separate medical decision-making from the people who are medically trained.

Hearing this story made me glad that I worked in a profession that has strict rules about not permitting nonlawyers to own law firms so that a lawyer’s professional judgment remains inviolate. Some exceptions to this rule of course do exist. For instance, the District of Columbia permits some professionals who are not admitted to the bar, such as lobbyists, to be partners of law firms. Also, there may be less interest among private equity shops to own law firms, but some law firms abroad are publicly traded, and others are owned by entities not controlled by lawyers.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Briefly reviewing materials off the internet, it seems as if a few jurisdictions have some interest in expanding who is permitted to own law firms. Indeed, according to some sources, [programs in Utah and Arizona may expand ownership of law firms to nonlawyers](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/arizona-utah-lead-way-legal-industry-change-2022-10-03/). Although innovation is always welcome, jurisdictions should be very cautious about expanding the capacity of nonlawyers to own law firms, and we can look to the example of the medical establishment for reason to have concerns.

Although many people might think that lawyers are interested only in money, many legal professionals and policymakers do not want a profit motive to be the primary reason for why attorneys complete tasks, and ethical rules are in place to prevent this. The legal profession, like the medical establishment, is very people-focused, and lawyers often build strong connections with their clients. This connection can strengthen a given representation and also be rewarding to lawyers as well. Not every call from a client might be a work call that needs to be recorded as billable time, and not every client can be fit neatly into categories for the sake of efficiency. If private equity firms or other nonlawyer owners run law firms and institute profit-promoting practices, the practice of law can lose a personal touch that is hard to replace.

Moreover, it is possible that widespread ownership of law firms by nonlawyers can reduce the opportunities of attorneys to earn more money or advance in their careers. The prospects for attorneys to have a fruitful and lucrative career have diminished greatly over the past few decades. Although people used to be offered partnership after eight years of working as an associate, and many partnership positions involved equity in a firm, this is no longer the case. Now, it can take much more time than in the past to make partner, and partnership might not come with the equity stake that is especially lucrative to attorneys.

Numerous law firms have recently instituted nonpartnership track or staff attorney positions to also limit the amount of equity and partnership opportunities that go around. Moreover, with the advent of predictive coding and artificial intelligence, many contract attorney jobs have disappeared in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. If private equity firms or other nonlawyers run law firms and are solely motivated to earn the highest profit possible, they might accelerate the trend of cutting lucrative jobs to reduce costs and maximize profit.

I’ll be the first to admit it, I’m just a practicing attorney, not a legal academic or someone who is particularly well-versed on broader trends within the legal profession. However, all of us in the legal industry can have a sense of pride in that, in order to preserve the independent professional judgment of attorneys, among other reasons, we do not usually permit nonlawyers to own law firms. Although relaxing rules regarding law firm ownership can be advantageous in some situations, policymakers should be cautious about changing this landscape by allowing companies run by nonlawyers to own and manage law firms.

# George Conway Disappears From Wachtell Website

George Conway via Twitter

America’s favorite Never-Trumper Republican, George Conway, has abruptly disappeared from the Wachtell Lipton website.

The husband of Trump’s 2016 campaign manager and current spokesperson-at-large Kellyanne Conway was last seen admonishing Chuck Schumer for attacking the Supreme Court — which was mildly inappropriate on the Senator’s part but [hardly worth the consternation the scolds were giving it](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/chuck-schumer-exposes-john-roberts-with-donald-trump-impersonation/) — and [maxing out his contribution to the Biden campaign](https://www.salon.com/2020/03/04/george-conway-contributes-the-maximum-amount-to-joe-bidens-presidential-campaign/). The ubiquitous Tweeter even changed his banner to a Biden 2020 poster:

It’s like this American treasure of the Twittersphere just got Carmen Sandiegoed.

What’s going on? Does this portend a move to get more active in the upcoming campaign? Spending [more time with his SuperPAC](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/george-conway-willing-to-spend-big-to-make-sure-his-wife-loses-her-job/) to convince Republicans to ditch Trump? Earlier this morning, he retweeted this message from the SuperPAC, The Lincoln Project, suggesting some Trump attack ads were in the offing:

# 7 Bits Of Real Advice For High Schoolers Who Want To Be Lawyers

Over at the Huffington Post, they have an [article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/how-to-prepare-your-kid-f_b_10926166.html), originally posted on Quora, that purports to give advice for parents whose high-school-aged children are determined to become lawyers. The post is filled with utterly reasonable advice, all of which notes that as a teenager there’s lots of time for them to change their damn minds, but it got me thinking. What do you really need to know if your child, or someone you care about, is seriously thinking of going to law school?

After swallowing down the disappointment, here are the things you can do to help them achieve their goal, no matter how dubious you think their life plan really is.

#1 — Get them ready to have their soul sucked out — it was really only holding them back anyway.

#2 — Advise they start practicing [polyphasic sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep). Less sleep = MOAR billable hours.

#3 — Get them to stop making friends. They’ll only wind up disappointing them with a constant pattern of making and then canceling plans, until all parties finally come to the tacit agreement that they used to be friends, but aren’t anything more than friendly acquaintances.

#4 — Tell them to stop thinking they’ll make a difference. They won’t. The system is bigger than they could possibly imagine. Suicide would at least save society the trouble of breaking them. [This cheerful bit of advice comes from Above the Law’s [Elie Mystal](http://twitter.com/elienyc).]

#5 — Start charging them rent. Sure, they can’t pay it on the measly allowance you’ve given them, but be sure to keep track of all the money you spend on them. Best to get them used to living under the weight of crippling debt as soon as possible.

#6 — Get them a Ritalin prescription. Maybe they don’t need it now, but if they truly want to live the lawyer lifestyle, get them chemical dependent right quick.

#7 — Demand unreasonable tasks from them moments before they plan to go out. Nope, it isn’t fair, but that 5:00 p.m. Friday call from the managing partner won’t be fair either.

# Vault 'Quality Of Life' Rankings: The Best Law Firms To Work For In America (2020)
## Did your law firm make the cut this time around?

Last week, Vault released the 2020 edition of its closely watched [law firm rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2020/), proving that money — in the form of Cravath’s perennially competitive pay scale — can buy prestige.

But can that money buy happiness?

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to their overall quality of life, including satisfaction, firm culture, compensation, hours, quality of work, business outlook, career outlook, associate/partner relations, formal and informal training, pro bono, transparency, and overall diversity. So many associates responded to this year’s survey (about 20,000), that Vault has expanded its Overall Best Law Firms to Work For ranking from 25 firms to 50 firms. This may be surprising for some, but almost none of the firms that made the Top 10 list for being the most prestigious made the Top 10 list for being the best firms to work for.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms to Work For](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-to-work-for) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2020:

- [O’Melveny & Myers](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/omelveny-myers-llp) (no change)
- [Latham & Watkins](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/latham-watkins-llp) (+8)
- [Clifford Chance US](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/clifford-chance-us-llp) (no change)
- [Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe-llp) (+2)
- [Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/fried-frank-harris-shriver-jacobson-llp) (-3)
- [Ropes & Gray](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/ropes-gray-llp) (+2)
- [Paul Hastings](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/paul-hastings-llp) (-3)
- [Jackson Walker](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/jackson-walker-llp) (not ranked; first time in Top 10)
- [Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/cleary-gottlieb-steen-hamilton-llp) (+5)
- [Choate Hall & Stewart](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/choate-hall-stewart-llp) (not ranked; first time in Top 10)
Once again, Latham is the only law firm that made it into the Top 10 on both of Vault’s rankings. Kudos on keeping your own associates so incredibly happy.

It’s also worth noting that O’Melveny made history this year, as the first firm to ever earn the No. 1 spot in the overall ranking for each major category (Overall Best Law Firm to Work For, Overall Diversity, and Overall Best Summer Associate Program). Latham, on the other hand, was the only firm to rank in the Top 10 for every quality of life ranking. That said, here are the No. 1 firms in each Quality of Life category:

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on lateral partner moves from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Abby Gordon](http://bit.ly/2kTjJkF) is a Director with Lateral Link’s New York office. Abby works with attorney candidates on law firm and in-house searches, primarily in New York, Boston, and Europe. Prior to joining Lateral Link, Abby spent seven years as a corporate associate with [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cleary-gottlieb/), focusing on capital markets transactions for Latin American clients in New York and for the last five years for European clients in Paris. A native of Boston, Abby holds a J.D., cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center and a B.A. in government and romance languages, magna cum laude, from Dartmouth College. Abby also worked with the International Rescue Committee as a Fulbright Scholar in Madrid, Spain. She is a member of the New York Bar and is fluent in French and Spanish (and dabbles in Portuguese and Italian).

It’s that time of year again when if you are a law firm associate, you see your bonus hit your account, you see numerous colleagues giving notice, and you inevitably start thinking about your next career move. Whether or not you decide to make a move in 2017, it’s always a good time to get your resume and representative matters sheet in order.

As many of you are currently struggling with revising your materials in preparation for a job search, I thought it would be helpful to share my posts from years past on résumé and deal sheet writing and interview tips:

# Top Biglaw Firm That Started Special Bonus Craze Weighs In On New Salaries
## The firm is doing something a little special for first-years *and* ninth-years. Congrats!

With millions of dollars’ worth of salaries soon to be increased across the legal landscape of large law firms, we couldn’t have but wonder: where would Biglaw associates be without Cooley?

If you recall, Cooley was the very first firm to [introduce special bonuses in Fall 2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/), in appreciation for associates’ grueling work during the pandemic. Without Cooley’s first move, Davis Polk wouldn’t have been able to [swoop in and top those payments](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/), forcing other firms to match the new market standard. In a way, Cooley was the firm that finally got law firm leaders thinking about higher compensation for associates, and now here we are, less than one year later, looking at a $205K salary scale. On behalf of all associates, thank you, Cooley!

The firm — which came in at #19 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, having brought in $1,552,149,000 gross revenue in 2020 — is of course matching the new [Davis Polk salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/), but it’s also doing something special for its youngest and its most experienced associates. Check out what the scale looks like at Cooley:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- 2021: $205,000
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000
- 2012: $375,000
Cooley is not only offering a $205K salary to the Class of 2020, but the firm has joined in as one of the few that’s offering a salary bump up to $375K for ninth-year associates. This is just great. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# Biglaw Firm Wants Associates Off TikTok, Or At Least TikTok Off Their Phones
## Biglaw is trying to control more of associates' lives, but at least it's for a good reason.

Associates at Ropes & Gray recently received a mandate from firm leadership telling them to delete TikTok. It doesn’t matter if it is firm issued or their personal electronics — any device that has access to their firm email has to be rid of the social media app.

In an email to associates, the firm said this mandate came after at least one client request. Last month, it was revealed that [TikTok, along with a host of other apps, was snooping](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/) on anything on your device’s clipboard — which could include sensitive client information. TikTok, as well as some of the other apps, promised to do away with the practice. However, according to an Ars Technica report, at least TikTok was caught snooping even after they said they’d do away with the practice. So, now Ropes associates can’t have TikTok on their phones.

But though TikTok, with its Chinese ownership and Gen Z fan base, has gotten a lot of headlines over the practice, it is certainly not the only app that employs this security loophole. As of June 30, the following apps still [reportedly](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/) read the data you have on the clipboard: Fox News, New York Times, Reuters, Vice News, Huffington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Fruit Ninja, Plants v. Ninja Heroes, Bed Bath & Beyond, Overstock, Accuweather, Zoosk, and more.
