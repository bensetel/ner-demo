Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

We want to be more intentional in our continued search for talent to ensure we bring the best people into our business. The targets we have announced today, together with others we have set in relation to gender and ethnicity, are part of an overall approach to ensure we are reaching the widest possible talent pool.

— [Steve Cooke](https://www.slaughterandmay.com/people/steve-cooke/), senior partner of Slaughter and May, commenting on the Magic Circle firm’s goal of achieving [socioeconomic diversity among its employees](https://www.slaughterandmay.com/news/slaughter-and-may-announces-social-mobility-targets/). As noted in the firm’s [press release](https://www.slaughterandmay.com/news/slaughter-and-may-announces-social-mobility-targets/), about 18.8% of Slaughter’s employees firmwide, 10% of its attorneys, and 34% of its support staff are considered working class. Slaughter and May would like to increase those figures to 25%, 15%, and 40%. To do so, the firm may widen its recruitment net and offer more apprenticeships.

# Kirkland & Ellis Has No Place For Lawyers Who FAIL To Overthrow Governments
## Official alleged to plot Donald Trump's DOJ takeover may have a hard time getting back in the workforce.

Hey buddy, can you spare an equity share? (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

When reports first surfaced that Jeffrey Bossert Clark, recently the acting head of the DOJ’s civil division, had [plotted with Donald Trump to fire the Acting Attorney General and install Clark](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/politics/jeffrey-clark-trump-justice-department-election.html) in an effort to leverage the federal government to advance debunked election fraud claims and, potentially, reverse the results of the presidential contest, my first instinct was that he’d walk right back into Kirkland & Ellis.

If the last four years have taught America nothing, it’s that there are no consequences for making a mockery of the legal profession in service to that administration. Jones Day [welcomed back its collaborators](https://www.jonesday.com/en/lawyers/m/donald-mcgahn?tab=overview) with open arms. Rod Rosenstein ordered the mass kidnapping of children and [waltzed right into Biglaw](https://www.kslaw.com/people/rod-rosenstein). That [firms parted ways with the lawyers on Trump’s “find more votes” call](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/and-now-both-biglaw-lawyers-have-resigned-over-the-trump-call/) was the exception that proves the rule — it’s one thing to serve as a hired gun, but quite another to promote mayhem while cloaked in an official title. Even if those with government posts caused more tangible damage to the nation, Biglaw always makes room for the former Assistant Deputy Director of Procuring Trump Hotel Rooms or whatever.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So it’s a little shocking to [hear chatter that Kirkland & Ellis may not take Clark back](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/ex-doj-official-called-radioactive-after-alleged-election-plot) after his misadventures over the waning days inside Trump’s bunker. Kirkland & Ellis hasn’t spoken directly to the issue yet, but when the press starts hearing experts describing a lawyer as “radioactive” and pulls together a lengthy list of prominent lawyers [describing the conduct as “astonishingly improper”,](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/01/24/astonishingly-improper-what-lawyers-are-saying-about-reported-trump-scheme-to-oust-acting-us-attorney-general/) it’s difficult to see a path forward for a firm trying to protect its brand.

Clark, who has served as the Chair of the Environment and Property Rights Practice Group for the Federalist Society (obviously), denies he did anything wrong, though in his statement to the National Journal he says, “Discussing legal options and engaging in inquiry is not unethical, nor is engaging in internal deliberations.” That is not unethical… unless the internal deliberations delve into a bad place. Criminal lawyers don’t get to say, “We discussed the pros and cons of killing the lead witness, but those were just, like, internal deliberations, man. A lawyah’s gots to present all the options!”

His statement to the Times added another wrinkle, “It is unfortunate that those who were part of a privileged legal conversation would comment in public about such internal deliberations, while also distorting any discussions.” Yeah, I’m not entirely sure attorney-client privilege attaches to the DOJ counseling the president as an individual to undermine the federal government. It feels like the latter institution is the actual client of the Department of Justice.

At this moment Clark’s future is cloudy, but the revolving door is strong and I continue to refuse to believe Kirkland & Ellis would surrender to mass outrage and the efforts of groups like the Lincoln Project or Meidastouch. But hiring someone who failed to pull off a coup? That’s the sort of thing the firm can’t forgive. Kirkland & Ellis is a place for winners, Jeffrey. When our lawyers set out to accomplish something, we expect them to finish the job.

What Biglaw firm — that no longer bears his name — was founded by Robert R. McCormick? McCormick was the grandson of Joseph Medill, the founder of the Chicago Tribune and namesake of Northwestern’s journalism school.

Hint: In 1920, McCormick left the firm to become publisher of the Tribune. In that role, he eventually needed a defamation lawyer and turned to a former partner whose name still hangs on the door of the Biglaw firm today.

# Biglaw Partner Gets A Cookie For Calling Out Blackface In 1980

The month of blackface continues! I know the barrage of racism from dealing with the near constant blackface scandals is getting exhausting for black people in this country — especially during Black History Month — and for that, I am deeply sorry. But, yes, we have another blackface scandal (plus lynching!) for you. At least in this instance white people called it out as vile racism at the time. So… progress?

Anyway, the image in question is from the 1979 University of North Carolina yearbook. On a fraternity page there is an image of a man in blackface standing next to two people in KKK hoods and they’re simulating a lynching scene. Yes, it is as bad as you think it is. Don’t believe me? Take a look.

Just nauseatingly racist.

And this isn’t some snapshot from a bygone, more racist era when such occurrences were somehow thought to be acceptable. Nope, it was racist BS even then. And you know how we know (besides the obvious)? We have a contemporaneous editorial, from a 1980 edition of the student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, that has also gone viral.

Here’s the [@dailytarheel](https://twitter.com/dailytarheel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) editorial from March 1980. Too relevant nearly 40 years after I wrote it. Thanks, [@pamkelleyreads](https://twitter.com/pamkelleyreads?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). [pic.twitter.com/dW6nK9juST](https://t.co/dW6nK9juST)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The editorial calls out the racism, saying, “those who argue that racism and discrimination on this campus are ebbing have only to look at page 400 of the 1979 Yacktey Yack [the yearbook] for evidence to the contrary.” It goes on to describe the images as “crystallized racism that permeates the University”:

They were, we presume, clowning around for a photographer. Still, their callousness and insensitivity toward racism, the most deep-rooted problem confronting our society, is appalling … It may be argued, and rightly, that these pictures are indicative of the actions and attitudes of only a few individuals. Nevertheless, individuals make up organizations and organizations make up the UNC community. These photographs crystallized the racism that permeates this University in its most blatant and disturbing form.”

The author of this now-all-too-relevant editorial, [Bradley Kutrow,](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/people/k/bradley-r-kutrow) went on to become a Biglaw partner at McGuireWoods where he practices in the financial services litigation department. In an interview with [Law.com](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/02/07/future-mcguirewoods-partner-denounced-blackface-yearbook-photos-39-years-ago/) discussing how well this particular editorial has aged, Kutrow says he felt a responsibility to call out the unacceptable behavior:

“It was our role at the newspaper to call out problems on the campus,” he said, adding that “I don’t recall anyone leaping to the defense” of the fraternity after the editorial appeared. “It really was wrong and antithetical to our values at the university. Those photos needed to be called out.”

Anyway, it’s a good reminder to white people that the bare minimum we can do is call out racism when we see it. It’s the right thing to do, and, if Kutrow’s experience is any guideline, history will treat you kindly.

# Yikes: Biglaw Firm's New Bonus Policy Is Bad News For New Parents
## Associates had themselves a nice little perk, and it's a bummer to see it taken away.

Bucking the [Biglaw trend ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/another-biglaw-firm-gets-on-board-with-gender-neutral-and-longer-parental-leave/)of creating new policies that assist[ associates in balancing their work and life](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firms-great-new-benefit-for-new-parents-bill-less/), Cooley LLP has decided to go the opposite direction and is throwing up new roadblocks for parents trying to have it all.

The firm has traditionally credited time spent on leave, most commonly taken as parental leave, for bonus calculations. That meant new parents who took time off were eligible for a full bonus, but not anymore. As a firm source revealed to Above the Law, a newly announced change to Cooley’s bonus policy means those on leave will be docked for the time spent with their new children:

Cooley began its annual state of the firm rounds where they discussed how 2018 was a banner year with record-breaking profits. However, they also sent the email below to pregnant attorneys and new parents informing them that the firm will no longer credit time out on maternity leave for bonus purposes.

To be sure, plenty of [other Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-goodwin-procter-announces-bonuses-but-not-every-associate-is-taking-home-money/) already prorate bonuses for associates that take leave during the year. But Cooley associates had themselves a nice little perk, and it’s a bummer to see it taken away. As a tipster said, when the firm is happily reporting sky-high profits it’s more than a little hard to take a cost-cutting measure that new parents bear the brunt of:

It’s sad to see a firm that has had such a profitable year, and historically prided itself on being family-friendly, take such a big step in the wrong direction.

The new policy was specifically circulated to those who recently took, or are scheduled to take, leave. It’s nice these folks won’t be blindsided, but it still feels like a swift kick to the ovaries.

# 5 Things You Need To Know If Your Biglaw Firm Hasn't Matched Milbank's New Compensation Scale
## What *does* the new associate compensation scale mean for Biglaw?

Earlier this week, [Milbank stunned Biglaw watchers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) and laid on a new compensation scale for associates (as well as generous, if predictable, year-end bonuses). So, now that some of the shock has worn off, what can we expect from the market? Thus far, no firm has matched Milbank. While it seems inevitable that at least some firms will make a compensation move, there are a lot of factors at play.

1- It’s not over until the fat lady (DPW/Cravath) sings

Milbank is [great](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) for getting the[ ball rolling](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) on raises, but they aren’t always the final word. Historically, [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/) and/or [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) have come [over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) of the Milbank standard — [even if just for a few classes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/), like those challenging-to-retain senior associates. And there are [rumors](https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/17qs6up/hearing_whispers_of_sidley_going_over_the_top_to/) swirling that something similar might happen again. Firms that have the capital to stay at the top of compensation heap are undoubtedly considering all these potential permutations and what their tolerance is for keeping up with the Milbanks of the world.

2- Read the fine print

Just because it seems like a match of the industry standard, it doesn’t mean it is. Watch out for some common stipulations a firm might want to put on the shiny new $225k price tag. For example, matching the base salary for first-year associates [doesn’t necessarily mean](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/biglaw-firm-matches-first-year-salaries-in-some-markets-senior-associates-not-so-lucky/) every class will get a match. Some firms might tack the raises onto increased billable targets, or office attendance. So watch out for what the raises really mean for you.

3- Impact on hiring

We already know that [first-year associate hiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firms-just-dont-want-too-many-first-year-associates/) is down this year. It’s entirely likely that (some) firms will be increasing judiciousness when extending those offers to law students, because the reality is $225,000 is a lot to spend on someone who [doesn’t know](https://www.raconteur.net/risk-regulation/gen-z-lack-tech-literacy-is-business-risk) how to save a Word document.

(Yes, that’s probably still true even though the raises can be seen as cost of living adjustments.)

Honestly, this shouldn’t be cast as a raise but as a simple cost of living adjustment. Firms moved to 215k in Jan 2022. Adjusting for inflation that would be 226k today. [https://t.co/J46fWC17Re](https://t.co/J46fWC17Re)

— Joe Patrice (@JosephPatrice) [November 9, 2023](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/1722713811138818266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

4- Don’t freak out until January

It might take a minute for firms to match the new standard. Milbank very much surprised the market with these raises — typically we [start seeing](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) the [matches](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/salary-wars-scorecard-tracker-2021/) on the same day at the first mover, but it’s been three days without a single response. The industry was caught flat-footed, and they need time to call partner meetings and agree to the new scale. The new compensation scale doesn’t go into effect until January, so firms have some time to match. (And even if they take longer, firms that are truly interested in matching the market scale will make the new salaries retroactive to Jan. 1.)

5- Welcome back to the MoneyLaw tier

These raises come at a weird time for the industry. Not every Am Law 100 firm finds itself in the same position as Milbank. Some firms are doing [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/), and even [more are predicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaw-attorneys-staff-expect-more-layoffs-to-be-announced-before-year-end/). That means we may see stratification in Biglaw between those who can afford to pay top of market, and those who cannot. This phenomenon was[ first predicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/) in 2016, when[ Cravath moved the market](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) to $180,000. Then pretty much all of the Biglaw firms were able to meet the new scale, but we’re not so optimistic this time around. So which firms will move to the [“MoneyLaw”](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/moneylaw/) level, i.e., the top tier of compensation leaders (as boutiques have repeatedly proven, being able to run with the big kids isn’t just a matter of size)? Only time will tell.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 11.27.17
## * According to recently released tax records, a mystery donor gave more than $28 million to the Wellspring Committee to keep Justice Antonin Scalia's Supreme Court seat in Republican hands and help get Neil Gorsuch confirmed. How awesome would it be if that mystery donor were the president himself? [[Law Newz](https://lawandcrime.com/politics/mystery-donor-gave-28-million-to-help-get-gorsuch-on-supreme-court/)] * The DOJ says Trump can appoint the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Federal Vacancies Act, but the Dodd-Frank Act says the deputy director will head the agency in the absence of a permanent director. Now we have two dueling CFPB directors, AND there's a lawsuit. Yay! [[The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/361824-justice-dept-says-trump-has-authority-to-appoint-cfpb-acting-director); [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/26/politics/leandra-english-cfpb-lawsuit-donald-trump/index.html)] * FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel is so against Chairman Ajit Pai's ""lousy plan"" to do away with net neutrality that she wrote an op-ed to plead for help: ""I'm on the FCC. Please stop us from killing net neutrality."" She encourages us to ""make a ruckus"" about this -- and we really, really should. [[Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html)] * The layoffs are coming! The layoffs are coming! Along with Sedgwick's announcement that the faltering firm intends to close its doors in early 2018 comes the news that it will shutter its back office operations center. Up to 75 people are expected to lose their jobs. It'll be a not-so happy New Year. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/25/sedgwick-back-office-to-close-laying-off-75-employees/)] * Start placing your bets: The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in New Jersey's sports betting case next week, and is expected to issue a ruling in June. What's the over/under on the high court overturning the federal ban on sports betting? Come on, SCOTUS, make Atlantic City great again! [[NJ.com](http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/11/nj_is_prepping_for_legal_sports_betting_maybe_soon.html)] * Representative John Conyers Jr. will be stepping down from his platoon as the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee during an investigation into allegations that he sexually harassed his former aides. Even though a settlement was made in 2015, Conyers continues to deny the allegations. [[New York Times](https://nytimes.com/2017/11/26/us/politics/john-conyers-steps-down-judiciary-committee-sexual-harassment.html)] * The InfiLaw System has been lowering the bar for minority law students for years and years and dooming them to hundreds of thousands of dollars of nondischargeable loan debt, and the man who started it all seems relatively disappointed with what's happened and the awful outcomes students have seen. [[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-a-law-school-empire-fueled-by-federal-loans-1511544524)] * ""I think when it’s all said and done, what you’re gonna see is there was nothing racial that motivated this."" The lawyer representing the white University of Hartford student who smeared period blood all over her black roommate's things to get her to move out doesn't think his client should be charged with a hate crime.

# Mega Firm Celebrates Lawyers' 'Sartorial Flair'
## A Biglaw firm being silly and having a good time!

Here’s a little Fri-YAY fun.

Working in Biglaw can be a stodgy affair; very serious work, you see, and lots of long hours, no time for a laugh. Well, if that’s your impression of those who work in the biggest law firms in the world, you’re in for a treat.

Roll on Friday [got their hands](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-dla-piper-lawyers-serenade-partner-lockdown-music-video) on a tribute video from DLA Piper whose employment partner Tim Marshall is stepping down as Joint Global Head of the firm’s employment practice. Set to the tune of “So Long, Farewell” from The Sound Of Music (extra point for the show tune), it features DLA-ers decked out in their best 1920s-inspired garb.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  

But the very best part is the good humor the firm displayed when Roll on Friday asked them for a comment. A DLA spokesperson said:

“Tim has had a change of role at the firm, and seeing as they couldn’t get together in person to thank him for his eight years as International Group Head, his colleagues thought they would do the next best thing and give him the gift of song”.

“We apologise unreservedly if any [] readers’ eyes or ears were damaged in the viewing of this video, but remain quietly proud of the team’s fortitude, ingenuity and sheer sartorial flair in celebrating with Tim during this lockdown period”.

Nice. Easily my favorite Biglaw statement of all time.

# The Commonwealth -- An Engine For Legal Innovation?
## In the past decade, the Commonwealth has evolved from a way for the U.K. to create its own economic and soft-power spheres of influence with former colonies into a larger organization focused on trade among its members.

Where on your passport would stamps from the 2022 Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meeting originate?

If you practice law in the United States, when you hear the word Commonwealth you probably think of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania — or perhaps Virginia and Kentucky. If you practice in the United Kingdom, most likely the Commonwealth implies an organization designed to keep past British colonies close and play sports against each other ever four years, so you’d be forgiven for guessing London.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Neither of those inferences suggest that the heads of 54 governments would have a CHOGM in Rwanda, a country that was never a British colony. But indeed, last week I flew to its capital, Kigali, as a delegate for the session — an opportunity I’m not sure many lawyers or legal entrepreneurs would drop everything to take. But as the founder of a U.K.- and Rwanda-based legaltech company, [Hence Technologies](http://www.hence.ai/), I knew the conference would attract top regional businesses and provide the basis for an exploration of their experience with legal services in the context of a large ministerial gathering. Besides, I’d have a better chance of snapping selfies with Prince Charles and the U.K. Prime Minister there than in London. So, there I went.

What I quickly learned is that this isn’t your grandfather’s Commonwealth. In the past decade, the Commonwealth has evolved from a way for the U.K. to create its own economic and soft-power spheres of influence with former colonies into a larger organization focused on trade among its members. It now serves as a vehicle for smaller countries to prominently voice their opinions on issues like the devastation climate change brings to island nations. And its membership rules have evolved such that countries which were not former colonies — like Rwanda — can join on the basis of ascribing to the prominence of English-speaking language and other core values. Gabon and Togo, similarly, were admitted this year.

So where does law fit into the equation? “The Rule of Law is an essential part of the Commonwealth charter and the legal sector plays a key role in developing and sustaining Commonwealth trade” says Sir Hugo Swire, deputy chairman of the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council (CWEIC). “Shared legal practices is one of the benefits of Commonwealth membership and one of the key parts that make up the Commonwealth advantage — that make it now 21% cheaper to trade between Commonwealth countries.”

The case is similar in general with independence of the judiciary. The “common law basis of much of Commonwealth law makes a fruitful basis for cooperation. Judicial networks are often strong with Commonwealth chief justices meeting regularly. These justices encourage each other to stick to their constitutions and not succumb to political pressure” says Nicholas Westcott, who is director at the Royal African Society and previously served as the EU’s top diplomat for Africa.

So, all of this means it must be easy to get consistent legal services that enable international business from Antigua to Zambia, right? Not quite.

From conversations with dozens of senior officials, business leaders, and entrepreneurs I’ve drawn a few conclusions about legal services across the Commonwealth.

First, the practice of law remains a fundamentally political and personal business, particularly in the smaller member-states that are most keen on using the Commonwealth as a trade network. I could argue this is no different than in major Western economies, but, in fact, when communities are smaller, it’s not uncommon for every party involved in a dispute to already have deep relationships. This means strengths and weaknesses of the lawyers on both sides are known from ongoing personal relationships and can be exploited as the legal process unfolds. In some cases, that comes from the exertion of unrelated political pressure to get matters to go away before they emerge. Knowing whether your counsel is a power player or not is critical before engagement as you can be sure the opposing party is well aware and ready to use that knowledge to their advantage.

Second, big global law firms continue to dominate the scene for those making inbound investments. But there are challenges in getting the right advice through this entry point. Boko Inyundo, who held senior roles at global law firms DLA Piper and Linklaters before joining Hence Technologies, the startup I co-founded, provides helpful perspective.

“When Fortune 500 companies source legal advice via the global elite of mega firms they run the risk of accessing deep specialist legal insight that can be decoupled from regulatory changes occurring in real time locally on the ground. This can be the case when working with the “Africa Desk” of a mega firm where the firm is triaging support to the client on Africa deals via their London, Paris, or Dubai office. Here the corporate legal department is heavily dependent on how well integrated the global teams in the mega firms are with their local counterparts in the relevant African countries. And that is heavily dependent on how rich the referral work is, and has been over the years, between the ‘main’ (often U.S. or U.K.) offices of the mega firm and the office(s) or local affiliate firms on the African continent. And when the Fortune 500 legal department opts to source legal advice direct from a local law firm in Africa, the corporate runs the danger of accessing deep knowledge of the local regulatory dynamics decoupled from the high, and often shifting or nuanced, expectations of the increasingly large global pools of capital that have been flowing towards Africa.”

Third, where pricing is consistent, it is consistently high in the case of big law firms serving small markets. That is to say, I’ve personally experienced flat-rate pricing that literally commands the equivalent of one year’s per capita GDP in a small market to file a single-page form. And the equivalent form is often quoted cheaper in absolute terms to have a paralegal file in London.

Where someone tries to go directly to local counsel, the pricing can get funkier. One entrepreneur told me the story of successfully working with local counsel in East Africa, after which he received what amounted to a loan request. In effect, the note said “because you value my practice and will use us again, can you please now transfer me the same amount again in advance to ensure we stay in business.” This is not all that different from my own experience where I was required to transfer double what I intended to spend into a rand holding account to attain South African legal advice. My balance remains sitting in a rapidly depreciating currency even though the counsel’s hourly rates were denominated in euros.

But as the Commonwealth has evolved into a business-oriented constellation, there are efforts under way to “let the business begin,” as was the common refrain at the conference. In particular, one of the more innovative programs I came across was the CWEIC’s Commonwealth Legal Network (CLN). The CLN effectively vets law firms so that businesses aren’t starting from scratch as they seize opportunities that result from closer collaboration. While there are only 11 firms in the newly launched program, Riyan Sherif, business development manager for CWEIC, tells me “The Commonwealth Legal Network is already becoming a great tool for both businesses and law firms to find partners across a trusted network. We are already seeing referrals between members and new connections being made.” When built out to scale, the types of networks can provide efficient shortcuts as well as a common place to capture and share feedback.

I’ve returned to London with more respect for the Commonwealth and also a deeper appreciation for the important role it plays for smaller countries attempting to raise profile to attract investment and make their case on global issues in an amplified way. But I only landed one of the intended selfies.

# Actually, THIS Tech Stipend Blows The Competition Out Of The Water
## Another firm makes a strong case for having the best tech policy.

Yesterday, we hailed Simpson Thacher for joining Paul Weiss in giving out a very generous tech stipend. The new Simpson policy offers lawyers $2000, replenishable every three years, to spend on tech purchases as well as a $50/month data plan allowance. From what we understood, this put Simpson at the top of the Biglaw tech pyramid.

Not so fast! At the conclusion of the piece, we asked you to write in with your firm’s tech stipend information, and it turns out another firm is giving out an even bigger tech stipend!

A Brown Rudnick tipster informs us that their firm is offering a $1000 stipend replenishable every year. That means Brown Rudnick associates are looking at $3000 over three years instead of just $2000, making this a much nicer deal by the numbers.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
On the other hand, the Simpson policy allows associates to make big-ticket purchases by putting $2000 in their hypothetical pockets in a lump sum. If an associate wanted a high-end laptop — which can easily run upwards of $2000 — they’d have that money available. With a $1000 annual stipend, the associate would have to spend some money out of pocket to pay for the computer. You win some, you lose some.

Still, missing out on the top-notch Mac may not matter much when you can buy a new [Apple tablet](https://amzn.to/2s1SngA) or [Sony Digital Paper](https://amzn.to/2GDZXDf) (affiliate links) every year. An attorney can get pretty cutting-edge with a steady supply of $1000/year.

Please keep sending us the full scoop on your firms’ policy. Once we get a comprehensive list, we’ll post the winners and losers when it comes to tech.

# Simpler Legal Papers Are Often Better
## Once in a while, brevity is not only the soul of wit, it also carries the day.

Many attorneys think that clients will be impressed by larger displays of legal effort, and that this makes it beneficial to produce voluminous legal papers to promote a client’s interests. Other lawyers might believe that a court will also be more persuaded by larger legal papers than arguments presented in simpler documents. However, from my experience, lawyers usually should try to make their legal papers as simple as possible due to the complexities of producing more voluminous legal papers in a given situation.

I first experienced the power of simpler motions earlier in my career with one of the first summary judgment motions I drafted and filed. My client had two co-defendants in the case, and I had just been assigned to the matter even though it had been pending since I was a freshman in high school. I put together a simple summary judgment motion, mostly because I did not have too much knowledge of the file and because I did not have sufficient time to be brought up to speed on all of the case materials.

When giving me advice about motions, my secretary said that I should only attach limited exhibits to the motion so that it would be easy for the judge to pick up the motion papers and refer to documents. This was in the days before electronic filing, and the only way that a judge would be able to refer to exhibits would be to pull a given tab on the motion papers and refer to the hard copy document. I ended up centering my summary judgment motion upon a recent appellate legal decision in my favor and only included a few factual exhibits.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When the deadline came for the summary judgment motion, I was surprised that I did not receive my co-defendant’s papers in the mail. I ended up discovering that the co-defendant had filed the papers by the deadline, but the papers were so voluminous, they had to ship the motion papers in a box to the attorneys involved in the case, and this accounted for the delay. The motion papers must have comprised thousands of pages, and an entire banker’s box was full of the papers my co-defendant assembled to advance its summary judgment arguments.

When it came time to argue the motion in court, the judge made a comment about how voluminous the motion papers of the co-defendant were. The judge mentioned how the court attorney needed to wheel the papers around and how difficult it was for the court to refer to the papers when preparing for oral arguments. At the end of the day, I won summary judgment for my client, and my co-defendant lost. I do not think that the volume of motion papers was why the co-defendant lost the summary judgment motion and I won, but it probably helped that the court could digest my arguments more easily than my co-defendant’s points, which required sifting through thousands of pages of documents.

Sometimes, simple legal papers can amplify an argument and make a solid point that might be missed if the argument is presented in more voluminous papers. Earlier in my career, I worked at a law firm at which an associate prepared a voluminous and well-reasoned summary judgment motion arguing that an act of the plaintiff meant that she did not have any claims in that case. The motion was supported by deposition transcripts, court records, and a brief that included a boatload of legal reasoning. We all thought that the motion was going to be a winner.

We eventually received opposition papers from plaintiff’s counsel, and we were pretty stunned. The opposition consisted of a one-page affirmation that argued the summary judgment motion should be denied since discovery was not yet complete. The affirmation only included a citation to the court rules, and did not include citations to case law or other authorities. There was also a glaring typo in the papers, which really stood out to me, since the lawyers could presumably proofread a one-page opposition! In any case, the court eventually denied the summary judgment motion based on the reasoning contained in that one-page opposition. Perhaps the court really focused in on the argument presented since the opposition papers were so simple.

In any case, lawyers might think they are doing a client a good service by preparing complex and voluminous papers, and of course, sometimes lawyers need to be thorough to preserve arguments for appeal and for other reasons. However, sometimes simpler legal papers can best serve a client’s interests.

The stock market is down, way down. The Dow Jones suffered its largest single-day drop in history. Thanks to escalated fears about the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak, it’s beginning to look like the days before the financial crisis began. People are panicking and have gone into crisis mode — even Biglaw firms.

As the coronavirus continues its onslaught across the globe with at least 82,000 people infected thus far, the world’s largest law firms have gone on the offensive, initiating measures to ensure that employees are protected from contracting the illness. More firms have issued travel restrictions, more firms are encouraging employees to work remotely, and some firms have even closed their doors entirely.

In addition to the firms we [previously reported on](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/coronavirus-fears-prompt-biglaw-firms-to-limit-travel-reschedule-retreats-to-protect-partners/), these are the latest to give instructions to employees on how they’ll be dealing with the threat of coronavirus:

- Shearman & Sterling – the firm has issued a travel ban for China and Hong Kong, and will limit lawyers’ nonessential travel to Italy, Japan, and South Korea, with orders for remote work having been given for all employees in Asia and Italy
- Dorsey & Whitney – the firm is encouraging lawyers and staff in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong to work remotely, and has distributed laptops to all lawyers and staff to enable them to do so
- Sullivan & Cromwell – the firm has told lawyers to check in with managing partners or office directors if they plan to travel to any of the countries that have had major coronavirus outbreaks and to be aware that they may have to self-quarantine upon their return
- Morgan Lewis – the firm has encouraged associates and partners in Asia office to work remotely, restricted all nonessential travel, and shipped supplies directly to its offices in Asia
- Baker McKenzie – the firm has limited nonessential travel for lawyers and has put remote working protocols in place
- Pillsbury – the firm hasn’t closed its Asia offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei, Taiwan, and Tokyo, but has sent respirator masks from the U.S. and has ordered hand sanitizer stations for all of its offices in an attempt to help protect its employees
- Hogan Lovells – while the firm is restricting nonessential travel, it hasn’t closed its Asia offices or office in Milan, Italy, and will permit employees to work remotely if they “have concerns”
- Latham – the firm has canceled a March 5 client reception at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, New York, “[o]ut of an abundance of caution”
- Quinn Emanuel – the firm is paying for employees to take taxis rather than public transport if they must go to the office
- Squire Patton Boggs – the firm is paying for employees to take taxis rather than public transport if they must go to the office
Some firms have temporarily closed their doors due to the coronavirus taking hold:

- Dentons – the firm temporarily shut down its office in Wuhan, China, where the virus was first identified
- Faegre Drinker – the firm temporararily shut down its offices in Shanghai and Beijing, but has since reopened them
- Baker McKenzie – the firm was the [first in London to temporarily close its doors](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/02/28/baker-mckenzie-shuts-down-london-office-following-coronavirus-scare-405-54895/) following a coronavirus scare, telling employees to work from home after someone at the firm didn’t feel well upon returning from Italy

Attorney General Bill Barr thought he could end the Michael Flynn prosecution by canning all the hard-working Department of Justice prosecutors and having a flunky declare that the government is dropping the case. A case that they’d already won.

That’s… unusual.

And it’s also the sort of thing that requires leave of the court.

Debevoise partner John Gleeson, a former Eastern District of New York judge, joined the Michael Flynn case at Judge Sullivan’s invitation to, in a nutshell, provide an independent answer to the question of whether or not Judge Sullivan should grant leave to allow the DOJ to walk away on the brink of sentencing and, separately, whether or not Flynn should be held in criminal contempt for now claiming that he wasn’t telling the truth when he admitted under oath to committing crimes.

So what did Judge Gleeson think about the DOJ’s arguments for dropping the case? A little inside baseball here, but the word “pretextual” gets prominent billing and that’s not good for the prosecution:

The Government’s ostensible grounds for seeking dismissal are conclusively disproven by its own briefs filed earlier in this very proceeding. They contradict and ignore this Court’s prior orders, which constitute law of the case. They are riddled with inexplicable and elementary errors of law and fact.

Twitter is replete with lobotomized non-lawyers (and sometimes just bad lawyers) trying to sell the cockamamie theory that Flynn was entrapped by some sort of illegal government sting operation. The basic tenets of this argument don’t hold up to scrutiny — the dates don’t even match up in most cases — but they’re still bleating about FBI collusion.

Judge Gleeson found collusion alright. But not where those folks think it is:

Rule 48(a) was designed to “guard against dubious dismissals of criminal cases that would benefit powerful and well-connected defendants.” In other words, the rule empowers courts to protect the integrity of their own proceedings from prosecutors who undertake corrupt, politically motivated dismissals. That is what has happened here.

Corrupt. Hooboy.

If Trump wants his buddy cleared, all he has to do is pardon him. There’s a constitutional process sitting right there! It would still smack of corruption, but there’s nothing anyone can really do about it. But instead, Barr cooked up this scheme that ends up failing to accomplish the goal and obliterating the reputation of the Department of Justice in the process. These people are the Wile E. Coyote of politics.

Oh, and what about that criminal contempt claim?

The Court has also asked me to address whether it should issue an order to show cause why Flynn should not be held in criminal contempt for perjury. Flynn has indeed committed perjury in these proceedings, for which he deserves punishment, and the Court has the authority to initiate a prosecution for that crime.

It was hard for even the most ardent MAGAheads to deny that Flynn’s two confessions under oath weren’t lies. Prosecutors can put defendants under duress but a sophisticated government official with high-powered Biglaw counsel can’t really retreat to the “oh, I had no idea what I was doing” defense.

The good news for Flynn is that Gleeson isn’t recommending a separate contempt charge, suggesting that Judge Sullivan just add it to his consideration of the sentence for the underlying crime.

# Law Firm Merger Mania: Eversheds And Sutherland Are Talking
## What's driving this deal, which would create a Biglaw behemoth with more than 2,000 lawyers worldwide?

As 2016 draws to a close, Biglaw associates have visions of [bonus plums](https://abovethelaw.com/bonuses/) dancing in their heads. Meanwhile, partners have mergers on their minds.

Earlier this month, Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer [announced their merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/two-new-york-and-d-c-powerhouses-arnold-porter-and-kaye-scholer-agree-to-merge/). Meanwhile, the troubled U.K. firm of King & Wood Mallesons [continues to seek a suitor](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/troubled-biglaw-firm-searches-for-hero-to-rescue-it-via-merger/).

Finding a merger partner when you’re in dire straits is difficult. It’s much easier to be merging for purposes of strengthening your platform, as opposed to mere survival. This takes us to today’s potential transaction, involving two firms on solid footing that seek to go global. From Casey Sullivan of [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/sutherland-and-eversheds-are-in-merger-talks/):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The Atlanta-based law firm Sutherland Asbill & Brennan is in merger discussions with Eversheds of London, the firms announced on Tuesday.

If consummated, the deal would create a law firm with more than 2,300 lawyers spanning 31 offices in 29 countries, the firms said in a joint statement. Combined revenue would be more than $900 million, according to the firm’s 2015 revenue figures, placing it among the top 40 largest law firms in the world by revenue.

“Joining forces with Sutherland will give each firm’s clients a global platform and we will be discussing with our partners positively in the coming weeks,” said Eversheds chief executive Bryan Hughes, in a statement.

The announcement depicted the discussions as being in an advanced, yet incomplete stage. It said that both firms have presented the proposed combination to their partners, who will likely vote on the deal before year-end.

“A new entity called Eversheds Sutherland, overseen by a global Board and with equal representation from each firm would be created by this transaction,” the firms said.

It makes sense for the Eversheds name to take precedence, given the comparative size of the two firms. In terms of headcount, Eversheds has almost 2,000 lawyers, while Sutherland has around 400. Not surprisingly, Eversheds has much larger revenue as well. But the firms are compatible in terms of profits per partner, as noted by Meredith Hobbs in the [Daily Report](http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202773344726/Sutherland-and-Eversheds-Are-in-Talks-to-Combine?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

Commensurate with Eversheds’ greater size, its revenue is higher than Sutherland’s, but the two firms have similar profits per equity partner. Eversheds reported revenue of £405.5 million for the 2015-2016 fiscal year—$503.4 million at the current exchange rate of $1.24 to £1—and ranks No. 13 by revenue in Legal Week’s UK Top 50 Firms.

Sutherland reported $301 million in revenue in 2015, ranking No. 107 in the Am Law 200. Sutherland’s PPP is a bit higher at $1.02 million per equity partner, compared with £742,000 or $921,000 per equity partner for Eversheds at the current exchange rate.

What’s motivating the merger talk? From the firms’ [joint statement](http://www.sutherland.com/NewsCommentary/Press-Releases/194628/Global-Client-Service-Drives-Focus-for-Eversheds-and-Sutherland-Discussions):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The rationale for the proposed transaction is driven by a shared vision of providing clients with high-quality, consistent and coordinated service around the globe.

Seems sound. As clients go global, many law firms must as well (subject to some exceptions, like Cravath and Wachtell).

Keep in mind that this isn’t a done deal just yet. Both partnerships must approve the transaction. Until then, either party can walk away — just as Foley & Lardner [left Eversheds at the altar](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/foley-lardner-to-leave-eversheds-standing-at-the-altar/) last year.

Good luck to the two firms as they explore a possible collaboration. If you have information or insight to share, please feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Eversheds%20Sutherland) (subject line: “Eversheds Sutherland”), or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks.

# Biglaw Firm Does Away With Profit-Sharing Bonus Due To Poor Financial Performance
## This certainly isn't a good sign.

We haven’t spoken about bonuses in a while, and considering some of the [doom](http://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs) and [gloom](http://abovethelaw.com/tag/deferrals) that’s happening in the legal profession, maybe that’s a good thing.

Don’t believe us? Get a load of this: Thanks to plummeting profits, one firm is doing away with its profit share bonus for all non-partner employees.

Taylor Wessing — a U.K. firm that brought in $578,914,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 102nd place on the 2022 Global 200 — has offered a salary-based 5% profit share bonus to all employees for the past two years thanks to its outstanding performance. This year, the firm is stepping away from that bonus due to a poor financial showing.

Here are some additional details from [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2023/07/07/taylor-wessing-scraps-profit-share-bonus-scheme-after-uk-profits-fall/):

Taylor Wessing’s profit in the U.K. fell 12% for the financial year 2022/23 compared to last year’s figure—although U.K. and international revenues have both climbed up.

After a considerable 32% increase in the firm’s profits in the U.K. last year—in which Taylor Wessing made a record breaking profit of £93 million [~$118,993,500]—this year the firm made a profit of £81.7 million [~$104,535,150].

The firm saw a 4.4% increase in global revenue to £439 million [~$561,700,500], as well as a 3.5% uplift in U.K. revenue to £227.1 million [~$290,697,084].

Shane Gleghorn, the firm’s U.K. managing partner, told Law.com International that its record financial growth “was always going to be difficult to replicate this year.” The site estimates that profits per equity partner at the firm would be about £809,000 (~$1,036,778), nearly 8% less than last year, when that figure reached £877,000 (~$1,123,923).

Hopefully Taylor Wessing will be able to offer its profit share bonus to all employees again in the future. And here’s hoping that Biglaw firms in the U.S. won’t be forced to take their generous bonuses down a notch due to the turbulent economy that’s forced some firms to conduct layoffs and defer their incoming first-year associate classes.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm announces bonuses (or in this case, the lack thereof), please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Top Biglaw Firm Has Already Closed One Of Its China Offices, May Close Another Soon
## If these firms have to remain in China, then consolidation is the name of the game.

Biglaw firms are eager to get out of China while the getting is still good — or at the very least, consolidate their offerings there — and the latest firm to do so is at the tippy top of the Am Law 100.

As first reported by [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/27/weil-gotshal-shutters-beijing-and-mulls-shanghai-closure-405-138750/), Weil Gotshal has already closed its Beijing office and is thinking about calling it quits on its Shanghai office as well. Here are some additional details:

According to an administration staff member who works in Weil’s Hong Kong office, the firm ceased operations in Beijing late last year. In Beijing, the firm didn’t have any resident partners and its office closure meant that its two lawyers, one counsel and one associate, were let go. Weil launched that office in 2008.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A spokesperson from Weil offered the following statement on the firm’s proposed closure of its Shanghai office, which was first opened in 2004: “The firm is engaged in discussions on the office in Shanghai with a view to consolidating its Asia operations through the Hong Kong office. We will be working out the details in the coming months, but we remain dedicated to our award-winning Asia practice and to providing top service to our clients in the region.”

Weil’s Shanghai office is home to two partners and five other attorneys, while its Hong Kong office has 22 lawyers, including five partners. The firm reportedly declined to comment on alternative employment arrangements for its Shanghai lawyers, should the office be closed.

Which Biglaw firm will be the next say zàijiàn to its offices in China? You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20China%20Office%20Closure) or text us ([646-820-8477](tel:646-820-8477)) if you have any intel. Thank you.

Evan Greebel and Martin Shkreli

After an 11-week trial, Evan Greebel, former attorney to pharma bro Martin Shkreli, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  Greebel, a former partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman and Kaye Scholer, faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.

Greebel acted as outside counsel for pharmaceutical company Retrophin from 2012 to 2014. During that time, prosecutors alleged Greebel assisted Shkreli in using Retrophin’s assets to pay investors in unrelated hedge funds run by Shkreli through the use of phony settlement and consulting agreements and fraudulently backdating agreements .

During the trial, Greebel’s attorneys tried to paint him as victimized by the notorious Shkreli; [during his opening statement](http://www.businessinsider.com/martin-shkrelis-former-attorney-was-convicted-of-aiding-fraud-scheme-2017-12) for the defense, Gibson Dunn’s Reed Brodsky said Shkreli lied about key facts to Greebel. Brodsky’s reaction to the guilty verdict was one of shock:

“We are shocked by the verdict,” said Reed Brodsky, a lawyer for Greebel. “We will continue to fight for justice for Evan Greebel and his family.”

In comments to reporters [following the verdict](https://www.law.com/sites/newyorklawjournal/2017/12/27/jury-finds-former-martin-shkreli-attorney-guilty-in-stock-scheme/), Brodsky said his client was unfairly painted by his former association with the “toxic” Shkreli, and that he “hope[d] that the judge will evaluate the evidence and the law and right this injustice.”

In a[ statement ](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/new-york-attorney-convicted-securities-fraud-and-wire-fraud-conspiracies)regarding the verdict against Greebel, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Bridget M. Rohde said the verdict sends a message that attorneys will be held accountable when their actions are made to “facilitate the commission of crimes”:

“By helping Retrophin CEO Martin Shkreli steal millions of dollars and cover up Shkreli’s fraud, the defendant Evan Greebel betrayed the trust placed in him by Retrophin’s board of directors to represent the company’s best interests,” stated Acting United States Attorney Rohde. “Today’s verdict sends a powerful message that this Office, together with our law enforcement partners, will hold lawyers accountable when they use their legal expertise to facilitate the commission of crimes.”

No date has been set yet for Greebel’s sentencing.

Cloud-native technology is the cornerstone of digital transformation initiatives for modern businesses to remain competitive. As data volumes explode, modern filetypes proliferate document review, and legal teams collaborate across the digital divide, will eDiscovery inevitably follow?

Organizations that adopt cloud-based eDiscovery identify key information quickly amid what can often be chaotic and expansive document sets. These platforms promote seamless collaboration, optimize efficiencies across workflows, and provide better control and higher data security.

In partnership with our friends at the leading eDiscovery provider [Everlaw](http://bit.ly/2y2v9fZ), we’re fielding a [survey](http://bit.ly/2LcSG5Z) to gain insight into how law firms are implementing and utilizing their platforms.

Dean Daniel Rodriguez (via Northwestern Law)

Big news in the world of legal education today: [Daniel B. Rodriguez](http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/danielrodriguez/) will step down as dean of Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, effective at the end of this academic year. Dean Rodriguez will become Professor Rodriguez, rejoining the faculty and returning to his scholarship and teaching in administrative law, local government law, and state constitutional law.

This news is major not just because of the stature of Northwestern Law, one of the nation’s great law schools, but also because of the stature of Dean Rodriguez. Unlike many other deans of so-called “T14” law schools, who were content to keep their heads down and quietly cash tuition checks, Dean Rodriguez was an active and eloquent participant in debates over the value proposition of law school and the future of legal education.

My colleague Elie Mystal, who often found himself on the [opposite side](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/atl-vs-law-dean-vs-common-sense/) of [those debates](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/debating-the-utility-of-the-third-year-of-law-school/) from Dean Rodriguez, had this to say about Rodriguez’s departure: “Dean Rodriguez was deeply committed to rethinking legal education. His departure as dean is a loss for the forces of reform within the legal academy.”

Dean Rodriguez didn’t just talk; he also acted. He raised epic amounts of money for Northwestern Law, culminating in an unprecedented $100 million gift from J.B. Pritzker and M.K. Pritzker, which led to the renaming of the law school. He wasn’t afraid to try new things, including [accepting the GRE in lieu of the LSAT](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/northwestern-officially-accepting-the-gre/) and launching the first two-year J.D. program at a top-tier law school. [UPDATE: The two-year program was actually [launched under Dean Rodriguez’s predecessor](http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2009/05/twoyearjd.html), David Van Zandt.] Not all of the experiments worked — the accelerated J.D. program, for example, was [discontinued in 2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/northwestern-admits-defeat-will-discontinue-its-accelerated-j-d-program/) — but there’s no denying that Dean Rodriguez and Northwestern Law were committed to innovation in legal education.

Here at Above the Law, we congratulate Dean Rodriguez on six successful years of service — and express the hope (and confidence) that even when he’s Professor Rodriguez rather than Dean Rodriguez, he will remain engaged in the effort to improve American legal education.

# Prosecutors Say Pipe Bomb Suspect Addressed An IED Package To A Biglaw Firm
## The incident raises serious security concerns for all Biglaw firms.

The list of people that suspected pipe bomber Cesar Altieri Sayoc is accused of targeting with his improvised explosive devices is quite long and includes a number of notable Democratic figures like Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hilary Clinton, Cory Booker, Maxine Waters, and Eric Holder. But what takes this story from a general news story about the f**ked up state of the world, to one about Biglaw suitable for the pages of Above the Law is the IED sent to former Attorney General Eric Holder.

As [reported](https://www.law.com/2018/10/26/complaint-bomb-targeting-holder-was-addressed-to-dc-law-firm-office/) by Law.com, law enforcement’s [complaint against Sayoc](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5022026/Attachment-1-1.pdf) revealed the bomb intended for Holder was addressed to him at his job, as a[ partner at Covington & Burling](https://www.cov.com/en/professionals/h/eric-holder):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The complaint identifies Holder as a partner of a “certain law firm” without mentioning Covington & Burling by name, and notes that the IED was addressed to Holder’s office at his firm in Washington, D.C., described as “Holder Office-1.” Holder returned to Covington & Burling in D.C. in 2015 after leaving the Department of Justice.

The package sent to the firm was returned to the address listed as the sender, which, according to law enforcement, belongs to Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Covington & Burling has declined to comment on the matter.

This incident, which, fortunately, did not result in any injuries, has raised concerns at other Biglaw firms with prominent figures about their own security procedures. Not that anyone is really willing to talk about it on the record:

Law firms across Washington, many of which are home to former government officials, demurred this week when asked whether the mailed explosives had prompted them to review security measures. Firms appeared to be concerned that commenting on the issue could make them potential targets for would-be attackers.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Associate Bonus Watch: New York Bonuses Go To Washington
## Will other Washington firms follow suit?

Now these are some ‘capitol’ bonuses.

I was chatting a few days ago with a D.C. lawyer who wanted to know what would be considered “market” for bonuses in Washington. I told this attorney, “Tough to say — some people like to think it’s the New York scale, but there are enough major D.C. firms that pay well below that, so I’m not sure that’s really the right answer.”

But maybe it is now? [Covington & Burling](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/covington-burling/) — which we’ve previously [described](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-word-from-a-top-d-c-firm/) as “arguably the top dog in town (at least among full-service Biglaw firms, setting aside elite litigation boutiques and such)” — just announced bonuses for its D.C. and California associates, and it has basically moved to the [New York scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It has also moved to a system that’s more lockstep than its prior [individualized system](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/associate-bonus-watch-associates-at-covington-covet-their-neighbors-bonuses/?rf=1). As noted in the memo, posted in full on the next page, Covington in D.C. and California is taking the NYC bonus scale and using it as the basis for a “unified scale” of “presumptive bonuses.” The presumption is that “all associates in a given class presumptive receive the same bonuses,” as long as they meet the firm’s “workload benchmark” (which we understand to be 1950 hours, including pro bono work). But the memo notes that associates with workloads or performances that are below or “significantly above” expectations might get bonuses below or above the unified scale.

Two questions. First, [Covington bonuses in New York](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-word-from-a-top-d-c-firm/), announced back in December, took the NYC scale and called it a table of “maximum bonus amounts.” Does the Covington D.C. announcement mean that top performers in Washington might get more than their high-performing colleagues in New York? If so, that would be a reversal of Covington’s past practice, which treated New York associates better than their counterparts elsewhere.

Second, and more importantly from the broader Biglaw market perspective, does Covington essentially following the New York scale in Washington put pressure on other D.C. heavyweights — think Akin Gump, Arnold & Porter, Hogan Lovells, Steptoe & Johnson, and WilmerHale — to follow suit, either by matching Covington if they haven’t yet announced or retroactively enhancing bonuses if they have already announced?

(By our count, we’ve already seen 2015 bonus announcements from [Arnold & Porter](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-a-not-so-happy-new-year/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-are-d-c-based-firms-cheap/), and [WilmerHale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-very-satisfying-bonuses-plus-a-pay-scale-overhaul/). We believe that Akin and Steptoe bonuses are out, but we don’t have the memos or info — please [send our way](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus%20Memo) if you can.)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We reached out to our Covington sources for their reactions. Most seemed pleased. Here’s what one said:

Now there appears to be a hard cutoff at 1950 hours, including billable and pro bono only. They still had us write bonus memos this year describing any additional factors like cancelled vacations. I was [a little under] 1950 and am not sure yet whether I should be pumped or whether I’m getting screwed. I am disappointed to still have to wait until April to find out, but I think busier colleagues should be pleased and will benefit from both higher average bonuses and certainty.

Thanks always for shining some sun on comp.

You’re most welcome. Please help us help you by sending bonus tips [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus%20Memo) or by text (646-820-8477). Thanks again.

# Biglaw Associates, Partners Need To Change Their 'Selfish' Work Routines Now That They're Expected In The Office

We got into a space [during the pandemic] where we had the ability to be completely selfish for a long time, and it was OK to do so. Unlearning some of those practices as we integrate back into society has been difficult for associates, partners, everyone. The slightest inconvenience feels like world war.

We, as society and the legal industry, are in a position where we need to commit to the change and endure some of the tougher, more inconvenient parts. That is, if they want to maintain a sense of community that brought them to their firm.

— [Ru Bhatt](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/ru-bhatt?byconsultantorauthor=ru-bhatt), a recruiter with Major, Lindsey & Africa who specializes in associate placement, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/30/the-lawyers-are-not-all-right/), on the way that lawyers’ sensibilities and sensitivities have changed since the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that the majority of Biglaw employees are expected to work in the office at least three days each week, a lot of their remote work behaviors must change, and quickly at that.

# Ropes & Gray's Reopening Plan Puts An End To The 5-Day, In-Office Workweek For Associates
## This is huge. Will more firms follow in their footsteps?

One by one, top Biglaw firms are announcing their plans for their eventual return to the office in the wake of the pandemic. Several other firms have already laid out three-part reopening plans, each with varying levels of flexibility for the amount of time attorneys would have to be present in the office. We now have news of perhaps the most flexible reopening plan of them all, and it comes from one of the most successful firms in the country.

Back in February, Ropes & Gray announced that it was setting its sights on a [September reopening](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/ropes-gray-september-reopening/?rf=1). Yesterday, during a firmwide town hall meeting, chair Julie Jones laid out the firm’s vision for a return to work for attorneys, in three phases. Here are the key points from a follow-up memo (available in full on the next page) that she sent last night to reiterate all that was said:

Phase 1 (now through the summer)-experience the office if you can. As we mentioned in our February message, our permissive, and entirely optional, use of the offices continues into September.

Phase 2 (targeted for the week of Sept. 13)-we recommend that you spend time in the office more regularly, one to two days a week.

Phase 3 (likely November through 2022)-we will look for a more regular rhythm to office life, and recommend that you spend the majority of your work week (three days a week) in the office.

For associates, these were likely the two most important sentences from Jones’s email: “No matter what phase we are in, we endorse flexibility post-pandemic. We don’t expect that we’ll ever mandate a five-day a week in-office environment.” Yes, you read that correctly. Ropes & Gray — a firm that brought in $2,192,810,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 11 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — is not likely to require that attorneys spend five days in the office, ever again.

For a Biglaw firm of Ropes & Gray’s stature to announce an indefinite policy like this is huge. With this announcement, did Ropes just end the five-day, in-office workweek for good? We’ll have to see if this turns into a trend that catches on across more Biglaw firms.

Sources we’ve heard from say they really appreciate the ramp-up time the firm is allowing for them to reacquaint themselves with office life, and that the flexibility being offered here is what really makes Ropes & Gray a fantastic place to work.

Congratulations to the firm for creating a reopening plan that focuses on flexibility for all attorneys, making very clear that “Ropes is about people, not place.”

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# If Your Biglaw Firm Has The Urge To Merge, Better Do It ASAP
## Merger interest is high, so strike while the iron is hot.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

If you wait until interest rates are down and everyone is crowding into the market, there are going to be fewer options and it’s going to cost more. So, I think there are firms that recognize that they need to continue to make investments when it may not seem like the right time, but in fact, the opportunities are better in those times.

— Lisa Smith, a principal at Fairfax Associates, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/07/03/law-firm-mergers-may-accelerate-in-second-half-of-2023/) on the “best” time for law firms to consider merging, even in the case of a recession. Fairfax recently released a report indicating that mergers are on the rise and interest is likely to remain strong. “[G]iven the level of activity,” the report noted, “we anticipate an acceleration in completed mergers during the second half of the year and into 2024.”

# Kirkland & Ellis Cancels Holiday Party Set For Tomorrow
## Forty-eight hours before go-time, the firm apparently decided it couldn't risk it.

Last night — Tuesday — a tipster reported that Kirkland & Ellis sent an email informing members of the New York office that the holiday party planned for Thursday at the Ziegfeld ballroom was canceled. The firm didn’t give a reason but we’re willing to bet it wasn’t that they suddenly realized no one made the reservation. We’ve reached out to the firm, but haven’t heard back yet.

While surveys confirm that lawyers generally [ache for a return to in-person holiday parties](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/the-pandemic-law-firm-holiday-party-festive-fun-or-superspreader-nightmare/), Kirkland made the right call in playing the party pooper here. Infection rates are spiking again, and while vaccinated folks are less likely to catch the virus and even more unlikely to contract serious cases, the risk that they could carry an infection to a young child or immunocompromised person is just too high right now. If Kirkland has to sacrifice some deposits to protect the firm, it’s willing to make that call.

This comes on the heels of [Latham canceling its remaining in-person holiday parties](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/latham-cancels-the-rest-of-its-holiday-parties-after-giving-everyone-covid/) after the New York Corporate soirée [ended with upwards of 10 associates coming down with COVID](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-holiday-party-turns-into-covid-outbreak/). Just like with Latham, there’s nothing per se wrong with bringing people together for the holidays if everyone is vaccinated, but when parties can feel like an obligation for people who simply cannot afford to get sick right now, it’s best to remove the party outright so everyone can feel comfortable staying home.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Though there’s also a rumor that Kirkland may have followed Latham’s lead a little more closely and encountered its own COVID outbreak following a Chicago holiday event. If so, it’s all the more reason to completely shut down these events going forward — no amount of precaution seems to be doing the trick right now.

No one wants another year of virtual parties, but here we are. Hopefully everyone recognizes that it takes a lot of fortitude to pull the plug on a major event at the last second, but unfortunately it had to be done.

# Law Students And Medical Students Do Not Mix
## Medical students, like law students, are in their own world, and it can be difficult for them to relate.

Law students and medical students have some things in common based on the financial and personal sacrifices most need to make in order to earn their degrees. Medical school and law school both cost a ton of money, and the coursework in both types of graduate programs is usually rigorous. In addition, both medical students and law students enter professions upon graduation that traditionally lead to relatively comfortable lives. However, from my own experience, law students and medical students do not mix, and it is difficult for such students to forge personal and social connections with students at the other school.

When I was in law school at Georgetown University Law Center, the student bar association hosted bar reviews at different bars around the District of Columbia each month. The events were well-attended (especially by first-year law students) who hoped to take a break from their studies and let off some steam with fellow law students. One time, the student bar association decided to host a bar review event along with a similar group at Georgetown’s medical school. The event was called “medical malpractice” and with a name like that, I knew I had to attend!

On a cursory level, it makes sense that law students would want to host an event with medical students. It is always nice for people to expand their social circles, especially since law school can be very gossipy and somewhat like high school when it comes to the social scene. In addition, lawyers and doctors sometimes interact with each other in professional settings, so it might be nice for law students and medical students to interact with each other in school.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
However, the “medical malpractice” bar review was not fun. The law students mostly kept to themselves, and the medical students mostly kept to their schoolmates as well. The scene looked like something out of a junior high school dance! There was very little mixing between students at both schools except for people who already knew folks from the other school from some other context.

In other situations, I also saw firsthand how law students and medical students sometimes do not mix. I am a triplet, and when I was in law school, one of my triplet brothers attended medical school. One weekend, my brother decided to join me at Georgetown so that he could see the sights and spend time with me in my law school environment. During this time, I invited my brother in medical school to a bar where a bunch of law students were planning to meet up to knock back a few after a long week of classes.

Throughout the evening, the law students kept discussing topics related to their legal studies that would not be too interesting to someone who did not attend law school. I felt bad for my brother since he could not participate in the conversations much. Law students are naturally engrossed in the law, and legal subjects are part of many conversations between law students. It can be difficult for medical students to relate to these subjects and participate in such conversations.

The same is true of law students in social settings in which they interact with medical students. I also visited my brother when he was attending medical school. During these trips, I frequently met medical school classmates of my brother. It was difficult for me to interact with these medical students since they wanted to talk about things they learned in class as well as gossip about the people who attended medical school. Medical students, like law students, are in their own world, and it can be difficult for outsiders to interact with people who are outside of this bubble.

All told, there should be more interactions between medical students and law students, since both professions can learn a thing or two from the other. However, it can be difficult for law students and medical students to mix due to the different experiences medical students and law students face.

Gender equality is given a lot of lip service in the legal profession, and yet women continue to face many disparities when they head into the office each and every day. From pay to partnership promotions to the composition of leadership committees to family policies, there are many areas where law firms must change to keep up with the times. Thankfully, some law firms are becoming more progressive, but which firms are doing the best they can for women in all areas?

For the second year in a row, the Yale Law Women have released a ranking of the Top Firms for Gender Equity, coupled its annual list of the Top Family-Friendly Firms. We’ve written about the latter ranking every year (see our coverage from [2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/the-top-10-most-female-friendly-law-firms-2018/), [2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2017/), [2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2016/), [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2015/), [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2014/), [2013](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2013/), [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/the-2012-top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law/), [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law-women/), [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/05/family-friendly-law-firms/), [2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/yale-law-women-anoint-top-ten-family-friendly-firms/), and [2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/non-sequiturs-09-08-08/)), and covered YLW’s important new dual ranking for the first time last year ([2019](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/the-top-10-law-firms-for-gender-equity-family-friendly-policies-2019/)).

Which firms made the cut in 2020? Let’s take a look at the latest rankings.

This year’s list is different from all prior ones produced by the Yale Law Women. This time around, they’ve eschwed a Top 10 ranking altogether. From the report:

Recognizing the individualized experiences and distinct needs of law firm employees, as well as the multitude of factors leading to workplace equity, we are no longer publishing holistic Top Ten lists. Instead, individual firms are honored for excelling in specific categories that relate to overall gender equity and family friendliness. Our report attempts to respect the diverse needs and preferences of those in the legal profession with the understanding that creating equitable workplaces will not entail a one-size-fits-all solution.

This year’s rankings were based off seven distinct categories, with honors given reflecting top firms’ strengths. Without further ado, these are the firms being honored:

Here’s a round-up of useful information about some of the YLW study’s findings:

- Among equity partners, women averaged 21%
- 29% of non-equity partners at the average firm identified as women
- 65% of firms required implicit bias training for all employees
- 36% of attorneys promoted to equity partner at the average firm identified as women
- 7% of attorneys promoted to equity partner at the average firm identified as women of color
- 4% of associates worked part-time schedules at the average firm
- Among associates who worked part-time schedules, women averaged 83%
- 63% of firms promoted someone who had taken caregiver leave in the last five years to equity partner in 2019
- 90% of firms offered equal caregiver leave for birth and adoption of a child
- 90% of firms had a committee specifically designed to address work-life balance
And now, a word on mandatory arbitration agreements. This has become a very hot-button issue in Biglaw, and given that law students are taking to the streets to do away with agreements that seek to strip them of their rights, of course the Yale Law Women delved into the topic. Here are the relevant details:

Reporting firms that do not require mandatory arbitration contracts covering at least some types of dispute as a condition of employment:
Junior & Senior Associates: 47%
Equity Partners: 38%
Other Attorneys: 43%
Non-Legal Employees: 36%

Reporting firms that do not require mandatory arbitration contracts covering allegations of sexual assault or sexual misconduct as a condition of employment:
Junior & Senior Associates: 47%
Equity Partners: 41%
Other Attorneys: 43%
Non-Legal Employees: 46%

Reporting firms that do not require non-disclosure agreements covering allegations of sexual assault or sexual misconduct as a condition of employment:
Junior & Senior Associates: 48%
Equity Partners: 46%
Other Attorneys: 45%
Non-Legal Employees: 47%

Now you know what you may be up against if you decide to sign on the dotted line with any of the Biglaw firms surveyed for these important rankings.

Please click [here](https://ylw.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/YLW-Top-Firms-Report-2020.pdf) (PDF) to see the full report from Yale Law Women.

While vast improvements have been made in terms of gender equity and parental accommodations offerings at large law firms, there is still a lot of work to be done. We said this in the past, but it bears repeating in times like these: “The legal profession has come a long way in terms of attempting to afford equal opportunities for success for both men and women, but it’s still got a long way to go. Why are lawyers still hurrying up and waiting for change?” Be forces for good at your firms. Women deserve to be treated equally, and allies have never been more important. Offer help where help is needed, and together, we can achieve true greatness.

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made the Gender Equity rankings and the latest edition of the Yale Law Women Family-Friendly Firm and How did your firm do? [Email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BLaw%20Firm%5D%20YLW%20Gender%20Equity%20Rankings), text us at [(646) 820-8477](tel:(646)%20820-8477), or tweet us [@atlblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog).

One by one, Biglaw firms across the country have realized that in order to recruit and retain the best talent, they need to offer the best perks and policies for a progressive new generation of lawyers. That may be why yet another firm has decided to truly support its attorneys who are embarking upon the fantastic journey into parenthood.

Which firm is the latest to modernize its parental leave policies? That would be Ropes & Gray, which recently announced that a new, gender-neutral leave policy would be implemented, ensuring that attorneys will receive additional time off following the birth, adoption, or foster placement of their new child.

“Not a Cravath match, but Ropes & Gray just increased parental leave….” said a source. Not to worry, associates, because we’re sure that Cravath match is coming soon. Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s recent memo (a full copy is available on the next page):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


Ropes joins many other Biglaw firms that have recently adopted enhanced, gender-neutral parental leave plans. All lawyers at the firm are now entitled to take up to 14 weeks of paid child care leave, while lawyers who give birth are entitled to take up to 22 weeks of paid leave. All in, a lawyer who gives birth at the firm may take up to 26 weeks of child care leave (with the majority of those weeks being paid in full).

We’ve often wondered whether Biglaw employees will choose to take full advantage of the parental leave policies that are being offered by their firms, and it’s now clear that large firms really want them to, without fearing for their safety of their jobs upon their return to work. These benefits are being offered for a reason: these law firms want associates to feel that they can grow with the firm — not just professionally, but personally. Ropes & Gray’s new policy strives help associates do just that.

# Sex And Biglaw: Why Do The Suits Keep Coming?
## It’s no surprise that in the age of #MeToo, white male hegemony in Biglaw is being exposed, called out, and challenged.

Easy answer: Why not?

Sexual harassment and gender discrimination are being rooted out in every other institution, so why not Biglaw? After all, it’s no secret that Biglaw (and its national trade group, the ABA) has an unhappy history of discrimination.  Recall that African-Americans were [not permitted to join](https://books.google.com/books?id=1lOIjQUG4aoC&pg=PA546&lpg=PA546&dq=ABA+and+black+members&source=bl&ots=QFJ4-VWqK4&sig=9UyBrXFfOnhVNcVaOixox4RblQM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz97bC1drYAhWyQ98KHadBBLgQ6AEIUjAN#v=onepage&q=ABA%20and%20black%20members&f=false) the ABA until 1943.

Oh yes — and gender. (The [first woman member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association) of the ABA was not admitted until 1918).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So it’s no surprise that in the age of #MeToo, white male hegemony in Biglaw is being exposed, called out, and challenged, and its Biglaw factories sued.

Longer answer: It’s built into the Biglaw DNA.  As I [posted here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/can-women-lawyers-ever-find-equality-in-biglaw/) last year, “[a]s long as the profits keep rolling in, why should Biglaw care about gender equality? … Nothing must get in the way of billing, the billable hour, the almost-sacred realization rate, or profits per partner. Certainly not you, lady!”

In other words, the very nature of the Biglaw model — the “iron law” of its existence — makes it “inherently unequal — unequal to all but the ruling few, who happen to be male and white. And for women — who were, after all, only allowed relatively recently into law schools, the ABA, and Biglaw, it is even more unequal — and will continue to be.”

I noted that:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Ivy League law schools, being the Biglaw gatekeepers, select those who will ‘make it’ in Biglaw, and train/brand/clone them to fit right in. And they charge an indecent entrance fee to cull out the herd — enough to keep new lawyers indentured to Biglaw for many years – and long enough for Biglaw to make quite a profit until it sends (most of) them packing. … For its part, Biglaw must pay ever-higher salaries so that the associates can and will be enticed (or forced) to stay – and for which the associates are required to work on an assembly line that gets faster and faster each year … And for which client fees must be jacked up ever higher.”

But like all institutions subject to their own “iron law,” Biglaw’s wheels are rusting and slowing down and in danger of finally seizing up as a result of market forces — and the resistance of those who have long been silent.

Is Biglaw’s Strategy A Maginot Line?

As Kathryn Rubino [posted here ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/new-warning-for-biglaw-firms-not-that-theyll-listen-anyway/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=59935706&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9gptmVclXeEehbsdH8H3FeOTnsS10hZwJaAJQL2S2D-FR-LrIv1umCoB_8u8b4oXxVvKuYWc1_3FmWqK4Mmz80tnC4U1CYky_ZFhKTgifJMo5goug&_hsmi=59935706)the other day, “What will it take for Biglaw firms to wake up and see that the way they’ve ‘always’ done business is not going to cut it anymore? Despite several [iterations of industry reports](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/law-firm-leaders-are-completely-confident-that-they-dont-have-much-confidence/) generously described as tepid, law firms seem entrenched in their stagnant ways, as they remain committed to ‘once-successful strategies even as evidence mounts of their failure.’”

She was referring to the [just-issued](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/2018-legal-market-report/) Georgetown-Thomson Reuters “2018 Report on the State of the Legal Market” which “compares the strategies of many firms to the French strategy of the Maginot Line — a seemingly impregnable fortification that provided a false sense of security until it was easily defeated in the early stages of World War II.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yikes — comparing Biglaw to the Maginot Line, which collapsed in a few short weeks and with it the collapse of France? Can things be even more dire in Biglaw than it seems?

The National Law Journal headlined [its coverage](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/10/new-report-warns-of-a-wake-up-call-for-stagnant-law-firms/?kw=New%20Report%20Warns%20of%20a%20%E2%80%98Wake-Up%20Call%E2%80%99%20for%20Stagnant%20Law%20Firms&et=editorial&bu=National%20Law%20Journal&cn=20180111&src=EMC-Email&pt=Daily%20Headlines) of this report “New Report Warns of a ‘Wake-Up Call’ for Stagnant Law Firms.”  Stagnant indeed! The Maginot Line was not merely stagnant, but a chimera — the product of hubris as well as stagnant thinking.

And there was more from the NLJ: “Strategic blind spots, decision-making inertia and unwillingness to adapt strategies to changing conditions can lead decision-makers to ignore signs that the world has progressed and current strategies may not be working.”  And the report does not even take into account the discrimination that is built into the “stagnant” Biglaw model and the major changes in the model which will likely be occasioned by the sheer number of well-reported discrimination lawsuits and the empowering of women and minorities who have long been marginalized.

And Now There’s A New Lawsuit That’s Bigger Than All The Rest.

It was just [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/therecorder/2018/01/12/ogletree-deakins-sued-in-300m-gender-discrimination-suit/?et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&cn=20180112&src=EMC-Email&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily%20Breaking%20News) that one of the largest employment law firms in the world — if not the largest — was sued by a female non-equity shareholder for $300 million based upon alleged gender discrimination. Plaintiff, an attorney at the firm since 2002 who represents employers, claims that male shareholders are paid — on average — $110,000 more per year than females. And that women, although making up 58% of the firm’s associates, nonetheless account for less than a third of its shareholders.

Sound like any Biglaw firm that you know?  Or maybe … every one?

The firm’s attorney denied the allegations and stated that “[e]qual opportunity has been a core principle … since the firm’s founding, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind — gender or otherwise.”

This sure sounds familiar.

I noted in my post last year that a late-2016 Major, Lindsey & Africa survey “found that women law partners average about 69% of the compensation of male partners,” and that “Above the Law also [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/nyc-bar-report-reveals-minorities-have-a-60-higher-attrition-rate-asian-attorneys-leaving-at-an-alarming-rate/) at the time on the NYC Bar Association’s [2015 Diversity Benchmarking Report](http://documents.nycbar.org/files/NYC_Bar_2015_Diversity_Benchmarking_Report.pdf), which stated that ‘[d]espite more than a decade of New York law firms pledging to enhance diversity in their ranks, minority representation within associate and partners levels stalled last year, and attrition rates for female and minority attorneys remained disproportionately high.’”

Will things ever change in Biglaw?  Well, there are alternatives. (Shameless self-promotion follows:  I escaped Biglaw for such an alternative).

Plaintiff’s attorney in this new action noted that “[w]e are at a cultural tipping point where women in the workplace will no longer tolerate unfair treatment, whether it comes in the form of sexual harassment or, as seems true [here], discriminatory pay and promotion practices that disadvantage women.”

Takeaway

For some reason I am reminded of my first semester Torts professor who smugly mused that his law school class at Harvard consisted of the best and brightest students in the nation.  A female student stood up and disagreed — she said that this couldn’t be true because Harvard Law [did not admit women](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/hard-earned-gains-for-women-at-harvard/) when he attended. The prof icily told her to sit down.

She is now a respected judge.

Another day, another Biglaw firm announcing salary cuts.

The latest firm to make the move to COVID-19 austerity measures is Finnegan Henderson. The firm, which made $309,940,000 in 2018 gross revenue making it [108th on the 2019 Am Law 200 ranking](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=103&name=Finnegan,-Henderson,-Farabow,-Garrett-%26-Dunner), has now gotten on board with the salary cuts that so many other firms have also done. Today the firm announced via email ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/finnegan-cuts/2/)) the scheme, which sees all employees making $150,000+ taking a 20 percent cut, those making $100,000 to $150,000 will have a 15 percent cut, between $75,000 and $100,000 see a 10 percent cut, and those making under $75,000 go unscathed.

The firm provided the following comment about the cuts:

Finnegan’s managing partner, Anand Sharma, and chair, Mark Sweet, announced this week there will be pay reductions effective June 1. They acknowledged that the challenges COVID-19 presents are not unique to law firms in general or Finnegan in particular.

“None of the recent changes due to COVID-19 are decisions the firm has taken lightly. We are bringing everyone together for these conversations,” Sharma acknowledged.

“We are incredibly proud of how the Finnegan team continues to work together to meet the challenges presented by the pandemic and are asking many members of the firm to assist in a temporary financial sacrifice,” Sweet said.

While share partners will shoulder much of the resulting financial effects, because the duration and ultimate impact of this pandemic remain uncertain, the firm will temporarily reduce future pay for all members except personnel who earn less than $75,000 annually, effective June 1. Those earning $150,000 or more will see a 20% reduction, those earning between $100,000 and $150,000 will see a 15% reduction, and those earning between $75,000 and less than $100,000 will see a 10% reduction. Sharma said, “Our hope is that any impact from COVID-19 will be minimal and, if so, we commit to offsetting these reductions.”

“We are proud of the work the Finnegan team is doing to serve our clients and appreciate their patience, compassion, teamwork, and continued resilience during this difficult time,” Sharma and Sweet said in the statement. “Incoming work remains steady, we are financially sound, but given everything we are seeing across the economy, we feel these changes will protect the long-term success of our team members and protect those most vulnerable to the risks we now face.”

# How To Get Better At Networking: A Critical And Learnable Skill
## Success in business development is a cumulative process, built through years of strategic investment of your time and energy.

Do you want to build a long-term career in private practice? As you likely have noticed from observing your firm’s most successful partners, a critical enabler will be your business development ability. It’s not the only factor: law firms also care about your legal skills and your internal contributions like mentoring more junior lawyers. But nothing lets you write your own ticket like a solid (and portable) book of business.

Success in business development is a cumulative process, built through years of strategic investment of your time and energy. It requires commitment and a [well-crafted, regularly updated plan](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/business-planning-for-senior-associates-laying-the-groundwork-for-revenue-generation/). One of the most important components of that plan is networking. Through savvy networking, you will build your contacts, expand your referral network, and burnish your brand.

For some people, networking comes naturally, but many of us find it daunting at first. Fortunately, networking is a learnable skill. Here are a few tips to help you become a more effective networker.

Think broadly.

Some networking opportunities are pretty obvious: events sponsored by bar associations, legal industry conferences, service on committees with other lawyers. But don’t narrow your focus exclusively to professional events. Networking can happen at college reunions, community gatherings, and even on a flight. In other words, don’t wait until your next conference — you should be networking everywhere you go.

Do you have kids? Chat with other parents at the playground or at school events. Attending a fundraiser? That’s a perfect opportunity to meet people. Are you involved in an affinity group or diversity initiative? Those can be great venues to build connections based on shared heritage or interests. Are you a veteran? Attend a military event and use the opportunity to make new contacts.

Set yourself up for success.

Networking shouldn’t feel like a chore. Make sure you are putting yourself in situations where you’ll be in a positive frame of mind. Attend events that are relevant to you personally and that you find enjoyable. As with any activity, you will be more successful if you’re having fun.

If it makes you feel more comfortable, bring a “date.” A colleague or a friend can help you work the room. But be careful. Don’t bring someone who will serve as a crutch and prevent you from circulating.

Be prepared.

Keep in mind that every networking “event” offers an opportunity to build your brand, and that first impressions matter greatly. Be sure to represent yourself well, both with respect to your physical presence as well as the substantive content of anything you’re presenting. Be genuine and embrace your personal style.

Do your research in advance: find out who will be there and make a list of “targets.” You want to make the most of your time, so be strategic: arrive with a plan to prioritize engaging with the most relevant attendees. Prepare some stock questions that you can use to help start a conversation. For example, if you’re attending an event for lawyers, you might ask: “What are the biggest challenges your law firm has faced during the pandemic?” or “What have you found works best with regard to business development?”

Be ready with your elevator pitch: a short summary of what you do and your background. When you have someone’s attention, you don’t want to be fumbling for words or going off on long-winded tangents.

Be human.

When you first strike up a conversation with a new contact, don’t go straight to business. Nobody likes to feel used, and your first interaction is not the time to close a deal. Instead, build rapport, and let the other person talk. Ask open-ended questions, displaying a genuine interest in the answers. Remember that there is value in building relationships with a wide variety of people, including those who are unlikely to become your client. For example, making strong connections with other attorneys in private practice can lead to fantastic referral relationships that yield lucrative dividends over many years.

Follow up.

Take the time to follow up with everyone you meet after a networking event. Add your new contacts on LinkedIn, making sure to add a quick personalized note. Sending something by mail can also be remarkably effective. The important thing is that you have a process in place and stick to it.

Understand that practice makes perfect!

If you aren’t already comfortable attending networking events, try breaking down the process into small steps. Set yourself the goal of making three new contacts at each event. Commit to making a post on social media before each event you attend: this helps elevate your brand and may even lead to contacts approaching you! If you make it a habit to set and achieve attainable goals like these, I guarantee you will find that networking becomes increasingly natural over time. Good luck!

# Incessant, Bonkers Anti-Paul Hastings Protest Continues

(outside Paul Hastings Tokyo, via @natadimarzo on Twitter)

One court order [didn’t do the trick](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/looks-like-the-court-order-to-knock-off-the-bizarre-bloody-vampire-images-about-paul-hastings-didnt-take/). Another [issued this month](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/lgpdklnrwvo/Pacific%20Alliance%20v.%20Guo%20-%20injunction.pdf) doesn’t seem to be doing much either. No matter how many times the justice system tries to clamp down on the goofy ongoing protest campaign targeting Paul Hastings, the placards keep showing up.

And it’s gone global!

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
To recap, [Paul Hastings](https://www.paulhastings.com/) partner Luc Despins is the Chapter 11 trustee for the estate of Guo Wengui (a/k/a Miles Guo, a/k/a Ho Wan Kwok) — a man who was a billionaire but now claims he has a negative net worth.

For some reason — that certainly couldn’t possibly be because they’re being paid by someone — a bunch of people all over the world are sufficiently wrapped up in this guy’s bankruptcy that they’ve been protesting Paul Hastings offices with cheesy Red Scare era photoshop jobs and posting attack ads on social media.

As protests go, it reminds me of the classic sitcom query: “[shouldn’t you be wearing the bucket?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDmToUzH44U&t=144s)” But despite seemingly generating nothing but more restraining orders, the protests continue.

The latest order sets limits on the time, place, and manner of the protests and enjoins the Debtor from “encouraging, inciting, suggesting, or directly or indirectly funding” any protest outside those restrictions. The First Amendment protects the right to protest — including outside people’s homes per a Supreme Court precedent designed to encourage harassing abortion providers (that the Court [conveniently doesn’t appreciate having applied to itself](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/supreme-court-officials-shocked-to-learn-that-supreme-court-rules-apply-to-the-supreme-court/)) — but it doesn’t cover defamation and it definitely runs up against some guardrails as an excuse to intimidate parties to an ongoing litigation.

In December, the protesters set up camp near the Paul Hastings office in New York. An eagle-eyed Twitter user caught this sign outside the Tokyo office last week. And another tipster informed us that the protests have spiraled beyond the firm to ensnare Despins’s ex-wife:

They’re now protesting against him in peaceful Larchmont, outside the home of his ex-wife, saying his machinations purchased her multi-million dollar home. They’ve been here at least two mornings this week.

Which is why the latest order went out of its way to include “former spouses” on the list of protected people.

For his part, Guo Wengui asserts that no one can prove he’s behind the protests. It may seem implausible that people all over the world have come together in concerted action over a random bankruptcy in Connecticut… but that’s just what the evil Communists would have you believe!!!

Or… yeah, it might be highly implausible.

# New Top Law Firm Ranking Comes With Extra Knife Twist
## But it's still far more important to look at the rankings behind the ranking.

Somehow, I feel as though Law360 Pulse hoped its [second annual Leaderboard law firm ranking](https://www.law360.com/pulse/content/leaderboard) came out a few weeks earlier.

As is, the Leaderboard, which ropes in results from Law360 Pulse’s [Prestige Leaders](https://www.law360.com/pulse/content/prestige-leaders-ranking) and [Social Impact Leaders](https://www.law360.com/pulse/content/social-impact-leaders-ranking) rankings, carries a bit of unintended extra baggage this year. The effort to create a composite ranking of firms across a variety of markers such as culture, reputation, and business practice [crowned Covington last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/ranking-the-top-law-firms-in-the-country-a-difficult-endeavor/).

Here’s a look at the top 10 for 2022 (the whole 100 are available here):

- Morgan Lewis
- Cooley
- Covington
- Hogan Lovells
- Skadden
- Latham
- WilmerHale
- Orrick
- Arnold & Porter
- Paul Weiss
Ahem. Cooley, eh?

Cooley is, historically, well-regarded in lists of the best places to work. It’s just… you never like seeing the number 2 slot in your annual “best overall law firms” list [laying off 150 people](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/).

Once again, some heavy-hitters sunk in these scores for not providing social impact data and the data-driven practice score measuring litigation and transactional reach based on Lex Machina and Intelligize data remains an interesting proxy calculation that could miss some significant matters that just don’t lend themselves to neat bean-counting.

Frankly, the best thing about the overall Leaderboard is the spotlight it shines on the Prestige and Social Impact rankings, which provide outstanding insight for students gauging firms, clients looking to maximize their hires, and companies balancing firm expertise with ESG guidelines. So as a marketing tool to get people focused on those rankings, the Leaderboard is worth it. Though as a substantive ranking — and with apologies to Morgan Lewis — no one is going to be looking at this list as a definitive guide to the best law firms out there.

As mentioned in prior articles, I have worked at a number of law firms throughout my career. Although I started [my own shop almost a year ago](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com), I have experiences working for managing partners at several law firms. The time I have spent running my own law firm and working as an associate at different shops has shown me how managing partners have an extremely difficult job. Indeed, these lawyers must usually deal with the egos of other partners at the firm while overseeing a multitude of administrative tasks. Usually, they also have to continue their own legal practices while overseeing those administrative functions. From my own experiences, all good managing partners have a few qualities in common, and lawyers should keep this perspective in mind when deciding who should hold these positions.

Legal Acumen. All of the good managing partners with whom I have worked were exceptional lawyers in their own right. Each of those attorneys had a solid understanding of the legal issues involving the matters we handled and knew how to divide tasks among the lawyers on a team to meet a client’s objectives. Unfortunately, at some of the law firms at which I worked, managing partners did not always get the chance to conduct many legal tasks, since they were too busy overseeing the firm’s administrative matters. However, each time a solid manager stepped up to do legal work, I was impressed with their legal acumen.

One time, earlier in my career, I reported to an insurance adjuster who would only allow senior partners at our firm to handle a mediation. One of the designated attorneys was our managing partner. Even though the managing partner rarely completed legal tasks on his own, witnessing him at that mediation was like seeing Michael Jordan come out of retirement to enter the court once again. That partner dominated the mediation and got our client an unexpectedly good result. Since managing partners need to understand all of the contours of the matters handled by a firm, and must step in and work on legal tasks as they arise, good managing partners must be solid lawyers.

Organizational Skills. All of the effective managing partners with whom I have worked were extremely organized. Managing partners usually need to oversee numerous matters and ensure that cases are handled properly. I once worked at a law firm that had well over a thousand lawsuits between the thirty or so attorneys at the firm. Each day, an unbelievable amount of mail arrived at the firm for all of those matters. Nevertheless, the managing partner read all of the mail that was received and made notations on anything that needed to be addressed. In addition, that partner saw the files of all new cases we received and wrote a plan of action for every matter we handled.

At another firm, I worked for a managing partner who was the recipient of all emails related to each of the thousands of cases we handled. Despite the sheer volume of the communications we received, this partner made sure to forward each email to the appropriate attorney and conduct follow up with an attorney if necessary. Furthermore, the managing partner either did not sleep (or woke up often), since he would forward emails and follow up at all times of the day and night. I never really understood how those managing partners were able to handle all of that work on top of their own legal tasks. In any case, organization is critical to being a successful managing partner.

Personality. The personality of a managing partner is also extremely important to success or failure in the role. A good managing partner needs to be very personable. Managing partners need to get along with people, since they need to work with a diverse group of individuals who do not always agree about how to best approach a situation. In addition, a managing partner needs to be very empathetic. Managing partners need to deal with disciplining employees, firing workers, helping employees through tough times in their lives, and a number of different situations. A managing partner that connects with employees is going to be much more successful. At the same time, managing partners need to be stern. They are usually the people most responsible for collections at firms, which requires a tough attitude. In addition, managing partners often need to make tough decisions about layoffs, finances, and other issues.

All told, operating my own shop has shown me how difficult it is to be a managing partner at a law firm. As a result, I have a lot more respect for everyone who holds that position than I did as an associate. For a variety of reasons, managing partners need to strike a delicate balance in how they act and manage their practice in order to be successful at running a firm.

# How To Write an Effective Cover Letter
## Tips and tricks on how to write a cover letter that may help in your job search.

Every candidate for a lateral or in-house role should write a cover letter. This is true even if you are working with a recruiter, and the recruiter is promoting your candidacy through other channels, such as phone calls. Why? It’s crucial that you give your recruiter any and all information that may be helpful in marketing you to the prospective employer.

I don’t offer candidates a cover letter template because it’s essential that the letter not sound insincere or formulaic. The letter should be authentic and, if signed by you, in your own voice. If you use the same cover letter to apply for multiple positions, at least tweak the text for each employer and re-read each version in full before sending. It’s easy to spot a non-tailored letter — this conveys laziness and disinterest.

Crafting a great cover letter starts with preparation. You want to be clear on what the letter is trying to achieve before you write it.


 

- Read the job description. Read it line by line. I cannot stress enough the importance of tailoring your cover letter to the specific job and in particular to the required and preferred qualifications listed.
- Research the firm/company. You must ensure that your stated interest in that employer will resonate with the reader. Make sure you have enough context to convey convincingly that your skills will help this firm achieve its strategic goals.
- Think of your cover letter as a first-round interview. What questions might you anticipate? You will want to address (if applicable):
a. Why are you looking to make a move, and why specifically do you want to work here, with us?
b. If applicable, why do you want to move to the new city? What personal or professional ties do you have to the new location?
c. If applicable, why do you want to move from a firm to an in-house role, or vice versa?
- Above all, your cover letter must answer the question, “How are you going to add value to our firm/company?” In your cover letter and in your interviews, remember that it’s not about you. It’s about what you can do for them. A prospective employer will be turned off by candidates who only talk about how this move will advance their own personal goals. Once you fully understand the opportunity and are clear on how you can add value, it’s time to start drafting. There are a number of common pitfalls to avoid.
- Be concise. It’s a letter, not an essay.
- Ensure that the letter is well-structured. Keep it simple: an opening sentence/paragraph, your “arguments,” and a conclusion. Your cover letter will offer substantive information, but it will also be judged as a representation of your writing and communication skills.
- Connect the dots. Do not assume the relevance of your experience is obvious. You may need to help the employer get from Point A to Point B to see that you do indeed have the relevant experience.
- Remember the old adage “Show, don’t tell.” Give concrete examples, especially for your relevant soft skills. There is nothing more annoying than reading “I have great interpersonal skills” with nothing to back up that claim. Consider:
a. What precise skills or experiences do you have that qualify you for this job?
b. What do you bring to the table that makes you unique?
c. Why should we hire you instead of your competition?
- Be thoughtful about tone. Err on the side of formality, but avoid sounding pretentious or unrelatable. If you are applying to a startup, perhaps a less ceremonious tone would be more appropriate?
- Do not simply repeat what is on your resume. You may want to highlight the most important points from your resume that match the job description, but the cover letter is primarily an opportunity to include relevant information not in your resume.
- Explain moves and gaps. If you have made numerous moves already, have left an employer after a short amount of time, or are currently unemployed, get ahead of the issue. No need for a complete memoir, but failing to address the matter may cause the prospective employer to suspect that you’re hiding something.
- If you are applying for a lateral law firm position and your class year for promotion purposes is different from your JD year, be sure to highlight this.
- Proofread. Absolutely no typos! After you’ve drafted, revised, and proofread (go do that once more, just in case!), follow best practices in sending the letter.
- Try to find the appropriate recipient’s name. I am always turned off by “To Whom it May Concern” letters.
- This tip is from my friend who is a senior executive with a large bank: make your cover letter and attached materials forwardable! Send everything in a clean email (separate from any personal chit-chat if you are sending to a personal contact) with the cover letter in the body of the email and not as a separate attachment.
A recruiter can help you decide which information is appropriate for a cover letter and which is not. Be sure to give your recruiter all the information and trust them to guide you. (If you don’t trust your recruiter, get a new one.) If you need visa sponsorship, you cannot start a new job within the next month or two, or you have any other complications to your job search, let your recruiter know upfront.

Will a good cover letter really move the needle? Realistically, it may only make a difference to a small percentage of applications. But why not give every job application your best shot?

# Biglaw Associate Tragically Killed In Freak Accident

Today we have tragic news out of the Boston office of [Latham & Watkins](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/latham-watkins/). On Tuesday evening, one of the firm’s talented young associates was killed after a speeding car careened through the front of a restaurant where he was dining.

At about 6:15 p.m., a car crashed into Sweet Tomatoes, a pizzeria in Newton, Massachusetts, running down and killing Gregory Morin, 32, a midlevel associate at the firm. Also killed was Eleanor Miele, 57, the office manager of Tamkin & Hochberg, a local law firm. Seven other people were injured in the accident. Sources say the impact of the crash was so severe that the building’s structure was [significantly damaged](http://www.boston.com/news/local/2016/03/02/newton-town-officials-mourn-the-victims-the-accident-sweet-tomatoes-restaurant/Bq1XdyU25a7OMwD4B6PGBK/story.html).

Bradford Casler, the 55-year-old driver of the vehicle, sustained minor injuries. He’s not yet been charged with a crime, but his license was revoked following the accident.

At the time of her death, Miele was at the restaurant picking up pizza to bring to an area church where she was working with volunteers for an Easter charity project.

According to his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-morin-40776b6), Morin joined Latham in 2013. He’d previously been an associate in the Washington, D.C., office of Williams & Connolly, where he’d worked for almost three years. Morin graduated from George Washington Law School in 2010.

Here’s a statement from [Hans Brigham](https://www.lw.com/people/hans-brigham), managing partner of Latham’s Boston office:

We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Greg was a wonderful colleague and friend to many in Boston and throughout our firm. He was a highly skilled young lawyer and a compassionate person with incredible spirit and singular wit. Our thoughts and prayers are with Greg’s family and friends, as well as the other victims.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences and sympathies to all those injured, and especially to Gregory Morin’s and Eleanor Miele’s family, friends, and colleagues. The city of Newton will hold a vigil for all of the victims tonight at 6:30 p.m. at Cpt. Ryan Park on Washington Street in West Newton.

UPDATE (03/04/16): Several of Gregory Morin’s friends and colleagues from the Latham & Watkins Boston office have prepared some thoughts about him:

It is always a surreal and unimaginable thing, to lose a friend or a colleague – but to witness the loss of life of a young man, in the midst of building a career, a family, and a life is an indescribable tragedy. We here at Latham’s Boston office are reeling, as so many are, at the death of our friend and colleague Greg Morin. Our hearts are especially broken for the loss his family has sustained.

Greg was a proud and doting father to 15-month-old Kate, devoted to new parenthood and to his wife, Erica, also an attorney here in Boston. He and Erica moved from Washington, D.C. to Boston in 2013 to be closer to family and to enjoy the New England outdoors while hiking and kayaking. Greg and Erica just recently bought a home in Newton and Greg always had a project going to fix it up. Greg had the uncanny ability that can be rare in fast-paced professional environments of having true perspective. Our work and our clients are extremely important, but family was his foundation. He was a devoted father and husband, and it was always clear that above all that was who he was working for and the reason he sought to be excellent in his work. For many of us who worked with Greg, that quality stood out and encouraged those of us striving to approach our work in a similar way.

Greg was the type of colleague and mentor you hope to have in the notoriously high pressure, high stakes world of Big Law litigation – he was calm, smart, level-headed, astute, hardworking, responsible, collegial, a March Madness savant… and absolutely hilarious. We will miss so much about our daily interactions with Greg here at Latham, but most of all we will sorely miss his dry wit. Our hallway conversations and litigation group lunches were always punctuated by one of Greg’s signature deadpan wisecracks that left the rest of us doubled over in laughter. That is how we will always remember him.

The entire Latham & Watkins Boston office, and especially our Litigation & Trial team, extend their sincerest condolences to Greg’s family and friends during this unthinkably difficult time. We are with you, and we are behind you. We know Greg would have done the same for us.

Greg was such a great man, a wonderful husband, and an amazing father. We were so fortunate to have found each other, traveled the world, challenged each other, laughed, and started a family together. All in just ten too short years. He loved his little girl so very much and it was such a joy seeing him grow into the role of dada. Greg was so loved by so many people and it has been a comfort to hear from so many of them. He was our rock, the center of our family, and our hearts are forever broken.

When you start your career, you are told you have to do great legal work, or words to that effect. This means consistent delivery to your supervisors of the following (which I will refer to as “Technical Legal Skills”):

- No typos in documentation
- Make coherent arguments in briefs, memoranda, and other litigation documents
- Do excellent drafting where there is a coherent flow of subject matter, consistent defined terms, and documents that mesh correctly with each other
- Work super-hard – sometimes into the late evening, weekends, etc.
- Develop client management skills, including how to handle concerns, keep clients happy,
- Move each transaction along effectively and efficiently
- Be prepared to argue a motion, take a deposition, or even run a trial
- And much more

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
At very few places does the managing partner call you into her office on your first day of work and say to you:

“Toby – as you know, we have a strict rule here. If you haven’t brought a client into the office within your first twelve months at the firm, then no matter how well you have done at developing Technical Legal Skills, we will still have to terminate your employment. Of course, I hope that won’t happen. Good luck Toby!  We are here to help if you need us…..”

Boy that sounds harsh – and it is harsh – and I am confident that it is a bad idea for a variety of reasons. But think for a moment what happens if the managing partner doesn’t do that?

One of the most critical issues in any culture is how people “define their jobs.” What does “doing a good job” mean?  This (little) issue is overlooked virtually all the time, but hardly anything is more important, especially at the outset of a career.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Consider how the young associate I referred to above, Toby, starts his career. He is hardworking – maybe even super-hardworking. He probably was the star of some sports team, or first violinist in his high school orchestra, or can be credited with some other over-achievement. And why is that?  Because he has programmed himself from early childhood to “do a good job” and if possible “do a great job” at whatever he sets his mind to. It is in his DNA, and this is a good – great – thing to have in an employee, and in a person at well. It means your employee will exercise great efforts to do a good/great job.

But then, for a moment, go back and examine what the definition of a “good job” is so early in Toby’s career. The definition is to “do a good job” at developing Technical Legal Skills.

At the start of a legal career, a “good job” typically does not take into consideration developing skills in sales, marketing, client development, and similar items (which I will refer to as “Sales/Marketing Skills”). Yet – if you think about it – once Toby hits somewhere between fifth to eighth year out of school, the Technical Legal Skills are largely presumed or even taken for granted, and gradually Sales/Marketing Skills become the primary consideration for advancement.

And here is the conundrum. Toby has defined a good job as developing Technical Legal Skills when – with the flip of a switch – at a certain point in his career this means very little, and Sales/Marketing Skills assume primary importance. But Toby not only is not trained for this, but, worse yet, simply does not consider Sales/Marketing Skills to be a part of his job definition.

Despite management – and Toby doing everything right – the training is not only wrong, but terribly wrong. Toby is crippled not only by being untrained but, worse yet, has his head filled with the wrong definition of what he is “supposed to do”. You can fix the training problem relatively easily – you just train Toby in Sales/Marketing Skills – but how do you untrain Toby’s mind, which has been effectively warped by the feeling of what is “really” important. It is awfully hard to do.

So – no – I don’t advocate the managing partner telling Toby he has twelve months to land a client or he will be fired. But if the managing partner did that it would be an awfully good thing for Toby’s career, wouldn’t it?

Ultimately, if you are an associate and your law firm isn’t training the heck out of you in sales and marketing generally from the start of your career, then your firm is letting you down in a major way. If this is the case you have to train yourself in sales and marketing, push your firm or its partners to do so, or go to a place where you will get this training. Otherwise your career is likely at severe risk.

# Biglaw Firm Seeks Its Pound Of Bar Prep Flesh
## It's all about optics.

When an associate left Jones Day before serving a full two years, [the firm billed for pro-rated bar study expenses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/cheapskates-at-jones-day-bill-former-associate-for-bar-prep/). Once again, just because an agreement allows a firm to do something, doesn’t mean it should. It’s just not a good look for a firm. Speaking of optics, we also talk about Justice [Brett Kavanaugh partying with Matt Gaetz and Alex Acosta](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/brett-kavanaugh-hangs-out-with-matt-gaetz-in-most-obvious-turn-of-events-ever/) — and more importantly, parties with business before the Court this Term — all while Supreme Court legitimacy sinks like a stone. Speaking of legitimacy, the Fifth Circuit agrees that a judge committed an ethical breach in hearing a case, but decided to [just sweep it under the rug](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/sure-this-federal-judge-was-supposed-to-recuse-herself-but-5th-circuit-says-too-bad-so-sad/). Also, by the time this posts, Twitter will have changed its policies five more times, but we discuss the legal ramifications, if any, of Twitter’s short-lived ban on mentioning “competitors.”

# Biglaw Firm Forms Mental Health Task Force
## A big step in staying ahead of these issues.

With increasing focus on the strains the profession places on mental health, Reed Smith has announced a global Mental Health Task Force to help Reed Smith’s team address mental health issues as they arise.

The new task force grew out of the work of the firm’s Looking for Excellence and Advancement of Persons with Disabilities (LEADRS) group, and closely tracks the [recommendations](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/lawyers-too-drunk-high-depressed-to-do-their-jobs-properly/) of the American Bar Association’s National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being. Partner [Kimberly Gold](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/g/gold-kimberly-j) will serve as the inaugural chair of the task force:

“The mission of this task force is to ensure that our lawyers and professional staff have access to help whenever they or their family members experience or are at risk of experiencing mental health or substance use issues. We will also challenge the well-documented stigma surrounding these issues and cultivate a workplace culture that promotes psychological wellness and positive help-seeking behaviors,” Gold said. “We are collaborating with other key members of Reed Smith’s Diversity & Inclusion team to develop a comprehensive strategy for assessing and addressing these outcomes across our global platform.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The group has scheduled multiple events across the firm, including a Lawyers Assistance Program Panel Webinar in the United States and a Mental Health First Aid Training program. In March, the firm plans to conduct a firmwide survey to identify additional members for its advisory teams.

Hopefully more firms take Reed Smith’s lead.

Well, Cadwalader was [the first Biglaw firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/cwt-match-22/) to match the [Milbank raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) last month. And now that [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/) has come over the top of those numbers — well, at least for mid-level and senior associates — CWT isn’t going to be caught flat footed.

As per an announcement sent earlier today, this is the new compensation grid at CWT:

Class of 2021	$215,000
Class of 2020	$225,000
Class of 2019	$250,000
Class of 2018	$293,500
Class of 2017	$335,000
Class of 2016	$360,500
Class of 2015	$381,000
Class of 2014	$396,500
Class of 2013+	$406,500
This new round of raises will also be retroactive to January 1. Read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cwt-reraises-22/2/)

Biglaw firms across the world have enacted cost-cutting measures as a consequence of the coronavirus crisis, but many of them are willing to dedicate special bonuses to attorneys who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in terms of “extraordinary performance” in the billable hours department. Staff members, on the other hand, were the first to be furloughed during the economic downturn, and instead of the promise of bonuses for exemplary performance are seeing their discretionary bonus pools halved or eliminated entirely.

Biglaw staff members may help firms run efficiently, but they’re often forgotten about when it comes to financial rewards. To be quite frank, it’s depressing, but one firm has remembered these important team members in a very special way.

Orrick recently announced that its staff members, worldwide, would be receiving a tax-free $1,000 wellness stipend for their hard work during the pandemic. Here’s an excerpt from the memo that was sent by chairman Mitch Zuklie:

[T]hrough all of the challenges 2020 has brought, there’s been one thing I, our lawyers, and our clients could count on and that’s YOU. You are the best in the business. This year has asked more of all of you than ever before and you came through with grit, dedication, innovation, teamwork and grace. …

We hope this mid-year wellness stipend takes some stress off for you. On behalf of all of our lawyers, thank you for your contributions to our team.

(Flip to the next page to read Orrick’s memo in full.)

It’s important that Biglaw firms remember to remain focused on employee wellness — especially in difficult times like these. Kudos to Orrick for being kind to its staff members when so many other firms seem to be neglecting them.

# A 'Perfect Storm': The Election And Voter Rights During The Pandemic
## Learn how you can sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge in order to help advocate for voters.

Even without a historic pandemic unfolding around the world, the 2020 U.S. election was bound to be noteworthy. Issues around voting rights have been simmering at the local and national levels for years, and many attorneys are eager to sharpen their skills and expand their knowledge in order to help advocate for voters.

[Ezra Rosenberg](https://bit.ly/3iSZq3y), Voting Rights Project Co-Director, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Chair of [PLI’s Voter Rights 2020](https://bit.ly/2GQGt4N) CLE program, available on-demand, commented about key issues and what attorneys can take away from the program.

Why offer a CLE about voting rights?

There are few, if any, legal topics that have so dominated the news as has voting rights in 2020. This is not only a consequence of this being a presidential election year, but the result of the perfect storm of that election and the pandemic.

On the one hand, the pandemic has created voting issues that have not been encountered before, such as how can we hold an election when people are rightly fearful of being in contact with others? On the other hand, these issues call us to draw upon the established fundamentals of voting rights law — of how we do that on a level playing field so that all eligible voters can be sure that their ballots will be counted. That’s why the voting rights program is particularly meaningful this year: it provides a needed perspective on the constitutional underpinning of voting rights law, along with a real-time, practical application of those laws, by some of the leading voting rights litigators in the country.

What can attorneys get out of PLI’s Voter Rights 2020 program?

We structured the program to provide, first, the constitutional and statutory foundation for modern voting rights litigation; and then, a soup-to-nuts demonstration of how that foundation interacts with every aspect of voting, from voter registration to voter purges to barriers to voting (in every aspect of voting, from absentee through voting in person), to how one’s vote is given weight in apportionment and redistricting decisions.

What are some of the key issues discussed in the program and why are they important?

The first thing we tried to do was to demonstrate the different ways in which the Constitution protects the right to vote. It does this either by way of specific amendment, such as the Fifteenth Amendment, or by way of application of judicial construction of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, which create different doctrines such as the right-to-vote test that balances burdens on voters with the interests of states, and the one-person/one-vote doctrine that insures that all persons’ votes are given equal weight in the drawing of legislative districts, and which led to the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 that prohibits discrimination on account of a person’s race or ethnicity so as to deny or limit that person’s opportunity to participate equally in the political process.

We then spent two-thirds of the program giving real-life examples, many of them litigated by the panelists in areas including: voter ID, using the Texas Photo ID case that Myrna Pérez and I tried as a prime example; voter purge cases, such as the Hancock County case, where we succeeded in obtaining a consent decree that stopped a purge of Black voters in a small Georgia County; and the various COVID-19-related cases, where we and others, including panelist Sophia Lin Lakin, have sued jurisdictions to ensure that absentee ballot eligibility criteria and procedures do not unconstitutionally stop people from voting this year.

Why did you speak for PLI?

I’ve been practicing law for over 45 years, and I take real pleasure in sharing my knowledge and experience with others. I’ve been lucky, in my career, to always have had others who have done that for me — including in the past decade, when I began to work intensively in the voting rights arena. PLI provides a stellar vehicle for sharing knowledge.

Can you share some insights about what you think attorneys can do to protect voting rights, particularly when there are so many unusual challenges facing the electorate this season?

Attorneys should reach out to any of the many voting rights organizations and volunteer their services. And these services can include volunteering to work on hotlines, such as the Election Protection hotline 866-OURVOTE, which the Lawyers’ Committee helps coordinate.

# Everyone Gets An Offer . . . Unless They Don’t

With the Fall recruiting cycle in full swing, the attention of not only Career Services, but really the law school as a whole — since most classes have yet to start and 1L orientation is still in the offing — are on rising 2Ls and their quest to land a job for next summer.  The importance of OCI cannot be overrated, especially for those students looking to start their legal career in Biglaw, which is why I penned a [four](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-i/)–[part](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-ii-the-initial-interview/) [OCI](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-iii-callbacks/) [series](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-iv-offers/) that aimed to be a comprehensive look at the process geared for those students currently going through OCI or who will be doing so in the not-too distant future.

The importance of OCI rests on the fact that it is the first part of a well-established chain of events which leads to post-graduation Biglaw employment:

- Get a summer associate offer
- Work as a summer associate
- Get a postgraduate associate offer
- Profit


But what happens if step 3 never happens?  What happens if after your stint as a summer associate, there is no offer of permanent employment?

Most firms, especially among those with the largest headcounts, want to give permanent offers to their entire summer class for a host of reasons.  These firms need a new batch of first-year associates each Fall to serve as grist for the mill and size of the summer class was likely chosen to match the firm’s needs.  Furthermore, firms know that a failure to make offers to all summers give them a black mark among students when it comes to recruiting, a problem which will only be exacerbated when the sub-100 percent offer rate is discussed at least in the pages of this [august publication](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/summer-associate-offer-rates-2018-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-job-offers-like-candy/).

But while Biglaw firms might strive for a 100 percent offer rate, that does not always come to pass. So what should you do if you find yourself no offered?

First things first, you need to find out what happened.  If you [had a few too many drinks at a firm event, disrobed, jumped into the Hudson River, and then had to be fished out by the Coast Guard](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/11/an-update-on-aquagirl-things-are-going-swimmingly/), it should not come as a great surprised that you were no offered.



But to the consternation of [some on this site](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/can-a-summer-associate-please-blow-a-goat-or-something/), such tales of summer associates gone wild are few and far between these days.  So if it was not an outrageous action, determine if your lack of an offer was based on the simple economic calculation that the firm cannot afford to bring back their entire summer associate class or if it was based on your work product over the course of the summer.  Most any law firm worth their salt will be honest with you in this circumstance, as they know how much this will impact your career prospects — though there might be more caginess if the rationale was economic based, as such news can quickly turn into a conflagration that threatens to consume a firm.  While your first instinct might not be to care, because regardless of the reason, the end result is the same, that is a mistake.  If you are unclear as to the firm’s rationale, not only will you be unable to correct your own behavior, you will not know what to tell potential employers when the question inevitably arises in future interviews.

Speaking of which, the next step is to start looking for a post-graduation job ASAP.  One of the first people you should talk to after being informed of your no-offer status is someone in Career Services.  They can help you formulate a game plan to help make it more likely that your 3L job search is successful.  See if your school’s OCI has employers who are interviewing 3Ls. If so, sign up for each and every one.  Yes, you might have wanted to start your legal career in New York City instead of Boise, but at the no-offer point, it is important to broaden your horizons and maximize your chances.  In the modern legal economy, just because you start your career at a certain firm or city does not mean that will define your entire career.  As Orin Kerr recently noted, nearly 60 percent of Harvard Law’s 1997 graduating class reported having worked at least four different jobs since graduation.

— Orin Kerr (@OrinKerr) [August 8, 2018](https://twitter.com/OrinKerr/status/1027286974741110784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

If you were someone who chose from multiple offers the previous fall, reach out to the firms that you rejected the last time around. These employers clearly saw something in your candidacy that they liked, so remind them of that while inquiring if they have any potential open slots for first-year associates.  And do not be concerned that your previous offer rejection has rendered you persona non grata at the firm.  Most everyone in this industry is an adult, so as long as you did not purposefully burn any bridges during the rejection process, they should be more than willing to speak with you.

Finally, consider trying to restart your recruiting clock.  While Biglaw firms are not necessarily fighting for the opportunity to interview 3Ls who were no offered, they typically are quite interested in interviewing current judicial law clerks.  I have previously extolled the virtues of clerking in [this space](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/to-clerk-or-not-to-clerk-its-actually-not-much-of-a-question/), but an added bonus is that it gives you a chance to continue your job search for another year, secure in the knowledge that you both have a job for after graduation and that it will be one where you get some outstanding training.

Getting no offered can be a real punch it the gut.  It immediately transforms your final year of law school from a time of leisure and seminar classes to one of running around trying to secure post-graduate employment.  But it does not mean you have no future as a lawyer.  Figure out what happened, learn from any mistakes you might have made, and plunge back into the job search — preferably sober and fully clothed.

Since 2017, Major, Lindsey & Africa and Above the Law have partnered together to learn about the perspectives of millennial lawyers and examine their growing influence on the cultural landscape.

Starting today, we are running a series of [short, anonymous surveys](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0AIndoanf6XOt0y) to capture the views of younger lawyers — many of whom are now partners at their firms — and help determine what differentiates them from their older colleagues.

[Today’s survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0AIndoanf6XOt0y) concerns workplace priorities, addressing topics as varied as associate-partner dynamics, diversity and inclusion, mentorship, and work-life balance.

Please take a few minutes and tell us what you think. (Note that we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to participate.)

Note that the second and third installments in this survey series are now available, too:
– [Click here to take part two](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8GHW7taR6ULBLb8) and tell us about your career goals.
– [Click here to take part three](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0pmAXno26be0r7o), which focuses on generational differences.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

I, of course, don’t know if Donald Trump has committed any crimes. It’s possible that a jury will tell us the answer to that a couple of years from now.

For now, Trump is not just presumed innocent but is not even charged with any wrongdoing.

But suppose he actually did something for which he could be charged. Should he be prosecuted?

Let’s set aside for a moment the issue of a self-pardon by Trump or a drive-by pardon where Trump resigns on January 19, President-for-a-day Mike Pence pardons Trump, and then Joe Biden takes over at noon on January 20. Those pardons would raise hard constitutional questions, and no one’s ever mistaken me for a constitutional scholar.

Although I won’t discuss it here, please do remember, as many seem to overlook, that pardons have consequences. If a person receives a pardon, that person is no longer at risk of punishment and so loses the privilege against self-incrimination. If Trump were to receive a pardon and then be compelled to testify before, say, a committee of the House of Representatives, Trump would be required to speak. If Trump lied during that testimony, he could be prosecuted for the perjury.

Let’s also set aside other paths that people are talking about: A truth and reconciliation committee to investigate Trump’s conduct while in office, the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate Trump.

I’m a purist. I’m thinking about only two things: First, should Trump be prosecuted for federal crimes that he may have committed while in office?

Many Democrats shout “no.” Impeachment didn’t hurt Trump politically; it may have helped him. Why, Democrats ask, should Democrats do something as counterproductive as prosecuting Trump?

I ask in return: Why do Democrats get a say in this? Neither you nor I should care whether a prosecution helps or hurts a political party. That’s irrelevant; put it out of your mind.

Independent of party politics, should Trump be prosecuted for federal crimes that he may have committed while in office?

On the one hand, no. We should not prosecute former presidents. It sets a terrible precedent. And remember: What goes around comes around.  Trump’s been screaming for four years that Barack Obama committed crimes and should be prosecuted. I’m confident that, if Trump is prosecuted next year, Republicans will be screaming that Biden did something felonious while in office and should be prosecuted in 2025. I’m not sure I care to live in that world.

On the other hand, yes. Why should the president be treated any differently than other citizens? If you or I tried to pull off some felonious crap with the president of the Ukraine, we’d probably go to jail. Why shouldn’t Trump?

This is a close call, but one could reasonably lean toward nonprosecution.  You and I are not the president; the president should not be prosecuted for fear of generally disrupting the political system; there are lots of benefits to being president, and not being prosecuted for federal crimes, if any, committed while in office is just another benefit of the office.

How about prosecuting the president not for policy-related matters but for things he did in his own self-interest?

I’m with you on the policy matters: We should give presidents an extraordinarily wide berth on matters that relate to policy, even if those actions could be in the president’s own partisan interest. Thus: I don’t know exactly what the “torture memos” were in the George W. Bush administration, but they had something to do with how aggressive American interrogators could be in pursuing evidence of possible attacks against the United States.  I’d steer far clear of prosecuting anyone for these things: People thinking in good faith about the appropriate course to protect America are entitled to deference, even if you disagree violently with those people’s conclusions.

Many — maybe most — presidential decisions rest at the intersection of policy and partisanship. Any policy that a presidential candidate campaigned on is partisan when the president later enacts that policy. For example, it may have helped Democrats (or Obama personally) for Obama to have passed Obamacare; that’s government. It may have helped Trump to take assorted action to “build the wall.” That’s the intersection of policy and partisanship; give him deference.

I lean the same way on more personal issues, such as the suggestion that Trump should be prosecuted for having violated in some way the Emoluments Clause or the Hatch Act. Presidents do many things that benefit the president personally; unless we can draw an extraordinarily bright line between office-related conduct and solely personal conduct, we should be wary of prosecutions.

Here’s the harder question: Should Trump be prosecuted for state crimes he may have committed before he took office?

If you think about the politics of this, you’ll give yourself a headache:  Democrats run both the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and the office of the New York Attorney General. (The Attorney General has been reported thus far to be thinking only about civil liability, although sometimes these things take on a criminal life.)

Line prosecutors in the Manhattan DA’s office always scream, “Politics play no role in what we do!” That’s a pretty good sign that they’re doing political stuff. (Ah, c’mon Cy; I’m just kidding. Can’t you take a joke?)

The politics of this are funny: Perhaps the national Democratic Party, taken as a whole, doesn’t want to prosecute Trump for anything, for fear that a prosecution would energize his base.

New York Democrats may feel differently about this.

And folks in the local prosecutor’s office may feel differently still. Some of those folks may have political ambitions. They may think that massive name-recognition resulting from a prosecution is a good thing for them personally; the rest of the party be damned.

Most presidents won’t have to worry about prosecution for things they did before entering office. If presidents aren’t prosecuted during the four years that they’re in office, the statute of limitations would have run on most claims by the end of the presidential term.

But other than that, on state prosecutions, perhaps we should do an unusual thing: Let state prosecutors pursue wherever the evidence takes them, and then proceed in the way the evidence suggests.

Wouldn’t that be a pleasant change of pace?

# Morning Docket: 07.05.17
## * While it's taken most justices about three to five years to get adjusted to life on the Supreme Court, it seems as if Justice Neil Gorsuch has already hit his stride over the course of just a few months. This gunner wrote one majority opinion, three dissents, three concurrences, and one statement during his first two months on the bench. [[New York Times](https://nytimes.com/2017/07/03/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court.html?referer=http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/)] * DLA Piper -- the first Biglaw firm to [fall to a cyberattack](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/global-biglaw-firm-paralyzed-by-new-ransomware-attack/) -- has finally restored its email service after five days of going without it thanks to being the victim of the worldwide Petya ransomware attack. The firm still claims no client data was compromised by the hackers who gained access to their systems. [[ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/law-firm-dla-piper-email-back-cyberattack-48410570)] * Ty Cobb of Hogan Lovells will reportedly be brought on to attend to Russia-related issues within the Office of White House Counsel. Cobb met with Trump last week, but wouldn't offer any comment on his prospective role except to say that he was on vacation. Enjoy your time off while it lasts -- working on Russia-related matters at the White House will certainly be no vacation. [[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer-idUSKBN19O29Z)] * Harvard Law School has established an endowed professorship to honor the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who graduated from the school in 1960. According to outgoing Dean Martha Minow, the professorship is ""especially meaningful"" because the justice ""had a great love of learning."" [[Harvard Law Today](https://today.law.harvard.edu/harvard-law-school-establishes-professorship-honor-justice-antonin-scalia-60/)] * Overworked and underpaid never paid? Public defenders working as independent contractors in Massachusetts aren't being paid in a remotely timely fashion. They sometimes go up to two months without receiving paychecks, and say that this has been going on for at least five years.

# Davis Polk Responds To Racial Discrimination Lawsuit
## They say they'll defend themselves 'vigorously.'

Yesterday,[ we reported on a recently filed racial discrimination case](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/davis-polk-hit-with-racial-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1) against white-shoe Biglaw firm Davis Polk. The plaintiff is former associate Kaloma Cardwell, who alleges as an African-American he was not provided the same opportunities for career advancement — he says he was routinely left off deal emails and excluded from conference calls — as his white colleagues. The complaint further alleges that negative performance reviews were “retroactively created after Plaintiff engaged litigation” in order to create a pretext for firing him.

While we are still far away from any formal, filed response from the firm, they have broken their silence. Yesterday afternoon, all Davis Polk employees received an email from managing partner [Neil Barr](https://www.davispolk.com/professionals/neil-barr) letting them know the firm would “defend [itself] vigorously and will show, based on the record, that the claims are not supported by the facts or the law.”

He also defends the firm’s diversity efforts, and touts that as a core value of the firm. You can read his entire email below:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Dear Colleagues:

As you may have seen, a lawsuit against Davis Polk and several individuals was filed last night by a former associate, Kaloma Cardwell, which alleges racial discrimination and retaliation.

Mr. Cardwell’s termination had nothing to do with his race. He was terminated for legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons following negative performance reviews given in the ordinary course. We will defend ourselves vigorously and will show, based on the record, that the claims are not supported by the facts or the law.

Diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace are core values and commitments of Davis Polk. We have worked hard to develop Firm-wide  training and development programs for lawyers across the seniority spectrum, and we have devoted substantial resources to the recruitment, training, and development of diverse talent. For many years, we have had a dedicated group of partners and administrators working on these issues.

I believe, as the Firm does, that having a diverse and inclusive work environment that promotes equality is not only the right thing but also leads to a more qualified workforce and delivers better and more innovative lawyering that is more responsive to clients’ needs.

I know you understand that given the pendency of this litigation, we are unable to provide additional information at this time. We will, however, keep you updated on developments as necessary. If you receive any inquiries related to the lawsuit, please refer them to Tenley Chepiga at our office of general counsel.

# Reframing The Legal Landscape: A Petition For Inclusivity And Linguistic Transformation
## The language choices we make can greatly affect our perception of a person or group.

In a [recent petition to the American Bar Association](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/olgamack_law-futureoflaw-leadership-activity-7181274287339704321-6717?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), I and a group of like-minded individuals called for a fundamental shift in language within the legal profession, urging the cessation of the term “nonlawyer.” This initiative sparks a crucial conversation about inclusivity and professional identity within legal ecosystems. As part of the conversation on LinkedIn about this effort, [Sarah Glassmeyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sglassmeyer/), a law librarian who now works as director of data curation at Legaltech Hub, wrote about why she supports finding a term other than “nonlawyer” and used historical backgrounds of taxonomies to illustrate her thoughts.

In this interview, I explore the depths of this linguistic transformation with Sarah. Her insights illuminate the significance of language in shaping perceptions as well as the broader implications for collaboration and the delivery of legal services. Join us as we explore the power of words and the potential for transformative change within the legal community.

Olga V. Mack: You mentioned the evolution of classification systems like the Library of Congress subject headings. Can you provide more examples where changing the language or taxonomy significantly impacted the perception or treatment of a group or concept within the legal field or beyond?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Sarah Glassmeyer: Absolutely! First of all, I’ve spent a significant portion of my life working with it, but for those of you new to thinking about official classification systems, there’s a couple of baseline things to understand: (1) The world is filled with classification systems. They include everything from the ways libraries organize information, to the West Key Number system, to the filters Amazon.com puts on their website to help you narrow down a purchase and thousands of things in between, with various levels of official importance. (2) Any time a human creates something, their worldview is baked into the end product. Sometimes these biases are good, sometimes they’re bad, and sometimes they are relatively neutral. (3) With classification systems, some of the ways these biases appear can be either in language choices (such as the names we call things) or how we connect terms together. (4) For a classification system to be effective, the creators and users need to review and modify to make sure the language choices accurately reflect the time and to eliminate bias.

Some people will try to wave off a concern about language choices as conceding to “hurt feelings” or being “woke” or “politically correct.” But the language choices we make can greatly affect our perception of a person or group. For example, the Library of Congress used to have subheadings of “Jewish criminality” and “Negro criminality” but not for all ethnic groups. That implied that maybe those groups have higher than average rates of criminality.

Another example and one language choice I’ve been working on personally is saying “enslaved person” instead of “slave.” Calling someone a “slave” removes their humanity. By saying “enslaved person,” the reader/listener is reminded that the discussed individual is a person placed in a circumstance, but it’s not their defining characteristic. Along that same line, language choices can normalize things that should never be normalized. For example, the LOC used “The Jewish Question” as a blanket term for things we would now call antisemitism.

Now those are all really horrific examples. I am not equating the conversation about what to call legal professionals with the Holocaust or slavery. I’m just saying how we use words and what we call people affects more than the feelings of those being called a certain name.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Olga V. Mack: Could you elaborate on how the term “nonlawyer” specifically contributes to the “othering” of individuals within the legal profession, and why you believe changing this term is a crucial step towards inclusivity?

Sarah Glassmeyer: By dividing the world up into lawyers and nonlawyers, there’s an implication that there’s only “legal work” and “nonlegal work” and only legal work is performed by lawyers.  However, there are many activities that could properly be defined as “legal work” that are not “the practice of law.” I’m thinking of the activities of law librarians, paralegals, legal ops departments, legal project managers, [and] legal technologists, to name a few. I think by recognizing that the people who perform this work are also professionals and also have often received extensive education and training to perform it, it recognizes and perhaps will illuminate for others what they are capable of and how they contribute to an organization’s or matter’s success. It’s moving from “lawyers and everyone else” to “here are all the people who participate in this professional sphere.”

Olga V. Mack: Have you considered or can you suggest alternative terms that could be used to describe individuals who contribute to the legal field without being licensed attorneys, which might better acknowledge their roles and expertise?

Sarah Glassmeyer: I tend to use, depending on the role, legal service providers or legal professional. And, along with that, either legal service delivery or legal work. I want to be clear — I’m not in favor of erasing all job titles or eliminating the distinctions between lawyers and everyone else who works in the legal industry. There are protections and ethical requirements for lawyers and their relationships with clients that are vital for a functioning society. It should always be made very clear — to clients, customers, and users as well as the person performing the actions — who is acting as an attorney and when these obligations kick in via the practice of law. I am simply suggesting that we use terms that fully represent the abilities and qualifications that groups of people possess when we are speaking in the aggregate.

I’m big on drawing charts and graphs to help me understand things. If it helps, here is a visualization to help clarify what I mean.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


Olga V. Mack: In your experience, what are the main arguments against changing the term “nonlawyer,” and how do you counter these arguments?

Sarah Glassmeyer: There seems to be some fear or misunderstanding that this effort is a sneaky way to change ownership rules or that supporters of a change in terminology are trying to pretend to be something they’re not and things along that line. For what it’s worth, I went to law school and passed the bar. Also, on my LinkedIn, my headline doesn’t list my job title, my degrees, or the awards I’ve won. It says: “The World’s Okayest Legal Technologist.” I can’t speak for everyone who supports changing terminology, but I’m personally not that concerned with status or pretending to be something I’m not.

So ignoring all those arguments, because I really don’t want to make assumptions about why someone is worried about those sort of things, I can speak to the concerns about protecting clients and those that seek the services of legal professionals. Most of the FUD — Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt — used whenever any change is suggested in the legal world uses A2J as a shield. So let’s talk about it. As someone who has spent a significant amount of time in the Access to Justice world, I do worry that end users and clients may not fully understand when protections and ethical obligations kick in and when they don’t. The solution for that is to make explicit in regulatory materials and other communications what constitutes the practice of law, when these protections and obligations kick in, and who is qualified to perform what types of services and actions.

Olga V. Mack: What practical effects do you foresee in the legal profession from changing the language we use to describe legal professionals and their roles, especially regarding collaboration and the delivery of legal services?

Sarah Glassmeyer: Honestly, I think this can affect every vertical of the delivery of legal services from corporate legal ops to people that work in small law offices to Biglaw and everything in between. I’m very familiar with the A2J world so I can dive into that.

So many conversations about Access to Justice are centered around lawyers. We use statistics about representation rates in courts or who can afford an attorney to measure the “Access to Justice Gap.” Proposed solutions often take the form of increasing pro bono work or ways to make existing attorneys work more efficiently. Don’t get me wrong, those solutions are incredibly helpful and appreciated. But the umbrella of “access to justice” encompasses so much more than events that involve litigation or require the protections and skills of a licensed attorney. If we reframe the needed work as “legal services” and workers as “legal service providers,” we can invite more participants into the process of creating solutions. Again, that does not mean we remove lawyers or the much needed obligations on some types of services that only barred attorneys should provide. It just means that there’s a lot more ways to help and more people available.

Olga V. Mack: Assuming there’s agreement on moving away from the term “nonlawyer,” what steps do you believe the legal community should take to implement this change? How can we ensure that new terminology is adopted widely and effectively?

Sarah Glassmeyer: Well, for one, even if there’s not widespread agreement on changing terminology, no matter what you — yes, you, the person who is reading this — can choose to change how you yourself use language and refer to other people.

Moving out from there, people can look at their firms or organizations and see how and where the term is applied within internal documentations and policies. Are there differences in fringe or practical benefits that are applied to employees depending on how they’re classified? Do these differences … seem fair? Are they likely to encourage employee retention or professional growth or job satisfaction?

And then expanding the universe and one’s sphere of influence further, you can look at how these terms are used by local regulatory bodies. Are they inhibiting who we can consider colleagues and collaborators in the delivery of legal services? Could public needs like access to justice be increased if we change our language and potentially unintentionally limiting who can assist and how? And then maybe work to change there.

One thing I’d like to end on … for the last 10 years or so of working and writing in the areas of legal innovation and access to justice, I have been trying to frame conversations as “OK, for a minute forget about specific solution ideas like terminology changes or licensed paraprofessionals or ROBOT LAWYERS and ask yourself: ‘Are you happy with the status quo?’ ‘Do you think the legal profession is operating as effectively as possible?’ ‘Do you think everyone who needs legal help is getting it?’ And if you answer ‘no’ to any of these, congratulations, you are ready to work in innovation! Now let’s come up with some mutually acceptable ideas.”

So I guess I just encourage everyone — especially those with an immediate negative reaction to the name change — to examine their opposition and think about why they are opposed. And then, see if there’s any room for some compromise where their concerns would be addressed but the status quo is not maintained.

Amir Ali, on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court after his argument in Welch v. United States.

Last month, we shared with you the story of [Amir H. Ali](https://jenner.com/people/AmirAli), who got to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court as a fifth-year associate at [Jenner & Block](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jenner-block/). It’s not common for Biglaw associates to argue [before any court](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/), to say nothing of the highest court in the land, so Ali’s story was many an associate’s dream come true.

And yesterday the dream got even better. Just like his mentor, Jenner partner [Lindsay C. Harrison](https://jenner.com/people/LindsayHarrison), who [argued](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/01/jenner-block-associate-argues-her-first-case-in-the-supreme-court/) before SCOTUS as an associate and [won by a 7-2 margin](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/04/update-jenner-block-associate-scores-scotus-win/), Ali also scored a decisive victory.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The Court handed down its [opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-6418_2q24.pdf) in [Welch v. United States](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/welch-v-united-states-2/) before hearing argument in the high-profile immigration case of [United States v. Texas](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-texas/), and Gregory Welch and his team at Jenner prevailed. The opinion came less than three weeks after oral argument — very fast turnaround by SCOTUS standards. Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion of the Court for seven justices; Justice Clarence Thomas filed the lone dissent. (Perhaps Justice Thomas was persuaded by his former clerk, Gibson Dunn partner [Helgi Walker](http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/hwalker), who was appointed by the Court to argue the other side of the case after the federal government sided with Welch.)

I chatted last night with Amir Ali about his win. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

DL: Congratulations! How do you feel?

AHA: Thanks! It feels great — a real honor to have been involved in this experience. And we’re so happy to deliver a positive result for our client.

DL: The oral argument [seemed to go well for you](http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-674_h3dj.pdf) (although Helgi Walker also did a great job arguing her side). How did you feel about it right after it ended? Elated? Relieved?

AHA: I certainly felt a sense of relief, after having prepared for so many weeks, to let some of this complicated retroactivity law exit my brain. Then the waiting game started — along with trying not to read too much into any justice’s questions.

DL: Some observers, such as Professor [Rory Little](http://www.uchastings.edu/faculty/little/index.php) writing on [SCOTUSblog](http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/03/argument-analysis-a-likely-decision-in-favor-of-retroactivity/), predicted based on how the argument went that you would prevail. Did you expect this outcome?

AHA: We had no shortage of predictions internally and externally, and certainly some observers thought we’d prevail. I just tried to take the position that we’d have to wait and see the what the Court had to say, especially in this complex and intricate area of law.

DL Did the 7-1 split of the justices — or anything in the opinions themselves, such as Justice Kennedy’s authorship or Justice Thomas’s decision to dissent — catch you by surprise?

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
AHA: What surprised and impressed me the most was how the Court was able to issue such an in-depth and clearly well thought-out and reasoned opinion in such a short period of time. I didn’t have a sense from argument that any justice seemed more interested than the others in writing the opinion. And I didn’t have any questions from Justice Thomas, so I had no reason to think that he’d rule one way or the other.

DL: Justice Alito gave you a bit of a hard time on whether the core issue of this case was properly raised before the district court, but then he joined the Court’s opinion.

AHA: So I like to think my responses satisfied Justice Alito — but of course I’ll never really know.

DL: The Court scheduled an unusual hand-down today. As explained by [Lyle Denniston](http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/04/a-break-with-custom-on-opinion-release/), “Ordinarily, when the Court is hearing argument on Mondays, it releases only orders in new cases, and withholds opinions until later in those weeks.” So observers speculated that they’d hand down a case with some time sensitivity.

In Welch, of course, the Court expedited the briefing schedule and sped things up — because, as we [discussed earlier](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/a-biglaw-associates-supreme-court-debut/?rf=1), the statute of limitations for prisoners to raise the retroactivity of [Johnson v. United States](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/johnson-v-united-states-3/) will expire soon.

Did you have a feeling that the opinion to be handed down today might be your case? Were you and Lindsay in Court this morning?

AHA: Lindsay and I were in Court this morning, yes. We had already intended to attend the argument in United States v. Texas. When we learned of the possibility that the opinion would be issued, we doubled down on our intent to attend.

So I was there when the opinion was issued. It was very exciting to have the honor of hearing Justice Kennedy read the Welch opinion from the bench.

And it was interesting and special for me for another reason as well. Before the justices entered the room, the front row of the public gallery was vacant. Right before the justices entered, the Chief Justice of Canada and several of her colleagues came in to fill that row. I clerked for the Supreme Court of Canada, so it was wonderful to have some of the justices I knew in court this morning when my case was decided. (But my boss, Justice Marshall Rothstein, was not present; they have mandatory retirement in Canada, and he retired last year.)

DL: So United States v. Texas, argued after the Welch opinion came down, is one of the blockbuster cases of this Term. People came from around the country to try and get into the courtroom for the argument and to protest outside the Court as well.

Protesters at the U.S. Supreme Court after arguments in United States v. Texas.

Did you worry about getting in, even as a member of the Supreme Court bar? In some cases, even SCOTUS bar members have had to watch proceedings in overflow rooms on monitors.

AHA: The line for the general public was extremely long, and when I arrived around 7 a.m., there were already 50 or so people in the Supreme Court bar line. That was early enough for me to get into the courtroom itself, and a few people after me got in as well. But note that there were no bar admissions scheduled today — which I suspect the Court did intentionally on account of the Texas argument.

DL: What happens next for your client? Mr. Welch could still get the same sentence in the end, right?

AHA: We asked the Court to resolve the Johnson retroactivity issue, so the maximum relief we could get for our client was a remand to the Eleventh Circuit, which is exactly what we got. We still have remaining issues to litigate in front of the court of appeals — where we are adverse to the government, which takes the position that Mr. Welch’s sentence should stay the same. [As [previously discussed](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/a-biglaw-associates-supreme-court-debut/?rf=1), the government sided with the petitioner before the Supreme Court on the issue of Johnson‘s retroactivity.]

DL: Will you handle case on remand?

AHA: Yes, we plan to continue to represent Mr. Welch on remand.

DL: And what happens next for you? Any vacation plans?

AHA: I have an argument next week in the Seventh Circuit. I’ll be starting moots for that in the next few days.

DL: A litigator’s work is never done. Good luck on that argument, and congrats again on prevailing in your first argument before the Supreme Court!

# Biglaw Firm Announces Nationwide Buyout Program
## Which major firm wants to trim its payroll, and how generous are the buyouts being offered?

It’s been quite some time since we’ve written about layoffs or voluntary buyouts here at Above the Law, but with technology and innovation bombarding the legal profession with new offerings day in and day out, we knew that it would have to happen sooner or later.

We recently received word that Morgan Lewis & Bockius will be offering voluntary buyout packages for all of its legal secretaries, across the country. Sources say that the firm’s separation package is extremely generous, and that those who take the deal will receive 2 weeks’ salary for each year of service, up to 52 weeks’ pay. Compared to the six-month cap we’ve seen at many Biglaw firms, longtime legal secretaries at Morgan Lewis could be walking away with a huge payday should they choose to leave.

We reached out to MLB for confirmation, and a spokesperson shared this statement:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As we continue to focus on technology innovation and cost effective solutions for our clients, as well as the practice needs of our lawyers, we have decided to offer our U.S.-based legal secretaries a voluntary separation opportunity. This is a purely voluntary offering, and we have no current plans for a group involuntary separation program, regardless of the level of participation in the voluntary offering.

We wish all of the legal professionals at Morgan Lewis who accept the buyout the best of luck should they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know; this is a subject we cover quite closely. Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477) with any information you might have. Thank you.

# 'White Shoe' No More: Why Elite Biglaw Firms Are Walking Away From Term

White shoe firms continue to handle the most prestigious matters for clients, including bet-the-company litigation, major transactions or important advice on regulatory matters. [White shoe firms] were not historically diverse, and there is no place for that now.

We represent more than the old white shoe label. We now cover white shoes, cowboy boots and high heels across 20 global offices, representing the new generation of diverse, global law firms.

— [Yvette Ostolaza](https://www.sidley.com/en/people/o/ostolaza-yvette), chair-elect of Sidley Austin’s management committee, commenting on the ways her firm is distancing itself from the “white shoe” designation. Ostolaza will take over as chair in April 2022, when she will become the [first woman to co-lead the firm in its 155-year history](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/sidley-elects-woman-of-color-as-its-first-female-leader-in-more-than-150-years/). She will be the only woman of color to lead a top 10 Am Law firm and among the handful of women who lead Biglaw firms.

# Am Law 50 Firm Slashes Associate Salaries Indefinitely
## The firm is changing its response to COVID-19.

It wasn’t that long ago that we were reporting on Perkins Coie’s[ assurances to associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/) that salary cuts and layoffs were not in their future. Though the partnership were deferring ~19 percent of their compensation, the firm had no plans for further austerity measures.

But that was last month. A little over a month later (even though it feels like several years ago now), and the firm has changed its tune. Today, in an all-attorney call, the firm announced that pay cuts were coming, beginning in their June paychecks. Non-partner attorneys will see a 15 percent cut, staff making $200,000+ will also have a 15 percent cut, and staff making $125,000-$200,000 will have compensation cut by 10 percent. Below is an internal slide describing the cuts:

Tipsters at the firm describe the cuts as indefinite and that, “Management says they don’t know if it will extend to 2021 or 2022. Won’t answer questions whether temporary or not.”

But, the good news at least, is that the firm is leaving the door open to a “special payment” to make whole top billers. And, as of now, there are no attorney layoffs.

# Clients Sometimes Peruse Their Lawyers' Personal Social Media Accounts
## One more way Facebook and social media can make your work life more difficult.

Clients and in-house counsel often conduct substantial research on lawyers when deciding if they want to use particular counsel to handle a given matter. Often, clients and in-house counsel speak to people who know the prospective counsel to determine if they do good work and are knowledgeable about a given area of the law. In other instances, clients may consult online directories to evaluate reviews of attorney and legal experience their counsel may have. From my own experience, clients and in-house counsel may even peruse the personal social media accounts of lawyers when conducting background research. Attorneys should take steps to protect their personal social media accounts if they do not wish clients and in-house counsel to see such content.

One time earlier in my career — even before I started writing for Above the Law! — I used to travel frequently for work, taking depositions up and down the East Coast since the people involved were usually sick and could not travel themselves. Sometimes, I would travel to exotic locations for work, and one time, I took a deposition in a tropical location for two weeks.

The trip started off as a real treat, but eventually it was actually kind of an annoyance to take a deposition in this touristy place for such a long time. I had to put all of my travel expenses on my personal credit card, and having to float the expenses until I got reimbursed was a real challenge back in the days when I still had a shocking amount of student debt. Moreover, the food prices at this tourist trap were insanely high, and I had trouble staying well fed on the pretty modest allotted meal budget. In addition, the repetition of long deposition days with little free time for fun excursions grows old after a while, and a tropical locale can be boring for a tourist after a few weeks.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In any event, while I was at the deposition, I took a picture from the beach and posted it on Facebook. I think the photo showed a piña colada in my hand and an ocean view in the background. The photo did not show my face or anything else. I think the caption was “work with a view” or some similar lame thing. (What can I say, I’m pretty basic!) I was much more into social media when I was younger, and I liked to document the things that I was doing in my life. Heading to this tropical location for a deposition was the first time I had been in an exotic place in years, so it was definitely the type of thing I would post a picture of on social media in those days.

In any event, a few months later, I was at work, sitting in my office, and I got a random call from an in-house lawyer I had never spoken to before, but had emailed with in the past. This in-house lawyer made some pleasantries, and then got to the point of his call. Apparently, he had tasked his secretary with doing some research on the lawyers who were handling files for this company, and my beach picture was included in the report. I accidentally marked the photo “public” instead of “private” so anyone on the internet could see it. In any event, the in-house lawyer said he wouldn’t tell my boss about the photo, but conveyed that some in-house professionals would not appreciate seeing that their counsel was enjoying their time on work trips.

Initially, I was mad at this in-house lawyer for Facebook-stalking me and making a big deal out of a benign photo. Again, the photo just showed my hand holding a piña colada with the ocean in the background, it was not like I was revealing client confidences or anything like that. Moreover, the trip was not what it was made out to be. It should be no surprise to anyone that Facebook does not reflect reality, and completing that work trip for the client was much more of a pain in the butt than the photo might have revealed. In any event, I believed that I should be able to live my life and document it via social medial so long as no client confidences are revealed and within other reasonable boundaries. As a result, I thought the in-house lawyer was busting my chops for no reason. Of course, upon later reflection, I can somewhat understand his point. The company likely needed to spend a pretty penny to fly me to this tropical location, so in-house lawyers might feel a little jelly if they see a photo of my hand holding a drink on the beach while on a work trip.

In any event, it was really surprising to me that in-house lawyers at major companies care enough about their outside counsel that they might peruse personal Facebook accounts to glean more information. Lawyers should be super careful to use the right privacy settings on social media accounts, and if they are friends with in-house contacts, make careful decisions about posting work-related content.

# Don’t Let The Pandemic Be Regressive For Women Lawyers (Part II)
## The pandemic has exposed the significance of the systemic disparity that can no longer be ignored.

In my [previous article](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/lets-not-lose-ground-during-covid-19-in-the-fight-for-gender-equality-in-law-firms/), I described a day in the life of a woman lawyer in Biglaw working from home with no childcare. My goal was to reveal that many women lawyers, through no fault of their own, are having to do the impossible — work full time while having full- or part-time childcare responsibilities. These woman are not OK. Since that article was published, many articles have been written on this subject, including the recent [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/covid-economy-parents-kids-career-homeschooling.html) article “In the COVID-19 Economy, You Can Have a Kid or a Job, You Can’t Have Both.” This crushing dilemma is challenging for women in all industries right now. But the challenge in Biglaw was extraordinary even before the pandemic because the Biglaw system was built by and for lawyers who have the ability to be available 24/7 with no competing commitments. This has never been a reality for most women lawyers, particularly those in the critical career years of midlevel associate to early partner (which coincide with the childbearing years for most families). The pandemic has exposed the significance of the systemic disparity that can no longer be ignored.

The need for action on this problem is particularly acute now. Many families are coming to grips with the fact that no end is in sight for the need for them to manage child care, home schooling, and domestic work on their own going into fall. This realization has created a sense of hopelessness and fear for many women lawyers. One of my clients explained it this way: “I am afraid that at any moment I could lose everything that I have worked my entire life for.” Another client told me, “I feel like a failure from the minute I put my feet on the floor in the morning until the minute I go to bed late at night.”  No one could be expected to keep this up indefinitely.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Law firms who lose women during this period risk losing some of their best talent, their reputation around the issue of diversity, their ability to recruit women in the future, and current and future revenue from clients who value diversity.

Given the unprecedented nature of the realities we face in the pandemic, there are no ready-made, road-tested options for solving this problem. However, I would like to suggest a process to help identify actions that move us closer to ameliorating this intensifying problem. The process I am suggesting involves the following four steps:

Step 1: Acknowledge The Problem

The current system law firms use for evaluation, compensation, and promotion will adversely affect many women lawyers during the pandemic period because, through no fault of their own, they cannot keep up their pre-COVID pace. As such, failing to take steps to address this situation could undermine decades-long efforts by law firms to move the needle on gender diversity. This will result in a loss of two of the most important assets for law firms: talent and revenue.

Once we acknowledge the problem, the next step is to identify the many questions the problem evokes.

Step 2: Surface The Questions

These are some questions that occurred to us:

- Do law firm leaders really know how the pandemic is affecting many of their lawyers? Women lawyers do not talk as loudly about their struggle because they are afraid they will be viewed as somehow “weak”, “not committed”, or simply “under-performing.”
- What are the consequences of failing to take action to address this problem?
- Do law firm leaders who are able to work singlemindedly all day (i.e., because they do not have primary responsibility for child care and other home care responsibilities) recognize the inequities of using the traditional evaluation methodology for lawyers who cannot work 24/7?
- Are law firm leaders willing to invest money or make other concessions (see below for ideas) to retain their women lawyers during this period when many firms are cutting salaries and instituting layoffs?
- Do law firm leaders recognize that their women lawyers who are striving to “keep up” their pre-COVID pace are actually demonstrating a superlative level of commitment to the firm rather than a lack of commitment?
- Would making an investment or concessions to women lawyers be fair to the lawyers who have been able to maintain pre-COVID pace because they do not have primary responsibility for child care?
- To what extent are male lawyers who are also caregivers also suffering in a disproportional way?
- Is there a fairer way to measure the value that lawyers bring to their clients and their firms other than the billable hour? Can or should we use this crisis to begin rethinking a system of compensation and promotion that is equitable for high-performing lawyers who also have important responsibilities outside of work?
After surfacing the key questions concerning the problem, the next step is to seek multiple perspectives regarding the problem, the answers to which will guide the development of potential options for action.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Step 3: Seek Out Multiple Perspectives

At least three major stakeholder perspectives should be considered here: 1) lawyers whose home-care responsibilities make it impossible for them to maintain their pre-COVID work pace; 2) law firm leaders making policy decisions about these issues; and 3) lawyers who have been able to maintain their pre-COVID work pace.

It is beyond the scope of this article to imagine all of the perspectives stakeholder groups may have regarding this problem. However, it is inescapable that many law firm leaders (who are charged with creating policy on issues such as these) simply do not currently have, and may never have had, the “lived experience” of working full time while being the primary parent for child care and housework. In fact, for many law firm leaders the pandemic has afforded them even more time to work singlemindedly. Lacking the life experience of balancing work and homecare responsibilities, it is understandable that many law firm leaders may not be able to grasp the significance of this problem. Research shows that it is very [difficult to have empathy ](http://media.wix.com/ugd/80ea24_69eafdc5d036419e93600d80c6d5be33.pdf)for the suffering of others when you have either never experienced the problem yourself or, if you did, it was a long time ago.

Making matters more complex, law firm leaders themselves are suffering as a result of the pandemic, but for very different reasons. In fact, the pandemic probably is posing the most significant challenges they have ever faced: managing a large multinational organization remotely, meeting client demands virtually, and trying to ameliorate the actual or potential loss of revenue and profitability. So, while law firm leaders may have a real commitment to gender equity in the abstract, they have a competing commitment around the financial health and continued viability of their organization.

Seeking and understanding the perspectives of all stakeholders won’t solve the problem, but it is an essential precursor to designing pragmatic action, the final step in the process. The pragmatic action will come from understanding the need to balance support for gender equity AND the need to tend to profitability and a sense of fairness to all stakeholders. Given the complexity of the task, it would be impossible to design action that solves the problem. Rather, the goal is to design experiments that respect the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and move us closer to equity.

Step 4: Create Pragmatic Experiments

What do pragmatic experiments look like? One way to generate ideas for small experiments is to look at what other industries are doing to ameliorate the suffering the pandemic has caused for their constituencies.

Technology Companies

Recognizing that all of their employees have different situations and responsibilities at home, Facebook offers up to 10 weeks paid leave and 30 days unpaid leave to employees who need it for caregiving purposes. This is on top of normal vacation and sick leave. In addition, Facebook employees will not be given official performance ratings during this period. Instead, all 45,000 of Facebook’s employees will be paid bonuses based on an “exceeds expectations” rating. Employees will receive low-key reviews but nothing will be logged. Facebook is also working on ways to reward its employees who have gone above and beyond during the pandemic.

How might this translate to law firms: Law firms could lower the hours expectations commensurate with some number of weeks of “paid leave” for caregiving responsibilities. For example, 10 weeks of paid leave would translate to lowering billable hours expectations by 400 hours. Many women lawyers don’t even take their earned vacation because they fear using vacation time will put them at the top of the list to be fired. Performance reviews could be waived for this period guaranteeing that everyone would at the least “meet expectations.”

The Federal Government

Recognizing that it is not the fault of the small-business owners that the lockdown has resulted in their businesses failing, the federal government has provided funds through the Payroll Protection Program to help carry these businesses and their employees through this period. Although the PPP is styled as a loan-forgiveness program, it actually is a subsidy program designed to offset some of the unexpected costs and losses eligible businesses are incurring directly due to the pandemic.

How might this translate to law firms: Law firms could “subsidize” the billable hours of their lawyers whose home and family responsibilities currently are preventing them from maintaining their pre-COVID hours. Some may argue for lawyers going part-time, but many women lawyers are also the primary breadwinners in their families, so they cannot afford to take a salary cut to go part-time as a result of the pandemic.

Higher Education

Recognizing that it is not the fault of students that they have to study from home and that every home environment varies in terms of equipment, broadband, and privacy, colleges and universities are allowing students to take all classes pass/fail.

How might this translate to law firms: Law firms could consider basing reviews, salary increases, and promotions on pre-COVID performance. The COVID period would be a pass/fail system. Women are very anxious about how their performance will be evaluated during this time, and that anxiety is making it even harder to work.

These are just a few ideas from other industries. What are your ideas for small experiments? What have you seen law firms try to address the problem?

The Risk And Opportunity For Law Firms

Firms that neglect to address this problem run a grave risk of negatively affecting their talent bases, reputations, and bottom lines for years to come. If women lawyers face compensation reductions, delays in career advancement, and a loss of job security simply because the pandemic is preventing them from working at their pre-COVID pace, firms may lose some of their highest-performing women during their prime performance years. Aside from the costly loss of talent, the reputations of these firms will suffer, and they likely will face greater challenges in attracting top female talent in the future because women will see a lack of commitment and a bleak path forward. This  regression will directly impact the bottom line because clients are increasingly factoring in diversity when choosing outside counsel.

Law firms who lean into this problem and work diligently and creatively to address it will be the winners here because they will retain the highly talented women lawyers who are demonstrating heroic commitments to their firms while handling significant commitments at home. These women will tell other women lawyers about the leadership at their law firms, which will make it easier for these firms to recruit and retain more talented women lawyers now and in the future. These law firms will have a competitive advantage when pursuing new work from clients who value diversity. Law firms should see this moment as an opportunity to take a stand for women lawyers and reap all the benefits of retaining and recruiting top talent, improved reputation for diversity, increased ability to compete for future work, and improved bottom line.

Over the last several years, a recurring theme in Biglaw coverage is the widening gap between the top handful of elite firms and the vast middle, once populated by strong mid-sized and regional firms. As niche firms and boutiques ramp up their firepower, clients are moving to the margins and porting more work to smaller firms and, when they don’t, they run with more fervor into the loving embrace of the cream of the crop firms.

The sort of firms that no one ever gets fired for hiring.

So, with the release of the latest Am Law 100 numbers, [what do we see](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/23/the-2019-am-law-100-gross-revenue/)? Basically, what we see are 10 firms pulling down over $2 billion in annual revenue and 37 firms topping the $1 billion mark. By spot 74, we’re not even over $500 million. The precipitous decline gains momentum fast.

Check out the full 100 in revenue over at Am Law, but here’s the top ten for you:

Kirkland — Up over 18 percent to $3.75 billion.
Latham — Up over 10 percent to $3.38 billion.
Baker McKenzie — This is where we’re supposed to note this is a verein. So… noted. $2.9 billion.
DLA Piper — Another verein. $2.8 billion.
Skadden — $2.6 billion off modest 3.5 percent growth.
Sidley — $2.2 billion with 9 percent.
Hogan Lovells — 4.1 percent growth to $2.1 billion.
Morgan Lewis — $2.095 billion, up 4.7 percent.
Jones Day — Trump may be mad at them, but the firm can content itself $2.057 billion in revenue.
White & Case — Another strong year of growth, up 13.7 percent to $2.05 billion and replacing Norton Rose on this list.

There are your top money makers — exactly the same as last year with White & Case pushing Norton Rose to 11th.

Did we mention that Norton Rose is a verein. It’s a verein.

# Yes, This Is How Much A Biglaw Partner Working For One Week Bills
## And the bills are only going to get bigger.

The media is losing its collective sh*t over the completely reasonable bill that Bracewell partner and former federal judge Barbara Jones has submitted for her work as the special master reviewing the materials seized in the raid of Trump Organization lawyer Michael Cohen’s office. It’s like — yes, this is what quality legal work costs in 2018, get a clue.

You’ve almost[ inevitably seen](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/retired-judge-charges-50g-review-seized-michael-cohen-docs-article-1.4015722) some [breathless headline](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/29/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-due-in-court-for-update-on-files-seized.html) in the last 24 hours or so discussing the invoice from Jones that revealed a $700/hour billing rate for the retired judge and a grand total of $47,390 in legal services for a single week of work on the matter.

But here’s the thing — that’s not an outrageous bill. That’s what Biglaw partners cost. In fact, for someone with the experience (including 16 years on the federal bench) and gravitas of Barbara Jones, it’s actually a pretty damn good deal. Top rates for experienced partners [approach the $2,000 mark](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/2000-an-hour-lawyers-thats-one-way-to-fund-salary-increases/) — more than double Jones’s rate — so let’s just chill out the f*ck out.

And the bills are only going to get bigger. The government has collected a metric sh*t-ton of documents, and deciding what materials are protected by the attorney-client privilege is going to take a lot of hours (at $700 per). Never mind that the highly public nature of the case means there’s just that extra bit of pressure to articulate a justification for every decision, a process that, again, takes a lot of time.

So when some douche at the bar tries to strike up conversation opining about the outrageously large legal bill in the Cohen case, just smile and turn away — because that guy has no idea what he’s talking about.

I'm also curious if she's not billing for her associates' work, if any are involved? Unclear what ""team"" means in the context of this itemization.
Looks like she's working with at least 1 other person who bills at $670/hour [pic.twitter.com/4LcHQIcZuq](https://t.co/4LcHQIcZuq)

# Understanding Big Law: A Must-Read Guide To One Of The Most Challenging Workplaces In The World Is Now Available
## An Am Law 100 partner and rainmaker penned Big Law Confidential to help the rest of us understand the law firms that help run the world.

[](https://bit.ly/40UMLED)Many a law student dreams of wearing a fine suit and walking into a gleaming office tower, then settling in a corner office to conduct high-stakes legal work. Yes, they will have heard about the astronomical stress levels that come with working in Big Law, about its all-consuming nature.

But some people can’t resist a “New York, New York” challenge. They know that if they can make it at one of these firms, they’ll make it anywhere.

Enter [Big Law Confidential, The Comprehensive Guide to the Large Law Firm Work Experience in the U.S. ](https://bit.ly/40UMLED)by D.W. Randolph. For young lawyers who want to take on the challenge — and those who care about them — it’s a must-read.

The author is a partner, rainmaker, and practice leader at a firm in the Am Law 100, the ranking of the largest, most high-powered firms in the country, those tagged with the Big Law label. The author chose to write under an anonymous pen name so nothing would interfere with the frankness necessary for the work to be truly useful.

And frank it is. Early on, the author discusses sky-high compensation. We’re talking a starting base salary of more than $200,000 per year in some markets, plus hefty bonuses. This is followed by a dose of reality: Big Law pays this much so top students from top schools will put up with the “soul-crushing” work.

In case you think this is an exaggeration, a Forbes survey recounted in the book found “the #1 worst and unhappiest job in America was that of associate at a Big Law firm.”   

This book is designed to help attorneys prepare, and cope. Big Law Confidential contains a massive amount of information, from the general to the granular. It’s tempting to say that only a Big Law attorney would be tenacious and organized enough to produce such a guide, meant to teach its readers “how to survive the grueling, incredibly stressful, and immensely challenging work experience[.]” 

Or better yet, how to succeed. Some advice is common-sense, such as an emphasis on producing quality work and promptly communicating with senior attorneys and clients, but some is less obvious and quite clever. For example, the author advises you to schedule your personal time for exercise or what have you (be vague about the activity) in the firm’s system, so that when the partner checks to see if you’re free, he or she does not get the impression that your hands are idle. Optics are an important weapon in the battle to succeed in Big Law.

A young attorney reading this book might say, “Surely, the partners realize I need some time for myself and my family.”

No such luck. This is Big Law, where you are expected to produce an enormous volume of high-quality, error-free legal work quickly and under budget. Your work will most certainly not be confined to ordinary business hours. Twelve-hour days are de rigueur in Big Law, all-nighters are not unheard of, and everyone works at least a few hours while on vacation. 

For this reason, the author suggests this guide be used not only by attorneys deciding whether to join a Big Law firm — and those striving to succeed once they’ve joined — but by the people in their lives. Spouses and other family members will need to understand, to the extent possible, what it takes to thrive. 

Legal recruiters may also find the book useful, as well as clients of Big Law firms, and law school faculty, staff, and administrators, to name a few.

In fact, the author makes it easy, providing a list of those who should read the book in the front matter, as well as a glossary, and a chart with the salient points from each chapter.

The chart is a great feature. It can be used like an index. Imagine you are a newly minted associate headed into your first performance review. You may want to reread that section to arm yourself with knowledge and to ease your stress. Consult the chart. Wondering how bonuses work? The chart will tell you where to read. Want advice about seeking a promotion? The chart will point you in the right direction. Big Law Confidential clocks in at 529 pages, plus a recommended reading list. The chart, a breakdown at-a-glance, should help the book remain useful throughout your professional journey.

But what most impressed this reviewer was the readability. At times, the book is entertaining and possesses a sly sense of humor. Chapter 3, for instance, is called “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.” It pulls no punches. 

The “good” found in Big Law includes excellent training, substantive experience in red-meat legal work, the cultivation of valuable personal relationships, and of course, money. Who wouldn’t want to pay off their law school debt in a few years?

The “bad” includes working under incredible time pressure and for absurdly long hours, lack of feedback, toxic culture, and this reviewer’s favorite subhead, “Jerks,” a section that describes the kind of demanding boss/partner all attorneys wish to avoid, the kind that screams and throws staplers.

In the next section, labeled “The Ugly,” the prose turns somber: “Rates of substance use, abuse and addiction in the legal industry are among the highest of any professions and in some cases double the rates for the general population.”

To this, add mental health issues, as well as physical problems caused by extreme work hours that preclude exercise and healthy meals. The author told of one associate who gained 70 pounds in two years.

And finally, the ugliest of all — losing your soul, when a client’s needs or actions do not align with your ethics.

The author caps off this brutally honest chapter with a striking quote: “As one former Big Law associate put it, ‘I have never in my life met anyone who regretted their decision to quit their job as a law firm associate. Never.’”

Another vivid portion of the book comes in Chapter 7, titled “A Day in the Life.” Here, the author gives detailed accounts of a typical workday for attorneys at each level of a Big Law firm, from junior associate to equity partner. First, a so-called “good day” is detailed, when there are no fires to put out and an attorney is left in peace for uninterrupted hours to accomplish work on the “to-do” list.

Of course, these good days are rare. The author’s description of a bad day may be familiar to anyone who has worked in the legal industry: Emails in the middle of the night from an anxious client who needs a problem solved posthaste; senior associates who sit on your brief for days only to throw it back at you, telling you to revise it “ASAP,” yet offering no guidance; mandatory meetings that trap you while your work piles up.

Big Law Confidential also contains a raft of practical information — presented in blessedly concise language — about typical Big Law hiring processes, compensation structures, practice areas, promotion processes, management structures, economics, and client relationships. The author certainly earned the right to call this a comprehensive guide. While it’s a safe bet the bespoke-suited partners are not going to explain what went on in the management meeting to a lowly junior associate, this book explains the realities of the business and offers insights to help a person work better and smarter. It may help them develop a good reputation at the firm, which the author says is one key to advancement.   

In the final chapter, despite frank discussions of the dark side of Big Law, the author says that given the chance to do it all over again, the author would choose the same path. After all, many believe Big Law represents the ultimate in lawyering. And now, this book exists to help.  

Elizabeth M. Bennett was a business reporter who moved into legal journalism when she covered the Delaware courts, a beat that inspired her to go to law school. After a few years as a practicing attorney in the Philadelphia region, she decamped to the Pacific Northwest and returned to freelance reporting and editing.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Firm Announces Summer Bonuses... Not Raises
## Is this better or worse than a raise? Depends...

Earlier, we looked at some [grievances we’d received](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/angry-associates-ask-wheres-my-money/) from around the legal industry from firms that hadn’t yet announced raises. One of those firms was BuckleySandler. The commenter was flabbergasted that despite high PPP and billables, the firm had taken no action in the salary wars. It was an earnest complaint, but also a complicated one. BuckleySandler is known as a great place to work and as a compensation leader, exposing just how much Cravath’s move has upset expectations.

Since that post, the firm has [sent out a memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-announces-summer-bonuses-not-raises/2/) to employees and it’s… not a raise. No, instead it’s a package of summer bonuses to share the love after a profitable first half of the year.

Those associates billing an annualized rate of 1,700 hours over the first half of the year will receive $7,500-$25,000 depending on seniority and intensity of effort. Those below that billing figure will receive “a more modest bonus.” Ahem… 1,700 hours? That seems like a very, very easy number to beat. This is a pretty sweet summer present.

But it’s not a raise. That’s certainly going to rub some people the wrong way, but BuckleySandler addressed this in their memo, noting that they traditionally don’t follow the prevailing Biglaw salary… they exceed it.

In fact, with the firm’s 401(k) profit sharing and its generous bonuses, all associates tend to exceed the Biglaw matrix — the average first-year in 2015 made over $180K already — and the “highest performer” attorneys do even better, as [this chart shows](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-announces-summer-bonuses-not-raises/3/).

According to its message to associates, the firm believes that, including this summer bonus, associates should, on average, exceed the Cravath scale again.

But this is the awkward fallout of Cravath’s announcement. Just as I’ve applauded some law firms for offering smaller raises in concert [with the expectations of their associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/kanyes-law-firm-issues-raises-for-associates/), there’s a flip side. When Cravath blew the top off a salary situation that was, probably, long overdue for a shakeup, it put some other firms in a pickle. BuckleySandler was taking advantage of the fact that the market undervalued associates to position itself as a leader. Now that the market has moved to correct itself, the premium that BuckleySandler associates expected over the market is bound to shrink. BuckleySandler may find itself on the wrong side of matching associate expectations through no fault of its own!

Of course, this may not matter in the grand scheme. The second half of the year might yield a tremendous rainfall for BuckleySandler and the way other firms are spending around the country like drunken sailors might shrink Biglaw bonuses and BuckleySandler may end up beating the market by the same proportions it did last year.

But that’s not necessarily guaranteed. And lawyers are generally such risk-averse people.

The full BuckleySandler bonus announcement is on the next page, and the chart of average 2015 compensation is available on the page after that.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Earlier this week, Above the Law began receiving whispers about Steptoe & Johnson, a firm ranked 99th on the most recent Am Law 100, with $421,994,000 in gross revenue. Tipsters were sharing that salaries were being cut for associates below an 80 percent utilization.

That is definitely an interesting development. The rumors quickly spread [to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/vgx3hw/big_law_v70_firm_cutting_salarieshours/id48ee9/), where eagle-eyed observers noted that [back in January,](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/steptoe-match-22/) when the firm announced raises to the then-top-of-market[ Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), the memo included [this detail](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/steptoe-match-22/2/) about those not billing at maximum capacity:

We will encourage associates who are consistently under budget to move to a reduced work schedule to make sure that compensation and work effort are equitable and aligned.

So, is that what’s happening? Those the firm considers underutilized are getting  prodded by the firm? Above the Law reached out to Steptoe, and it seems it’s a mixed bag at the firm.

The good news, for those billing at optimum utilization, as of July 1, the firm is moving to the full Cravath scale. That means fourth-year and more senior associates are getting a raise. But for those under the firm’s “utilization expectation,” they’ve been moved to “reduced utilization budgets and prorated compensation.” So, the tipsters are correct — salaries are being cut for some associates. At year end, the firm will again assess utilization and compensation accordingly.

The full statement from the firm is below:

“In January, we laid out our vision for Steptoe for 2022 and beyond. Part of that vision is maintaining and strengthening our high-performance culture, growing our talent, and enhancing the success of our clients.

“We have raised base salaries for associates in our US offices, for the second time this year, effective July 1. These increased salaries are consistent with our high-performance expectations. It is important that our associate compensation scale allows us to retain and compete for the best talent.

“We also announced in January that we would be matching associates who are consistently under budget with reduced work schedules to make sure that compensation and work effort are equitable and aligned. Over the course of the past few days we’ve contacted every US associate to inform each of them of salary changes and their utilization expectations. A small number of associates will be moving to reduced utilization budgets and prorated compensation through the end of the 2022, at the July 1 scale. At year end, we will review again associate utilization and performance and expect to continue to reward our high performers.

“We are committed to always acting in a way which is consistent with our vision and culture and to doing our best to develop every associate so that they can achieve their full career potential. We are confident these changes will help us achieve those goals.”

July 1 compensation scale

Class Year	Prior Salary	New Salary
2021	$215,000	$215,000
2020	$225,000	$225,000
2019	$250,000	$250,000
2018	$285,000	$295,000
2017	$325,000	$345,000
2016	$350,000	$370,000
2015	$370,000	$400,000
2014	$385,000	$415,000

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

Biglaw firms are ranked in a multitude of ways, from gross revenue to size to quality of life and even prestige. But what about the ways these large firms are performing on LinkedIn? What is Biglaw firms’ engagement like on LinkedIn in terms of followers, comments, likes, and posts? Are they strengthening bonds with their employees and clientele that will help drive new business in the future?

That’s exactly what a new ranking from BTI Consulting Group — Benchmarking Law Firm LinkedIn Performance 2023, Unleashing the Power of LinkedIn — covers in detail. Here are some additional details from [BTI’s Mad Clientist](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/31-law-firms-with-the-best-linkedin-engagement-by-law-firm-size) blog:

BTI’s 3-year deep dive exploration into Law Firm LinkedIn pages and performance has unearthed a fascinating landscape of achievements and opportunities across law firms of varying sizes. The implications are profound, offering high-performing firms a gateway to inbound business and providing others with a chance to catch up — or leap ahead in the latest source of new business.

Our research reveals that strategically minded and disciplined firms consistently deliver performance levels 3x times better than their larger peers. The extent of this performance spectrum underscores the crucial role of investment, commitment, and strategy in shaping each firm’s destiny.

# Law Firms Should Be Shamed For Reopening Offices Too Soon
## Even if there is some elusive benefit to in-person collaboration, it is not worth risking the health and safety of employees.

Earlier in the pandemic, [I predicted that some law firms would reopen their offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/will-some-law-firms-reopen-their-offices-too-soon/#:~:text=As%20most%20states%20begin%20to,staff%20to%20continue%20working%20remotely.) shortly after they were legally allowed to do so, even though this defied social distancing guidelines. Indeed, I opined that the same firms that refuse to close their offices for inclement weather, or had a reputation for not caring for their employees, would be the shops that would reopen their offices too soon during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many law firms across the country have not required attorneys and staff to return to offices because of COVID-19, I know of several law firms in my area that reopened their offices too soon. I have also received numerous emails over the past several months from attorneys and staff who need to make tough choices because their bosses are forcing them to return to the office. Since the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage, law firms should not be requiring employees to come to the office under most circumstances, and the legal profession should do more to shame law firms into permitting virtual work for the remainder of the pandemic.

Supporters of reopening law firm offices often assert a few extremely flawed arguments for why attorneys and staff should be forced into returning to offices. Many managers lament that productivity has plummeted because employees are working from home and this hurts the bottom lines of many law firms. However, if productivity was such an issue, why have many law firms, both big and small, across the country promoted virtual work programs and still had the resources to reverse salary cuts, furloughs, and other austerity measures (and in many instances, awarded bonuses)? There is no reasonable explanation why taking Zoom depositions, conducting computerized legal research, drafting documents, and completing most other legal tasks cannot be conducted at home and requires a visit to the office for the sake of productivity. If a law firm is finding itself unproductive because of virtual work, perhaps this is because of the lack of vision of managers, and law firm bosses should work on boosting the output of virtual work rather than risking the health of their employees by reopening offices.

Moreover, even if productivity is a reason for reopening offices, keeping your employees healthy (which is easier if they are at home) and minimizing the number of workers who have to deal with COVID-19 will boost productivity. As someone who recovered from COVID-19 earlier this year, I can convey that the virus made it difficult for me to complete work for over a week, and I only had a moderate case of COVID-19. Of course, individuals with more serious cases of COVID-19 can be off their feet for weeks or months, and this is assuming they are able to recover from the virus at all. Moreover, permitting virtual work will make it far easier for employees to juggle all of the schooling, childcare, and other personal needs we all need to contend with these days, which should improve the mental health of a firm’s workforce and boost productivity. As a result, law firm managers concerned with productivity should be enabling employees to work remotely.

Another argument supporters of forcing attorneys and staff back to offices often convey is that meeting in an office helps with collaboration among coworkers. This is an extremely antiquated notion, the type of outdated reasoning that someone the likes of Don Draper might convey (I’m assuming, I’ve never actually seen an episode of Mad Men). Attorneys today collaborate using a number of virtual mediums, including Zoom, group texts, GChat, social media, and other platforms. Indeed, attorneys across the country have even been attending virtual happy hours and other programs in order to remotely promote the social environment of a law firm. Even if there was some elusive benefit to in-person collaboration, it is not worth risking the health and safety of employees.

Many law firms are taking safety measures to supposedly make returning to offices safer, but there is no doubt that requiring office work comes with a greater risk of being exposed to COVID-19 than staying at home. I have heard of law firms only requiring half of their employees in the office at once, which still presumably exposes their attorneys to more people than if they worked from home, not to mention the individuals they must interact with on public transportation, the lobbies of buildings, and other places. Moreover, wearing masks and sterilizing surfaces is not 100% effective, and we have all heard stories of people being careful and still being exposed to the virus. Although law firms can engage in safety theater with measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, the most effective way to keep employees safe is to permit them to work from home.

The legal profession should take a bigger role in shaming law firms into allowing virtual work as the pandemic continues to rage. [This website has published stories and opinion pieces](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-covid-law-firm-reopening-tracker-how-is-your-firm-going-back-to-work/) about law firms that prematurely reopened their offices, and this is a good start. However, bar associations and other trade organizations should also take the position that virtual work should be promoted in all but the most critical roles that need to be conducted in an office. As this website has demonstrated for years, law firms react to public relations pressure just like other organizations because clients, potential employees, and other stakeholders may not wish to associate themselves with law firms that mistreat their employees. We can all play a part in ensuring that fellow legal professionals remain safe during the ongoing pandemic.

In the end, even though law firm managers may be upset that they need to pay rent for an office that is rarely used in the current environment, this is no reason to force attorneys and staff back to offices. Many firms have been successfully using virtual work techniques for months and have been able to minimize any impact to their bottom line. Law firms should continue to allow work-from-home policies for the remainder of the pandemic, and we can all play a part in pressuring law firms to promote the health and safety of their employees.

# Biglaw Firm Tries New Strategy In Intense Associate Talent War
## Taking time off doesn't have to be a career killer.

Just because someone took a break from the legal profession, it doesn’t mean that Biglaw is foreclosed as a career option. Well, while there has never been a *rule* about it, but ya know, coming back to Biglaw after a multi-year break was far from common. (This is my lack of shock over Biglaw’s [continuing diversity problem](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/behind-biglaws-dismal-diversity-numbers/).) Anyway, one firm is trying to make it easier for folks to get back in the fold of Biglaw.

Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer recently announced its Returners program, open to folks who have left the profession for two or more years, whether it be to raise a family, take care of a family member, or to pursue another opportunity. We all know Biglaw is super busy and there really aren’t enough qualified lawyers out there to handle all of the work, which has created a scorching [hot lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/). This program will help fulfill that need while also giving an assist to diversity, as [reported by](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/freshfields-seeks-draw-lawyers-returning-practice-amid-talent-war-2022-01-20/) Reuters:

Although the program is partly about boosting headcount, “it’s also an attempt to focus on a real shortcoming of the profession by saying, sometimes when people have been driven out of it, they can be lured back into it,” said Boris Feldman, Freshfields’ head of U.S. technology and a partner in the firm’s Silicon Valley office.

So, what does the program look like? From the [firm’s press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220120005683/en/Freshfields-Launches-New-Recruitment-Initiative-to-Attract-and-Hire-Experienced-Lawyers-Seeking-Re-entry-to-Profession):

Initially offered in the firm’s Silicon Valley office, the program gives participants the opportunity to work with high-profile clients and collaborate with cross-border, cross-functional teams, while supporting them with a full range of mentorship, training and development resources. These include: technical training tailored to individual, role-specific and client requirements; a dedicated mentor; and access to senior management and the firm’s extensive support network and community, including other returning professionals who understand the challenges of career re-entry.

It’s nice to see a firm thinking outside the box to tackle two issues with a single solution.

# The Geopolitics Of Selecting Lawyers
## Companies talk about being 'represented' by particular lawyers. Shouldn’t those lawyers match their values?

Ed. note: Please welcome Sean West to the pages of Above the Law. He will be writing about geopolitics and the practice of law.

Recently US Congressman Steve Cohen (D-TN) [sent a letter](https://cohen.house.gov/sites/cohen.house.gov/files/Updated%20Sec.%20State%20Letter%204.18.22.pdf) to the Biden administration urging that the US ban visas for six British lawyers he accused of enabling Russian oligarchs to silence journalists through “abusive lawsuits.” He urged that the US “establish deterrents for foreign enablers … and hold to account those enablers … performing this unscrupulous work.”

It has been three months since Russia invaded Ukraine and during that time there has been an escalating chorus of sanctions announced from every corner of the Western world. However, it is only now that the question is being asked — “What about the lawyers?”

This isn’t too surprising. Everyone has a right to their own defense and everyone, as citizens, has the ability to hire lawyers to try civil matters. As a result, those that represent unsavoury figures are often seen as just doing their job.

But lawyers choose what work they take on. Shouldn’t legal work — the basis of which is trust — be held to a higher ethical standard?

Numerous executives have been canceled on the back of #metoo allegations, prompting companies to transform the way women are treated in the workplace. Very undiverse corporations have recommitted to change in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Companies in pollutive industries have reshaped their corporate missions to embrace green technology. And enterprises find themselves challenged to take positions on everything from voting rights laws to gender rules and norms around toilets and competitive sports.

Corporations wield tremendous power and when they decide to tackle an issue, they move in big ways. While this may involve supply chain commitments like cancelling vendors who use child labor or are environmentally destructive, actions rarely involve the advisors to the company. These strategic advisors often directly influence how the company operates and interacts with its customers and employees in ways that go well beyond sourcing of inputs.

Companies talk about being “represented” by particular lawyers. Shouldn’t those lawyers match their values?

For instance, if a corporation offloads its highest value knowledge work to law firms that are completely undiverse, the company should not be viewed as wholly a champion of inclusion and equity.  If a company engages law firms that haven’t made commitments to sustainability and engage in pollutive travel and printing practices, the client is not free from responsibility.

And, of course, back to ethical choices of who to represent on what.

Congressman Cohen’s assertion is that the UK lawyers — some of whom work for the top British firms like CMS — “are undermining democracy.” Earlier this year, Mischon de Reya, another top UK firm, was fined by the UK Solicitors Regulation Authority for [“facilitating transactions that gave rise to a risk of facilitating money laundering”](https://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/solicitor-check/624547/) while a host of other US firms were disciplined by the same body in recent years for lack of controls and conflicts of interest. A bevy of major US and UK law firms were mentioned alongside investigations of the Panama Papers in 2016 which revealed a Panamanian law firm as a central hub for global tax evasion schemes.

Do other clients of these same firms face a duty to reconsider their relationships if such actions violate their own ethics? If so, this rarely happens.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Current clients might rationalize the behavior: It was probably a rogue partner that failed to uphold the standards of the law firm. Or that the lawyer has a duty to their client even as the client’s circumstances change. Or that there’s some moral justification that will never be obvious due to the particulars of legal confidentiality. And any of these could be true.

But there’s a more banal reason why law firms rarely face customer cancellations over questionable behavior: Customers generally don’t track the reputations of their advisors. Often, this is because large companies — which can spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on legal services and which may have over 1,000 in-house lawyers tasking external lawyers — don’t have a clear view of how much money they are spending with a particular law firm, with particular lawyers, and on what. Even when they do, they often have no clear view of the web of relationships or influence that advisors like lawyers have within their entities.

Is this good enough? If a corporation said it wasn’t accountable for human rights violations in its supply chain because it didn’t know they were occurring, the company would likely face boycotts and pressure from civil society or authorities to change course. But if clients of the above law firms were to be asked about continuing to work with them, most would probably be surprised the question is even being surfaced.

If ethical commitments are central to an enterprise’s worldview, the company must hold all of its suppliers to account. That means it must self-police such alignment of its knowledge providers.

The beginning of that is to really understand the state of play. So many relationships with lawyers are built on trust developed over time — often originating from personal relationships. But this must be examined and re-examined as the facts shift. And it must be considered at regular intervals or when a material new piece of work is about to be assigned.

Technology can help in this regard. Companies track their own corporate reputation and alignment with science-based climate goals or quantitatively defined diversity goals using tools that bring together all the data in their entity as well as meaningful information from public sources. Tracking the ethics of advisors is no harder to do. It’s not that the problem is unsolvable — it’s that only a few standout companies have decided to solve it so far.

The new wave of ethical corporations are those who have full alignment in their goods and services supply chains.  Lawyers are not “only” knowledge suppliers — they receive some of the most highly paid and highly valued work that a company offloads, and have strategic impact on the direction of the enterprise. A company must hold its knowledge partners especially to its highest standards.

# Chest-Thumping Is A Necessary Evil In Litigation
## If an adversary starts with that mishigas, it's fine to let the 'Jersey' out.

Most litigators would relate that one of the worst parts of litigation is the conflict that arises between litigators and their clients. This often requires attorneys to employ a fair amount of chest-thumping at the other side, which is aggressive and somewhat empty conduct that shows adversaries that the attorney shouldn’t be messed with, and opposing counsel should go along with whatever the other attorney wants. Sometimes, chest-thumping is employed merely to show to the client that the lawyer is being a good advocate who is internalizing the positions of a client. For better or for worse, chest-thumping is a necessary evil in litigation, but lawyers should keep a few things in mind when employing this strategy.

I remember the first time I was chest-thumping in my career. I had just started a gig as a “street lawyer,” and I had a compliance conference the next day. Right before the end of business, my adversary wrote me the nastiest letter saying that he would ask the court to strike my answer at the court conference the next day for alleged discovery deficiencies. My adversary copied his clients on the email, which I had not seen earlier in my career.

I sought advice from more senior lawyers in my office, who told me that a judge would not strike an answer at a discovery conference. Nevertheless, I wrote a strong, over-the-top response to this letter, citing to authority about how our answer should not be stricken and detailing how my adversary had actually been deficient in producing discovery.

When I saw my adversary in court the next day, I was still pretty ticked off about the letter my adversary sent the day before. My adversary was as nice as someone could be in his position, and he was surprised I had taken the time to write such a detailed response to his letter. I kind of got the impression that he was writing the letter more to make a point to his clients than to me, which made sense since he was just hired to resume prosecution of the matter from another lawyer and probably wanted to make an impression. This perspective changed how I viewed chest-thumping and responded to this tactic in the future.

As I have written in a few prior articles, another way that attorneys employ chest-thumping is with frivolous litigation letters. Such letters are [sent way too often](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/lawyers-threaten-each-other-way-too-much/), and it seems many lawyers don’t understand that having an opposing view of a matter does not mean a case is frivolous, warranting sanctions. In any event, the first time I got a frivolous litigation letter right after starting my own firm, I was really riled up. As my claims had merit, it was super frustrating to receive the letter since it did not include much relevant authority.

I ended up writing a longer, and much more detailed letter, responding to the frivolous litigation letter I received. When I finally got opposing counsel on the phone, he seemed surprised that I had taken so much time to draft my response. We ended up settling the case shortly thereafter, and no action was ever taken after the frivolous litigation letter, and my adversary probably just sent it because his client told him to.

There are a few considerations lawyers should keep in mind with regards to the chest-thumping that often predominates in litigation. Firstly, lawyers should not always take it personally if they are subjected to chest-thumping by an adversary. If an adversary takes an overtly aggressive tone, it does not mean that the lawyer is necessarily a jerk or is rude to others. There are many reasons why lawyers decide to be aggressive in litigation, and attorneys should extend some good faith to others to maintain relationships between counsel.

Moreover, it usually makes sense to match the tone of an adversary but not escalate things with more aggression or rudeness. I am rarely the instigator of chest-thumping unless a client wants this approach because it usually pays to be calm and respectful when handling a situation. However, if an adversary starts with that mishigas, I am fine letting the “Jersey” out and responding with the same level of aggression. Matching the tone of an adversary ensures that no one can allege an attorney took things too far with their manner of acting.

All told, chest-thumping is a necessary evil in litigation since clients and certain kinds of strategies might require that approach. However, lawyers can take some steps to ensure that the negative consequences of this litigation tactic do not deleteriously impact a representation.

# Milbank Spread The Wealth Through Salary Increases Because 2023 Was A Record Financial Year For The Firm
## This leading law firm's financials went up, up, up in 2023, and 2024 is proving to look similar. Congrats!

Perhaps you’ve been wondering why Milbank decided to [raise salaries to a $225K baseline](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) after what many other firms may have described as a difficult year, complete with associate [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) and [deferrals](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/deferrals/).

We’ll give you a little hint: it’s because Milbank’s financials went sky high in 2023, which proved to be a record year for the firm. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/29/milbank-revenue-shoots-up-17-8-as-profits-soar-and-nonequity-tier-grows/) has additional details on the firm’s success:

Milbank … grew its revenue by 17.8% to $1.514 billion in 2023 while its profits per equity partner jumped 18.6% to $5.114 million ….

Even as its full-time equivalent head count grew about 8% to 912 lawyers, Milbank’s revenue per lawyer was up 9.5% to $1.66 million. With the firm keeping its equity partner ranks mostly flat, its total net income jumped 20% to $846.6 million. Meanwhile, the firm saw 51% growth in its nonequity partner ranks.

In an interview with Am Law, Scott Edelman, Milbank’s chair, spoke of what drove the firm’s performance last year, saying, “It’s not just a one-story thing. Basically, the entire firm was up. Our lawyers were just generally busier across the firm.”

Milbank had several practices that were “really busy,” including its private equity practice and its energy and infrastructure practice (“especially renewables,” according to Edelman). The firm’s restructuring practice and litigation practice also saw big gains in 2023.

Watch out, Biglaw world, because Edelman says Milbank is going strong in 2024 as well. “Things are super busy going into this year,” he said. Will there be yet another salary increase led by Milbank at the end of the year? That remains to be seen — and it would be the third year in a row that Biglaw would see a compensation hike — but we’ll be there to cover the exciting news if and when it happens.

# Artificial Deadlines Are One Of The Worst Parts About Working At A Law Firm
## Artificial deadlines are unreasonable and do not create a congenial work environment.

As covered at length by this website, there are a number of reasons why people hate working at law firms.  For one, time entry is a tedious chore that annoys even the most patient among us.  Also, constant tension with adversaries can wear down even the most dedicated attorney.  However, to me, one of the worst parts about working for a law firm, and perhaps one of the most avoidable nuisances of being an attorney, are artificial deadlines.

As many people who work in law firms are aware, managers oftentimes require associates to complete assignments on timeframes that have almost no bearing on when a particular task actually needs to be accomplished.  At times, bosses seem to pull a deadline out of thin air, and hold associates accountable if they fail to complete a given task by that deadline.  It does not matter if the associate needs to work on nights or weekends to complete an assignment by this time period, what matters is not whether a hard deadline will be met, but if the manager’s artificial timeframe will be satisfied.

Time and again during my career working for both small and large law firms, I have been forced to churn out assignments according to a partner’s unreasonably tight timeframe when the actual filing deadline was weeks or even months in the future.  One example sticks out in my mind as a particularly egregious example of a partner setting a completely artificial deadline that seemingly had no use other than to force me to work needlessly over a weekend.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Several years ago, I was working on a case in which a summary judgment motion needed to be filed within 120 days of an event that just occurred in the matter.  Despite the fact that we had nearly four months to write and file the summary judgment motion, a partner told me on a Wednesday that he wanted to see a draft of the summary judgment by Monday, five days from that date.  Since I was busy with court appearances and other obligations that week, I did not begin to draft the summary judgment motion until Friday.

In order to meet the partner’s deadline, I worked much of that weekend, and had to come to the office on a Sunday to get some exhibits together.  I also had to miss a baseball game that most of my brothers were attending so that I could prepare the motion by the partner’s deadline.

After I emailed the draft of the summary judgment motion to the partner that Monday, I did not hear back from the partner about the motion for weeks.  I checked our document management system, and confirmed that this partner did not even look at the draft motion for a long time after I finished writing the document.  About three weeks after I submitted the draft, the partner finally gave me his edits, and we filed the summary judgment motion well before the deadline.  However, there was absolutely no reason for the partner to create artificial time pressure and force me to work all weekend to meet a completely fabricated deadline.

Even though it seems pretty unreasonable to create artificial deadlines out of thin air, I have heard partners justify their use of artificial deadlines in a number of ways.  Some partners have told me that drafting a motion has a lot of moving parts, and it might be important for a draft to be provided well before the filing deadline to ensure that everything is ready by the time papers need to be filed.  In addition, other partners have told me that their time is more valuable than the time of an associate, so it does not matter if an associate needs to bust their butt to meet an artificial deadline.  What really matters is that the papers will ready by the time the partner is able to review the document.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There are, of course, times when there is absolutely no need to put an associate under time pressure so that things are lined up for a motion to be filed.  In addition, it is completely unreasonable to force an associate to work under a tight timeframe so that papers can be ready for when a partner finally reviews the documents.  Although some who might think otherwise, partners are not divas who need associates to unreasonably exert themselves under tight deadlines that are not based in realty.

I am far from the first person to discuss how partners do not respect the time of associates, and sometimes it is unavoidable to have associates work under tight timeframes to serve clients.  However, artificial deadlines are unreasonable and do not create a congenial work environment.  Partners should seriously consider whether a tight timeframe is necessary before requiring associates to work nights and weekends to meet an artificial deadline.

Are you tired of hearing about the supremely excellent U.S. Women’s National Team yet? No? Me either! In the course of capturing their fourth star (representing the four U.S. World Cup victories), they’ve also captured the imagination of fans across the country. And the good news, from an Above the Law perspective, is that one of the starters has a Biglaw connection.

One of the stars of the USWNT was Crystal Dunn, the tenacious defender that moved from the midfield position she plays at for the North Carolina Courage to better fit in the national team’s scheme. The New York native wowed the world with her soccer moves —- particularly during her stellar performance in the quarterfinals against France, and part of her essential support system is her parents Rhonda and Vincent Dunn. Vincent is the co-managing partner of Norton Rose’s New York office.

In an [interview](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/12/norton-rose-partner-is-a-proud-soccer-dad-his-daughter-just-won-the-world-cup/) with Law.com the high-powered partner plays a stereotypical dad, beaming with pride for his daughter:

“I did spend time thinking of some of the many days traveling to soccer games when she was young, when her jersey was too big for her and when I had to help her tie her cleats,” Dunn said. “From those days to a World Cup championship—a great deal of hard work and sacrifices have paid off.”

He and his wife were able to travel to France for the full 22 days of the tournament to support Crystal (shout out to the technology that makes balancing a corporate lending practice and attending the World Cup to support your daughter a little easier). Vincent describes the experience as somewhat surreal:

“The sounds were crazy. The fans were nuts,” Dunn a corporate lending partner, said. “People who I don’t know would come up and take pictures with me, and I would always say ‘I just want you to know I’m not Crystal.’”

Vincent credits the firm for their support that allowed him to experience this, saying “Norton Rose and everybody else went on the journey with me.”

# Law Firm Responses To GCs' Open Letter: An Epic Fail
## In-house counsel didn't request or give permission to law firms to spam them via email (personal and professional), LinkedIn, and mail.

The most recent Paul Weiss partner class

I was one of 170 general counsels who signed an [open letter to law firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/01/27/170-gcs-pen-open-letter-to-law-firms-improve-on-diversity-or-lose-our-business/) requesting to improve on diversity after seeing “largely male and largely white” new law firm partner classes at Paul Weiss and other firms. As someone who has openly and consistently advocated for diversity in leadership, especially on corporate boards, I was disappointed to see that some law firms are tone deaf and joined the effort to encourage change.

I will be blunt — these largely male and largely white new law firm partner classes, speaking panels, boards, executive teams, etc. are nothing more than dated relic. It is unacceptable and embarrassing. It must end!

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In response to my signature, I have received so much literature in the past few weeks that I cannot possibly read all of it. To be clear, my support for the letter was not a request for proposals or an opt-in to join lists. When I signed the letter, I didn’t request or give permission to law firms, various vendors, or other providers to spam me about their practice, diversity efforts, and numerous initiatives via my email (personal and professional), LinkedIn, and mail.

Moreover, receiving unsolicited, self-serving law firm marketing literature in this context feels a bit like receiving a pitch for a top of the line coffin from your neighbor for a business he happens to run after a death in a family. It had a distinct flavor of inappropriate, self-serving bad taste. Shouldn’t we be having different, less commercial conversations? Shouldn’t we take the marketing dollars and put them to a more productive use, such as training and mentoring?

Moreover, the senders are missing the point. By signing the letter, we very firmly and unequivocally stated that an all-male partner class in 2019 is simply inexcusable and unacceptable. It is a request to do better, aim higher, and embrace a seemingly irreversible historic trend toward inclusion.

A certain well-known national law firm sent me a FedEx envelope that required a signature to accept to my home address. Imagine what was going through my head as I contemplated what to do. Am I being served? The sender is clearly a reputable law firm. A few jobs ago, I even worked with them. They seemed sane. What have I done? Who may possibly want to sue me personally? Or, are they after a company with which I have had a relationship? Or, do they want to depose me? Should I refuse service? Should I make them jump through hoops?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Anyway, I signed after thinking through countless what-if scenarios became too much and feeling a distinct pressure from the FedEx guy to make a decision. To my surprise when I opened the envelope, I found this law firm’s diversity statistics on a heavy paper. It was a beautifully laid out, professionally created, impeccable, shiny piece of marketing collateral.

After a moment of relief (I won’t lie, I would rather get a marketing collateral than a complaint or notice to appear), I wondered how much waste and agony this one FedEx envelope would have caused if it were sent to all 170 GCs. The bottom line is this: if you are a law firm or sending something to a general counsel, consider what message you are sending when you require a signature. Of course, the irony of signing for yet another letter was not lost on me either!

The story of responses to the open letter did not end there. A few days later, another general counsel, whose first name also happens to be Olga, forwarded me an email. In her note she said, “See attached. This might have been meant for you.” I opened the attachment and found a long, well-crafted letter addressed to “Ms. Mack” (me!) that was emailed to another general counsel who shares my first name.

Apparently, we Olgas are fungible! If you write to one of us, you will most certainly reach all of us. So please address all invoices and complaints to other Olgas. Of course, if you are sending something good and of value, please be sure to get my address right. Who wants to wait for good stuff?!

Aww, all you Biglaw associates were hoping that another firm decided to beat the Cravath bonus scale. Stop being greedy little Scrooges, get into the holiday spirit, and think about your colleagues on the staff side for once.

Since bonus season kicked off at the end of November, we’ve received emails from law firm support staff wondering whether they’d receive even a pittance of the cash associates would soon see arrive in their bank accounts. After all, support staff members make law firms run, so they, too, ought to receive appropriate bonuses for their hard work.

That being the case, for the second year in a row, Weil Gotshal & Manges, one of the most prestigious firms in America, decided that all of its staff members — from human resources and business development personnel to paralegals and legal secretaries — would receive special bonuses of one week’s pay, on top of any discretionary year-end bonuses they were already due to receive.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Congratulations to Weil for setting the bar for how Biglaw firms ought to treat their administrative staff members. Here’s what one happy recipient of the firm’s special bonus had to say: “[T]oday (for the second year in a row), Weil offered a staff bonus. Happy Holidays – I’ll have one now thanks to this sweet unexpected surprise!”

Here’s the memo Weil’s admin staff received from the management committee:



Special bonuses for Weil’s staff members will be paid before the end of 2017, while year-end bonuses for associates will be paid in January 2018 — which may place staff at an advantage thanks to the new tax regime.

That’s our take on Weil Gotshal’s special bonuses for staff. If you’re a staff member at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

What is your firm doing in terms of staff bonuses this holiday season? Is it paying out two-figure, three-figure, or four-figure bonuses? Please [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus).

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

Call it naiveté or the Hollywoodifcation of things, but before going in-house, I assumed large companies like ours had a single Biglaw firm they turned to for everything.

I thought a single Biglaw firm, in exchange for a large retainer, would handle all aspects of that company’s business. After all, I presumed when you retained the biggest of Biglaw firms, they would be equipped to handle all aspects of a company’s business.

I had the image of a company being wooed by multiple firms, much like LeBron choosing Miami, before ultimately taking their talents to the inevitable Latham & Watkins or Skadden Arps.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Very quickly after going in-house, however, I realized we had multiple firms on speed dial. Biglaw, Midlaw, and Smalllaw alike, we were a near equal-opportunity client. While we do have some favored firms we turn to for our most trusted engagements, a single firm rarely captures more than a quarter of our business in a given year.

At first, I was admittedly confused by this decision. If our Biglaw firm of choice could handle the variety of issues we would throw at it, what would be the need for another?

That is, until our legal department received a request from one of our regular firms for a conflict waiver. This particular waiver was rather harmless. The firm wished to represent a plaintiff against one of our former physicians in a medical malpractice case. This waiver, like countless others, was granted without much thought.

When I inquired why we spread our business around so often as to require such seemingly mundane conflict requests, an attorney who had been with the company for years raised his head from a stack of papers and rather dryly quipped, “Knowledge is power.”

He explained that each time we are requested to sign a conflict waiver, we not only gain a little bit of knowledge on the state of legal affairs around the state, but we gain leverage in our ability to say no.

He recalled a time he was in a meeting with a potentially adverse, out-of-state party who broadly claimed our company had better accept their proposal or else they would retain the largest Biglaw firm in town!

He let on a big grin as he said he told them that particular Biglaw firm was a trusted counselor of ours who had not requested a conflict waiver to represent the client, and if they did, he would decline it given the nature of the present dispute.

He chuckled as he recalled how the faces of the adverse party sank as they knew their bluff had been called. Not only did they have a weak case, they also had no counsel to represent them. And even if they did decide to go firm shopping, they would quickly find there were very few firms in town who could, or would, want to engage them as a client.

In that moment, it clicked. Sure, while it is nice for the local large company to spread its legal business around town to gain some powerful friends, the real value comes in the ability to deny a firm a potential engagement.

Denying an adverse party local Biglaw counsel can derail their potential dispute before it even gets off the ground.

So to those in-house who are satisfied with their current single Biglaw engagement, I implore you, look to the others in the city. Not only will you be able to gain a fresh perspective on a given issue, you just may be able to shut down an adversary before they get started.

# Associate Bonus Watch: The Good News Keeps On Coming

There seems to be a fair amount of good news coming out of Goodwin these days. This month, the firm [fared well](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/news/2018/01/01_10_18-goodwin-advances-in-mergermarket-global) in the latest [M&A league tables from Mergermarket](https://www.mergermarket.com/pdf/MergermarketLegalLeagueTableReport.Q42017.pdf) — especially in private-equity deals, where the firm boasts a powerhouse practice. Last year, we covered Goodwin’s [high-profile hiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/ropes-raids-continue/?rf=1) of real-estate dealmaker [Marc Lazar](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/professionals/l/lazar-marc) away from Ropes & Gray, Goodwin’s rival for preeminence in the Boston legal market.

All the good news has given rise to good bonuses. Goodwin announced its bonuses last week, and they were well received. As one source said, “People are happy. Compared to last year, now hitting the hours requirement pretty much guarantees you a market bonus, unless you have unsatisfactory performance reviews.”

Goodwin bonuses are individualized, but the bonus memo contains aggregated information about the 2017 bonus distribution, and this information supports our tipster’s observation. From the memo sent around by [William Weiss](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/professionals/w/weiss-william), chair of Goodwin’s Attorney Review Committee (which we’ve posted in full on the next page):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This year, 77% of associates are eligible to receive bonuses.  Of those receiving bonuses, 35% will receive an amount greater than the amount listed for their class, 60% will receive their class amount, and 5% will receive less than their class amount.

For purposes of comparison, here’s the distribution info about the [2016 bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/associate-bonus-watch-no-news-is-good-news/):

This year, over 68% of associates are receiving bonuses. Of those receiving bonuses, 40% will receive an amount greater than the amount listed for their class, 36% will receive their class amount, and 24% will receive less than their class amount.

So in the latest bonus cycle, more associates got bonuses — over three-quarters of them, compared to two-thirds from the prior cycle — and of the bonus-receiving associates, 95 percent received a market or above-market amount. That’s a very healthy uptick. Congratulations, Goodwin associates, on the nice news!

## They cut employees last year and emerged stronger than ever.

If you think Biglaw firms that made layoffs in the middle of the pandemic were showing some economic weakness, well, that theory has been thoroughly disproven. According to an illuminating [report by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2021/03/04/at-more-than-a-dozen-firms-2020-layoffs-were-followed-by-partner-profit-windfalls/), 15 Biglaw firms saw significant upticks in revenue or profit — we are talking 5 percent or more — after they conducted layoffs of staff and/or attorneys as the COVID-19 pandemic raged. Here’s a look at what happened at some Am Law 200 firms that cut positions and still came out on top.

[Akerman](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/akerman/):

[Back in April of 2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-announces-salary-cuts-and-layoffs-by-video-message/) Akerman laid off both staff and attorneys. They saw record revenue in 2020, up 6.5 percent to $467.4 million. In a statement about this dichotomy, a spokesperson chalked in up to uncertainty in the market and “careful expense management”:

“Like many firms, we made business decisions early in the pandemic to confront the uncertainties facing the legal industry,” a law firm spokesperson said in an email. “Akerman’s success in 2020 is a direct result of our team’s phenomenal work for clients across numerous practice areas and sectors within the United States and internationally, as well as careful expense management.”

[Reed Smith:](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/reed-smith/)

Billion-dollar firm Reed Smith had a banner 2020, with profits per equity partner up 15.9 percent and revenue up by 5.1 percent. It also axed 19 jobs from its London office. Global managing partner Sandy Thomas said of the lost jobs:

“We don’t like that, of course, but you do have to reconcile the ongoing needs of the shape of the business with where you are in any particular point in time.”

[Hogan Lovells:](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/hogan-lovells/)

[Hogan Lovells announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/top-10-am-law-firm-lays-off-4-percent-of-americas-based-business-services-staff/) a 4 percent reduction in staff in the United States and Mexico in October. During that same period, the firm saw a 2.8 percent uptick in gross revenue. And profits per equity partner for last year are way up — by 30.8 percent, though that was assisted by a 23 percent decrease in the firm’s equity partner ranks. But the firm has pointed to the potential for more challenging times ahead:

A firm representative pointed to [CEO Miguel Zaldivar’s](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/10/23/hogan-lovells-to-cut-43-business-services-roles-in-americas/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_content=20201105&utm_campaign=lawbarometer&utm_term=law) statement in October, when he said the firm has “performed well over the past few months” and was ahead on revenue. “However, we see continuing uncertainties in the market for 2021 and need to be well-positioned to weather what could be a more challenging period,” Zaldivar said at the time.

[Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch:](https://abovethelaw.com/?s=procopio)

Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch cut its workforce by 13 percent last year. They also saw an increase in revenue of 7.6 percent and partner profits were up by 24.8 percent. But chief operating officer James Perkins says a hefty chunk of the increase in net income was from a PPP loan, which they anticipate will be forgiven. On balance, firm leaders say those they cut were not missed:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“It’s something we needed to do to weather the storm. We took those three steps pretty quickly, before many of our peers, and then when we were approved for the PPP funds, we equalized it all,” said Perkins, referring to the firm reversing pay cuts and hourly restrictions and hiring a few people back.

….

“We did hire a couple [staffers] back later in the year, but on balance we didn’t bring anyone else back,” said Perkins, the COO. “I hate to say this but we didn’t really miss them, and that’s what we’ve seen in the use of our technology, to allow our ratios to grow of attorneys to staff.”

[McDermott, Will & Emery:](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/mcdermott-will-emery/)

McDermott [conducted layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-50-firm-lays-off-associates-staff-during-pandemic/) to both the staff and attorney ranks in 2020. But, wow they had an amazing year — up a whopping 17.9 percent in gross revenue which translated to a 25.6 percent bump in profits per equity partner. Firm chair Ira Coleman characterized the cuts as part of a “moderated approach” and said the firm didn’t do any “big things.” Hmmm, tell that to the folks that lost their jobs mid-pandemic.

“You run the business based on the information you have at the time. When times get tough, you focus on everything a little closer, you trim expenses, you don’t do any riffs or big things,” chairman Ira Coleman said in a statement. “We took a very moderated approach. We knew partners were going to bear the risk of the year whether it turned out to be a good or bad year.”

[Dickinson Wright:](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/dickinson-wright/)

[Dickinson Wright cut](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/staff-summer-program-on-chopping-block-at-this-am-law-200-firm/) its workforce by 3 percent last year, despite a 2.9 percent hike in revenue with a corresponding 14.9 percent increase in profits per partner. Dickinson CEO Michael Hammer said the pandemic was an “opportunity” for the firm. “It really was an opportunity to address some of those underperformance and overcapacity issues most firms have,” he went on:

“When you are looking into a sea of uncertainty, we know we have these people we have been carrying along and can address it in a humane, transparent way, and then we don’t do any more cuts,” said Hammer… “We didn’t want to get to a point where we were making cuts on people we need for economics’ sake.”

[Davis Wright Tremaine:](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/davis-wright-tremaine/)

Davis Wright Tremaine increased gross revenue by 7.5 percent and profits per equity partner by 8.7 percent. [But in September,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/davis-wright-tremaine-layoffs/) the firm announced that furloughs would become layoffs for some staff members. The firm’s managing partner said the elimination of those positions were not part of cost-cutting measures:

“The layoffs were not a cost-cutting measure,” said Jeff Gray, managing partner, in a statement. “They were due to a fundamental shift in how we expect to operate and support our clients and lawyers going forward. We had already started looking at those changes. It involves an assessment of our staff structure and what kind of roles and capabilities we need to best support our clients and lawyers.”

[Saul Ewing:](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/saul-ewing/)

Saul Ewing[ laid off attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/one-of-vaults-best-firms-in-the-mid-atlantic-is-laying-off-associates-and-taking-other-steps-to-cut-costs/) and staff last year, and saw profits per partner increase by 14.4 percent. Managing partner Barry Levin said the cuts were made “in anticipation of reduced and evolving client needs.”

“There has been a shift from the traditional lawyer-secretary-paralegal model to having all kinds of other nonlawyer professionals who can provide really important insights that benefit client relationships in terms of project management and pricing experts,” Levin said last month.

The holiday season is typically a great time of the year for the legal community. Attorneys and staff can usually look forward to an assortment of parties and other traditions that make “the most wonderful time of the year” even more special. One of the things that I liked about the holiday season when I worked at bigger law firms is that vendors would often give gifts to attorneys and staff. Now that I have my own practice, it is far less likely that a vendor will provide me with a holiday gift (probably since I am less able to throw business their way) and a recent conversation with another small-firm lawyer informed me that it is less common for solo and small-firm lawyers to receive such gifts. This made me remember and appreciate all of the holiday gifts I used to receive from vendors at larger shops.

When I was a street lawyer at a 30-attorney firm, we used to conduct depositions regularly, and we would usually use one specific court-reporting service. Around the holiday season, to thank us for using their service, this business provided every attorney in the office (and some staff) with a gift basket. The gift basket had all of the knickknacks you would expect from a gift basket (like the ones made famous in “The Office”!) and they also included a bottle of alcohol.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Interestingly, the court reporting service knew who was a partner and who was an associate at our firm. For all of the associates, the vendor provided cheap bottles of wine in the gift baskets. For all of the partners, they included a decent bottle of vodka. I knew I would much rather have the vodka than the cheap wine, so I hatched a plan to get a bottle. The court reporting service sent a gift basket to our New York office for a partner who worked in New Jersey. I wasn’t sure if the firm was going to bother shipping the basket to the partner, and before they could, I switched my bottle of cheap wine with the bottle of vodka! All of the associates around the office thought I was pretty badass for my antics, and since the firm didn’t award bonuses that year, none of the associates thought it was too objectionable to pull off the switcheroo. In any event, the gift baskets were a great way to thank us, and all of the associates and myself who went a year without bonuses were happy to at least have some recognition around the holidays.

When I moved to another firm, the holiday gifts provided by a vendor were a little different. This vendor gave associates gift cards with a certain amount of value inside a note thanking us for using that court reporting service the previous year. I was super happy to get anything, and the value of the gift cards was around $50 or more.

Hilariously, we discovered that some of the associates received gift cards for more value than others. In addition, some associates received gift cards to more desirable locations than others. I am not sure how the vendor made decisions about where to buy the gift cards and how much value should be on the gift cards, but oddly, I always ended up getting the most desirable gift cards with the most value! Sometimes the other associates and myself would trade gift cards so people would have cards to establishments that they actually enjoyed.

In any event, legal professionals probably never thank vendors for providing these gifts since the gifts are likely meant to express gratitude to lawyers and staff for using the services of vendors. However, let me just relate on behalf of myself and the countless attorneys and staff that I have worked with over the years that such gifts are much appreciated and mean a lot. Sometimes, lawyers are not appreciated by their bosses, and they may be bitter around the holidays. This might be because professionals did not receive a raise, a bonus, or because of some other issue. As a result, receiving a little something from a vendor can make an impact on increasing holiday cheer and morale around an office. Indeed, you could almost see everyone’s faces light up when gifts were delivered, and I wish vendors were around to witness this reaction. Naturally, vendors need to spend precious money providing such gifts, but such presents are not only beneficial for creating goodwill, they also increase the morale of an office.

Of course, I wish some vendors would be more progressive in the types of gifts they send. Indeed, partners should not necessarily get better gifts than associates, especially when associates may appreciate a gift more and will likely be able to refer additional work as they progress in their careers. Nevertheless, holiday gifts from vendors to attorneys and staff can not only help solidify relationships but can also add to the positive environment around a law firm office during the holidays.

# Law School Marks Down Grades For Single-Breasted Jackets Or If 'Bra Shows'

On the one hand, BPP Law School in London is just trying to help their students become “practice ready” with an in-depth guidebook for the vocational Bar Professional Training Course. The law is, on occasion, a stodgy profession and helping students navigate the antiquated and often arbitrary norms of barrister practice is a noble aim.

On the other hand, the school’s wildly outdated, often downright sexist fashion and conduct advice betrays a program — and, as much or more, a Training Course — that needs to take a long look at itself and its practices.

Our friends from across the pond, Legal Cheek, [bring us this story](https://www.legalcheek.com/2018/04/incredible-bptc-handbook-advises-students-to-wear-double-breasted-jackets-in-their-advocacy-exam-and-says-theyll-be-marked-down-for-wearing-kinky-boots/). Check out their story for all the ludicrous micromanagement, complete with pictures. Here are some highlights:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Ideally, men’s jackets should be DOUBLE BREASTED or 3-PIECE. If you wear a single-breasted jacket, you do need to do it up. You are not supposed to show your shirt over the stomach.

Unless you’re going yachting with Thurston Howell, no, you should not be wearing a double-breasted jacket. They may as well have suggested men wear a codpiece because that would look as ridiculous in 2018. Law moves slower than other professions, but I remain convinced most of the law’s fascination with long outdated fashion stems from aging partners unwilling to shop for a new wardrobe and willing to make [everyone around them look goofy](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/this-partner-wants-you-to-dress-up-so-you-can-be-a-tool-just-like-him/) rather than step into a store.

The handbook also dings men 2 points for “Non-black shoes.” I’m not even sure that was even a rule of accepted professional attire in the 1960s.

There are useful tidbits, of course. Students are penalized if their cell phone goes off while conducting the mock trial exercise or if they address the judge with their hands in their pockets. That’s basic and timeless etiquette. But someone from the latter half of the 20th century really needs to dig into this advice before another generation of barristers recommits the fashion sins of the past.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But as goofy as the advice for men may be, the disturbing stuff comes from the downright creepy approach to policing women’s fashion:

Too much shirt undone (women)	-1 or -2
-3 if bra shows

Shirt should be predominantly UP. Cleavage should not be on show.
Now some people will inevitably point out that this is good advice. So it is. The problem is there’s no reason to spell all this out. “Shirt should be buttoned predominantly up” or even “shirt should be worn conservatively” would accomplish everything without injecting this unnecessary sexualization into the discussion. The men’s trousers section doesn’t say, “Make sure you’ve zipped your fly” even though we all understand that this would be a major faux pas as well. Or maybe it wouldn’t… England’s got some weird rules.

At another juncture, the guide warns against “Kinky boots” (women). Easy there Cyndi Lauper. Can’t we just say women should wear “professional shoes”? Is there really a need for this trip down leather fetish lane? That’s the whole problem here, there’s a mildly lurid specificity provided for women’s attire that no one would ever expect for a male candidate. Who wrote this guidebook, and has anyone checked to see if any prostitutes have been mysteriously murdered in his proximity?

Dressing professionally requires learning a few arcane tricks of the trade, but by and large it just requires some common sense. It doesn’t require dressing like a caricature of a pre-war shadow minister and it definitely doesn’t require a lengthy account of how women should properly wear a thong. Let’s take this from scratch — show students two people wearing professional attire and say “go buy this!”

# Biglaw Partners Take On Junior Associates' Work As Holiday Gift
## Associates got a real break for Christmas!

In addition to the cheer and goodwill brought on by the holiday season, it can also be a scheduling nightmare, particularly at Biglaw firms. You see, just because lawyers want (well-earned) time away from their computers doesn’t mean the matters they’re working on suddenly go dormant. So each practice group or matter team has to devise a schedule to figure out who is responsible for responding should a deal/case/project blow up over the holidays. But what happens when everyone wants the same days off?

Well, at most firms that means some junior associate(s) holiday plans are ruined, a move generally chalked up to dues paying. But this year at the Biglaw firm of Osborne Clarke, partners took a different route. The firm — [ranked](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=42496&name=Osborne-Clarke) 139th on the 2020 Global 200 ranking and 23rd on the UK 100 — played Santa when almost an entire group requested the same time off. As [reported by our friends at Roll on Friday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-osborne-clarke-partners-do-juniors-work-christmas), partners at the firm took the bullet for junior associates and provided the necessary coverage and let the younger attorneys have the holidays free from the burdens of work:

At the top of the Christmas tree is a group of Osborne Clarke partners who have put Santa to shame, as far as their associates are concerned. “All fee-earners in the team bar one requested the full two weeks off for Christmas”, an OC lawyer told the RollOnFriday Firm of the Year 2021 Survey (which is open now, do take it below). A scheduling disaster bound to leave several lawyers disappointed. Except “the partners’ response was that they would provide all cover for our matters for that period. We were blown away”.

# Underpaying Associates Can Be Costly To Law Firms (Part II)
## Some law firms might realize substantial benefits in the long run if they simply paid attorneys more money.

Last week, I published an article discussing how [underpaying associates can be costly to law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/underpaying-associates-can-be-costly-for-law-firms/).  In case you missed the piece, I basically argued that paying attorneys low salaries [increases the amount of turnover at a firm, which can have many negative consequences](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).  I received a lot of positive feedback about this article, and I think that many people intrinsically understand the basic argument that underpaying associates can be “penny wise and dollar foolish,” as my grandfather would say.

In any event, there are a bunch of additional reasons why underpaying associates can be harmful to a firm that I did not mention in the original article.  On the off chance that my pieces convince employers to pay associates more reasonable salaries, I wanted to convey additional reasons why underpaying associates can be costly to law firms.

Every firm should think seriously about succession planning.  Although it is easy to believe that attorneys will practice law forever, lawyers ultimately retire, and firms need to groom a new crop of attorneys to fill the breach when this occurs.  It is usually in a firm’s best interest that a shop continues as a going concern even if the principal attorneys retire.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Law firms typically sign long-term leases that partners can be on the hook for even after they depart from a firm.  In addition, retiring attorneys might be entitled to receive residual payments from firms long after they leave a shop.  Furthermore, partners probably want to secure their legacy by having a law firm they spent years building continue operating long after they retire.

However, underpaying associates can interfere with succession planning.  If attorneys feel cheated by their shop, [they will not want to stick around](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/introducing-side-hustles/), and there will be no one to groom for partnership.  As such, there will be no one who can continue operating the firm when partners decide to retire, which can increase the likelihood that partners will face serious liabilities in the future.

In addition, underpaying associates makes attorneys disillusioned with their firms and less likely to go the extra mile to originate business.  It is oftentimes dangerous for law firms to rely on a few rainmakers for most of the business at a law firm.  This is because rainmakers can leave a shop on short notice, or might lose their “juice” with clients once in-house contacts retire or move to new jobs.

Almost all attorneys are capable of originating business, and the smaller the law firm, the more likely it is that associates have contacts who are able to pay a firm’s hourly rates.  There have been many times in my career [when I witnessed associates originating substantial amounts of business](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/), and the more people a firm involves in the business development process, the more likely it is that different clients will come to a firm.  However, if an attorney thinks they will soon leave a firm, or holds ill will to their employer because of a low salary, they will be less likely to attend networking events, cultivate contacts, and try to originate business.  This can affect a firm’s bottom line, and paying associates more money could improve the client base of a law firm.

Moreover, underpaying associates affects the quality of work an attorney performs.  If an associate makes a low salary, [they are more likely to view their job as a 9-to-5 gig](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/time-side-hustles/), and will be less willing to work on nights and weekends for the good of a firm.  In addition, an attorney who makes less money is more likely to do crappier work, since there are few reasons for underpaid associates to “go the extra mile” and exceed expectations.

The shoddier work performed by underpaid associates can affect relationships with clients.  Oftentimes, clients want responses as soon as possible, even if this requires an attorney to do research and communicate with them on nights and weekends.  Underpaid associates are less likely to do this, since many attorneys who make less money view freedom from work on nights and weekends as a trade-off for their lower salaries.

Certain types of matters need to be performed on an exigent basis, and underpaying associates might mean that a firm is unable to accept some emergent matters.  For instance, I once originated a case while working at a smaller law firm that required me to respond to an order to show cause on an extremely tight time frame.  I almost referred the case to another attorney, since I knew that this small shop would have trouble handling the matter on short notice.  I eventually handled the matter myself, and since the time frame for a response was so tight — and required work on nights and a weekend — I ended up doing most of the work myself.  In any case, underpaying associates can affect the types of matters a firm might handle, and this can impact the bottom line of a shop.

In the end, there are many reasons why underpaying associates can be harmful to a firm.  Of course, paying attorneys lower salaries can have some short-term benefits, and I understand why many shops underpay associates. However, some law firms might realize substantial benefits in the long run if they simply paid attorneys more money.

Every time you see an associate compensation bump, for lockstep associate compensation, firms follow suit. Whenever you see the bonuses increasing, firms will follow suit. [I]t would be surprising if we didn’t see a handful [of law firms] following suit, and potentially dozens.

— Rob Delicate, co-founder of New York recruiting firm Erica Robert Associates, in comments given on [what the upcoming financial landscape may look like](https://www.law.com/2021/10/29/more-bonuses-in-store-for-big-laws-top-performers-after-paul-weiss-move/) for Biglaw associates in the wake of Paul Weiss’s decision to offer [discretionary special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/paul-weiss-special-bonus-discretional/) to its top-performing associates, prior to year-end bonuses. “I don’t think the Am Law 50 will put themselves in a position to not compete,” said Avis Caravello, a San Francisco-based recruiter. “These firms will be looking at this hard.”

# Biglaw Retreat Uses Diverse Attorneys As Actual Tokens
## Are icebreakers really that hard?

Law firm retreats are, by design, awkward things. They try to get people from lots of different offices who don’t necessarily work together to make connections. And for more junior attorneys, there is an underlying current that the whole thing is very-important-for-your-career, without any clear blueprint on what to do to make the event the most impactful.

In the midst of all this awkwardness, it is only natural that the firm event planners would take it upon themselves to institute a little forced socialization, in the form of a corporate icebreaker.

That’s exactly what happened at [Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough](https://www.nelsonmullins.com). At a recent firm retreat, there was a networking event and BINGO cards were whipped out. Attendees were encouraged to complete certain tasks listed on the card (across, up and down, or diagonally) to win a prize.

Good in theory, but things go off the rail, as a helpful source at the firm pointed out to Above the Law:



This isn’t so much creating an opportunity for meaningful connections between attorneys of diverse backgrounds as much as it is telling minority attorneys at the firm they are only useful to white people when they can be used as a tool to win a prize. As an astute tipster noted:

Diverse attorneys reduced to bingo tokens

# The Secret Ingredient To Building An Incredible Book Of Business? Be Human.

Have you ever walked into a networking event and had someone take the stage to shush the crowd, asking everyone to please be quiet, and announce: “If I can have your attention, it is [insert your name]’s turn to give an elevator speech.”

Busting into the conversation at this point with that elevator speech that has gone through 10 drafts and a full marketing department review simply sounds flat, and drops any chance of getting back to the energizing conversation you walked into with the group. It squishes in all your expertise into a few short sentences. It’s perfectly balanced to make your practice seem both broad and deep while trying to sound personal and professional. It says, “I am flexible enough to do absolutely anything that someone who will hire me might want me to do.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There is one major issue with this approach: sounding like you do everything often ends up sounding like nothing. The overuse of an elevator speech falls flat. It keeps your personality off the table and leaves no room for the next question.

No matter how you look at it, bringing in business is not a simple exercise in sending out a higher-level resume into the universe. It is about making connections. Not just meeting people — finding the place where you intersect. It requires learning about clients, understanding their perspectives, and identifying how you are uniquely positioned to help them achieve their goals. It means knowing about them, and allowing them to know you. It’s about being present, aware, and human.

There are so many ways to dissect how to show up for business development. At the core, it requires being able to actively listen and pay attention to the nuances in the room. Business development asks you to identify what is being said and what is not being said. It is the moment when you are relaxed enough to authentically share your expertise and experience without spewing a digital resume and hoping it lands well enough for someone to hire you.

What if, instead, you walk into that bustling room and spot a few people you know, grab a drink, and find yourself an active listener in a random conversation. After a few minutes, you might shake hands with a couple people, give your name, ask a question, and join the conversation which usually has nothing to do with your resume. It might be about your favorite workout, your kids’ school project, or the latest binge-worthy television show.

As conversations advance past “Hello,” and you show up confidently as yourself, your expertise and experience will shine without ever having to recite that elevator speech or sound like a digital resume. Conversations often build in stages, including hints to the full life of the participants (think all things kids, food, hobbies, travel, and the juggling of obligations), which then gives you the space to show up and connect over the stuff that makes up your full life. Practicing patience and staying engaged through the flow of the dialogue is a trust building exercise and one that allows the relationship to start with a solid foundation. You might connect over the appetizers or the speaker, but then segue into your work and the client’s needs a whole lot faster.

Here are three simple ways to put this into action right away that will allow you to show up as you:

- Remind yourself what you love about your work. Spend three minutes writing down every single thing that energizes you about what you do, about your clients, and about your workdays. This might be substantive (what you love to nerd out on) or how you practice (consider this your leadership, who you talk to in a day, or who you get to work with). Allow this list to grow. When you are ready, pick out one or two areas that you want others to understand about you when you first meet them.
- Explore something new. Nothing connects and allows us to engage in the smaller talk (that leads to the bigger conversations) like sharing something interesting. Subscribe to a new magazine, go to a museum, watch a movie, or read a book. Anything that is of interest to you. Find one thing that sparks a conversation. For me? All things coffee and current events.
- Find one good question. I’m a big believer in finding the right three-question strategy when we dive into a customized business development plan. This starts with finding one thing to ask when walking into the room. Make it more than “what do you do,” and use it as a way to gather data and understand how ideal clients, colleagues, and referral partners are looking at this issue. The more conversations, the more information you have. We will turn this information into the base of an awesome content strategy next.
That’s the start. Arming yourself with these three strategies allows you to walk into conversations, showing up as yourself, staying present in the discussion, and connecting with clients at the human level, before launching into the next great business discussion. The rest of the strategy rolls forward from here.

# Morning Docket: 06.15.18
## * ""If the law’s not going to be improved by Congress, we have to help these young people who are drowning in student loan debt."" In the past, judges would rarely consider helping people who were bankrupted by student debt payments, but now offering their support through the court system. [[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/judges-wouldnt-consider-forgiving-crippling-student-loans-until-now-1528974001?mod=hp_lead_pos7)] * Guess which Biglaw firm helped the United States Soccer Federation secure the 2026 World Cup? If you guessed it was the firm that celebrated its bid by not raising its associates' salaries yet, you were right. Thanks, Latham! [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/14/latham-guides-u-s-to-winning-2026-world-cup-bid/)] * A judge approved AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner on Tuesday, and two days later, it's now complete. Although the Justice Department isn't filing for a stay, that's not going to stop lawyers in the Antitrust Division from appealing the judge's decision in the case, though. [[CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/14/media/att-time-warner-deal/index.html)] * As our personal-finance columnist Jordan Rothman complained of [earlier this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/you-can-lose-your-law-license-after-defaulting-on-student-loans-and-thats-messed-up/), it's messed up that you can lose your law license after defaulting on your student loans. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Marco Rubio thought it was messed up too, so they introduced a bill to stop it from happening. [[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/06/14/new-bill-would-protect-law-licenses-of-student-loan-defaulters/)] * RBG, the documentary about the life and times of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is quite literally stealing the show. The film has made $9.2 million since its release, making it the highest-grossing movie of the Sundance Film Festival. I [highly recommend](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/in-rbg-a-portrait-of-a-supreme-court-justice-whose-commitment-to-womens-rights-has-shaped-the-nation/) seeing this movie.

# Report Proves What We Already Knew: Clients Will Pay Any Fee Hike To Get Brand Name Firms
## Bellyaching aside, clients aren't quitting on the elite firms.

Clients upon hearing Cravath will charge even more.

Whenever firms start chattering about a salary increase or a bump in bonuses, the same clients come out of the woodwork to complain that they will not under any circumstances pay more to finance these “exorbitant” associate salaries. Then every single one of them falls in line and pays the newly hiked fees and the whole legal world keeps on spinning.

At least that’s what happens at the elite firms. The mid-tier firms — which increasingly means “the Am Law 51-100” — don’t necessarily have that luxury. For these firms trying to keep up with the big dogs in the drive for talent, it’s harder to pass the cost onto the client, resulting in thinner margins and stressing the firm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This has long been the conventional wisdom among legal industry observers, but [the new Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group Report](https://www.privatebank.citibank.com/ivc/docs/2019CitiHildebrandtClientAdvisory.pdf) went out and actually gathered some hard data to see if our gut instincts are correct. It turns out… they are.

Despite past predictions that law firms would not be able to raise rates, our analysis demonstrated that firms did not sacrifice work as they increased their rates. Nor did the firms who saw the greatest growth in demand achieve this through slowing down rate increases. Rather, demand growth was determined more so by brand than by price. In our view, brand strength and product focus are among the most highly rewarded traits of a law firm in today’s market. In recent years, much of the demand growth has come from high value work—work that is typically undertaken by firms who enjoy a strong brand, and can command high rates. Firms who have established themselves as the go-to practice in a market—whether that be by industry, practice or region—have been able to increase demand for their services while also charging higher rates.

There’s an old saw, “no in-house lawyer loses their job by hiring Cravath.” You can replace Cravath with any of the other top-tier firms, but the point is clients aren’t going to balk at rate increases from firms they trust with high-stakes engagements. For now, those firms will keep taking advantage of this elasticity. For everyone else, this probably increases the pressure to merge or form strategic regional alignments with other firms. That’s why the report is convinced that consolidation is going to continue in a big way into 2019.

One more point about the 2019 outlook worth noting:

Geographic growth opportunities. In Citi’s 2018 Law Firm Leaders Survey (see Chart 4), respondents once again singled out New York as the strongest opportunity over the next two years, followed by London—although many cite the challenges of attracting talent and work in these two highly competitive markets.

I wonder why it’s so hard to attract talent to New York? Could it be the way the market’s paying matching salaries to attorneys living in frigging Dallas? Texas attorneys offer me no end of flak for this take, but the reason New York attorneys should be making more has nothing to do with “how hard they work” and everything to do with maintaining the talent flow to the markets that require the best attorneys to exploit the best growth opportunities.

As Michael Corleone would say, “It’s not personal, Sonny, it’s strictly business.”

# Ex-Biglaw Partner Arrested, Accused Of Cyberstalking Former Colleagues
## The messages he allegedly sent range from racist to sexist to physically threatening.

It’s not every day that an ex-Biglaw partner is arrested on federal cyberstalking charges and accused of launching a “campaign of harassment, intimidation, and threats” against his former partners, but here we are.

Willie Dennis, 59, a former corporate partner at K&L Gates, was arrested last week in the Dominican Republic after allegedly sending an untold number of “harassing, threatening, and intimidating emails and text messages” to a number of people at the firm over the course of more than 18 months. The indictment against Dennis was unsealed this past Friday.

Dennis, who is Black, was let go in May 2019, and he did not part ways amicably with the firm. In 2020, he filed suit against K&L Gates, accusing the firm of discriminating against his fellow Black partners and also mounting claims that he was fired after attempting to discuss the firm’s alleged “culture of sexual misconduct.” Per the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/11/19/former-kl-gates-partner-arrested-on-cyberstalking-charges-405-94950/), that suit is now in arbitration.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ex-k-l-gates-partner-charged-with-cyberstalking-former-partners) has additional details on the messages Dennis allegedly sent:

The firm said during an 18-month period after his departure in May 2019 he sent thousands of emails, text messages, faxes and voicemails to firm lawyers that were intended to “harass, humiliate, intimidate, or stoke fear” in the recipients.

The messages included sexist, racist, anti-Semitic and physically threatening statements, the firm said. The firm said he told a Jewish lawyer to “start the ovens,” referred to an Asian-American lawyer as “Wuhan,” and also used racial epithets to refer to other Black lawyers.

Lovely.

Dennis faces four counts of cyberstalking, and up to a 20-year prison sentence.
