# Can The Accounting Firms Unseat Biglaw?
## Times are changing. Are law firms in trouble?

A hot conversation started around the legal industry — an industry where the bar for the term “hot” is apparently pretty low — is if and when the Big 4 accounting firms will force their way into the American legal market. They have [some built-in advantages](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/twilight-of-the-law-firms-the-big-4-are-poised-to-conquer-the-legal-landscape/), especially when it comes to pre-existing relationships they can leverage into legal business. They’ve [made strides in Asia](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/asia-becomes-ground-zero-in-big-4-effort-to-take-over-the-legal-market/) and have started — haltingly — to make forays into the American market.

Of course, the accounting firms are prevented by existing ethical provisions from practicing law in U.S. jurisdictions. But how long will those rules hold up when the Big 4 decide to start throwing their weight around? Today, the behemoth entities set up “strategic partnerships” with existing law firms, agreeing to send their stockpiles of business to a partner firm. All the happy talk about “synergy” rests atop the idea of a proof of concept test run right under our noses.

Epstein Becker Green is the most recent strategic partner, joining up with Deloitte, but it’s just the latest in the line. From [Bloomberg Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/big-four-big-law-alliance-could-spur-more-partnerships):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This is not the first “strategic alliance” pairing a law firm with a Big Four firm. Last June, immigration law firm called Berry Appleman & Leiden entered into an alliance with the British arm of Deloitte, allowing the firm access to Deloitte’s worldwide customer base.

Three months later, PwC and the immigration firm Fragomen announced a partnership to provide tax and immigration services to clients and their employees.

[[Adam Smith Esq.’s](https://adamsmithesq.com) Bruce] MacEwen said deals like this are indicative of the fast changing nature of legal work as it expands outside the scope of traditional legal practices.

With a broad network of client relationships and decades upon decades of goodwill built up in other professional service sectors, the Big 4 appear an existential threat to a lot of law firms out there. Indeed, if the accounting firms entered full-fledged legal practice, they’d instantly be among the largest firms in the world. On the other hand, some industry insiders think size might not be a virtue. With competing stakeholders across other service sectors, they think a Big 4 legal practice would buckle under its own weight and fall behind more nimble, dedicated law firms.

It’s impossible to say how this will all turn out, but at this point, law firms don’t seem worried about the Big 4.

[Chuck Baldwin, a managing director with Ogletree Deakins] said he’s not concerned that Ogletree will be affected, as the firm has 950 lawyers located in 53 offices throughout the U.S. as well as international lawyers.

“We still feel really good about our competitive position,” he said. “For them to compete with us, they’d have to open 30 other offices in the U.S. alone.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Fair enough. Yet, the above quote reminds me of the conclusion of Arthur C. Clarke’s short story, Rescue Party. At the end of the tale of an advanced alien civilization taking pity on primitive humanity with our quaint nuclear-age technology:

“I wonder what they’ll be like?” he mused. “Will they be nothing but wonderful engineers, with no art or philosophy? They’re going to have such a surprise when Orostron reaches them—I expect it will be rather a blow to their pride. It’s funny how all isolated races think they’re the only people in the Universe. But they should be grateful to us; we’re going to save them a good many hundred years of travel.”
…
“Something tells me they’ll be very determined people,” he added. “We had better be polite to them. After all, we only outnumber them about a thousand million to one.”

Rugon laughed at his captain’s little joke.

Twenty years afterward, the remark didn’t seem funny.

Another day, another ranking for lawyers to ogle in a search for meaning as they attempt to get through the day’s billables during a pandemic. Despite all the unrest and change in the world thanks to COVID-19, this is still the life of a Biglaw attorney, always on the hunt for confirmation that their firm is the best firm, the one that’s hitting all of its essential metrics year after year. If that sounds like you (and you might as well admit it, it probably does), then you should check out the latest offering from the American Lawyer, the annual A-List ranking.

Are you somehow unfamiliar with this ranking? Here are all of the metrics that it measures to determine which Biglaw firms are the best of the best:

The A-List recognizes firms based on a combination of factors, both financial and cultural: revenue per lawyer, pro bono commitment, associate satisfaction, racial diversity and gender diversity (the percentage of equity partners who are women), with RPL and pro bono given double weight. Each metric measures Am Law 200 firms’ relative performance—a firm’s score in a given category is based on its ranking among all 200 firms. Each category, as well as the overall score, is based on a 100-point scale.

Have you spent the last few weeks agonizing over if your firm will increase your salary? If you work at Dechert, fret no longer!

And with $1,288,692,000 in gross revenue last year, the firm can definitely afford sharing the wealth with their employees.

Here are the bonuses:



Those who managed to bill 2200 client billable hours are eligible for an additional 30% above the year-end bonus. If that weren’t enough, the folks that billed 2400 and over are eligible for an additional 40%! Who needs Netflix when you have paystubs like that!

Oh, are you wondering about salary? Well, they matched that too.



Congrats on making the big bucks!

We like hearing about bonuses almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# A&O Shearman To Move Into Shearman’s New York Office Space Post-Merger
## The legacy firm’s NYC office is beautiful, so this isn’t a shocking decision.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

One of the exciting aspects of our combination is bringing our people together into a single office in each jurisdiction where we operate. [This approach] will accelerate our integration, foster collaboration and create powerful financial synergies on the real estate side.

— a statement from A&O Shearman on the soon-to-be combined firm’s decision to [take over](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/a-o-shearman-to-adopt-shearman-space-in-nyc-move-in-london) Shearman & Sterling’s [recently renovated office in New York](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/shearman-sterlings-revamped-new-york-headquarters-sets-new-bar-for-legal-workplaces/) and occupy Allen & Overy’s current office in London before moving to a new office in 2027. “Whether we will be in the legacy Allen & Overy or legacy Shearman & Sterling space—or entirely new space—will vary by location,” the firm said. The firm’s goal is to finish all moves as soon as possible.

# Equal Pay Pioneer Reflects On What It’s Like To Sue A Biglaw Firm
## Kerrie Campbell thinks it's everyone's responsibility to challenge blatant inequality.

Kerrie Campbell

Even if you don’t remember the name [Kerrie Campbell](https://www.kcamlaw.com/about/), chances are you’ve read a story ([or two or three](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kerrie-campbell/)) about her. She is the former Chadbourne & Parke partner who took the world of Biglaw by storm when [she sued her firm over a gender pay gap](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/).

Styled as a purported class action, the case took on a total of three named plaintiffs [before it was settled](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-to-pay-over-3-million-to-settle-pay-discrimination-case/). Chadbourne, the firm Campbell sued, no longer exists — it was swallowed up [in a merger with Norton Rose,](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/biglaw-merger-means-the-end-of-chadbourne-parke/) but her experience taking on some of the best in the legal profession is illuminating. I recently had the opportunity to speak with Campbell, and she was happy to shine the light on what it is like to call out a Biglaw firm in court.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Initially, I wanted to find out from Campbell what is was like the moment she realized she believed she was being paid less than her male counterparts. Campbell said she first had an inkling something was wrong with her compensation way back in her first year as a lateral partner. The firm circulated a year-end ranking of partner compensation — revealing the pecking order as it were — and given the amount of work she’d been billing she just knew something was wrong — a “shocking revelation” was how Campbell characterized it. And it was a real eye opening moment for Campbell as a lateral partner with 30 years of Biglaw experience and a solid book of business.

Campbell said she made the decision to sue her former firm when she realized merely leaving the firm or just complaining about it would never be enough to move the needle. Year after year [studies and reports](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/theres-a-27-percent-global-gender-pay-gap-for-equity-partners/) detailing the [gender pay gap](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/gender-pay-gap/) in the legal industry are published but little changes; Campbell asked herself “what am I going to do about it?” That question forced Campbell’s hand, in a manner of speaking, and she knew she had little choice but to file a lawsuit against her firm.

As one might imagine, the reality of litigating against a giant law firm is stressful — and even seasoned litigators noted how contentious this suit was. As a trial lawyer herself, Campbell said she wasn’t surprised at the way the suit went down. She says the way defendants in discrimination cases tend to react to a lawsuit is largely predictable and that was something she was ready for. But the way that her local professional community reacted to the lawsuit was a little surprising. Campbell said that, for the most part, professional colleagues in D.C. were hesitant to discuss, or even acknowledge, the case while it was ongoing. But interestingly, the converse was also true. People she’d never met from around the country reached out to Campbell expressing their support and letting her know they were rooting for her. Through it all Campbell says she has no regrets about filing the lawsuit.

Campbell believes there is more than just a culture of secrecy regarding the inner working of firms — including partner compensation — that allows a gender pay gap to exist. In fact, she says there is a “laundry list” of factors that keep it alive. One of the biggest issues she identifies is the one/two punch of complacency and silence. There is so much at risk for women at law firms, and they are so busy growing their own practice, they have little time to worry about the broader issue of a gender pay gap. But Campbell says acceptance of the status quo is unacceptable, and women need to speak up, support those who do, and challenge blatant inequality.

There are, however, structural barriers that sometimes prevent women from openly challenging the existing system. One of the biggest issues Campbell sees on that front is the existence of mandatory arbitration clauses — in employment or partnership agreements. This often means that even if a women is courageous enough to bring the issue to her employer’s attention, no one knows about it and there is no public debate (or accountability) about the firm’s practices. Campbell is a litigator at heart, and she believes access to courts (and the accompanying judicial scrutiny) is key for real change.

These days Campbell has left the world of Biglaw behind. She’s building [her own firm](https://www.kcamlaw.com/about/) and is excited to represent clients in a variety of matters. One of the most interesting representations she has is working with the legal defense fund for Time’s Up!, and she continues to be a passionate advocate for gender equality in the workplace. This seems like the perfect next chapter for an equal pay pioneer.

Today brings us unfortunate news from Japan, where a Freshfields attorney was killed in an avalanche during a backcountry ski trip. [Barnaby Levy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barnaby-levy-b1b48090?originalSubdomain=hk), 34, was a senior associate with firm who advised corporations and financial institutions throughout the Asia-Pacific region on transactional tax issues.

The [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3048729/british-lawyer-who-worked-hong-kong-dies-japan-avalanche) has additional information:

Levy was backcountry skiing with his brother and a local guide on the southern flank of 703-metre-high Mount Pinneshiri in the town of Nakatombetsu, in northwest Hokkaido, when the avalanche struck around 11:30am on Saturday.

Local emergency services responded to reports that a group had been caught in an avalanche and scrambled a helicopter to recover Levy from the mountainside and transfer him to a nearby hospital, national broadcaster NHK reported. Levy was pronounced dead a short while after being admitted.

Levy’s brother and the guide both survived. An avalanche warning for Mount Pinneshiri had been issued due to “unseasonably warm winter conditions,” but Levy and his brother went on an off-piste ski route nonetheless. According to local media, now an investigation has been opened into why they went ahead with those plans.

The firm released the following statement upon receiving news of the senior associate’s death: “Barnaby Levy was a wonderful colleague, friend and lawyer. We are shocked and saddened by this news and he will be greatly missed. Our hearts go out to his family and many friends at this difficult time.”

We here at Above the Law extend our condolences to Barnaby Levy’s family, friends, and colleagues during these trying times.

# The Comprehensive Partner's Guide To Associate Raises

You’ve made partner. Congratulations. All your hard work has finally paid off.

But now all those annoying friends you used to have before you made the leap are clamoring for a raise. Somewhere in the back of your head you remember believing that associate raises were “good,” but that was before those raises came out of your paycheck. And now the rest of the partnership is turning to you for your thoughts on the spate of raises. What are you going to tell them?

Because we love you, we’ve created a handy cheatsheet to guide you through this process. If your firm is yet to raise salaries, be sure to take this to your next meeting.

# Summer Associate Programs — And Pay — Cut Short Thanks To Coronavirus
## Sorry, law students. At this point, be thankful you still have jobs.

It was just one week ago that many a Biglaw firm seemed confident that their summer associate programs would [go forward as originally planned](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/could-coronavirus-play-a-hand-in-biglaw-firms-canceling-summer-associate-programs/), despite the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Perhaps there would be fewer festive outings and extravagant meals due to social distancing guidance, but some truly believed that things would be “just fine.” Others were more realistic, embracing the [possibility of remote work](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firms-cant-seem-to-decide-what-theyre-going-to-do-with-summer-associate-programs/) and even givng credence to delayed start dates. Now that firms have started announcing salary reductions, furloughs, and layoffs, the game has changed.

Which firms have decided to start their summer programs late — and pay their law student employees less?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
First up is Cooley, which according to sources recently decided to cut its 10-week summer associate program back by four weeks. Law students will begin their work at the firm on June 15, and end their summers on July 24, as previously scheduled. We’re told that in addition to the firm’s deferred start date, law students’ paychecks will also come up a little short. Instead of receiving pay for the 10 weeks they were supposed to be working as detailed in their offer letters, Cooley summers will only receive pay for the length of their shortened programs.

Compare this to what’s going on at Sidley, where tipsters say summers will be starting their programs later than expected, on June 1, although the firm isn’t quite clear yet on how the program will operate (i.e., whether it will all remote or whether modifications will be made so in-person meetings can occur). Regardless of any possible abbreviated program length, we’ve heard that Sidley summers will be paid for the number of weeks indicated in their offer letters.

As more firms make strategic financial moves in the weeks to come, we suspect we’ll hear more about the fate of their summer associate programs. We sincerely hope that law students will receive the experiences — and pay — they were expecting to receive, but please bear in mind that the unexpected circumstances brought about the coronavirus outbreak could very well put an end to summer associate programs at some firms, so be thankful your job is still waiting for you.

Is your firm planning to hold its summer associate program as planned, despite coronavirus concerns? Please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Coronavirus%20Summer%20Associate%20Program) (subject line: “Coronavirus Summer Associate Program”) and let us know. Stay safe.

# The Largest Law Firm In The United States
## There's a new champion when it comes to law firm headcount.

‘Your firm is HUGE!’

Ever since the recession hit, law schools have enrolled and graduated fewer and fewer students, and the legal profession as a whole took a major hit, having lost about 500,000 to 600,000 jobs that may never return. But despite the layoffs en masse that were a toll of the recession, the biggest of Biglaw firms are still employing thousands and thousands of attorneys — and they’ve been quickly growing in size.

But which U.S. Biglaw firm is the biggest of them all? [Law 360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1032583/law360-reveals-400-largest-us-firms) (sub. req.) can help us answer that question. Last night, the website released its master list of the top 400 law firms in the U.S. by headcount, and revealed that Jones Day, President Donald Trump’s go-to law firm, is [no longer the largest firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/whats-the-biggest-law-firm-in-the-country/) in the country. Not only did Jones Day lose 33 spots in [Above the Law’s 2018 Power 100](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firm-rankings/top-law-firms/) rankings, but the firm was bounced down to fourth place in the latest Law360 400 rankings — SAD!

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The firm that now resides in the No. 1 spot is Kirkland & Ellis, which expanded its attorney headcount in America by about 13 percent in 2017. Kirkland is now the largest law firm to ever take the top spot in the Law360 400 ranking.

Below, you’ll find a list of the Top 10 largest law firms in the country by headcount:

1. Kirkland & Ellis: 1,854 U.S. attorneys
2. Latham & Watkins: 1,744 U.S. attorneys
3. Greenberg Traurig: 1,725 U.S. attorneys
4. Jones Day: 1,701 U.S. attorneys

# Thoughts From A Biglaw Firm's Leader On Mandatory COVID Vaccination
## To encourage or require vaccination, that is the question at this Biglaw firm.

I would hope that if the firm did what it needs to do to encourage our people—because we share a commitment to the firm and each other—that they would do that once it’s generally available and absolutely safe and there’s no other issues.

I hope we don’t get there. I think we can do it from an encouragement point of view.

— Winston & Strawn chairman [Thomas Fitzgerald](https://www.winston.com/en/who-we-are/professionals/fitzgerald-thomas-p.html), in comments given about [encouraging employees to receive COVID-19 vaccinations](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/25/dla-piper-winston-strawn-leaders-will-encourage-vaccines-for-returning-employees/), during a roundtable discussion on the future of the law firm office. Although he’d prefer encouragement to be enough, Fitzgerald said he’s still not ruling out mandating vaccination for a return to the office.

If you haven’t already done so, we recommend that you read [this article](http://www.abanet.org/journal/redesign/11as.html) (and not just ’cause we’re featured in it). It’s entitled Scuttlebutt Central, by Stephanie Francis Ward, and it’s from the November 2006 issue of the [ABA Journal](http://www.abanet.org/journal/redesign/home.html).
The piece is a fun and interesting read; check it out for yourself. We’ll just comment on one passage that caught our eye:

A Washington, D.C., corporate associate who asked to remain anonymous admits to reading legal gossip blogs daily — a habit he says isn’t unusual among his peers.

“There’s an allure of some of these stories — like the summer associate in New York who took off her clothes and jumped into the Hudson River — so there’s sort of a universal appeal,” he says.

Allow us to supplement the record. According to [various](http://ourtakeonwake.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_ourtakeonwake_archive.html) [reports](http://cublawg.blogspot.com/2005/06/summer-associates.html), the summer associate in question was at the venerable firm of [Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton](http://www.cgsh.com/). The incident took place at a charity benefit held at the [Chelsea Piers](http://www.chelseapiers.com/) sports and entertainment complex. It turned out to be a fairly big deal because the SA had to be fished out of the river (either by the Coast Guard or an NYPD police boat).
We’re not sure if she ended up getting an offer. But given what a summer associate has to do NOT to get an offer — e.g., first- or second-degree murder (manslaughter, no big deal) — we wouldn’t be surprised if she did.
More juicy details [here](http://ourtakeonwake.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_ourtakeonwake_archive.html) and [here](http://cublawg.blogspot.com/2005/06/summer-associates.html).

# What Lawyers Need To Know About Infrastructure And Construction Projects
## PLI’s one-day program is ideal for anyone working in the construction and infrastructure space.

In recent years, the U.S. has seen an increased demand for more and better infrastructure. The uptick in interest in these kinds of projects is falling squarely on the shoulders of the construction industry and its lawyers.

In order to meet the rising demand and remain competitive in the national legal market, construction lawyers need to hone their expertise in infrastructure regulation, funding, and process. Without this knowledge, developers and contractors will struggle to succeed on large infrastructure projects.    

PLI is offering a one-day program, [Construction Projects and Infrastructure 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/construction-projects-and-infrastructure?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), which features distinguished Program Chairs Josh M. Leavitt and Heidi Hennig Rowe, who will share their expertise on successful contracting, recent financing, and project management strategies in the construction and development space. The panel will also help explain to practitioners the heightened interest of lawmakers in the construction and engineering sectors, the important (and often unique) aspects of government contracts, and more.

Additional topics to be covered include:

- Key points of the recently passed Infrastructure Bill, Airport development, and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)
- Project and public finance techniques including TIFIA and RRIF programs
- How to utilize meaningful stakeholders support and smart partner selection
- An in-depth explanation of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)-based and other government contracts
- How to select the most effective delivery system 
- How to align project risks with financing risks
- Successful strategies for large contract projects
PLI’s program is ideal for anyone working in the construction and infrastructure space, including outside counsel, in-house attorneys, construction contract procurement professionals, and government agency officers. A background in federal construction contracts procurement, and real estate development will be beneficial.

# Did A Biglaw Partner Get Forced Out For Slapping An Associate When She Rejected His Advances?
## This is an outrageous story.

The [#metoo](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/metoo/) sexual harassment scandals keep piling up, and the legal industry — always a little bit late, but not one to abandon trends entirely — has gotten onboard. The latest scandal, [reported as a blind item in RollOnFriday](http://www.rollonfriday.com/TheNews/EuropeNews/tabid/58/Id/5611/fromTab/36/currentIndex/0/Default.aspx), involves allegations against a London-based partner at a Magic Circle firm forced out of his firm following a jaw-dropping incident.

Read the details below then circle back for the outrage:

A Magic Circle partner was forced to quit his firm after he slapped an associate because she rejected his sexual advances.

The man, who is based in London and who RollOnFriday shall name ‘Slappo’, was rejected by his new firm when it found out, but then eventually found a new job at a third firm.

Last year he propositioned a junior female lawyer in his team. When she refused to succumb to his charms, said multiple sources, he slapped her in the face. She reported the matter to the firm which, after an investigation last Autumn, asked him to leave the partnership.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ya think? Hell, making unwanted sexual advances on a subordinate is probably more than enough — or should be more than enough — to lead to Slappo’s ouster from the firm. But raising the stakes of the altercation to the level of physical f**king violence? That is beyond “inappropriate.” That’s assault.

According to RollOnFriday, Slappo apparently found work at another firm on his way out the door. [In a familiar tale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/timesup-for-this-biglaw-partner-who-got-a-new-gig-after-being-quietly-pushed-out-of-his-old-firm/), the offer was withdrawn once the details of the incident were revealed to the new firm. But don’t bother to shed any tears for Slappo, he supposedly found work at a third firm. Yes, sources report this third firm was made aware of the circumstances leading to Slappo’s departure from the original Magic Circle firm. But, really, what are a few slaps around the office when you’ve got someone who can make it rain?

# Book Of Business: A New Podcast From Above The Law

If you’re interested in the world of large law firms — and if you’re reading Above the Law, you probably are — then we have the podcast for you.

Following up on the success of our first podcast, [Thinking Like A Lawyer](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/), we’ve decided to launch a second. It’s called [Book of Business](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/), brought to you by ATL and our friends at [Kinney Recruiting](http://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/).

Book of Business is hosted by myself and veteran legal recruiter Robert Kinney, Founder and President of Kinney Recruiting (sponsor of the podcast). In each episode, Robert and I will do three things. First, we’ll analyze a recent notable lateral move or collection of moves, explaining their significance for the Biglaw world. Second, we’ll take an in-depth look at a specific legal market, discussing what it’s like to practice in that market, including its pros and cons. Finally, we’ll offer career advice for the audience of Book of Business — current and aspiring partners at leading law firms.

In the [first episode](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/discussions-about-the-merger-between-andrews-kurth-and-hunton-williams-episode-1), we discuss [lateral moves](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/will-partner-poaching-stop-this-rumored-biglaw-merger-in-its-tracks/) related to the [recent merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-merger-creates-new-1000-lawyer-firm/) between Andrews Kurth and Hunton & Williams; conduct a market snapshot of New York, the biggest Biglaw market; and offer advice to lawyers on the important topic of negotiating lateral offers.

Check out Book of Business via the embed or links below, and subscribe to future episodes through your podcast purveyor of choice. Enjoy!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

What do you think of that five-page memo on your desk?

Pick it up.  Flip through it.  Send back an email:  “This looks okay to me.”

Change tacks.

Decide that there’s a typo in that five-page memo.

Pick up the memo.  Read it.  Search for the typo.

You didn’t find the typo.  Read the memo again, really looking for the typo.

Aha!  It’s right there, in the footnote on page four.

That’s the difference between skimming and focusing.

Try this experiment again.

Decide that the memo has a substantive error in it.  Read the memo with that thought in mind.

You didn’t find the substantive error.

So slow down.  Read the memo again.  Concentrate.  Think about the implications of every sentence.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Aha!  The substantive error is right there, in the third paragraph.  (It’s remarkable you didn’t catch this the last time around.)

Send your responsive email:  “The memo generally looks okay, but I have a question about the third paragraph.  We say . . . .  Also, note that there’s a typo on the second line of the footnote on page four.”

How do you suppose the recipient of that email — the boss or the partner — reacts?

I frankly think that the first type of thinking — not really thinking about things at all, but merely passing your eyes over stuff — is routine, in law, and business, and just about everywhere else.  After all, it’s easy not to think about things.  And, as to most stuff that crosses your desk, why should you think about it, anyway?  Not only that, but most things don’t deserve serious thought.

On the other hand, if you’d like to develop a reputation as a competent person, you’ll choose to think seriously about stuff.  

If you’re the one person in the crowd who catches errors, then who’s the boss likely to rely on next time?

If you’re the associate who makes contributions, and the other associates blow things off — figuring that the partner prepared the draft, so it’s probably fine — who will the partner go to for projects that count?

Perhaps it’s not worthwhile to think hard about every item that crosses your desk; that really depends on how many things, of what importance, are crossing your desk.

But if you improve your joint’s collective work product, while other people type back that drafts “look okay to them,” you’ll soon stand out from the crowd.

It would help, naturally, if you were very smart. 

But it would suffice if you simply paid attention — really paid attention — to projects that came your way.

For more than 18 months now, lawyers and staff members have largely worked from home thanks to the pandemic. But with law firms now announcing (and postponing and then delaying) their offce reentry plans, the prospect of a commute looms large. And with a commute comes the expectation that other business travel may soon be expected as well.

With that in mind, it got us wondering: will attorneys truly be ready for more business travel once the new year rolls around?

We polled attorneys and staff members running the professional gamut across Biglaw firms, small firms, in-house legal departments, and state and federal government offices to find out what lies ahead for the legal workforce in the wake of the pandemic. The largest group of respondents to our survey were law firm partners and counsel (36.25%), followed by law firm associates (26.25%), and general counsel/in-house counsel (18.75%). Are lawyers ready to travel for business again? In true lawyerly fashion, it depends.

The largest cohort of our survey respondents (27.85%) reported that they are planning moderately less travel in 2022 compared with their travel plans from before the pandemic, with 20.25% reporting that they will be doing far less travel. These responses were expected; after all, we’re still in a pandemic. Now, let’s get down to the nitty gritty.

How do your business travel plans for internal meetings in 2022 compare with those from before the pandemic?



The largest cohort of respondents (27.12%) reported that they are planning far less travel for internal meetings in 2022 compared with their travel plans from before the pandemic. Nothing unexpected here, folks.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The largest cohort of respondents (30.43%) reported that they believe their amount of planned business travel for 2022 is the right amount. Who are these people who want to travel a lot more? Maybe the secret lies within the responses to our next survey question.

How important do you believe business travel will be to business development and client satisfaction?



Aha, here we go. The largest cohort of respondents (32.35%) reported that business travel is somewhat important to business development and client satisfaction. This thinking leads us to the reason why many law firms are trying to reopen before 2021 is over.

How important do you believe business travel will be to law firm morale, mentorship, and internal networking?



Over one third of respondents (36.76%) reported that they believed business travel is somewhat important to law firm morale, mentorship, and internal networking. But just saying, many associates value the health and safety of their families more than their law firm networking opportunities.

When asked to share their general thoughts on business travel in the future, our survey respondents really spoke their minds and some common themes emerged. Here are some select responses that we thought would really resonate with others.

- “The pandemic has demonstrated that plenty of business can be conducted just as easily and successfully virtually. As much as I enjoy seeing people in person, I am comfortable with NOT attending ANY in person conferences before 2023 (and I’ll reconsider that next summer).”
- “The pandemic shattered old models. From court hearings to meetings, it’s really a new (better) world. We don’t need to burn so much jet fuel and head downtown (or out of town) for every court appearance or meeting. Zoom works just fine.”
- “We’ve proven excessive business travel is not necessary for success. We owe it to our own health and well-being, and that of our planet, not to rush back to what we used to consider ‘normal.’ It never was, or at least never should have been.”
- “Remote depos work, remote meetings work. Business travel, for the most part, is a waste of time and resources.”
As it turns out, not everyone wants to remain at home forever. Here are some thoughts from other survey respondents who wish things could go back to the way they were before the pandemic.

- “We need to all get vaccinated and become comfortable meeting in person again. Meeting in person facilitates the exchange of useful information and ideas – which our world desperately needs more of right now – better than any videoconferencing platform.”
- “I wish business travel would return to pre-pandemic levels, but I do not think that will happen.”
- “Lawyers are incredibly risk averse and do not understand data and numbers. Being fully vaccinated and understanding how good the data is for those who are vaccinated, I plan to take advantage of that and get in front of clients more often than other attorneys.”
So there you have it. Are lawyers ready for business travel again? Yes! But also, no. As with all things having to do with COVID-19, plans for any travel are likely subject to some amount of change, so be sure to prepare yourselves for all the possibilities that go hand in hand with office life — because it’s going to start happening again, and sooner than you may like.

Even multinational law firms with 1500+ attorneys in nine countries have to deal with the vagaries of the human condition. Don’t believe me? Take a look at an unfortunate incident taking place in the Birmingham, UK, location of Gowling WLG.

Building management posted the following[ notice](https://www.rollonfriday.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/poo%20sign.jpg) — as [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/excloosive-gowling-wlg-told-address-toilet-abuse) Roll on Friday — asking, nay, begging that “toilet abuse” on the floors occupied by the firm cease immediately.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

While the definition of “toilet abuse” is left in the minds of the beholder (and the firm has not commented on the incident(s)), it is pretty clear that whatever’s going on is both gross and unacceptable. Let’s just hope they can dispose of the matter quickly.

# Legal Sector Lost 4K+ Jobs In January, But There's No Need To Worry
## The legal job market is 'cyclical,' says one top recruiter, and today's lob losses will turn into tomorrow's job gains.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The demand for legal services in different practice areas is cyclical. I have no doubt that the demand for legal services will continue to climb. The practices touched by that demand will change overtime. As the type of legal services needed by businesses change there will be a transition, reflected as job losses in some practices followed by hiring in other practices, as firms adjust their talent mix to service their clients.

— [David Maurer](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/david-maurer?byconsultantorauthor=david-maurer), executive director for legal search and recruiting firm Major Lindsey & Africa’s partner practice group, in comments given to [Law360 Pulse](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1789356/us-legal-sector-drops-4-400-jobs-in-january), concerning the Labor Department’s latest report showing that the U.S. legal sector lost 4,400 jobs in January. Maurer went on to note that compared to the same time frame last year, he’d seen an increase in requests for lawyers over the last three months, ending January 31.

In unexpected news to legal nerds everywhere, there has been a major shakeup in the makeup of Kirkland & Ellis over the Second Amendment. Paul Clement’s work moves [just have a way of being newsworthy](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/), don’t they?

""Paul and Erin have been valued colleagues,” said Jon A. Ballis, Chairman of Kirkland’s Executive Committee. “We wish them the best of luck in the future and we look forward to collaborating with them in the future in matters not involving the Second Amendment.”

That not doing it? Try these on for size. This is like:

- Wu-Tang becoming something to mess with.
- Left Twix tasting different from Right Twix.
- The right to gun ownership being in relationship to the requirements of a well-regulated militia.

[Joe has made the point in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/paul-weiss-touts-anti-death-penalty-reputation-so-why-is-the-firm-helping-oklahoma-kill-a-man/) that the “everyone deserves a lawyer” argument is going out of vogue. Sure, everybody wants to be filthy rich — [like so filthy rich you have to put shoe coverings on before you walk about the house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKEMGr07BMk) — but in a woke culture like ours, firms need to consider their branding in addition to their practice. Being associated with school shootings, far beyond being unethical, may impact the bottom line, after all! While it’s anyone’s guess if this falling out was fundamentally about morals or money, it definitely looks like Kirkland decided making bazillions doing private equity is preferable to constantly getting written up in the media as the NRA Hypebeasts trying to make murdering schoolchildren easier.

# Joshua Schiller Case Dropped, But Remains Case Study For Law Firms

Joshua Schiller’s [January arrest on domestic violence charges](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/biglaw-partner-arrested-on-domestic-violence-charge/) seemed destined to be dropped. Before the news even got out, Schiller’s wife was already saying the whole thing was a misunderstanding and it’s difficult to bring a case when the alleged victim is saying nothing happened. Add in a police report that offered little in the way of allegations of serious injury and it was highly unlikely that prosecutors would proceed with charges.

Which is exactly what ended up happening.

Schiller’s attorneys released this statement:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“We are clearly pleased, though not surprised, by the decision to drop the charge in light of the facts and circumstances. The district attorney dismissed the case after a thorough review in the interests of justice because there was no case to prove. As we’ve stated from the beginning, there was no physical harm or instance of domestic violence in this case. Mr. and Ms. Schiller are glad to put this behind them.”

Schiller had already cleared the firm’s internal investigation conducted by [Danya Perry](https://www.perryguha.com/e-danya-perry) of Perry Guha that found no evidence of physical abuse.

But as this case closes, it should remain a case study for how firms deal with abuse allegations against partners. As lawyers, firms don’t want to prejudge a defendant. Yet, as businesses, firms have obligations to employees and clients to treat these allegations seriously. Honoring both impulses is difficult.

In this case, the firm quickly released this statement back in January:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Firm has been made aware of recent events related to our partner, Josh Schiller. While we have been informed by him and his wife that this was a misunderstanding, the firm will be conducting its own review to better understand what happened. While that review is ongoing, Josh has asked for a leave of absence to focus on his family, and we have agreed to give him this time.

Producing a timely official response announcing an independent inquiry is important. It assures everyone that the firm takes the allegations seriously and recognizes that the high burden of proof that applies to the criminal justice system is not necessarily the standard that applies to the duty of representing the firm. An ideal response would include a more direct condemnation of abuse as a general matter up to and including a strong statement that it has no place within the firm. This statement also put the entire ownership of Schiller’s leave on him, phrasing it as his request that the firm accepted. A better response for future firms in this situation would be to announce that the partner was put on leave by the firm or, at best, that the partner and firm mutually agreed to a leave.

Hiring outside counsel to conduct the investigation was another sound decision. Perry is a prominent white collar litigator with a background at the SDNY U.S. Attorney’s Office as Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division. That’s exactly the resume a firm should seek out in conducting an internal review.

Some controversy emerged around this matter when news broke that Schiller was continuing to circulate conflict checks, suggesting he never stopped generating business while supposedly on leave. As [we’ve pointed out before](https://twitter.com/JosephPatrice/status/1367566294950813699?s=20), putting aside the underlying claims, showing a lack of respect for the process undermines the firm investigation. [The firm rejected the claims about conflict checks](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/04/27/prosecutors-drop-domestic-violence-charge-against-boies-schiller-flexner-partner-joshua-schiller/), which may resolve the issue, but it all goes back to the problem of phrasing the leave as the attorney’s decision as opposed to the firm’s. Clear boundaries need to be set for any leave.

Hopefully firms will not have to confront the situation of partners accused of serious out-of-the-office crimes. But realistically something like this is going to come up again and whether or not the allegations ultimately result in criminal action, what happened here should be top of mind when firms craft their responses.

# Lawyerly Lairs: A Wachtell Lipton Partner's $5.4 Million Prewar Palace
## He and his wife, an interior designer, did a beautiful renovation before moving in.

The “tax reform” bill that [just passed the House](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-vote-republicans.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0) contains some [bad news for Biglaw partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/big-trouble-for-biglaw-partners-from-tax-reform/). And it also contains bad news for owners of expensive homes, who will face new limits on how much they can deduct in terms of property taxes and mortgage interest. Some analysts have suggested that Manhattan home values could [drop by almost 10 percent](https://slate.com/business/2017/12/housing-markets-worst-hit-by-republican-tax-plan.html) as a result.

Bad for Biglaw partners, bad for homeowners — and therefore bad for Biglaw partners who are homeowners. But don’t shed too many tears for them; as our latest Lawyerly Lairs story will show, they’re still doing quite well for themselves.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Earlier this month, the New York Times ran a [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/realestate/prewar-with-a-contemporary-twist.html?module=Slide&region=SlideShowTopBar&version=SlideCard-12&action=Click&contentCollection=Real%20Estate&slideshowTitle=Prewar%20Gets%20Some%2021st-Century%20Polish&currentSlide=12&entrySlide=1&pgtype=imageslideshow) on New York City apartment buildings that combine prewar beauty and elegance with postwar convenience and comfort. The featured couple that kicks off the article: [William Savitt](http://www.wlrk.com/wsavitt/), co-chair of the litigation department at Wachtell Lipton, and his wife Nazak.

(Savitt is a former colleague of mine, and I can attest that he’s as brilliant as one would expect from a former Columbia Law Review editor-in-chief and law clerk to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Also, note how Wachtell partners are dominating Lawyerly Lairs as of late; back in May, we covered George and Kellyanne Conway’s [$8 million mansion](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/lawyerly-lairs-george-and-kellyanne-conways-8-million-mansion/).)

From the NYT write-up:

[The Savitts] fell for [the Chatsworth](https://thechatsworth.com/), a 1904 Beaux-Arts apartment building at [344 West 72nd Street](https://maps.google.com/?q=344+West+72nd+Street&entry=gmail&source=g), facing Riverside Park, with a brick-and-limestone facade resplendent in cherubs, elk heads, human busts and garlands, which is being converted to a co-op with condo-like bylaws by HFZ Capital Group.

“I came to the lobby, and it was so impressive,” said Ms. Savitt, 51, a [graphic and interior designer](http://www.nazakdesign.com/).

Bill Savitt

Hyperlink to Nazak Savitt’s website in the original. If you were wondering why a partner at Wachtell Lipton, a notoriously press-shy firm, would be willing to have his multimillion-dollar home splashed all over the pages of the Times, it’s because it’s smart business development for his wife’s graphic and interior design firm. (Check out her [portfolio](https://www.nazakdesign.com/portfolio); I’m a fan of her cool, modern aesthetic.)

The lobby, featuring columns and pilasters and paneling and plasterwork, is [gorgeous](https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2017/12/08/realestate/prewar-gets-some-21st-century-polish/s/10PREWAR-slide-IVTS.html). But we suspect our readers are more interested in the Savitts’ particular apartment, to which we now turn….

# Well, MoFo Had A Mother F-cking Good Year
## That's quite the healthy bottom line.

It’s that time of year again! Now that the scene has officially been called on 2019, the financial performance of Biglaw is up for scrutiny. It’s still early in 2020 of course, so not everyone is ready to report their results, but the  venerable firm of Morrison & Foerster is ready to report a pretty darn good 2019.

MoFo’s numbers are up across the board. Revenue is up 10 percent, bringing their number to $1.15 billion. Revenue per lawyer? Also up by a margin of 4 percent to $1.14 million. Average partner compensation is up 4.9 percent to ~$1.5 million. And the gold standard of Biglaw, profits per equity partner, also saw an increase of 3.3 percent to $2.05 million.

And as Larren Nashelsky, the firm’s New York-based chairman, [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/01/29/morrison-foerster-posts-double-digit-revenue-growth/), the great 2019 is part of a trend, “Our 2019 performance comes on the heels of two prior exceptional years.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Speaking of 2018, last year the firm posted a 14 percent increase in PEP, but that boost was on the back of a drop in equity partner head count — by 25 percent — and ballooning nonequity ranks by 50 percent. But that doesn’t seem to be part of a trend. In 2019, the firm only lost one nonequity partner and 14 equity partners were added. The change wasn’t part of some grand strategy, according to the firm:

Nashelsky said the change in the equity partnership numbers was not part of any overall plan.

“I don’t know that it was a conscious strategy. We really are recruiting the best and the brightest. In some years they fall more in one category than the other,” Nashelsky said.

Speaking of hiring the best and brightest, MoFo made some power moves this year on that front, growing the number of attorneys to over 1,000 and opening two new offices in the process:

It hired 42 lateral partners and opened two offices. Its new Boston office, which opened in February of last year, has grown to roughly 40 attorneys, including notable pick-ups such as Proskauer Rose corporate partner Ori Solomon and Todd Boudreau, former co-chair of Foley & Lardner’s private funds and buyout practice.

The new Miami office launched in June as it poached nine Greenberg Traurig attorneys, including Greenberg’s Miami corporate co-chair Randy Bullard, who made the jump to help serve firm client SoftBank. Since their move, Bullard and his team have advised on several SoftBank deals, with the latest being a $125 million Series B investment into Latin American fintech company AlphaCredit.

# Another Biglaw Firm Is Showing Associates The Milbank Money
## Money makes the Biglaw world go 'round.

One by one, Biglaw firms are rushing in to match [Milbank’s new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), and the latest firm to do so is Boies Schiller Flexner. The firm is still hangin’ tough in 2022, and the firm has come to play with the members of the Biglaw elite who have anted up to pay their associates the big bucks.

In an email to associates (available on the next page), the BSF confirmed their commitment to staying on top of market compensation. That means associates will be making between $215,000 and $385,000, depending on class year, as base pay for associates in good standing. Here’s Boies Schiller’s new scale:

Class	Salary Effective January 1, 2022
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$285,000
2017	$325,000
2016	$350,000
2015	$370,000
2014+	$385,000
This new salary scale is effective as of January 1, 2022, and associates will see the cash in their February paychecks. Those associates who have remained on the firm’s forumular compensation system will see an adjustment in their salaries compared to the new salary scale as well.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Boies Schiller.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Given the ginormous expansion and size of Biglaw firms: is it possible that they have gotten too big? I ask because several ginormous (albeit nonlawyer) companies are slimming down post-COVID. Whatever weight was gained in the pre-COVID years is now seen as a liability, rather than an asset.

So, GE is separating [into three units](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/16/the-key-benefit-from-general-electrics-breakup/) (Jack Welch must be turning over in his grave): health care, energy, and aviation. Johnson & Johnson is dividing itself in half, separating the consumer products unit from the pharmaceutical and medical device unit. And not to be left behind, [Toshiba has announced](https://www.reuters.com/technology/toshiba-set-announce-split-into-three-firms-shareholder-reaction-focus-2021-11-12/) plans to divide itself into thirds: energy and infrastructure in one, hard disk drives and power semiconductor business in another, and flash chip and other assets in a third.

So, can Biglaw sustain its bigness? Should it? Associates who fill the coffers with the billable hours are not so sure that that’s where they want to be and how they want to [spend their working lives](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/the-real-threat-to-biglaws-business-model/). Reasonable considerations given the demands. Does Biglaw continue to grow, or will it think to rethink its bigness? Some mid-size firms are considering mergers due to succession challenges. The need for viable succession planning is not new.

As we slog toward the end of a tough year, many peeps are asking questions about not only what job they might want to have but how they might want to have it. In the office? Remote? A hybrid of the two? What about legal work energizes you and what sucks? I am not the first to tell you that every single lawyer job sucks in some respects, and if you think it doesn’t, then let’s talk further. Drudgery, to a greater or lesser extent, is part of every lawyer’s work. Discovery work was always what I hated the most. The endless responding to what seemed to be endless requests for documents, admissions, answers. Not just boring, but mind-numbing. Not quite like what you imagined the practice would be. Right? And did any professor tell you that in law school? (Rhetorical question.) The only ones who came even close to telling you anything about the real world of lawyering were the adjuncts, those in-the-trenches lawyers who told you the truth about practice.

Here in California, I, along with many other lawyers, would like nothing more than to drive a stake through the heart of the current discovery statutes for good and find a better way to litigate and resolve cases rather than endless motion practice. Lawyers prosper on the theory of leaving no stone unturned, while clients rail against the expense.

Further news on the state bar/Tom Girardi front. The state bar will consider revisions to how lawyers manage their trust accounts or mismanage them, as the case has been with Girardi and others over time. The proposed changes would require, among other things, compliance certification of the trust accounts by CPAs. The board will [consider rule changes](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/state-bar-board-of-trustees-approves-comprehensive-client-trust-account-protection-program) after the first of the year and the proposed changes will be open for public comment until midyear.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And the December issue of our monthly glossy magazine, not surprisingly, titled Los Angeles, has on its cover Mr. and Mrs. Tom Girardi. The cover banner reads: “Barely Legal, Crooked Investigators, Swindled Orphans, A Fortune Squandered on Bling, Inside the Surreal Scandal That Toppled L.A.’s Top Lawyer and His Ambitious Reality-TV-Star Wife.”  (Emphasis on the cover.) “Barely Legal.” Really?

Jordan Rothman was spot on [in his recent post](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/managing-partners-should-micromanage-less/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=187237893&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--FyFNwkz6NmDbEiX55ZNsFeR9ir9TdVYxyJJrTIMc42YdmxDOLbzYj2EknvPyra7pT4djChruVh_98aHsrzcbr-EZTiQ&utm_content=187237893&utm_source=hs_email) about micromanaging.

Micromanaging is always a curse and never a blessing. I was GC of a nonprofit many years ago and the CEO’s micromanaging drove me out and into my own firm. Every single decision had to be made by him so all the competent people around him were merely fact gatherers and order takers. Not one single decision could be made by those on his team. Mentoring is good; micromanaging is bad. How are peeps supposed to learn if they are not allowed to make mistakes? Why hire anyone? Just do it all yourself.

Micromanaging is borne out of fear, of insecurity, of not trusting the judgments of your staff and so, to CYA, the manager, the boss, whoever is micromanaging does so out of a lack of trust. There’s nothing worse than not being able to do the job you were hired to do, to not be able to use your judgment to make decisions, but it is your job to keep the boss informed and to escalate issues as needed. No one likes surprises. If a boss is insecure and a micromanager, then look out. That boss may well be driving the bus that you find yourself under. I have the tire tracks to prove it.

Having graduated from a nonranked law school that is now gone, I think the recent kerfuffle at Yale Law School requires a matrix to figure out who’s who and why anyone should care. Joe Patrice opines that the school is [a microcosm](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/yale-law-school-is-a-microcosm-of-a-failing-democracy/) of a failing democracy. Read Timothy Snyder’s book, “[On Tyranny, Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century](https://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/0804190119/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1638382001&sr=1-2),” in which he lays out 20 signs of a country headed in the wrong direction. (There’s also a graphic book version.)

Among those signs is the failure to remember our professional ethics. If we  “confuse our specific ethics with the emotions of the moment,” then we can find ourselves “saying and doing things that we previously would have thought unimaginable.” Lawyers in Hitler’s inner circle thought that the law was there to serve his aims. We all know how that turned out.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Firm Leadership, Not Motherhood, Fails Women When It Comes To Gender Equity In Biglaw
## Don't believe the hype. Pregnancy isn't why women are put on the back burner in Biglaw.

Men who think they are being sympathetic by lightening the load of pregnant women and new moms are doing them a huge disservice. I have extraordinarily talented and productive female partners who have never married and have no kids and are not rewarded to the same extent as men with similarly situated practices.

— An anonymous female partner at an Am Law 100 firm, commenting on the [myth that women lag behind men in Biglaw](https://www.law.com/2018/07/05/motherhood-isnt-the-culprit-for-big-laws-gender-equity-failures/) due to their commitments to motherhood, family, and work/life balance. Instead, we ought to look to law firm leadership to see where the problem lies. According to Kirkland & Ellis partner [Michael Williams](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=8341), “Leadership fails [women]. Leadership needs to do more to recognize and invest in their trajectories.”

Viet Dinh (courtesy of Bancroft)

The biggest Biglaw news from yesterday — and most likely the week — is Kirkland & Ellis [hiring all 17 lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/kirkland-ellis-hires-paul-clement-viet-dinh-and-all-of-bancrofts-lawyers/) of Bancroft PLLC. Named for Bancroft Place, the street in D.C. where it had its first office, Bancroft is the super-elite boutique founded in 2003 by former assistant attorney general Viet Dinh and joined in 2011 by former solicitor general Paul Clement.

Over its 13 years, Bancroft became known for its top-flight Supreme Court and appellate practice, handling high-profile, hot-button cases such as challenges to aspects of Obamacare and defense of the Defense of Marriage Act (which is what led Clement to [join Bancroft from King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/) five years ago, after defending DOMA proved too hot for K&S to handle).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In a series of updates to our [original story](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/kirkland-ellis-hires-paul-clement-viet-dinh-and-all-of-bancrofts-lawyers/), we quoted prominent in-house lawyers reacting positively to the news. It seems that Clement’s fellow SCOTUS advocates feel the same way, per [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/12/kirkland-acquires-dc-based-boutique-bancroft/):

“It was a shock. Nobody was expecting this,” said Lisa Blatt, head of Arnold & Porter’s Supreme Court practice and a longtime friend of Clement’s. “This is the biggest shakeup in the Supreme Court bar since Paul left King & Spalding in 2011.”

Neal Katyal, a former acting U.S. solicitor general, said that hire of Clement, Dinh and their team was a “huge coup for Kirkland.”

As Sidley & Austin chair Carter Phillips told [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202767223390/How-Bancroft-Found-a-New-Home-at-Kirkland?slreturn=20160813124637), “If Kirkland’s desire is to become a top-tier player, there is no more visible way to accomplish it than Paul.”

We noted (again in updates to our earlier story) that the deal came together in a matter of weeks, with Kirkland partner [Mark Filip](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=9711), a member of K&E’s Global Management Executive Committee, playing a major role. According to [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/how-the-scotus-firm-conservatives-love-got-acquired-by-kirkland-in-two-weeks/), the deal came together in just two weeks, initiated by an informal call by Filip to Clement (so presumably no legal recruiter made a killing on this mass lateral hire).

How much might Clement and Dinh earn at Kirkland? A lot. They’ve declined to discuss specifics, of course, but Dinh told Big Law Business, “Suffice it to say, everybody wins here.” As noted by Big Law Business, K&E’s has deep pockets, which it happily digs into for star laterals. Recall, for example, the [$5 million annual pay package](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/which-biglaw-firm-won-the-robert-khuzami-lottery/) it gave to former SEC enforcement director Robert Khuzami. That amount happens to be what Clement earned at King & Spalding back in the day, so he’s probably getting something north of that from Kirkland.

Earlier this afternoon, I chatted with Viet Dinh about his firm’s lawyers moving over to Kirkland. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

DL: Congratulations on the big news!

VD: Thank you. We’re very excited. [My wife] Jennifer and I had a baby girl in August, so it has been a big summer. I gained a baby — and 1,700 colleagues!

DL: It’s great news, in many ways. But are there things you’ll miss about Bancroft or having your own firm?

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
VD: There’s a little of a bittersweet sense to yesterday. We developed a pretty good thing at Bancroft, establishing through the marketplace that we can do quality work, handle interesting cases, and be financially successful. We hope to continue that momentum at Kirkland. I think of this not as changing highways or even lanes, but as putting more gas or octane into the car so we can go even faster.

DL: Bancroft was a small and [super-elite firm](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/top-litigation-firms-by-law-school-pedigree-2015/). Its lawyers have had [120 Supreme Court arguments](http://www.wsj.com/articles/kirkland-ellis-to-absorb-bancroft-1473711303), and during its 13 years, it sent nine of its lawyers into high court clerkships. Kirkland is an amazing firm, to be sure, but it’s also huge. How do you anticipate the Bancroft lawyers operating within Kirkland? Will you perhaps be a group unto yourselves?

VD: On day one, I don’t think much changes except the location where we do our work, the letterhead, and our email addresses. We are fully utilized; we’re not going to Kirkland because we need more work, and they’re not absorbing us to find work for themselves either. Obviously as we continue to grow and get the benefit of the larger Kirkland platform, there will be more opportunities for our younger lawyers to work with their new K&E colleagues, and opportunities for K&E lawyers to work with our group. So we envision a gradual and meaningful integration process. Kirkland is best of class in a number of practice areas — trial litigation, restructuring, private equity — and they know how to treat best-in-class practices. We look forward to sharing in this commonality of excellence.

DL: Kirkland already has a strong appellate and Supreme Court practice, under the leadership of Chris Landau. How will your and Paul’s arrival affect that practice? Will either of you be taking a leadership role in either the appellate practice or Kirkland more generally, such as on the management executive committee?

VD: The short answer is no. Kirkland doesn’t have many substructures, and Paul and I trust Mark [Filip] as much as we trust each other. We are very happy to be guided by Mark and his colleagues on the management committee.

As for the appellate practice, Kirkland’s lawyers — including Chris, John O’Quinn, and Pat Philbin — are all folks we know and respect, and they’re doing some of the best Supreme Court and appellate work out there. Together with them, we hope to do more of what we love doing: winning cases and serving clients.

DL: Kirkland is a larger firm than Bancroft by a factor of about 100, and it has many more clients. Did you evaluate potential client conflicts before making this move, and if so, what did your analysis show?

VD: We did a thorough conflicts analysis, running conflicts checks for the two systems, and found surprisingly little conflict. We had almost no breakage; we were able to resolve the issues that arose. At a deeper level, we’re very happy with the full and frank conversation we had with Kirkland about resolving conflicts.

DL: Bancroft handles lots of major, controversial cases before the Court. Kirkland is a large global law firm with many lawyers and clients. You’re not worried about a possible “DOMA 2”-type situation?

VD: We want to protect our ability to do interesting work, and Kirkland not only supports that but very much appreciates our specialized docket. Conflicts, soft or hard, will inevitably arise; it’s the law of large numbers, and the result of more lawyers doing important work. The question is not whether there will be conflicts but how they get resolved. We’re very comfortable with the discussions we’ve had with Kirkland about flagging conflicts and our plan to resolve them going forward.

DL: Some sources of ours at Kirkland have expressed concern that the absorption of the Bancroft attorneys, who represent major conservative causes, will create conflicts or otherwise prevent K&E from handling progressive pro bono work, like its voting rights work against North Carolina. Any concerns?

VD: I don’t think so. I haven’t focused much on that issue as opposed to our own issues, but we anticipate that we will be able to continue representing a broad array of clients. Earlier this year, Paul won a big case on behalf of the [Omaha Tribe](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1406_6536.pdf). No matter where one falls on the political spectrum, one can respect that case and Paul’s advocacy as a win for the Court’s jurisprudence.

DL: Was the move to Kirkland motivated in part by the issue of [succession planning?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/reinventing-the-law-business-succession-planning-yuck/) Both you and Paul have served in high government posts, and you might do so again in the future (even if not in a [Trump Administration](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/)). Is going to Kirkland a way of ensuring that everyone at Bancroft has a long career runway?

VD: Succession planning, at least in the short term, was not a big concern. All of us love what we do and intend to do it for a long, long time. There was no immediate sense of “what happens to the firm if x or y or z.”

But in terms of the bigger picture, the deal would make sense only if it was a win for everyone at the firm, from the most junior staff member to the most senior partner. The animating spirit for the transaction was enhancing opportunities for everyone, both for firm leaders and for our junior colleagues.

DL: I wonder if it’s hard out here for a boutique. Over the years, D.C. has had some great boutiques — during my clerkship, I interviewed with one of them, [Miller Cassidy](https://www.washingtonian.com/2001/05/01/the-perfect-lawyer/) — but many of them get absorbed into larger firms, like how Miller Cassidy got absorbed into Baker Botts.

It’s challenging for boutiques on two fronts, it seems to me. First, they have to compete with larger firms for clients and matters. Second, assuming they do successfully compete, then Biglaw comes calling and makes them an offer they can’t refuse. Is it possible for boutiques to make it work?

VD: For certain cases, clients will always go to the best lawyer and best practice they can find, whether in a boutique platform or a Biglaw platform or even in a kiosk of one or two lawyers. The clients will find the lawyer who will best serve their needs.

I do think that there’s something to be said about this transaction building strength on strength. We felt our ability to do even more of what we love will be enhanced at Kirkland. We could have gotten there organically on our own, but having this kind of opportunity, platform, and match of cultures just made the whole deal very easy.

DL: That makes perfect sense. Congratulations again, and thanks for taking the time to chat!

# What Is The Definition Of A Law Firm?
## Culture is often code for 'we’ve always done things one way, so let’s never consider doing them in a way that might be better.'

It’s no secret. The legal industry has long lagged behind the broader business world on most fronts. The world of remote working has been no exception. Yes, the basic tech is functionally available for most law firm attorneys. We mostly all have laptops and the ability to remote in and bill from our living rooms. But most large law firms still lack a real culture of remote working as a professional lifestyle.

Physical proximity is still the unspoken assumption of law firm life. In most firms, working regularly from home is an oddity to be commented on rather than a reflection of our digital 21st century reality. And that’s just on the attorney side of things. Even with the minor inroads remote working has made with lawyers, it remains virtually nonexistent as an option for professional staff. Having a legal administrative assistant working remotely would strike many attorneys as utterly preposterous. Isn’t physical presence part of the basic concept of the job?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The arguments against a remote working culture are timeworn. Remote teams can’t collaborate together as well. Workers at home get distracted by chores, naps, or Netflix. It’s unprofessional to take calls with clients or courts when kids or pets might be making noise in the background. You can’t pop your head in the office to ask a question or see how the day is going when someone is working out of their house.

The biggest argument by far, though, is the damage that remote working will do to a firm’s culture. So much of the special sauce that makes a good team is composed of those unplanned, serendipitous moments by the water cooler. Without proximity — and the chances to spontaneously gel that proximity brings — the fear is that we’ll lose our firms’ greater sense of unity and possibility.

The Cult Of Culture

I’ve got a complicated relationship with the idea of firm culture. On the one hand, it’s an essential element to maintaining and growing a firm. Without that central identity[, it’s hard to attract and retain talent](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/dont-just-show-me-the-money/). Few folks out there just want to walk into an office, close the door, and bill. Most of us want to belong to something bigger, to have friends and colleagues with whom we’re proud to practice. There will usually be some other firm out there ready to overpay to attract lateral talent. When those firms come knocking with big checks in hand, a strong, positive culture can help fend off the headhunters.

But culture is both a sword and a shield. “It’ll damage the firm culture” gets thrown out almost any time I hear a proposal for some innovation in how we work. In these situations, [culture is code](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/) for “we’ve always done things one way, so let’s never consider doing them in a way that might be better.” It’s an easy trump card to lay down, a cheap excuse to change nothing and continue to fall behind the times.

The culture argument has long been a dominant voice in the conversation around teleworking. It’s already easy for law firm attorneys to silo off ourselves or our practice groups and lose touch with our colleagues. Sometimes it can feel like physical presence is most of what keeps a firm together. The daily ritual of congregating at an office, saying hello to the admins in our impressive lobbies, stepping into mahogany-lined conference rooms for meetings … it all creates a sense of oneness that can’t be replicated anywhere else. Without the building where we work side-by-side every day, what actually unites us as a common entity with common goals? What else, besides our office, makes us a firm?

Because of COVID-19, we’re starting to learn how wrongheaded that thinking actually is.

Law In The Time Of Corona

COVID-19 continues to be a global tragedy of historic importance. By the time this is published, over 60,000 Americans will have died of the virus, out of over 225,000 worldwide deaths. The scope and human impact of this disease are hard to overstate, which is why the resilience of the people fighting it has been so remarkable.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Most people reading this column are likely working primarily from home. The legal industry has shifted from professional buildings to bedrooms and home offices. Instead of dropping by for a chat, we’re emailing, scanning, Zooming, [Housepartying](https://houseparty.com/), FaceTiming, using every means at our disposal to stay connected with our colleagues, friends, and families. Not only do we seem to be maintaining our relationships and culture, we seem to be growing them in a positive direction.

Being stuck at home has made us more intentional about our communication with one another. The pop-ins and water cooler chats have been replaced by in-depth conversations and GIF threads on Slack. We’re all struggling, and all coming to one another’s rescue.

COVID-19 is forcing all of us to finally accept that working from home can and should be normal. Even the naysayers have been forced to try it themselves, and to make it work. They’re getting the chance to experience the [well-documented benefits](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-companies-benefit-when-employees-work-remotely) of teleworking for themselves. There have for sure been hiccups and headaches with the transition to remote working. I certainly owe our IT team a round of drinks once the quarantine is lifted. But I truly believe that despite losing that physical closeness, our firm culture is stronger than ever during this time.

Choosing Togetherness

Physical closeness is never going to go away. My firm isn’t canceling its building lease any time soon. Even firms deeply committed to teleworking like Fisher Broyles or Keystone continue to conduct at least some of their meetings in meet-space, either in pay-per-hour professional conference rooms or designated office spaces. But we’re finally being forced to use some of the tools that have long been at our disposal, and it’s making our industry richer.

A law firm isn’t a building. It’s not a collection of attorneys or practice groups. It’s not a letterhead or a recruiting class or a PPP metric. A law firm is a choice. It’s the decision people make to band together and form something greater than the sum of their parts. In the shadow of COVID-19 we’re now choosing to make that decision a little more consciously every day. In the process, I think we’re also choosing to make ourselves better people.

# Biglaw Firms Complete Big-Money Merger During Pandemic
## This is something worth celebrating. Congratulations!

It’s been a very long time coming, but Philadelphia-based Pepper Hamilton and Atlanta-based Troutman Sanders have finally completed their merger to create Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders, a 1,100-lawyer firm with combined legacy revenue of $900 million in 2019, making it one of the 50 highest-grossing firms in the country.

The merger was publicly announced in November 2019 and the firms were originally supposed to combine on April 1, 2020, but the pandemic put a damper on their plans. “While we are well-positioned to execute the combination on April 1, we believe the decision to postpone is in the best interest of our attorneys, staff, and clients,” the firms noted in a March announcement, [postponing the merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-merger-postponed-due-to-unprecedented-coronavirus-challenges/) to July 1 due to the “unprecedented” challenges associated with the coronavirus crisis. In the meantime, both firms enacted austerity measures like pay cuts to control costs while COVID-19 wreaked economic havoc across the country.

Now that Troutman Pepper is finally here, with 26 offices spread across the country, CEO and chair Stephen Lewis, who formerly served as Troutman’s managing partner, is ready to get this party started. From the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2020/07/01/troutman-pepper-merger-goes-live-even-as-pandemic-keeps-new-colleagues-apart/):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“There is a lot of excitement across the combined firm about making this effective now,” Lewis said.

For now, the new firm’s lawyers and staff will celebrate via video at a firmwide event Wednesday afternoon. Troutman Pepper has scheduled its first partner meeting for July 16, also via video. Lewis said the firm hopes to host an in-person partner meeting in the new year, but “it depends on COVID-19 and when the world opens back up.”

And what about those pay cuts? Lewis seems optimistic everyone’s salaries will be restored sometime in the future. “I’d love to do it sooner rather than later,” he said.

Congratulations to everyone at Troutman Pepper on acheiving the seemingly impossible by completing a merger during a pandemic.

# Another One Bites The Dust
## LeClairRyan’s splashy downfall and the reasons law firms fail.

No matter how you’ve been doing, chances are you’ve been doing better in the past two weeks than LeClairRyan. The blows have been coming for the Am Law 200 firm at a break-neck pace. Gary LeClair, the first named partner, announced he was[ leaving for regional firm William Mullen](https://www.richmond.com/business/local/gary-leclair-leaving-the-leclairryan-law-firm-that-he-co/article_02e71a4e-2c22-550f-a55f-7253fb93790c.html). Other partners, associates, and staff have been jumping ship in droves, including [entire practice groups](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/24/15-lawyer-leclairryan-aviation-team-jumps-to-fox-rothschild/). The landlord of a shuttered satellite office has [sued for hundreds of thousands](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/struggling-leclairryan-faces-suits-over-closed-office-alleged-gender-bias) in overdue rent and promissory note payments. Every day has brought more bad news for the firm.

So it was no surprise that LeClairRyan officially announced it was [forming a wind-down committee ](http://www.virginiabusiness.com/news/article/leclairryan-moving-towards-shutdown)on July 31 and is in the process of dissolving. A firm with over 270 attorneys and $120 million in annual revenue will soon be no more. How in the living heck does that happen?

Why Do Law Firms Fail?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Two caveats: (1) I do not have any insider information on what happened at LeClair beyond what’s been publicly reported; and (2) I have deep sympathy for the staff and attorneys who are in the midst of this professional upheaval. That said, and with all due respect to the people living this chaos, I would be derelict in my duty as a law firm managing partner if I didn’t try to glean some lessons from LeClairRyan’s meltdown. They’re far from the only firm that’s failed publicly in the past few years, and I doubt they’ll be the last. The segment of the market we occupy is facing unique challenges in the legal market, and complacency today might mean shutters tomorrow.

The silver lining of the spate of recent firm failures is that we have some data to analyze. I’ve spoken to many lawyers who have gone through firm dissolutions, and a number of themes continue to recur in those conversations.

Coasting when times seem good. When things are going well, it’s easy to get comfortable and assume things will always remain good. This mindset is comforting to lawyers, who are trained to love the predictable and status quo, but it can be death to a business. Someone’s always coming for your market share. If you’re not taking active steps to expand your current book to keep pace with potential client attrition, then you’re just biding time until that book slips through your fingers.

Not addressing underproductive lawyers. Lawyers who don’t appear to be pulling their weight can be poisonous to a firm’s morale and cohesion. The high performers carrying an unfair share of the load feel dissatisfied. The low performers stress further, feeling simultaneously like everyone knows they’re dragging the firm down while also feeling like they’re waiting to be unmasked as unsuccessful frauds. I’m an advocate for attorneys treating each other, and themselves, with kindness and compassion. But compassion doesn’t mean inaction, and too many in firm management are unwilling or unable to address chronically underperforming attorneys. Firms need to be proactive and direct in these situations. Compensation cuts aren’t a substitute for substantive planning and discussion. It’s not pleasant to have tough conversations, put people on strict performance plans, or ultimately cut headcount, but doing so helps everyone in a firm feel more at ease. When the firm trusts management to actively handle internal disputes, its members can focus outward on building their practices instead of inward, defending their piece of the firm’s pie.

Diluting the equity pool. At a recent Hugh Simon lecture, he pointed out that if you adjust for inflation, Am Law 200 firms’ current revenue-per-lawyer stats are about where they were in 2008, but profits-per-equity partner have gone up over time. The market has shifted in the past decade toward constricting the equity pool, raising the compensation of the rainmakers who are keeping firms afloat in these leaner times, while cutting the comp of lower-performing or service partners. Whether we like it or not, this shift in the market price of rainmaking means firms that aren’t willing to pay to keep their biggest books happy are at risk of losing them to their competitors.

Letting expenses devour profit. Lawyers love the trappings of our practice, but too often lose sight of [the costs we’re incurring until we’ve already begun to feel the bite](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/the-tragedy-of-the-law-firm-commons/?rf=1). We lock our firms into expensive leases in swanky buildings, only to see our prices undercut by virtual firms and less flashy boutiques. We spend money on decorations and perks that look impressive, but probably don’t generate much new business. We get excited by high-revenue practices[ without considering how much expense those practices incur to bring that money in](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/what-makes-a-good-book-of-business/). Firms that don’t manage their costs often don’t realize they’ve slipped into unprofitability until it’s already too late.

Over-democratizing the firm. Lawyers are used to studying law. They don’t, usually, study market forces, business trends, or the emerging best practices of business management and accounting. Yet that has rarely prevented partners from developing passionate, vehement opinions about the management of their firm. Owners undoubtedly deserve a voice in the management of what they own, but [firms that spread their agency too thin](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/what-if-lawyers-ran-amazon/) find themselves stuck in gridlock, unable to respond quickly to new challenges. Businesses need agility, precision, and clear delegations of power. Management teams that delegate all their power to committees, or that aren’t granted any real power to begin with, might as well be trying to paddle a canoe with a toothpick. They can make a big show and expend a lot of effort, but they’re not going to have much say over where they end up.

An Opportunity for Growth

LeClairRyan’s implosion is just one chapter in the much larger story of the sea change our industry is continuing to experience. We’ll learn more in the coming weeks what precisely brought this firm down, but the major strokes of the larger story are already well understood. We owe it to ourselves not to let this opportunity for learning and growth pass us by. We can pay attention to the forces around us, or let them drag us down as well. The choice, as always, is ours.

## A comprehensive guide for legal professionals and recruiters to assess compensation in the dynamic legal market and align it with industry standards.

Over the past decade, the legal industry has undergone substantial transformations, prompting law firms and in-house legal departments to continually adjust their compensation strategies to attract and retain top talent. In 2023, evaluating whether you are underpaid is more crucial than ever, given the salary increments, shifts in bonus structures, and the emergence of new compensation models. This article delves into the prevailing compensation trends in the legal sector and offers insights on how to ascertain if your remuneration aligns with current market standards.


Grasp the Compensation Landscape

To accurately assess whether you are underpaid, it is imperative to comprehend the existing compensation landscape for legal professionals. In 2023, Biglaw firms have persistently elevated associate salaries, with first-year associates now receiving a market standard of $215,000. This rising trend encompasses all seniority levels, with eighth-year associates earning up to $375,000.

Partner compensation has also witnessed a surge, with average profits per partner surpassing $2 million at several distinguished law firms. In-house general counsel roles have experienced considerable salary growth, with chief legal officers at Fortune 500 companies earning between $700,000 and $3 million, contingent on the company’s size and complexity.

Benchmark Your Compensation Against Industry Averages

A practical approach to determining whether you are underpaid is to juxtapose your current compensation with industry averages. Resources such as the National Association for Law Placement (NALP) and legal industry publications furnish extensive salary data for diverse legal roles and practice areas. Bear in mind that compensation can vary considerably based on factors like firm size, location, and practice area specialization.

Evaluate the Significance of Bonuses and Benefits

Beyond base salaries, bonuses and benefits are instrumental in ascertaining total compensation. In 2023, Biglaw firms have consistently offered substantial bonuses, with year-end and special bonuses frequently reaching six figures for high-performing senior associates. Moreover, law firms and in-house legal departments have broadened their benefits packages, encompassing health insurance, retirement plans, and flexible work arrangements. To precisely assess your compensation, take into account the worth of these supplementary factors.

While examining your compensation, it is vital to recognize that base salary constitutes just one aspect of a comprehensive compensation package. Bonuses and benefits, such as health insurance, retirement plans, and vacation time, can substantially influence your overall earnings. Ensure that you incorporate these components when comparing your compensation to market standards, as they can significantly impact your total income.

It is important to note that not all Am Law firms adhere to the market standard for compensation, with some underpaying their associates. For instance, Gibson Dunn has faced scrutiny in recent years for not aligning with the industry’s compensation trends. Despite the firm’s renown for its high-profile cases and robust practice groups, reports indicate that its associate compensation packages have not paralleled the rapid salary growth observed at other Am Law firms. This disparity underscores the necessity of researching and contrasting compensation packages across firms, even those with esteemed reputations, to guarantee that you are justly compensated for your skills and expertise.

To accurately determine if you are underpaid, gather information on comparable positions within your specific practice area, location, and experience level. This data can often be sourced from salary surveys, legal industry publications, or through conversations with colleagues and recruiters.

Examine Your Compensation in Relation to Your Peers

Another valuable tactic is to compare your compensation with that of your peers. Networking and candid discussions with colleagues or alumni can yield invaluable insights into the compensation landscape within your practice area or region. Approach these conversations with tact and professionalism.

Consult an Expert for Guidance

If you are uncertain about whether your compensation aligns with the market, consider seeking advice from a legal recruiter. Knowledgeable legal recruiters, like those at Lateral Link, possess an in-depth understanding of the legal market and can offer tailored guidance based on your distinct background and career aspirations.

Discerning if you are underpaid in 2023 entails comprehending the current compensation landscape, contrasting your salary with industry averages, taking into account bonuses and benefits, appraising your pay in relation to your peers, and seeking expert guidance when necessary. As the legal industry continues to evolve, staying informed about compensation trends and engaging in open dialogues can help ensure your pay corresponds with your skills and experience.

If you suspect that your compensation is not commensurate with the market, or if you are exploring new opportunities with competitive compensation packages, contact Lateral Link today. Our adept legal recruiters can assist you in navigating the intricate legal market and discovering the right position that aligns with your professional objectives and financial expectations.

# Biglaw Firm Makes 2 Rounds Of Stealth Layoffs After Billable Work Disappears
## About 30 associates are now out of work thanks to the firm's cuts.

Thanks to the economic downturn, stealth layoffs among corporate practices abound throughout Biglaw, hitting even some of the most successful law firms, like [Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/) and [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-junior-associates-top-20-biglaw-firm-cooley/). Today, we have the details on even more stealth layoffs, and the news is not good.

It seems that Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer — which delayed its new associates’ start date until January 2023 — followed up on that austerity move by making two rounds of layoffs due to a slowdown in work. Here are some additional details, courtesy of the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/10/gunderson-associates-out-of-a-job-after-dip-in-billable-work/):

[The firm] cut a group of associates in New York and Bay Area offices in September and this week due to a decline in billable work, according to four people with direct knowledge of the two rounds of cuts.

… [T]he layoffs at Gunderson affected about 10 associates in late September and about 20 more this week, according to sources in contact with affected individuals. Many of the associates recently let go were onboarded in recent years’ rush to hire corporate lawyers, only to be let go shortly after joining the firm.

Sources said that those who were let go had previously received glowing reviews, but thanks to the implosion within the tech industry, their hours dropped significantly. As noted in Am Law, some Gunderson associates billed as little as 10 hours last month. Yikes.

Is this what it’s going to look like at other tech-focused corporate firms as we close out the year?

# Why Innovation Beats Invention

I was moved to write this column by the story of Jack Chen, a rather amazing lawyer at Google. If you want to understand where I’m coming from—or if you just want to be inspired—check it out before proceeding further.

I told you it would be worth your time.

That video stirred plenty of thoughts for me, as I imagine it does for everyone. My own reaction unfolded in three parts. First, I felt a great admiration for Jack. Second, I felt a keen appreciation for the very surmountable nature of the logistical and physical “challenges” that I sometimes lament in my own life. (Put another way, by comparison to Jack I felt incredibly lazy, and unproductive.) And third, I began to reflect on larger lessons that Jack’s experience can teach us.

With regard to those larger lessons, perhaps most obviously Jack provides yet another argument for the value of inclusiveness in the legal profession. Specifically, he attests to the contributions that can be made by “non-typical professionals,” too many of whom get directed away from big law firms and “toward government work, advocacy organizations or solo and small-firm employment, often with disability-related practices,” according to [this ABA Journal article](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_biggest_hurdle_for_lawyers_with_disabilities_preconceptions).  There’s more to say on that point, but I am going to move beyond it here in order to talk about a different subject: innovation. (N.B.:  My children’s school uses the expression “non-typical learners” to describe students whose learning needs, abilities, and experiences differ from the proverbial “typical,” and I’m borrowing the phrase here – the word “disability” strikes me and others as inaccurate and problematic, to say the least.)

It’s clear to me that Jack Chen is an innovator. More than that, he reminds me of the true meaning of that word—which I believe can and should be kept in mind by individual lawyers, law firms, and legal organizations.

Before I heard of Jack Chen, if you told me of a totally blind lawyer working at the very highest levels of the profession, I would have believed it—while waiting for the other shoe to drop. That is, I would have expected to hear of some new technological invention that was making the practice of law more feasible for the blind lawyer. To some degree, I think that’s how we are programmed to think now. Perhaps it’s the fact that inventions are coming at us with such frequency. Perhaps it is the hysteric attention given to new product releases (iPhone 7, anyone?). Perhaps it’s something else entirely. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that we’re accustomed to seeking answers to our problems and needs in new technologies and in new inventions.

But innovation and invention are two different things.

Watching the report, I was taken with the fact that Jack’s solutions to the obstacles he faces seemed to involve well-understood technology, adapted for Jack, but widely available. For instance, his technique for inhaling unbelievable amounts of information—letting him read at a pace of 620 words per minute—relies on nothing more exotic than text-to-voice technology and a fast-forward button. I hope Jack doesn’t mind me saying that his brand of innovation appears to owe more to MacGyver than Steve Jobs. Make no mistake, that’s a compliment. It’s impressive to see him using just his own creativity and already-existing tools to so greatly expand the universe of “What’s Possible” for himself as a lawyer.

I’m thankful to him for reminding me that innovation is frequently not about invention as much as it is about adaptation and ingenuity. Which made me wonder: Can I apply some of that ingenuity to my own life and work? How can I use the wealth of tools available to me right now to become a more efficient, productive, and happier performer? Since watching Jack’s story, I’ve been considering major aspects of my workday, and trying to think boldly about how I might optimize them. Should I have my emails read to me? Should I find a method of commuting or tools to use during my commute that allow me to get vastly more work done before I arrive at my desk?

Interestingly, in the video, Jack explains that getting to work, for him, is like running ten miles before starting a marathon, noting that his cane provides only a four foot radius of information. Yet we already have driverless cars, high precision GPS (admittedly requiring satellite coverage), and similar active location technology, leading me to wonder how long it will be until that technology evolves and adapts to help people like Jack vastly expand their effective radius of information and reduce the effort it takes just to get to work.

The questions, and the stakes, are heightened at the organizational level. Law firms that ask themselves how innovative they can be very well may reap the largest rewards in coming years. Historically, law firms have not been under great pressure, internally or externally, to work efficiently. But just as Jack Chen’s disability drove his pursuit of creative solutions, current conditions—including the aftermath of the recession, greater pricing pressure by corporate clients, and even the emergence of AI-driven legal solutions—are focusing law firms on the need to deliver more efficient services. Many firms are already benefiting from a focus on process improvement and Six Sigma management techniques.

Likewise, as leaders of one of the major vendors in the legal industry, my team and I often spend our time considering and developing (or acquiring) new inventions. But I wonder if we spend nearly enough time focusing on innovating through adaptation, through connecting existing technologies in new and more useful ways. Our heads of product and engineering regularly remind our team that there is often a simpler way to do something other than trying to build from scratch, and that existing tools can often be re-invented or re-imagined for other sources. Jack’s story is a powerful reminder of that.

But there is a long way to go. There is lots of ingenuity to apply within the walls of vendors, law firms, and others in the profession, with limited (or no) need for invention. There is much self-examination to be done, creativity to exercise, and breakthroughs to be made. Where is the fast-forward button that will allow lawyers and those who support them to achieve jaw-dropping levels of efficiency?

Jack Chen found his. And if any organization in our industry can approach his degree of success, it will be doing just fine.

What mistake do I often see even senior lawyers at good firms make when taking depositions or trying cases?

These folks know that questions on direct examination should be open-ended and questions on cross should be leading. I see people err in those regards, of course, but I don’t typically see experienced, knowledgeable folks make those errors.

Here’s the error I see all the time:

A: “No.”

Everyone in the room understands that those “no” answers almost surely mean “yes.” The witness did not believe that the light was red, and the witness’ signature was not at the bottom of the document. But the double negative obscures this. It’s entirely conceivable that the “no” answers might in fact mean “no.”

The double negatives mean that the questions and answers are generally useless: The double negative obtained at deposition cannot be used on summary judgment because it’s ambiguous. Depending on what the video looks like, the double negative at deposition may not be useful for impeachment at trial. And the double negative at trial is similarly useless on appeal; the appellate panel, reading the transcript, will not be sure what the question and answer meant.

It’s true that the double negative conveys meaning in the moment: Everyone at the deposition or trial knows that the “no” answer means “yes.” That’s great — unless you were taking the deposition for a reason, such as setting up a summary judgment motion or creating useful material for impeachment at trial. And the ambiguity is fine at trial — so long as you win. If you happen to lose at trial, you don’t have the record you need for appeal.

It’s thus wrong to say, dismissively, as some do: “We all knew what the witness meant.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

That’s true. You and the others in the room when the testimony was taken did know what the witness meant. But understanding the witness in the moment was not the only reason you were taking the testimony.

Good lawyers fix the double negative problem in one of three ways:

First, if a good lawyer realizes that he or she inadvertently put a negative in the question and obtained a negative response, the lawyer will immediately correct the error: “I’m sorry. I asked you a bad question, so the answer was confusing. What I said in the preceding question was correct, right?”

That will elicit either a “yes” or a “what was the question again?” that’s an invitation to fix the error.

Second, some lawyers strip the negative out of the question. Thus:

Q: “Did you believe the light was red?”

Or:

Q: “Is that your signature at the bottom of the document?”

The answers to those questions will be not be ambiguous.

But some lawyers tremble at the thought of the questions I’ve just suggested:  “Herrmann, you idiot! ‘Did you believe the light was red?’ is not a leading question. If you ask an open-ended question on cross-examination, you’ll get your ass handed to you. You must be a terrible lawyer!”

If asking those questions causes you too much stress, then you could use a third approach. Some lawyers fix the double negative problem by phrasing the questions slightly differently.

Q: “You did not believe that the light was red. Is that statement correct?”

Or:

Q: “That is not your signature at the bottom of the document.’ Is that statement correct?”

Those questions are likely to elicit the necessary “yes” or “yes, that’s correct.”

“Creating a useful record” and “having a conversation” are two entirely different things. If you’re doing the former, do not mistakenly think that you’re doing the latter. Is that correct?

# Ride 'Em, Cowboy! Top Texas Trial Firm Lassos Salary Raises For Associates

The stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of Texas — but they’re even bigger and brighter for law firm associates who’ve recently received news about their salaries skyrocketing. If you’re at a firm in the Lone Star State that’s been “monitoring” the market for further developments in this summer’s salary wars, bring to partners’ attention the fact that yet another firm has matched the [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) [MoneyLaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/) scale.

On Thursday night, litigation boutique Yetter Coleman — a firm that previously started first-year associates at $170,000, a salary $10K above the then-prevailing market rate — announced that it was matching the new salary scale that’s taken the nation by storm. Yetter, one of the [top litigation firms by law school pedigree](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/top-litigation-firms-by-law-school-pedigree-2015/), notified associates that its goal was to remain competitive, attract top talent, and continue to be viewed as a top litigation boutique, and thus, firm leaders decided to adopt the new associate payscale. Sources tell us Yetter matched the Cravath scale at every level, through the class of 2008.

Congrats to all associates at Yetter Coleman, and keep on lassoing those trial victories!

It’s no secret that, for personal injury firms, the pandemic has brought about a drop in new cases.

Amid this environment, however, some are taking steps to bolster their current operations and position themselves to emerge stronger than ever.

Hosted by legal tech journalist Bob Ambrogi, this webinar will focus on Paul Hernandez, Partner with Kalfus & Nachman and a well-known personal injury lawyer in Virginia, who will discuss how his firm has thrived in the past year and how it’s cultivating continued success in a new normal.

David Wagner, COO of Assembly Software, will join the panel to discuss the role of case management and offer other insights on how technology can help firms tightly manage profits at all times.

Join us June 29th at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT for a lively discussion on:

- How firms can apply a metric-driven approach to managing costs and profitability
- The increased importance of frequent communication with clients and colleagues
- Managing firmwide productivity in light of the changing role of physical office space
- Increasing business development activity to secure a post-pandemic pipeline of cases
- How the right case management software can play a role in all of these areas

# Biglaw Firm Puts Some Extra Oomph Into Bonuses For High Billers -- We're Talking Above-Market Money!
## $45,000 over market? Yes, please!

Picture this: You’ve been billing your butt off all year long, and when bonus time comes, you’re going to be expecting something big. Sure, that special bonus is nice, but you want more — much more. Fear not, because one law firm wants to give you that huge bonus you’ve been craving.

With a maximum bonus potential for senior associates of $183,000, Schulte Roth & Zabel came to play this bonus season. The firm — which brought in $444,700,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it at No. 90 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — announced bonuses earlier this afternoon, and SRZ is offering much more than a simple Cravath/DPW match.

Schulte is also offering associates three levels of step-up bonuses as well as partial credit bonuses for those who were unable to meet their minimum hours. Here’s what the 2021 hours requirements are at the firm:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
1. In addition to the class bonus, and the previously announced special bonus, there will be another special bonus for all associates meeting the 2000 hour target.
2. There will also be three levels of step-up bonuses for 2300, 2500 and 2700 hours.
3. Associates with 1600 hours will receive a 50% class bonus and 50% special bonus. This will apply to the previously announced special bonus as well.
4. Associates with fewer than 1600 hours will receive a $5,000 bonus.

Without further ado, here’s the SRZ bonus scale for 2021:



All told, that’s a pretty penny over the market rate, depending on associate class year. That’s quite the thank you for the extra hard work associates have been putting in during the pandemic. Associates at the firm seem to be pretty happy about how their bonuses turned out.

Feedback from the associates seems to be really good.  The firm really came through on bonuses this year – above market for high billers, cushion for lower billers, and matching the DPW scale + special bonuses!!! SRZ has always tied bonuses to hours, which pays off when it’s this busy.  Lots of people definitely getting way above market comp.  Great way to end the year.

# Biglaw Firm Closes All Of Its Offices Across The Globe Due To Coronavirus Concerns
## What’s your firm doing to keep its lawyers and staff safe?

Earlier this week, [Quinn Emanuel shuttered its New York office](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/quinn-emanuel-new-york-coronavirus/) after one of the firm’s partners tested positive for coronavirus, enacting a work-from-home policy for all of its attorneys and staff members. Employees at other firms were shocked, and perhaps even envious, that such a successful firm had done such a thing, pondering if their own firms would ever close their doors to protect their health.

Now we know that at least one more firm is willing to close its doors to spare its employees from suffering through a COVID-19 diagnosis.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Which Biglaw firm could it be?

Faegre Drinker, the 1,300-lawyer strong merger product of Faegre Baker Daniels and Drinker Biddle & Reath, decided to temporarily close all of its offices — every single one of them across the globe, 22 in total — due to coronavirus fears. That’s an incredibly bold move. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2020/03/10/faegre-drinker-closes-all-22-offices-after-potential-coronavirus-exposure/) has more information:

None of the firm’s lawyers and staffers have tested positive for the coronavirus, but a person who attended a recent event at Faegre Drinker’s Washington office did, the firm said in a statement. As a result, the firm’s executive leadership decided Monday to close the firm’s offices.

“Because the health and safety of our personnel and clients is our top priority, Faegre Drinker is temporarily closing its D.C. offices. As a measure of caution, our leadership team has also taken the step of closing our global offices on March 10 while we evaluate this situation,” the firm said in its statement.

The firm noted in its statement announcing the office closures en masse that its employees “are equipped with the required technology to work remotely and remain ready and available to assist clients.”

How long can a Biglaw firm survive with all of its employees working from home? We may soon find out, because Faegre Drinker has not said when it plans to reopen its offices across the globe. Stay tuned for further developments.

UPDATE (3/12/20): Faegre Drinker has since [reopened](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1252464/faegre-drinker-reopens-most-offices-after-coronavirus-scare) the vast majority of its offices, save for its two outposts in Washington, D.C., where the potential coronavirus exposure began.

What is your firm doing to protect lawyers and staff from coronavirus? Please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Coronavirus%20Response) (subject line: “Coronavirus Response”). Stay safe.

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

Say goodbye to the class-action gender discrimination lawsuit against Jones Day.

As you may recall, [the purported class-action](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/plaintiffs-in-jones-day-gender-discrimination-case-want-it-to-be-a-class-action/?rf=1) gender discrimination [case](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) alleged a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system. The plaintiffs were spread throughout the country — Nilab Rahyar Tolton, Andrea Mazingo, Meredith Williams, and Jaclyn Stahl worked in California offices of the firm, while Saira Draper was an associate in Atlanta, and Katrina Henderson was in the firm’s New York office — and a core allegation is that the same black box compensation systems kept their pay below that of men working at the firm.

After [contentious discovery](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/the-fight-to-crack-open-jones-days-black-box-heats-up/?rf=1), U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss of the District of Columbia ordered Jones Day to provide plaintiffs with salary information about every associate nationwide from 2012 to 2018. But that data didn’t turn out how the plaintiffs anticipated, and after an analysis, the plaintiffs have decided to drop the class-action claims against the Biglaw firm, as [reported by Law.com:](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/12/15/ex-jones-day-associates-drop-gender-bias-class-action-claims/)

In a joint [status report](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20424229-toltonjonesday12142020) filed late Monday, attorneys for the six women suing the firm and for Jones Day indicated the women had decided to cast aside the class action claims after analyzing the nationwide evaluation and compensation data provided by the firm. They also agreed to drop their individual disparate impact claims related to the firm’s compensation model, while other individual claims will remain active.

Henderson, Draper, and Williams still have individual Equal Pay Act claims  and there are also pending claims under the California Private Attorneys General Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and various state and District of Columbia laws.

Attorney for the plaintiffs, Sanford Heisler Sharp’s Deborah Marcuse, said they’ll continue to pursue their individual claims:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“The six named plaintiffs brought this case in the name of transparency and equity in the legal profession and we will continue to vigorously pursue their compelling individual and statutory claims, including their individual claims of unequal pay.”

The firm’s statement on the latest development in the case noted the timing of the decision to drop the class-action claims and that they’ll continue to fight the individual claims:

Jones Day spokesman David Petrou noted that the women were required to submit expert reports in early December supporting their allegations that the firm’s evaluation and compensation processes led to systemic discrimination against women.

“But after their experts analyzed nationwide data for the period 2012–2018, they concluded—as Jones Day has said from the outset of the case’s filing—that there was no basis to pursue these claims,” he said in an email. “The firm will continue to litigate the limited—and equally meritless—claims that remain.”

It’s a quiet end to the class-action case we once hoped would blow open the firm’s notorious black box compensation system.

# Debevoise Makes Its Salary Announcement -- With A Twist

The cascade of salary matches — from [many firms, anyway](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-bad-news-who-wont-be-matching/) — keep on coming. Debevoise, being the venerable firm that it is, has matched the Cravath salary structure as expected.

The senior attorneys floating just off the traditional grid have largely flown under the radar of these discussions, but Debevoise was good enough to place them front and center of their memo:

Good for Debevoise. Counsel are people too!

Speaking of people, Debevoise didn’t forget its summer associate people either:



Congrats.

# Morning Docket: 12.21.18
## * In completely unshocking news, despite advice from ethics officials, Acting Attorney General and former Tight End Matthew Whitaker has refused to recuse himself from oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russian election interference probe. [[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/20/matthew-whitaker-cleared-oversee-robert-muellers-russia-probe/2374630002/)] * Corporate clients are trying to control their spending, and that means more and more Biglaw firms are having trouble collecting on their year-end bills, such that ""on average [a firm] can lose 20 percent of its original billing amount."" [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/slower-billing-collection-times-giving-law-firms-headaches)] * First-year law student enrollment increased by 3 percent this year, and two New Jersey schools played a really big role. Rutgers Law increased its 1Ls by 17.87 percent and Seton Hall Law increased its 1Ls by 24.87 percent. [[New Jersey Law Journal](https://www.law.com/njlawjournal/2018/12/20/law-schools-see-first-real-enrollment-gains-since-2010-399-19816/)] * Another day, another law school that's willing to accept the GRE for admissions. Starting this fall, the University at Buffalo School of Law will accept the alternative test in place of the LSAT to ""eliminat[e] barriers to access to education."" [[UB Now](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/briefs/2018/12/law-school-gre.html)] * In case you missed it, earlier this week, Nick Wilson, a public defender, won the latest season of Survivor.

# Boies Schiller Flexner Shakes Up Its Executive Committee
## Preparing for a firm without David Boies.

I am certain the timing was coincidental. Yes, David Boies’s [representation of Harvey Weinstein](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-takes-responsibility-for-enabling-harvey-weinstein/) and his involvement in the effort to squash a New York Times article about Weinstein’s alleged history of sexual assault and harassment has led to [severe backlash](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/new-york-times-fires-david-boies-over-the-whole-grave-betrayal-thing/) [against](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-loses-more-work-over-weinstein-debacle/) the legal legend, but it is highly unlikely his Biglaw firm changed the way it operates as a direct result of the controversy.

That said, less than three months [since the scandal broke](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/david-boies-isnt-worried-about-recent-scrutiny/), Boies’s eponymous firm, Boies Schiller Flexner (BSF), has changed the composition of their executive committee (EC). As [reported](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/19/changes-at-boies-schiller-as-firm-imagines-a-future-without-david-boies/) by Law.com, at BSF’s partnership meeting in December they increased the number of attorneys on the executive committee to 11 (up from 7). And the new — younger — EC now includes three women partners, [Karen Dunn,](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/karen-l-dunn.html) [Natasha Harrison](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/natasha-harrison.html) and [Karen Dyer.](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/karen-c-dyer.html)

As the 77 year-old Boies paints it, this is all about smart succession planning (co-managing partner Jonathan Schiller is 71):

The firm is “making sure the next generation is not only ready to take over, but is in the process of taking over,” Boies said in an interview.

And Boies downplayed any conclusions one may draw from the timing of the decision:

Boies stressed that it would be “incorrect” to draw a line between the recent management changes and the Weinstein drama. The negative publicity over his Weinstein work hasn’t affected firm management, he said.

Long time clients support the move as a natural progression:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Even though David Boies has the energy of a 4-year-old, he is in the twilight of his career,” said Peter Carter, Delta Air Lines’ chief legal officer and executive vice president, who regularly hires Boies Schiller.

But it’s not as if Boies has already left the building, Carter and other clients said. The legendary litigator, who represented the prevailing plaintiffs for marriage equality at the U.S. Supreme Court and Al Gore in the disputed 2000 presidential election, still ranks as “the spiritual leader” of Boies Schiller, and “his fingerprints are all over that firm,” Carter said.

Of course none of this means Boies is stepping back from his role leading the firm. Also during the December meeting Boies was re-elected as firm chairman — a role he’s held since the founding of the firm.

# Firm Ignores Biglaw Special Bonus Trend, Gives Associates The Gift Of Takeout Food
## A nice gesture, but not what everyone was hoping for.

Listen, you can’t blame Biglaw associates for being antsy about bonuses. Special bonuses are sweeping their way through Biglaw firms, and if your firm *hasn’t* announced yet, well, you’re probs a bit nervous.

So, when folks at Quarles & Brady, a firm with $274,602,000 gross revenue in 2019 making it 118th on the Am Law 200, got an email from firm leadership advertising “a token of our appreciation,” well, you can’t be faulted for hoping for the best — a match of the special bonus numbers.

But alas, that wasn’t to be. Instead, it was a $30 voucher for GrubHub/UberEats.

The nice thing is that the token of appreciation was sent to everyone, attorneys and staff. But as commentary from tipsters reveal, it hasn’t gone over well, with associates keeping their fingers crossed for special bonuses.

Coming in hot with a $30 Uber eats gift card for lawyers and staff after beating precovid revenue projections in FY20.

At least it’s better than a hat.

Yeah, [it’s not firm swag, so there’s that.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-says-youre-expecting-a-bonus-but-please-accept-this-hat-instead/?rf=1)

# Of Course Biglaw Firms That Conducted Layoffs Are Going To Hand Out Market Bonuses

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Firms that were publicly in the news having done layoffs, I think they will be very sure to pay market bonuses.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), a California legal recruiter for Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-bonuses-holding-steady-but-now-come-with-more-strings) on Biglaw’s upcoming bonus seasons. Firms that [conducted layoffs and deferred incoming associates](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) earlier this year may be eager to show that they’re doing better now, but recall that many associates’ bonuses may be affected due to their [compliance with in-office attendance policies](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/biglaws-bad-ideas-4-day-office-mandates-and-attendance-based-bonus-policies/).

# Another Firm Bumps Associate Salaries To The $180K Scale
## We have our first Cravath match -- lock, stock, and barrel.

Well, that didn’t take long. About four and a half hours after we first learned that Cravath would [bump associate base salaries to $180K](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), the tips started pouring in from California that litigation boutique [Hueston Hennigan](https://www.hueston.com/) matched the Cravath scale lock, stock, and barrel, in both its L.A. and Newport Beach offices.



Around the ATL office we’d mused that some firms might cynically boost first-year salaries to $180K while compressing salaries up the chain, but that’s certainly not the case here.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Perhaps it’s not surprising that a firm born out of an [exodus over disappointing compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/an-exodus-of-attorneys-out-of-irell-manella/) with a [history of beating Biglaw bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-another-boutique-beats-biglaw/) would be committed to staying on the cutting edge of salary.

Congratulations to the Hueston Hennigan associates!

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# 3 Reasons Not To Trust Personal Reviews
## Current and former employees make for unreliable reviewers because firms vary wildly from office to office, and from practice to practice.

You’ve found the perfect blackout curtains on Amazon, recommended specifically for overworked and late-sleeping New York associates, vampires, and Alaskans. They’re inexpensive and ship via Prime, but then you notice a wisp of yellow out of the corner of your eye that spells doom for your purchase: 3.5 stars. You click out of the product and start the cycle anew, maybe using the star filter this time. As technology has burgeoned over the last 20 years, anonymous or unknown reviewers have become more and more relied upon to shape our judgment in all aspects of our life. The idea of rating something is nothing new, but the proliferation of technology has allowed it to spread to even the most niche sectors. Law firms are one of the industries impacted by this rise in technology. Various sites and forums are devoted to the very task or rating firms. Why might this be problematic?

1) The Raters Are Overrated. We tend to be poor judges of our experiences, especially if we have limited context or reference points. What we may see as unreasonable, may be the norm for all employers in the industry — or vice versa. Regardless, we are prone to black and white thinking. Distributions of reviews tends towards bimodal distributions of reviews at one-star and five-star reviews. Furthermore, interpersonal factors have the largest correlation between good and bad reviews. One explanation for this is that overwhelming positive or negative experiences motivate us to actually review a product or company. [Research shows ](http://www.columbia.edu/~on2110/Papers/Schoenmueller_netzer_stahl_2018.pdf)that the more someone reviews, the more evenly distributed their reviews tend to be. When it comes to law firms, most reviewers have only practiced at a few firms and have limited comparison points.

Moreover, what exactly are we rating? The discrete parts that make up an overall review may be composed of completely different categories based on who you ask and are more a reflection on their values. If you value work-life balance, you may give a sweltering New York litigation powerhouse a one-star review based on your unhappiness with firm’s encroachment into your personal life. Others who thrive in pressure cookers might find the firm perfectly aligns with their preferences. If we look even more granularly, we see another reason why current and former employees make for unreliable reviewers.

2) A Rose Is Not A Rose Is Not A Rose. Overall firm reviews reside in a vacuum, stripped from the individual components that are summed to generate that rating. The problem with this is that firms vary wildly from office to office, and from practice to practice. The experience of working as an associate at one firm in New York could be diametrically different to the experience of working in their San Francisco office. Even going up one floor in the same office, you may find the real estate practice to have a completely different atmosphere compared to your corporate practice. The experience is somewhat akin to college, where your grade and interest in your class largely depends on the professor teaching. Ultimately, the firm decides who to hire and sets the tone for corporate culture. As firms expand, this becomes harder to instill and police and sometimes incongruent attorneys slip in through the cracks — or the prospective bottom-line boost is enough to discount or ignore red flags. I cannot recount how many times I’ve heard: “The firm would be perfect, if only I didn’t have to work for this partner.” However, basing a lateral decision on firm personnel can lead to another complication.

3) As Constant As A Northern Star. It will come as no shock to you, that attorneys like to move around firms. The constant churn muddies the waters and can make it difficult to get an accurate read on a firm. The friend who told you not to move to her former firm because of the cantankerous rainmaker who made her life hell may be surprised to find out that the rainmaker is now on a permanent golf tour across the world. Associates tend to lateral every three years on average, while partners tend to stay a little bit longer, hanging on for five years. Since the composition of firms is changing so often, there are really only a few sources of information that can give you an unbiased and accurate view of the current market.

If you haven’t guessed it already, one is legal recruiters. We talk to thousands of people every year from attorneys to firm chairs, and have our finger constantly on the pulse of the market so that we can guide our candidates to the firm that makes aligns with all of their personal and professional needs. Using a source like Vault or the U.S. News and World Report can be tricky when assessing a prospective employer. For other industries, the resources available and corporate culture largely dictate your experience in the company. However, because law firms are more decentralized and have access to largely the same resources, your local practice bubble will largely dictate whether you have a positive or negative experience.

# You Are Not Alone In Your Hatred Of The Biglaw Life
## 'It feels like my eight-year legal joyride earned me a top position as a corporate chauffeur.'

I do not enjoy my job. I detest the obligation to keep track of my time in billable six-minute increments and the enormous pressure to work as many of those increments as is humanly possible. Worse, I work as a junior member on teams of lawyers assembled to produce work I used to complete alone in less time. As far as I can tell, this arms race approach to litigation adds bureaucratic and political complexities while degrading the quality of the work we produce. In all events, my job bears little resemblance to my previous professional experiences, the ones that purportedly made me such an attractive hire. It feels like my eight-year legal joyride earned me a top position as a corporate chauffeur.

— [Isaac Lidsky](https://twitter.com/isaaclidsky), a [former child star](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0509240/) who graduated from Harvard Law School and in 2008 became the first blind Supreme Court clerk, [reflecting on his unhappy time](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/03/09/with-eyes-wide-open-blind-lawyer-recounts-scotus-clerkship-unhappy-law-firm-life/) at the Biglaw firm of Akin Gump. He left Biglaw in 2011, but the experience provides plenty of fodder in his [new book](http://www.lidsky.com/book/), [“Eyes Wide Open”](http://amzn.to/2nnByc4) (affiliate link).

# NYC Biglaw Associates Don't Seem Too Thrilled About 'Flexible' Office Return Policies
## Some of these policies aren't flexible at all, and associates aren't very happy about it.

With rents in Manhattan at a 33% increase, it’s absurd to expect us to be in the city for a job that could be done remotely without giving us a 33% salary bump.

— An anonymous Davis Polk associate’s response to a survey concerning [Biglaw firms’ return-to-office policies](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/02/remote-or-hybrid-light-the-differences-matter-to-attorneys-and-should-to-firms/) in our “post”-pandemic world. Davis Polk recently announced its own office-return policy, [mandating three days of in-office work](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/top-biglaw-firm-returns-to-the-office-with-mandatory-tuesday-thursday-attendance/) each week on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. The associate said the policy impacted their decision to explore lateral possibilities. Along the same lines, Milbank has asked associates to work in the office three days each week, and an anonymous associate said that while the [policy was “reasonable,” it was not “ideal.”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/02/remote-or-hybrid-light-the-differences-matter-to-attorneys-and-should-to-firms/) “I would gladly move to any firm paying associates the market rate if they would allow me to work 100% remotely,” they said.

# Biglaw Suffers Huge Blow In Malpractice Case Against Horrible Person
## Expert testimony dominates most malpractice suits. Why not legal malpractice suits?

With football season around the corner, it’s time to remember what a magnificent waste of carbon Daniel Snyder is. He’s the sort of guy who can own the most notoriously racist caricature in sports and also fairly, yet completely unironically, accused a newspaper’s cartoon of him as “racist.” Thankfully, he’s also the sort of guy whose sheer incompetence keeps his team an also-ran, proving there is some general thrust of karma out there.

Snyder is also at the center of a $22 million legal malpractice claim against Cadwalader, alleging that the firm gave him bad advice on an investment bank’s fee during a proxy fight. The agreement supposedly capped the bank’s fees at $2 million, but the bank later challenged the agreement and managed to win $10 million.

If that sounds like a complex legal question fraught with competing interpretations — you know, the sort of high stakes, nuanced question that might lead someone to hire Cadwalader in the first place — then Cadwalader, and their attorneys from Cravath, agree with you. That’s why they argued that they should be able to call a number of esteemed legal experts to testify as to the reasonableness of Cadwalader’s conduct. Snyder’s people disagreed.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice O. Peter Sherwood agreed with Snyder. From [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/08/07/judge-dings-cadwalader-defense-before-legal-malpractice-trial/):

With a jury trial scheduled to start next month, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice O. Peter Sherwood said there are only two versions of the facts” regarding events 13 years ago that may have resulted in injury to Red Zone — “neither of which involve matters outside the ken of the typical juror.”

In breaking news, the “typical juror” in Sherwood’s experience is a Harvard-educated attorney. Now expert legal testimony is always dicey, coming as close as it does to usurping the judge’s role as the one who dictates the meaning of the law to the jury. But malpractice hinges on whether or not the professional performed their job reasonably, which can only be sussed out through expert professional testimony. No one’s forcing a doctor to weather a medical malpractice claim without expert testimony; why in the world would attorneys in a complex transaction not be afforded the same courtesy?

But here we are. Daniel Snyder’s going to finagle his way to success in this one, isn’t he? At least Washington’s going to tank again.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Gets Brand New Office Out Of Group Lateral Hire
## That's one way to open a new office.

What’s the best way to open a new office in a market where there’s a great amount of demand? If you’re a high-powered Biglaw firm, you may find the answer in the latest lateral trend of big group moves. That’s what just happened at Holland & Knight, and the firm now has 17 new lawyers and a second Los Angeles office to show for it.

Holland & Knight — currently ranked at No. 33 on the Am Law 100, having brought home $1,402,502,000 gross revenue in 2021 — just absorbed lawyers from Pircher, Nichols & Meeks, a California real estate firm. The move is not being characterized as a merger, but rather, a big group hire.

Another Biglaw firm, White & Case, tried to make merger moves with Pircher in the past, but the firm turned the possibility down, opting instead to “remain a competitive boutique firm.” Why the change of heart? H&K is apparently a “much better fit.” [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/holland-knight-gets-new-la-office-by-absorbing-real-estate-law-firm-2022-06-16/) has additional details:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Tampa-founded Holland & Knight, which combined last summer with Dallas-based Thompson & Knight, will take over Pircher’s lease in Century City, a business district in Los Angeles. Holland & Knight also has an office in downtown Los Angeles, and two others in California. …

Holland & Knight says its real estate section has about 300 lawyers nationally. [Joseph] Guay, the [real estate] department leader, said the practice had its “best year ever” in 2021. With uncertainty ahead in the market with rising interest rates and inflation, the new team coming in can help as real estate clients may have to “pivot,” he said.

Is your Biglaw firm considering any massive lateral hires? That seems to be the way of the future when it comes to bringing in new talent.

# The Pandemic's Impact On The Legal Industry (Through April)
## The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says what we all know is true.

If you’re a regular reader of Above the Law, you will not be shocked to learn that COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on the legal industry. Damn near every day we are reporting on layoffs or furloughs or salary cuts or some other austerity measure designed to help firms maintain cash flow and navigate these uncertain times.

The latest [jobs report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics actually quantifies what even casual observers of the industry know is true — that the legal profession has lost a hella lot of jobs because of the coronavirus. According to BLS, there was a net loss of 64,000 jobs in the legal sector, bringing the total number of jobs in the industry down to 1,097,006. The April report also had updated stats for March, showing 1,700 legal sector jobs were lost that month.

Of course, it isn’t just the legal industry that has taken a hard hit during these tumultuous times. There have been massive job losses across the nation in all industries, a figure BLS puts at 20 million jobs lost in April. And unemployment rose by 10.3 percent, which is the largest monthly increase since January 1948, when records started being kept.

# Trial Lawyers Skew Democratic: What Does That Mean For Trump?

You’ve read elsewhere about the legal problems that Donald Trump will face now that he’s left the White House. But I haven’t seen anyone talk about this:  Plaintiff’s-side trial lawyers are a huge piece of the Democratic base. What does that mean for Trump?

We all know about Trump’s cash-flow problems. The New York Times has reported that he has hundreds of millions of dollars of debt coming due in the next few years. Much of that debt is secured by personal guarantees. And the properties that he could sell to service that debt have been hammered by the pandemic, probably leaving him in a tough cash-flow spot.

We all know about Trump’s other business problems. Being abandoned by the PGA and the folks who run the carousel in Central Park is high profile, but other stuff matters more. He’s lost his banks. He’s lost a big real estate leasing agent and at least one real estate broker. He’s lost at least two law firms.

It’s hard to salvage a business when everyone around you is quitting simultaneously. We’ll see how Trump does.

We all know that Trump faces possible criminal problems. On the available evidence, Trump chose not to pardon himself. (My criminal-procedure-professor buddy tells me that Trump could have pardoned himself secretly.  Even Joe Biden would not now be aware of the pardon. If indicted on federal charges, Trump could pull the pardon out of his pocket and offer it as a defense. On that score, I know what you know: Nothing.) But Trump certainly remains an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal case about Stormy Daniels that put Michael Cohen behind bars. Trump faces whatever the Manhattan District Attorney, a state prosecutor, has in mind. Trump faces whatever state prosecutors are investigating over his phone call to election officials in Georgia. Trump faces whatever the Department of Justice unearths in the investigation of his speech that preceded the storming of the Capitol.

We all know that Trump faces civil litigation. Matters are pending for sexual misconduct, defamation, and a fraud purportedly committed on Trump’s niece, Mary Trump. Dominion Voting Systems sued Sidney Powell for allegedly having said untrue things about how Dominion’s machines performed during the 2020 election. Do you really think Trump will avoid a similar lawsuit? And clever lawyers will surely generate theories to pursue Trump for the storming of the Capitol. Remember: They didn’t get O.J. in the criminal case; they got him in a civil wrongful death case. They might not get Trump for sedition, but who do you think the survivors of the Capitol Police (and others) killed and injured in the attack will choose to sue? Maybe the prominent deep pocket, do you think?

We know all that.

Here’s the new twist that I’m adding today: Plaintiff’s-side trial lawyers skew Democratic. Trump is a prime target: He’s at least temporarily rich. He’s at least temporarily high profile. Suing Trump would attract an awful lot of attention for a trial lawyer. Actually winning a case against Trump would be worth even more.

Won’t the trial lawyers be salivating over Trump’s past, and shadowing Trump every step of the way into his future, to be sure that he gets sued for every appropriate claim (and maybe then some)?

That’s a lot of days in deposition, and that’s a lot of litigation risk.

As long as I’m adding new thoughts, I’ll add this one, too. Isn’t Congress duty-bound to conduct an investigation of the recent assault on the Capitol? As part of that investigation, aren’t those who arguably incited the assault necessary witnesses? Won’t we see Trump be put under oath as part of that investigation, or will some members of Congress decide that comprehensively investigating the assault on the Capitol poses too much political risk?

Even if Trump manages to beat the rap, he’s in for a long, terrifying ride.

Late last week, Alec Baldwin fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, 42, with a prop gun on the movie set of the film “Rust.” Baldwin had been told that the gun was “cold,” indicating that it didn’t have live rounds. Halyna leaves behind her husband, Matt Hutchins, a corporate associate in the Los Angeles office of Latham & Watkins, as well as their nine-year-old son.

As noted by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/alec-baldwin-shooting-victim-was-wife-latham-watkins-lawyer-2021-10-22/), Hutchins joined Latham as an associate earlier this year. According to his LinkedIn profile, the Harvard Law grad is an alumnus of Skadden and Kirkland & Ellis, who also worked in-house at an entertainment company.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Hutchins and Baldwin have been in touch, and the attorney says the actor has been supportive. On Friday night, Hutchins spoke out on social media for the first time about the loss of his wife. This is what he said on Twitter:

Halyna inspired us all with her passion and vision, and her legacy is too meaningful to encapsulate in words. Our loss is enormous, and we ask that the media please respect my family’s privacy as we process our grief. We thank everyone for sharing images and stories of her life.

For those who wish to honor Halyna, a rising star in her industry, the American Film Institute has established a scholarship in her memory. Click [here](https://www.afi.com/halyna-hutchins-scholarship-fund/?form=FUNYUNXCHMH) to donate.

We at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Halyna and Matt Hutchins during this especially difficult time.

# Associate Furloughs And Other Cost-Cutting Measures At This Am Law 200 Firm
## Tipsters say there are 'deep cuts' at the firm.

Did you think that maybe, with reports that we are apparently [at the peak of COVID-19 cases](https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-19-coronavirus-peak-estimate/), that we should be (slowly) returning to normal soon? Well, I believed in Santa Claus until 5th grade so, who am I to judge wishful thinking?

In any event, the COVID-19 austerity measures are still going strong in Biglaw. The latest firm we have intel on is Brown Rudnick, [ranked 141](https://www.law.com/international-edition/law-firm-profile/?id=5920&name=Brown-Rudnick-LLP) in the most recent Am Law 200 rankings. We’ve heard from multiple tipsters that there were “deep cuts” and that associate furloughs have been going on there, but as a tipster noted, “these have all been stealth and there is a lot of confusion about who is out. It is being touted as merciful.” Another tipster noted that the confusion extended beyond the furloughs:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Now this morning they announced furloughs of employees (although it’s unclear who exactly has been furloughed, I know of several associates who have been furloughed). And they are cutting pay for all attorneys by at least 10%, although exact amounts are unknown.”

Other associates have placed the amount of the salary cuts at 25 percent through August. When we reached out to the firm, they clarified that the pay reduction for associates is 7.5 percent on an annualized basis (which, I’m no math whiz, sounds a lot like a 25 percent cut for only a few months of the year). Associates also report a delay on their 2019 bonuses which were supposed to be paid (in full) in March:

Unfortunately, our bonuses are paid in March because we are on a fiscal year ending in Feb., which coincided with the lockdowns. They delayed the bonus process and will be paying 1/3 this month with the remainder some time later this year (or early next). All the associates think the remaining 2/3 won’t happen or that they will just condense it into next year’s bonus and eliminate the 2020 “fiscal” year.

Let’s hope associates see the remainder of the 2019 bonuses as soon as possible.

Partners are also seeing a cut in their draws, though the firm will not comment on specific figures for equity draws.

When reached for comment, firm Chairman and CEO Bill Baldiga had this to say:

“The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has impacted law firms like many other businesses. Brown Rudnick has taken expense management steps during these uncertain times. The firm is dedicated to its lawyers and staff and has implemented a proactive plan to provide solid financial standing for the firm that does not involve layoffs. The firm continues to operate uninterrupted for our clients, and we hope the global work disruption will be a short term impact.  We have positioned the firm’s diverse practices for future success.”

Good luck to the firm as it tries to weather the COVID-19 storm.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Trademark protection for colors holds significant value as colors have become important marketing tools for brands, particularly in the evolving trend of minimalistic branding with fewer logos. One example is the success of Bottega Veneta, which experienced a resurgence in popularity in 2021 after a rebranding effort. As part of this effort, Bottega introduced products with its prominent “Bottega Green” color during Bottega’s spring 2021 ready-to-wear collection. The vibrant color brought a young and modern vibe to the company and contributed to increasing sales by 9.3% from 2020. “Bottega Green” was even named color of the year in 2021 by many media outlets. By introducing a distinct and memorable bright green hue, Bottega was successful in creating a strong visual association between the color and the brand.

Similar to Bottega Veneta, many iconic brands have successfully associated themselves with a particular hue, promoting immediate recognition in the eyes of consumers. From Tiffany & Co.’s iconic blue to Christian Louboutin’s vibrant red, these colors have become synonymous with the companies they represent. While it is acknowledged that color alone may be the subject of a trademark, obtaining a trademark registration for a color is more challenging than for more typical word or logo marks. I will explore the importance of single-color marks and some of the specific challenges brands face in this process of obtaining them.

Courts in the United States have acknowledged that a single-color mark is not inherently distinctive for the purpose of eligibility for federal trademark registration. Moreover, the statutory definition of trademarks does not include color. However, the Supreme Court in Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., acknowledged that color alone can be eligible for trademark protection where it has acquired distinctiveness in the minds of the consumers. Establishing that a color has acquired distinctiveness (sometimes called “secondary meaning”) is not a simple matter.  It requires the applicant or plaintiff to provide persuasive evidence that the color has come to identify the source of the goods — without serving any other significant function.  Factors that can prevent a color from serving as a source identifier include purely ornamental purposes, where the color is used solely for aesthetic appeal or to make an object visually appealing. If a color is primarily “functional” or utilitarian, it may not acquire the necessary distinctiveness to indicate source, and cannot, therefore, serve as a trademark. Examples include using a specific color to indicate flavor (brown for chocolate), or characteristics of a product (red for “hot,” yellow or orange for visibility/“caution.”).

The most famous example of a single-color mark in the industry involves the famous shoe brand, Christian Louboutin, which has been using a distinct red color on the soles of its shoes since 1992. Louboutin filed a trademark application in 2008 for the red outer sole design element on its shoes, which was approved by the USPTO. In 2011, Louboutin filed a lawsuit against Yves Saint Laurent (YSL), alleging that YSL infringed on its red sole trademark by selling a monochrome red shoe that also included a red sole. The District Court had originally rejected Louboutin’s claim, stating that color was per se not capable of being a trademark. YSL filed a counterclaim seeking to invalidate Louboutin’s red sole mark and registration on grounds including that the color red as used was not distinctive, but instead merely ornamental and functional, and have long been used on outer soles by many other brands. The Second Circuit found error in the District Court’s decision and held that the red sole mark was a valid and enforceable trademark where the red soles contrasted with the shoes’ upper component because the red sole had acquired distinctiveness — secondary meaning. Specifically, the Second Circuit recognized that Louboutin had met the test of showing distinctiveness, such that that the color became a symbol of the brand — a trademark. This evidence included the designer’s advertising expenditures, media coverage, and sales success over 20 years of use and fostered worldwide recognition insofar as the red sole popped in contrast to the color of the upper part of the shoe. However, the court found that because Louboutin’s trademark was limited to uses in which the red outer sole contrasts with the color of the remainder of the shoe, and Louboutin sought to enjoin YSL from using a red sole as part of a monochrome red shoe, the District Court’s denial for an injunction against YSL is affirmed.

Besides Christian Louboutin, other notable examples of  companies successfully acquiring trademark rights for specific colors include UPS, and Tiffany & Co. UPS holds a service mark registration for its distinctive “Pullman” brown color, which is used as a service mark on delivery vehicles and clothing of delivery personnel. Tiffany & Co. has maintained trademarks and service marks for its iconic robin’s egg blue since the 1990s, covering a wide range of goods and services that have become synonymous with the brand. The association of Tiffany & Co. with the blue color dates back to as early as 1889, further solidifying its status as a recognized and protected brand identifier.

In addition to securing trademarks for their actual products, brands often seek trademark registration for their product packaging, which can be easier to obtain. For example, Hermès has secured trademark rights for a specific orange hue used on the exterior of their merchandise boxes and Glossier has trademark rights for its pink shade as applied to bags holding its cosmetics and skincare products.

In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc., 529 U.S. 205 (2000), the Supreme Court considered a trademark suit involving the configuration of baby clothes. It famously held that product configurations could never be “inherently distinctive,” and required a showing of acquired distinctiveness, while product packaging could be inherently distinctive depending on the facts.  Moreover, the Federal Circuit relied on Wal-Mart v. Samara to highlight the difference between colors applied to the products themselves and colors applied to the product packaging.  In that case, the Federal Circuit recognized that a multi-color mark used on product packaging does not require acquired distinctiveness, but “can be inherently distinctive when used on product packaging, depending upon the character of the color design.” Referring to the Supreme Court, the Federal Circuit noted that “inherent distinctiveness turns on whether consumers would be predisposed to ‘equate the [color] feature with the source.'”

However, for many companies, color does not act as a strong enough source indicator to acquire trademark protection. A notable example is General Mills’ attempt to register a trademark for the yellow color of the box in which Cheerios cereal has been packaged since the 1940s. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) denied the application, reasoning that General Mills failed to show that consumers equate the yellow color with the brand. The TTAB also noted that the fact that other companies also use yellow boxes for cereal indicates that the yellow serves as “eye-catching ornamentation customarily used for the packaging of breakfast cereals generally,” rather than a source identifier.

As the Supreme Court recently affirmed in Abitron Austria GmbH v. Hetronic Int’l, Inc., No. 21-1043 (2023), trademark rights are territorial. For example, Japan serves as a good illustration that trademark laws and regulations vary by country or region (e.g. the European Union). While the Japan Patent Office (JPO) has approved of multi-color marks such as the red, orange, and green 7-Eleven signs, the JPO has to date rejected the registration of all single-color marks. Hermès and Louboutin have even faced significant challenges when trying to obtain the same trademark protection they maintain in the United States in Japan. For example, in May 2023, the JPO rejected an appeal from Hermès for the registration of its orange and brown colors as used on its packaging. Hermès presented evidence of a survey of high-income individuals in their 30s to 50s where 43.1% of individuals identified Hermès when shown its signature orange and brown boxes in order to prove acquired distinctiveness. However, the JPO maintained that the survey pool was too narrowly limited and even within the pool less than half linked the colors to the brand.

Moreover, the United States is unique in according trademark rights based on actual use of the mark in commerce. Consequently, even if the USPTO may not recognize a company’s color mark as eligible for registration, there is a chance the District Court might.

While single-color marks can gain trademark protection, registration of a single color is still more the exception than the rule.  Companies can enhance the value of their resources by consulting trademark counsel to select, market, and promote their color within a carefully crafted plan to acquire distinctiveness.

# Insane Partisanship And The Trump Search Warrant

I advocate in this space for thinking intelligently, which often means reversing the identities of the political parties in a given situation and deciding if the reversal would cause you to react differently.

So here’s today’s thought experiment: We don’t know which party controls the presidency. We therefore don’t know the party of the attorney general. We know only that someone in the Department of Justice wanted to obtain a search warrant. The situation was sufficiently high-profile that the attorney general personally had to sign off on obtaining the warrant. The warrant was then presented to a federal judge (or magistrate judge) for approval. That judge knew that this was a very sensitive search and thus probably fly-specked the warrant to within an inch of its life. The warrant was issued, and the FBI conducted the search.

What’s your reaction?

There’s only one sane reaction to this news: Let’s wait and see. We know nothing about the basis for the warrant. We don’t know what evidence the search unearthed. We don’t know what the high-profile individual whose premises were being searched might have done or what the evidence might show.

All we can rationally do is wait and see.

Now, suppose that a Democratic attorney general authorized applying for the search warrant, and the person who was searched was named Trump.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Every rabid partisan Republican screams that the search was an outrage. Kevin McCarthy says that Attorney General Merrick Garland should “[preserve [his] documents and clear [his] calendar](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/263826309449383092).” Josh Hawley, a graduate of Yale Law School, says that Garland “[must resign or be impeached](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/263826309449383092).” Fox News suggests that the FBI probably [planted evidence](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/263826309449383092), and most Republican politicians with an eye on the presidency quickly follow suit.  

Why do we even listen to these people?

The folks make you madder, because they imply the opposing party has done something wrong, and they make you stupider, because they imply that you have a sufficient basis to make a judgment when in fact you’re in total ignorance.

But fair is fair; reverse my hypothetical. Assume that a Republican attorney general authorized applying for the search warrant, and the person who was searched was named Biden.

It’s entirely possible that every rabid Democratic partisan would engage in precisely the stupidity that the Republicans engaged in last week.

Which is why I’ve come to hate them all.

We shouldn’t elect these people. We shouldn’t listen to these people.

Where’s a politician who reacts thoughtfully to events?

And if you reacted to the search warrant by immediately assuming that it was either right or wrong, then what does that say about your ability to think clearly?

# Law Firms, Don’t Throw It All Away
## Law firm leaders seem hell-bent on undoing all the progress we’ve made as a profession.

Earlier this year, Bloomberg Law [surveyed](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/analysis-hours-data-show-the-sweet-spot-for-lawyer-satisfaction) over 1,500 lawyers to ask them about working habits and job satisfaction. Roughly 59% of attorneys reported being “satisfied” with their work conditions — a number Bloomberg’s researchers considered pleasantly, surprisingly high. To which I had to say, “Seriously?” More than four out of 10 members of our profession aren’t satisfied with their jobs, and we’re calling that a win?

Look, I understand statistics mean different things depending on their contexts. A baseball player who gets a hit on 59% of at-bats is a Hall of Famer, while a player who only catches 59% of the balls thrown their way won’t be playing much longer. But it doesn’t seem like a stretch to say that 59% job satisfaction qualifies our industry for a big, fat F. It’s only our abysmally low expectations for ourselves that can make those kinds of numbers seem good.

Job dissatisfaction can be poisonous, both to individuals and teams. Dissatisfied lawyers leave their jobs or quit the profession altogether. Their unhappiness can leech joy from otherwise satisfied people, or outright turn a team dynamic sour. As law firm leaders, we want our people feeling happy and fulfilled. Our firms need to be places our people can aspire to be more than they are; not places people aspire to get the heck out of at 5 p.m. It’s our obligation to figure out ways to engage our attorneys and give them the satisfaction that they need to flourish.

A Way Out

Bloomberg did offer a tantalizing idea of how to address this satisfaction gap. One of the correlations it noted was that the attorneys who reported they were overall satisfied with their situation tended to have more years in the practice under their belts than their less-satisfied colleagues.

I don’t think this is just a case of professional Stockholm Syndrome, where spending more time in an unpleasant situation makes you come around to actually liking it. Rather, it makes sense to me that the practice itself tends to change the longer we’re in it, and those changes are what bring that sense of satisfaction.

Consider how most of our careers in private practice began as junior associates. Most of us started out not working on grand strategies or courtroom dramatics but with basic research and writing. That kind of work is essential to an associate’s growth as an attorney, and it helps that associate to develop the trust of their senior associates and early clients. But it also is work that an associate rarely has much sense of control or agency over. The work is defined by the senior attorney, the deadlines are set, and it just needs to get done.

As junior attorneys gain experience, their agency over their work experience increases. The work they’re handed covers a broader spectrum, and they often have more ways they can choose to accomplish their goals. Eventually, young attorneys start calling the shots on their own cases, and perhaps passing work down. As an attorney becomes more experienced, and especially as they grow their book of business, their ability to shape their day-to-day working experience increases exponentially.

How can this be done in practice? Providing lawyers with more control over their work environment is a big step toward the goal, but certainly not the only part. Agency increases with access to information. Businesses and leaders who trust their employees enough to share more information will find they get a more engaged workforce that cares about the investment. Leaders can increase this sense of agency by listening to employees to get feedback and then integrate what they hear into decisions. Workers in turn feel more invested in the firm or business and that they’re more than just hamsters running in wheels.

I think it’s that increased sense of self-determination that is at the heart of much of the job satisfaction we feel — or don’t — in this industry. The more say people have over how their day-to-day experience is shaped, the more they’re going to tend to enjoy that experience. As law firm leaders, we should be doing what we can to increase our teams’ sense of personal agency and flexibility.

If increasing employees’ sense of control can be accomplished with relatively small steps, why are so many firms falling all over themselves to run in the other direction?

From Pilot and Above The Law  
 Don’t Break What We’re Already Fixing

As I’ve [discussed in this space before](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/navigating-treacherous-legal-waters/), COVID-19 has shaken our profession to its core and caused our industry to move as fast as I’ve ever seen it toward embracing new technologies and more innovative ways of doing business. Associates in particular have responded [overwhelmingly positively](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/23/midlevel-associates-arent-satisfied-with-law-firms-return-to-office-plans/) to these changes. Many see the practice of law as finally catching up to promises that it’s been making for decades.

Yet law firm leaders continue to insist on snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory. Flexibility programs are [being rolled back](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/kirkland-reopening/?rf=1). Law firm leaders that held Zoom meetings with staff members and associates for a few months last year are reverting back to the silent, close-to-the-vest formula that’s defined the legal industry for so long. Firms aren’t inviting feedback as much — perhaps because they won’t like what they hear. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine what it means to be a lawyer, and many leadership teams are opting for “exactly what we used to do — but we can also Zoom with our clients now.”

Why are we throwing away our chance to dramatically improve the experience of some of the 41 percent of attorneys who aren’t satisfied with their professional circumstances? This is a complicated question, but the answer may start with looking at what current law firm partners had to sacrifice to earn their positions. They likely spent 50-plus hours per week in the office for years on end. They likely had work dumped on them late on a Friday as associates. They likely missed kids’ birthdays and vacations. Their sense of agency was beaten back by the law firm hierarchical culture. Although they’ve become more senior and have earned more agency, at some level deep down, there may be a conscious or subconscious feeling that it’s unfair that the next generation can get similar types of control and freedom without going through the same hardships.

These same partners are also likely reaping significant financial rewards in their position, so there’s a bias toward keeping the structure that has contributed to their success the same — fearing that a fundamental change might jeopardize it. If it ain’t broken for me, why fix it?

Happiness Is A Choice

Yet for all of the understandable reasons why law firm leaders and partners may want to revert to old ways, the fact is that the misery that permeates the law firm experience for many isn’t a necessary feature. For many firms, it’s a choice. Unhappiness doesn’t have to be the default in the practice of law. We’ve always had the power to make the experience of our profession better than it is.

For all of the horrible tragedy that COVID-19 has brought to the world, it’s also created an opportunity for firms to embrace a business model that is more consistent with a happy, satisfied lifestyle. Smart firms will use the COVID-19 era as not just a catalyst new ways of working but also as an opportunity to embrace new policies that improve employees’ sense that they matter, are a valued part of the organization, and have some control over their lives. They will embrace flexible working where possible. They will share more information. They will consistently communicate more. They will seek feedback from employees at all levels — and act on it.

Firms that embrace these changes, capitalize on the progress they’ve already made, and move further into the future will be the ones that attract top talent and outpace the competition. The others will scratch their heads about their diminishing stature and continue to pat themselves on the back for achieving 59% job satisfaction.

# Biglaw Firm's Chair To Step Down Due To 'Health-Related' Reasons
## This serves as a reminder for all attorneys to take their health more seriously, and to not place their jobs over their wellbeing.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Earlier today, I informed the partnership that I have made the difficult decision to step down as chair, effective April 2024 for health-related reasons. This is not a decision that I have taken lightly and, while I will be fine, I will be turning my attention to my health. Doing so will not allow me to devote the time and energy that the role of chair requires and deserves.

Being chair of Proskauer is an honor, and I am immensely proud of our firm’s strength and success and excited to see where we go next.

— [Steven Ellis](https://www.proskauer.com/professionals/steven-ellis), chairman of Proskauer Rose, in a [memo sent firmwide](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/12/06/citing-health-related-reasons-ellis-to-step-down-at-proskauer/) concerning his decision to step down from his role due to health-related reasons. Ellis was reelected to his second term as chair in January 2020, and led the elite firm through the pandemic, including its best year ever in 2021. “Proskauer is in a strong position, as we continue to grow our high-value practices and strengthen our industry leadership,” Ellis wrote to the firm. “We remain a place where clients come for their most critical, important, complex and novel matters.” Proskauer will hold an election to fill his position in January, and the newly elected chair will take his place in April 2024.

A typical day in the life of an entertainment law transactional attorney might involve:

- Drafting and negotiating development and production contracts, such as writer agreements, talent agreements, and recording agreements.
- Facilitating and negotiating distribution deals for an entertainment project.
- Working on financing agreements for sponsorships, bank loans, co-production investments, grants, and other types of investments.
- Preparing form agreements for clients, such as appearance releases, location releases, and license agreements.
- Reviewing contracts and other legal documents to analyze rights issues or other business or legal questions.
This work involves legal concepts across multiple subject areas, including intellectual property, contracts, business associations, securities law, and labor and employment law. In addition to understanding these substantive areas of law, entertainment law attorneys help clients with projects that are not necessarily considered traditional legal work, but have legal and business implications, such as reviewing and commenting on pitches and budgets for television series, films, mobile apps, or other entertainment projects.

Although entertainment law encompasses all of the sectors of the entertainment industry, entertainment transactional attorneys tend to focus on one or two entertainment sectors, as each sector has its own industry norms. For example, attorneys serving music industry clients often specialize in that sector. Similarly, other attorneys focus on television or film industry clients. Across all of the sectors, transactions arise in the development, financing, production, and distribution phases of an entertainment project.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Depending on the project, entertainment lawyers can spend a lot of time on the phone or email with clients and opposing counsel to work through contract and deal issues and to solve problems related to production and other phases of an entertainment project.

- Who do you work with?
Junior associates generally work with senior associates or directly with partners. However, junior associates can gain responsibility quickly for some deals, including drafting and negotiating simpler production agreements, such as releases, talent agreements and independent contractor agreements. Law firm entertainment attorneys also consult with specialists within the firm, including labor and employment, trademark, and copyright counsel, as well as entertainment practitioners specialized in other industry sectors.
Some entertainment attorneys work directly with celebrity clients as their personal attorneys. These clients often have a team of business and legal advisers, including agents, managers, and attorneys. Many more entertainment attorneys work with other entertainment industry clients, including studio and network executives, producers, financiers, and, of course, other lawyers.

- What does a common career path look like?
Law firm to in-house and sometimes back to law firm. Given the location of the industry, Los Angeles and New York have the highest concentration of law firms that specialize in entertainment law and entertainment companies with in-house legal departments. Outside of those cities, it’s not uncommon for attorneys to start practicing in another area of law, such as general corporate, mergers and acquisitions, or securities work, and then move into entertainment law, usually in-house but sometimes in a firm. A general transactional practice, especially if it involves some securities or other finance work, or IP licensing experience can be a useful background for practicing entertainment law. Major entertainment companies, such as motion picture studios and television networks, have significant in-house legal departments and hire relatively young attorneys. They often hire law firm associates with two or more years of experience to work in their legal and business affairs departments. In-house attorneys sometimes move back to a law firm seeking a more diverse practice.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?
Mild to super hot. At a law firm, practice can be quite varied, with clients simultaneously at all stages of development, production, and distribution of entertainment projects. In-house attorneys, however, may be more specialized and have less variety in their work. For example, in-house business affairs attorneys may work primarily on a large volume of just a couple of types of agreements. But of course that is not always the case, especially in smaller companies, where attorneys may need to be able to handle any type of legal work the company needs.

New issues often come up even for routine matters, whether because of the relationship of the parties, new technology, or other developments in the entertainment industry. These changes help keep the work interesting and allow attorneys to continue learning and growing.

- How much wear and tear?
This is a transactional practice, so the pace and expectations are similar to other transactional practices and are largely deal driven. Long-lead projects can proceed at a more leisurely pace, while short-term projects, say with an airdate or principal photography start date in the near future, proceed at a very fast pace. Expectations are high not only because money and reputations are at stake, but also because creators and others can be very passionate about a project.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
Most people practicing entertainment law are in the field because they like the substantive work as well as the clients. It is unusual to find entertainment transactional attorneys who hate the actual work. However, time pressure and tight budgets, and clients under pressure from those factors, can create significant stress for attorneys.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
Many entertainment attorneys have a personal interest in the industry, such as a love for music, television, theater or film, or may themselves be musicians or artists. They enjoy helping creators, financiers and distributors bring their projects to life and to an audience. Although entertainment lawyers may attend film premieres and entertainment awards shows, the day-to-day work is not nearly as glamorous. Nonetheless, many attorneys love being an essential part of a creative or meaningful project.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
It is quite common for mid-level associates to move in-house to studios, networks, and other distributors or content providers. Entertainment lawyers are sometimes called on to evaluate financial plans, production budgets, business plans, and creative pitches. This experience can be valuable for moving from legal work to a business development or hybrid business/legal role, such as in the business affairs department of a studio or network.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
Technology trends. The digital revolution and the resulting changes in the music industry and in television/film distribution have dramatically impacted the entertainment business, such as the development of streaming music and video as distribution platforms. These changes have in turn affected legal practice and industry norms.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
A key quality for successful entertainment lawyers is an interest in learning about the not-so-sexy business side of the entertainment industry, including budgeting, financing, and profit participations. They must also have the ability to handle many matters simultaneously, while also being efficient, thorough, and mindful of legal budgets. Finally, they should have curiosity and interest in keeping up with and understanding developments in technology and business practices in the entertainment industry.

Rudy Giuliani Week: Part 2 (Photo by Rob Kim/Getty)

* According to Rudy Giuliani, if special counsel Robert Mueller issues a subpoena, Donald Trump “[doesn’t] have to” comply with it. After all, “[h]e’s the president of the United States. [He] can assert the same privileges other presidents have.” And he has no plans to allow Trump to sit for an interview with Mueller — Giuliani won’t allow him to “walk him into a prosecution for perjury.” Admitting during a TV interview that your client is a liar? Check.

Many law students and lawyers alike have long dreamed of someday working in New York, the city that never sleeps (especially if they wind up as Biglaw associates). New York firms are regarded as the crown jewels of the legal profession, and it’s in New York where firms typically set the stage for Biglaw salaries and bonuses across the country. But which firm is considered the best in the Big Apple?

Thanks to Vault’s recently released [regional rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/vaults-top-law-firms-by-practice-area-and-region-2023/), we now know which Biglaw firms are dominating the legal scene in Manhattan. This ranking is based on votes tabulated from associates who were asked to rate firms on a 1 to 10 scale based on their prestige within the region.

Here are the top 10 most prestigious firms in New York (you can see the full list from Vault by clicking [here](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/new-york)):

- Cravath, Swaine & Moore (up from #2)
- Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (down from #1)
- Davis Polk & Wardwell
- Skadden
- Sullivan & Cromwell
- Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Latham & Watkins
- Debevoise & Plimpton (up from #12)
It’s worth noting that several of these firms are known as compensation leaders, with Cravath, Skadden, and Simpson Thacher each having been the first to announce bonuses throughout the years, and Cravath and Davis Polk each raising the stakes on associate salaries in recent years. Just outside the top 10, we find Milbank — a firm that has taken the lead in raising associate salaries and bonuses since 2018 — at No, 13, up from No. 16 in the 2021 rankings.

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made the latest edition of Vault’s New York rankings. How did your firm do this time around?

# Biglaw Bonus Blitz Continues With Big Bucks Announcement
## Biglaw = big money.

If you thought that Milbank’s decision to announce their 2019 year end bonuses early — [November 7th to be precise](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) — would slow the rest of their Biglaw colleagues from matching, well, you were wrong. Sure, it took Cravath the weekend[ to decide to match that standard](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/), but once that happened the bonus announcements for the top of the Biglaw heap have been[ coming fast and furious.](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/associate-bonus-watch-2019/)

The latest firm to make their associates’ bonus dreams come true is Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Earlier today, the elite firm matched the market bonus scale.[ ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/)That bonus schedule is as follows:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000

# Judge Delivers Stinging Rebuke To Partners For Freezing Out Associates
## This may come as a shock, but he wasn't pleased.

But I would be remiss if I did not observe the irony of another missed opportunity to invest in our profession’s future when two of the motions originally noticed for hearing seek massive fees and costs. To be clear, GSI asks for $6,810,686.69 in attorney’s fees, $1,828,553.07 in non-taxable costs and $337,300.86 in taxable costs, while UMI asks for $6,694,562 in attorney’s fees, $648,166 in expenses and $302,579.70 in taxable costs. That a few more dollars could not be spent is disappointing to me. My disappointment, however, is unlikely to compare to the disappointment of the associates, who were deprived yet again of an opportunity to argue in court.

— Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal, responding to the decision of DLA Piper and Ruyak Cherian to waive oral argument rather than [allow associates to argue](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/proof-that-law-firms-dont-really-care-about-associate-development/) a handful of post-trial motions. Nothing stings like, “I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed.”

# Biglaw DEI Head Frustrated By General Criticism, Storms Off To LinkedIn For Support

When you see someone advocating for diversity, they usually tie it with an actionable item. When Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton met with Above the Law, we talked about the importance of diversity and [planned to defend it by pressuring Biden to nominate more Black judges](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/when-there-are-50-pressure-mounts-for-president-biden-to-assist-diversifying-the-judiciary/). When Kimberlé Crenshaw met with us to discuss the actual meaning of intersectionality and the fight to do damage control on right-wing misuses of it and the term “Critical Race Theory,” she asked readers to join in on the 3rd Annual Critical Race Theory Summer School [so that they can learn about CRT while getting their CLEs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/whose-intersectionality-anyway-kimberle-crenshaw-clears-up-some-crt-confusions/). Unfortunately, things can’t always be that simple.

After the SFFA v. Harvard decision, law firms are more cautious about if and how they advocate for diversity, likely for fear of being sued. While understandable, that usually results in wishy-washy or non-committal platitudes about the importance of diversity with no clear discussion of the most vital part of advocacy: implementation. In short, you end up with all vibes and no process. This non-committal ethos also extends to how diversity efforts are discussed in public. For an example, here is a excerpt from a Bloomberg article titled[ Law Firms Boost Diversity Defenses After Conservative Backlash](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-boost-diversity-defenses-after-conservative-backlash):

[  ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Law firms are actively defending diversity efforts after conservative attacks and a slowing economy threaten gains.

Davis Wright Tremaine is boosting diversity, equity and inclusion education through panels, LinkedIn posts and opinion pieces. “There’s more of a call to explain it,” Yusuf Zakir, the firm’s DEI chief, said in an interview.

Prior to SFFA, a firm “actively defending diversity efforts” would have looked like them mic dropping their well-funded summer associate program for Blacks and Latinos or bragging about the number of their Pacific Islander equity partners. Hell, Cooley put their money where their mouths were back in 2020 and donated $750k to Black Lives Matter “[as part of a commitment to taking action to end systemic racism](https://www.cooley.com/news/coverage/2020/2020-06-04-black-lives-matter).” With these things in mind, framing the “call to explain” the attack on DEI and some opinion pieces as “actively defending diversity efforts” comes up short. I thought that this would be an uncontroversial position. I was wrong. Davis Wright Tremaine’s Chief of DEI Yusuf Zakir had this, among other things to say:

One of the risks of speaking up is that, sometimes, people find ways to mischaracterize what you say (and sometimes, they do this just to get a few extra clicks).

In this case, Chris Williams from Above the Law misinterpreted a quote of mine in his article.

In a thoughtful Bloomberg Law piece written by Tatyana Monnay, Tatyana asked me about what we were doing at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP in the face of anti-DEI backlash. We spent an hour talking, including a robust discussion of our DWT DEI strategy.

One of the things I said, which she fairly quoted me on, was that I was using different platforms (including LinkedIn and panels) to vocally advocate in support of DEI. In the face of the vocal anti-DEI backlash, I am compelled to be just as vocal in response. These are not the standard diversity debates of the past – these are existential. I told her this was taking up a larger portion of my time than before.

Chris took my quote to somehow imply that this was ALL we were doing at DWT on DEI. I’m not sure how he could jump to that conclusion from a sentence in the Bloomberg article, but he did. Based on his conclusion, he compared our efforts to the meme of Justin Bieber wearing a “Racism is Evil” sweatshirt (a snarky reference – credit for that).

For reference, [this](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/linkedin-activism-is-cool-but-wed-rather-see-you-actually-hire-diverse-applicants/) is what he’s responding to. Feels weird to quote myself, but c’est la vie:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

… Actively defending diversity efforts with posts and panels? I’m gonna be honest with you — that just reads like the suit-and-tie version of this:

Nah this still got me crying Justin Bieber really tried to end racism with this 😭😭 [pic.twitter.com/XmPVMcc3Vi](https://t.co/XmPVMcc3Vi)

— 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗲𝘇𝘆’😵‍💫 (@OvOBrezzzy) [February 25, 2023](https://twitter.com/OvOBrezzzy/status/1629307276245757958?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

To the firms making concrete moves to develop DEI, that’s great. That said, diversity discussions have been ongoing for years now. At this point, you should lead with concrete actions and strategies being deployed, not by centering LinkedIn lessons and pro DEI articles.

Now, I like to throw out a spicy take every now and again, but I think that this is one of the tamest things I’ve ever said on the site that someone has had this adverse of a reaction to. As to DEI being great, I’ll just assume Zakir and I agree. As far as the timeline of these diversity discussions, [here’s a law review article discussing the need for diversity in law firms from 1993](https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1420&context=lawineq) — that’s about 30 years ago for those of you who don’t want to break out their calculators. Is it really that bonkers to say, “Hey, we’ve done enough talking, let’s lead with the action items”? Because Stephen Miller and Edward Blum aren’t leading with LinkedIn articles about affirmative action being bad, they’re leading with lawsuits. [And they are winning](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/edward-blum-breaks-up-bigot-brigade-for-now/). You know, actionables! And when you do get a soundbite from one of the anti-DEI talking heads, it’s something that’s confrontational and easy to digest like Elon Musk saying “[DEI is another word for racism](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/inclusion-equity-diversity/elon-musk-dei-racist),” not something that promises to address the issue at a later time like “We will cover it later on LinkedIn.” Is talking about DEI important? Yes. That’s why it is important to call out when pieces “actively defending” it use the Gnome plan for diversifying the field.

If you disagree, I welcome you to [read the article](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-boost-diversity-defenses-after-conservative-backlash) and find the part that goes “Here’s the plan.” Take all the time you need.

Was my article an attack on Zakir or DWT? No, it was a critique of what counts as an “active defense of diversity,” a call to have some action items in your coverage, and a call for law firms to publicly implement actionable items that increase diversity at their firms. In case Zakir or anyone else didn’t make it to the bottom of the article where I said this, I’ll re-print it here:

If firms are going to start making trends of posting how important their diversity advocacy is, it better be tied to some concrete action. Make a post about some diverse hires. Name some diverse partners — actual partners, and not the glass ceiling that gets dressed up as non-equity partner. And for the love of all that is billable, throw some scholarships out there that match what you preach.

A person having a normal time of it would have said “Oh, my firm does that!” and went on their merry way. Instead, Zakir made a bunch of accusations about me missing the point. How he took my article to be an attack on him or his firm’s diversity efforts is beyond me. Maybe it’s easy to miss the point over the sound of your coworkers patting you on the back:



And the strangest thing? DWT actually has some infrastructure for fostering diversity in their firm — Zakir speaks at great length about the four pillars of Community, Growth, Education, and Engagement in his LinkedIn post. Now, is any of that in the Bloomberg article? No! Not a breath beyond “We need to explain more” came out of the hour-long interview he had prior to the article’s release, and that’s why at the end of the day he himself told me that the information I was looking for was elsewhere:



He probably should be mad at a journalist for undercutting DWT’s diversity efforts for clickbait or mischaracterizing the depth of his work, but it ain’t me.

# Remote Work Helps Law Firms Recruit And Retain Talent

I recently spoke with a former colleague who has become a more senior attorney at a well-regarded midsize firm in my area. This colleague told me that she was part of recruitment efforts at the firm, and related that her shop, like many other law firms, is competing heavily for talented associates, counsel, and partners. My friend told me that many applicants are asking about remote work policies at the shop, and she believes that if law firms do not embrace remote work, they might have a more difficult time recruiting and retaining talent. This was intriguing to me since remote work was a perk that few of us thought of several years ago, and now it may be the defining make-or-break characteristic of a prospective employer.

Of course, remote work is not new, and law firms have traditionally had fluid work arrangements for some attorneys. When I began working as an associate at a Biglaw shop around a decade ago, I remember thumbing through the employees’ manual and noticing a section about nontraditional work schedules. The manual related that the firm would consider reducing an associates’ billable hour expectations if the associate also received less annual pay. The manual also related that employees could request a flexible work arrangement under which they were only in the office certain days of the week, and they could complete their work remotely the rest of the time.

Most of the law firms I worked at had the tools for remote work in place for years. Indeed, most shops with which I have experience issued attorneys work laptops so that they can complete work remotely and had cloud-based systems so attorneys can access work materials from anywhere. In addition, many colleagues and I used to rely on text chains, Gchat, and other methods to communicate to each other outside of the office.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Working remotely, fully or mostly, has been a long time coming in the legal profession, but COVID-19 really brought this progress to the forefront of the legal industry. For months, and even years, law firms shuttered offices during the pandemic in order to promote social distancing and keep everyone safe. Even though virtual work had a difficult beginning at many shops, most law firms found that they were just as productive with remote work than they were when people were in the office.

Because of the pandemic, an entire generation of lawyers have gotten used to remote work. Many summer associates in the past few summers completed much of their work remotely, and associates who started their careers in the past few years may view remote work as the norm. In fact, many attorneys even interviewed for their jobs remotely, and have rarely, if ever, met everyone with whom they work on projects.

For a variety of reasons, law firms seem poised to reopen offices in the coming weeks and months. Although law firms are mostly just as productive with remote work as in-person work, old-school law firm managers may believe that there are some benefits to having people interact and collaborate in person. In addition, many law firms have long-term leases, and they may be frustrated with having to pay rent month after month even though the firm is doing decently well with remote work.

My friend told me that law firms that adopt more rigid return-to-the-office policies may have a difficult time attracting young talent. Any legal professionals who began their careers during the COVID era may not see in-person work as the norm and may not appreciate needing to commute to an office to perform their work when they can mostly complete tasks remotely. People may think it is undesirable to spend time and money commuting to an office where they most likely have to interact with a boss and cannot have too much control over a schedule when other firms offer remote work policies.

Even attorneys who have worked in the legal profession for years or decades may not wish to apply for a job with strict in-person work expectations. Work-from-home policies have not only helped legal professionals stay safe, they have also let people juggle all of the personal and work tasks they need to complete in a given day. If someone needs to go to an office, it can be difficult to deal with childcare, car problems, or any of the other personal issues all of us need to contend with in our daily lives. Established legal professionals may not want to give up this freedom they have enjoy over the past few years to work for a firm that is requiring them to travel to an office.

All told, law firms likely believe that in-person work policies will increase productivity and impact their bottom line. However, law firms with stricter in-person work policies may have trouble recruiting and retaining talent, and law firms need to consider this when deciding on continuing remote work policies.

People aren’t just sitting at home working like they were the last two summers, they’re a little more out and about this summer.

— [Mitch Nussbaum](https://www.loeb.com/en/people/n/nussbaum-mitchell-s), vice chair of Loeb & Loeb and co-chair of the firm’s capital markets and corporate department, commenting in an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-sees-end-of-cycle-for-ipo-work-lawyer-recruiting-war) on the slowdown in IPO work that’s led to Biglaw’s hiring of capital markets associates and partners tapering off or even stopping altogether. “We’ve been here before and we’ll be here again,” [Craig Marcus](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/biographies/m/craig-e-marcus), co-chair of Ropes & Gray’s capital markets practice, said of the IPO downturn. “It’s the end of the cycle.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Handicapping Donald Trump's Supreme Court Shortlist
## It looks like it's down to two: Judge Diane Sykes and Judge Bill Pryor.

Winter is coming (or technically here); is a SCOTUS nomination as well?

More than a month has passed since President-elect Donald Trump told us to expect a Supreme Court nomination [“pretty soon.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/trump-to-make-scotus-great-again-pretty-soon/?rf=1) But even if a SCOTUS nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia gets announced forthwith, it’s unlikely that this new justice will join the Court in time to participate in any decisions for the current Term.[[1]](#f1)

So that’s the “when” of this story. What about the “who”? In case you missed it over the holidays, Jan Crawford of CBS News, one of the most plugged-in Supreme Court reporters around, revealed Trump’s [five finalists](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/122516.html?_ga=1.176643045.1514966084.1422212612) (in alphabetical order, and with thanks to [How Appealing](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/122516.html); full transcript of the discussion [here](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcript-december-25-2016-colbert-correspondents-panel/)):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- Judge Steven Colloton (8th Cir.) of Iowa
- Judge Thomas Hardiman (3d Cir.) of Pennsylvania
- Justice Joan Larsen of Michigan
- Judge William Pryor (11th Cir.) of Alabama
- Judge Diane Sykes (7th Cir.) of Wisconsin
These five judges all appeared on Trump’s [first SCOTUS list of 11 names](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/?rf=1), suggesting that his [supplemental list of 10 names](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/making-scotus-even-greater-trumps-supplemental-supreme-court-shortlist/) might represent something of a second tier. But the legal and journalism professions must thank the Donald for his not-so-short “shortlist” of 21. It made the SCOTUS process closer to a reality TV show, with more than a dozen competitors to start, and more fun than a traditional presidential process with maybe four to six contenders.

UPDATE (7:05 p.m.): According to Shane Goldmacher and Josh Gerstein of [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-strategy-supreme-court-233106), still in the mix are Judge Raymond Kethledge (6th Cir.), Judge Raymond Gruender (8th Cir.), and Judge Neil Gorsuch (10th Cir.). Judge Kethledge and Judge Gruender appeared on Trump’s first list, while Judge Gorsuch was on the second list.

Of the finalists, who has the edge? My money is on Judge Pryor and Judge Sykes, for a few reasons:

1. They’ve been on Trump’s radar screen for a long time. During the Republican presidential debate that took place right after Justice Scalia’s passing, Trump [called them out by name](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/donald-trumps-supreme-court-nominees/): “We could have a Diane Sykes or a Bill Pryor.”

2. The buzz is on their side. When I attended the National Lawyers Convention of the Federalist Society back in November, where numerous Republican power brokers (and many Trump shortlisters) made appearances, the SCOTUS talk [centered on Pryor and Sykes](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/442330/gop-consensus-trump-scotus-pick-sykes-or-pryor), and continued to focus on them [into December](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/trump-supreme-court-vacancy/).

3. Prediction markets favor them. See, e.g., [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/Market/2198/Who-will-be-the-next-confirmed-Supreme-Court-justice) and [FantasyJustice by Josh Blackman](https://fantasyjustice.lexpredict.com/stats).

(Yes, the top vote getter on FantasyJustice right now is Judge Neil Gorsuch (10th Cir.). But if you look at just the five finalists identified by Jan Crawford and eliminate the others, you’ll see that Pryor and Sykes are far ahead of Colloton, Hardiman, and Larsen. Also, as I know from having attended the Fed Soc conference in November, where Blackman was taking in-person predictions from attendees, some judges could — and did — strongly encourage their clerks, colleagues, and friends to make supportive predictions.)

4. They are both solidly conservative. They are conservative in terms of the outcomes they reach, writing opinions and casting votes [striking down various Obamacare provisions](http://dailycaller.com/2016/12/27/trumps-supreme-court-shortlist-is-making-the-rounds/) and [upholding voter ID laws](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/trump-supreme-court-vacancy/). They are conservative in terms of methodology, emphasizing Justice Scalia’s themes of textualism, originalism, and judicial restraint. Not surprisingly, they are active in the Federalist Society, aka the legal profession’s vast right-wing conspiracy.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
UPDATE (10:42 p.m.): According to [this study](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/25/us/politics/how-clintons-or-trumps-nominees-could-affect-the-balance-of-the-supreme-court.html), Sykes and Pryor are in the Alito-Thomas range of conservatism (with Sykes a little more conservative than Pryor).

UPDATE (1/7/2017, 9:45.m.): But this study is very much [open to question](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/09/27/comparing-the-ideologies-of-supreme-court-nominees/?utm_term=.aabf7edfecb5) (as Orin Kerr notes).

5. They are highly qualified and super-smart, yet not “elites” — a very “Trumpy” combination.

Pyror and Sykes have long and distinguished records of judicial service, and they are highly regarded as jurists. Even their ideological adversaries concede their brilliance. See, e.g., [Ian Millhiser](https://twitter.com/imillhiser/status/733001911645933568), author of [Injustices: The Supreme Court’s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted](http://amzn.to/2iRqfKl) (affiliate link): “Trump’s potential justices are really smart and really awful. Really. Awful.”

But they are not coastal elites: Pryor is from Alabama, and Sykes is from Wisconsin. They went to strong but not Ivy League or “T14” law schools: Tulane for Pryor, and Marquette for Sykes. They have not spent their entire careers in the federal system: Pryor served as Alabama’s attorney general before taking the bench, and Sykes was a state trial and appellate judge before joining the Seventh Circuit.

(Contrast them in this regard to Colloton (Yale, Office of Legal Counsel, federal prosecutor); Hardiman (Georgetown Law, Skadden Arps); and Larsen (Northwestern Law, Office of Legal Counsel). If Trump wants to “drain the legal swamp,” expect him to steer clear of the T14/Biglaw/Main Justice types, going instead with nominees from the “real America.”)

6. They have powerful backers. Pryor is pals with incoming attorney general Jeff Sessions, his fellow Alabaman, and Sykes gets support from incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, her fellow Wisconsinite. This type of stuff might sound silly, but in D.C. circles, connections matter. (For example, there are many lawyers across the country qualified to serve as U.S. solicitor general, but the ones getting buzz — George Conway, Chuck Cooper, Noel Francisco, and Greg Katsas — all have strong ties to the Trump White House or Justice Department.)

(One other random fact: Sykes was once married to conservative Wisconsin talk show host Charlie Sykes, a leader of the #NeverTrump faction during the presidential campaign. But she is his ex-wife, and they [divorced back in 1999](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/charlie-skyes-wisconsin-radio-conservatives-214175), almost two decades ago. This connection should not be an issue.)


Judge Diane Sykes and Judge William Pryor

As between Pryor and Sykes, who has the stronger shot? I’m going with Sykes. (Disclosure: I have had the honor of meeting both judges and I admire them both greatly, but I know Judge Sykes better, having participated in events with her at the University of Chicago and Marquette Law Schools.)

Here are the relevant factors:

1. Age. Members of Team Pryor [point out](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/15/politics/trump-supreme-court-vacancy/) that he is younger than Sykes (54 to her 59). This is a problem for Sykes — presidents, especially Republican presidents, like their justices young — but not an insurmountable one. Justice Ginsburg was 60 when appointed to SCOTUS, and Justices Breyer, Alito, and Sotomayor were all over 55 when they joined the Court. Also, recall that women live longer than men; as noted by Josh Blackman, based on actuarial analysis, Judge Pryor and Judge Sykes have the [exact same life expectancy](http://joshblackman.com/blog/2017/01/06/the-actuarial-life-expectancies-of-the-scotus-short-list/).

Interestingly enough, Judge Sykes’s age could actually help her, at least in terms of getting the first Trump appointment. On inauguration day, Justice Ginsburg will be 83, Justice Kennedy will be 80, and Justice Breyer will be 78. While we wish all three of them long tenures on the Court, it is possible, even likely, that President Trump will get one or more SCOTUS appointments in addition to the one he currently has. So if he thinks Judge Sykes is a strong candidate (which she is), he would be well advised to appoint her now, to give her the longest possible tenure on SCOTUS.

The remaining four finalists — Colloton (53), Hardiman (51), Larsen (48), and Pryor (54) — are all young enough to be considered for future vacancies. But Judge Sykes this December will turn 60, which is traditionally viewed as the age cutoff for appointing a justice. So with the long game in mind, Trump should select Sykes.

2. Confirmability. Judge Pryor is a nominee in the mold of a Judge Edith Jones (5th Cir.) or a Judge Emilio Garza (5th Cir.). The full-throated expression of conservative views that Republicans love about him is also what would make him harder to confirm.

A recent interesting paper, [Searching for Justice Scalia: Measuring the “Scalia-Ness” of the Next Potential Member of the U.S. Supreme Court](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2874794), gave Pryor high marks for “Scalia-ness.” But when it comes to confirmation, “Scalia-ness” isn’t necessarily a plus.

Take abortion. It’s de rigueur for senators to ask SCOTUS nominees in their hearings for their views on Roe v. Wade (and Senator Chuck Schumer has already [highlighted protecting Roe](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/chuck-schumer-knows-how-to-spot-potential-supreme-court-justices-outside-the-mainstream/) as a priority). It’s then de rigueur for the nominee to say (1) Roe is precedent (duh); (2) I respect precedent (of course you do); (3) yes, precedent can be overruled (with a digression here on stare decisis and the circumstances under which a case can be overruled); and (4) sorry, can’t say more because abortion might come before the Court, toodles!

It’s a time-honored song and dance, but one that Judge Pryor would have a hard time performing. He previously stated, as groups like NARAL [love to tout](http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/media/press-releases/2016/pr05182016_trump-scotus.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/), that Roe was the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law,” [amounting to](https://thinkprogress.org/meet-the-two-ultra-conservatives-trump-would-nominate-to-the-supreme-court-da6a78b686b6#.31thayul4) “a constitutional right to murder an unborn child.”

Statements like these, plus additional concerns raised by [African-American and LGBT groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Pryor_Jr.) about other aspects of Bill Pryor’s record, led Democrats to filibuster his Eleventh Circuit nomination. President George W. Bush had to resort to a recess appointment to place Pryor on the Eleventh Circuit, and his final confirmation vote was close: 53-45. Judge Sykes won confirmation by a [much more comfortable margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_S._Sykes), 70-27.

3. Diversity. To be sure, President-elect Trump isn’t big on diversity, as reflected in his appointments thus far. As we [observed](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/trump-nominates-sullivan-cromwell-partner-to-lead-sec/) when he passed over Gibson Dunn partner Debra Wong Yang in favor of Sullivan & Cromwell partner Jay Clayton for SEC head, “even when choosing between two elites, President-elect Trump goes for the white male.”

But if he’s torn in the end between Pryor and Sykes, Sykes’s gender might be a tie-breaker, since it helps in terms of both confirmability and improving the GOP’s standing with women. Per Tim Alberta in the [National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/442330/gop-consensus-trump-scotus-pick-sykes-or-pryor), “Sykes is considered to be every bit as conservative as Pyror, but is less controversial…. She also is — quite obviously — a woman, and Republicans have been eager for decades to appoint a female Supreme Court justice. (The Harriet Miers fiasco still haunts many GOP establishment types.) Allies of Sykes say it would prove especially difficult for Democrats to oppose her: She’s a 58-year-old single mother who hails from the heartland.”

4. Attractiveness. Some might find it stupid, distasteful, or even offensive of me to raise physical attractiveness in the context of comparing two Supreme Court contenders; presidents generally select justices for their minds, not their bodies. But Donald Trump is not your ordinary president. And as we know from his catty comments about people’s looks while on the campaign trail, as well as his willingness to consider Mitt Romney for secretary of state because he [“looked the part,”](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/us/politics/donald-trump-mitt-romney-rudy-giuliani-state.html) the Donald places a priority on appearance.

(I’m not at liberty to divulge details, but I have a friend who, some time ago, was offered a job with Trump basically because he met her casually and found her attractive (and told her as much). He eventually got to know her better and learned of her brilliance and accomplishments, but it was clear in my friend’s retelling of this tale that he wouldn’t have taken the initial interest in her had he not found her compelling in terms of her appearance.)

What does this mean for Judge Sykes and Judge Pryor? If you’ve seen them in person, you know that they are both rather attractive (especially by the standards of the federal judiciary). Judge Pryor looks like he could be a male model, and he keeps in shape by running. As for Judge Sykes, in 2004 she was named a [Superhottie of the Federal Judiciary](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2004/07/_general_commen.html), described in her nomination blurb as “startlingly pretty and elegant,” with a “cool,” “businesslike,” “yuppie sort of appeal.”

So both Judge Sykes and Judge Pryor would pass Donald Trump’s “look the part” test. But as we know [all too well](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html?utm_term=.a5a17cd7aad0), Donald Trump is a red-blooded, heterosexual American male. If he interviews both potential nominees in person, as presidents traditionally do, I suspect he will find Judge Sykes more appealing.

(Again, my apologies to anyone who is offended by such frivolity while discussing a life-tenured position on the highest court in the land. But I’m sorry, this is the world that Donald Trump has made, and I’m trying to be a realist. Here at Above the Law, we call things as we see them, even at the risk of occasionally causing offense.)

In sum, I’m predicting that Judge Diane Sykes will be President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee. And I’m not alone in this prediction. For example, Jeffrey Toobin also [expects a Justice Sykes](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-top-legal-stories-of-2017-donald-trumps-conflicts-of-interest-bill-cosbys-assault-charge-and-more) in 2017, noting that aside from her age, “she’s everything else they want in a Justice.”

Is it exciting to predict Justice Sykes? Not really. She’s one of the odds-on favorites at this point in time.

But you know what makes this process fun? How often the pundits’ predictions are wrong. When President Barack Obama was looking to nominate someone to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, I was pretty certain that he would go with either Judge Sri Srinivasan (D.C. Cir.) or Judge Paul Watford (9th Cir.), and most other observers agreed. But then POTUS surprised everyone and nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland (D.C. Cir.) to SCOTUS (which was, in hindsight, a brilliant move; Judge Garland was [thrilled to tears](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/merrick-garland-your-scotus-nominee/) by the nomination, while Judges Srinivasan and Watford were kept in “pristine” condition — unsullied by politics, and ready for elevation under President Elizabeth Warren).

And then, of course, we have an even bigger blooper by the chattering class: our collective failure to foresee the election of Donald Trump as our 45th president. So consider this a lesson learned: as long as the Donald is involved, accurate prediction is impossible.

P.S. But please, dear Lord, let Trump at least stick to his slate of 21 names. We do not need [Peter Thiel on the Supreme Court](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/report-donald-trump-would-put-peter-thiel-on-the-supreme-court-wait-what/).

[ [1]](#reff1) No new justice before the end of this Term — at least that’s what experts like former solicitor general [Ted Olson](https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/799298789307772928) and veteran SCOTUS correspondent [Jeffrey Toobin](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-top-legal-stories-of-2017-donald-trumps-conflicts-of-interest-bill-cosbys-assault-charge-and-more) believe (and I don’t disagree with them). Another former SG, Don Verrilli, believes that it’s [“possible”](https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/799299384747888641) we might get a justice on the Court in time for the April sitting, but that would be “optimistic.”

If you look at the last few nominations, it has generally taken about three months to go from nomination to confirmation — Elena Kagan (announced 5/10/2010, confirmed 8/5/2010), Sonia Sotomayor (announced 5/26/2009, confirmed 8/6/2009, Samuel Alito (announced 10/31/2005, confirmed 1/31/2006). And those nominations didn’t come at the start of a president’s new term, when the Senate will be busy holding hearings for many other appointees, including Cabinet officials, and addressing other priorities (e.g., Obamacare, or the termination thereof).

# MoFo 'Mommy Track' Lawsuit Heats Up Over Discovery Dispute
## More disputes in the contentious case.

The $100 million [gender discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/) case against Morrison & Foerster is still marching forward, and in the latest scuffle the parties are clashing over discovery. As you may recall, a total of [seven plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit-against-mofo-spirals-and-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/) have come forward alleging there’s a “mommy track” at the firm that they were placed on after they took maternity leave, and the firm is fighting back against the allegations.

According to [reporting](https://www.law.com/2019/09/10/plaintiff-in-mommy-track-suit-against-mofo-fights-request-for-records-from-her-new-employer/) by Law.com, MoFo is seeking discovery from the current employers of one of the plaintiffs — Jane Doe 4. [MoFo has already ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/mofo-files-for-sanctions-against-firm-plaintiff-suing-them-for-gender-discrimination/)tried, [and failed](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/mofos-attempt-to-play-hard-ball-with-gender-discrimination-plaintiff-fails/), to bring sanctions against this plaintiff. The firm argued Doe 4 had signed a release of all claims against the firm when she negotiated a severance package from the firm. But the court found plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded Doe 4 signed the agreement under economic duress since she was eight months pregnant when she was fired from the firm. Now the Biglaw giant says it needs discovery from her current law firm to “probe whether her performance is also viewed as subpar at her current law firm” and that Doe 4’s retaliation claim “put her job applications directly at issue.”

The plaintiffs… do not agree with that position. Deborah Marcuse, partner at Stanford Heisler representing Doe 4, wrote in a letter brief to the magistrate judge:

“[A] plaintiff does not expose her current job record to carte blanche scrutiny merely by filing suit against her prior employer.”

“Nothing here warrants forcing Jane Doe 4’s current employer into this litigation as an unwilling participant with tangible discovery burdens,” Marcuse wrote. “MoFo should not be able to launch such a damaging assault on Plaintiff’s job security and career prospects, and fire off a warning to similarly-situated employees, on such a slender reed.”

As always, we’ll be following this case closely.

# Should I Stay Or Should I Go?
## How can you improve your chances of retaining your team members?

Let’s face it. Should I stay or should I go is a question that even the most loyal employee will ponder at one time or another. If you are leading an in-house legal team and you are interested in retaining talent, it is important that you recognize this as a fact.

It does not matter if you give your team members the chance to work remotely and you pay them a competitive salary. You may remain at risk for losing that team member. How can you improve your chances of retaining that team member?

1. Pull your team in; don’t hold them at an arm’s length. There are some people who would say that as a leader you need to stay at an arm’s length from those people with whom you work. That is not the way I want to work.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Why?

When you keep those people with whom you work at an arm’s length, connecting with them becomes harder. When you fail to connect with them on a personal level, you will often find yourself in the dark about those things that matter most. You will never know what’s really on their minds until it’s too late.

So how do you build healthy relationships with those people with whom you work?

You start by letting them know you care. In the words of John Maxwell, “people don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
You can be most effective when you can create an environment where those people with whom you work feel valued, included, and heard.

You can show you care by keeping people informed. To the extent you can, don’t just rely on formal office communications. Talk to people about what it is that is happening around them even if you don’t have all the answers.

When you talk to them and not at them, it can make all the difference in the world. It should be a conversation and not a lecture. The better you are at having conversations, the deeper the connection you can form with your team.

2. You give your team a sense of purpose; you don’t make it all about just completing tasks. Successful in-house leaders recognize the importance of making it about more than just completing everyday tasks. Successful in-house leaders also recognize the importance of creating a shared sense of purpose for everyone on the team.

When everyone has a shared sense of purpose, it is easier for your team members to form an emotional attachment to whatever they are doing. When that emotional attachment exists, it can bring the team together and create a sense of togetherness and belonging.

3. Empower your team to do; don’t do for your team. Chances are, if you are leading a legal team, you have a proven track record as a problem solver. You know how to get things done.

As a leader of a legal team, however, your job is no longer just about solving problems.

When your team comes to you with problems, your first instinct will be to try to solve the problem for them. This is an urge you should resist.

Success as a leader is all about developing your team and empowering them to identify and solve problems for themselves.

At the end of the day, it may not matter what you do. Talented lawyers will come and they will go, but, if you have done your job well as a leader, you may be able to increase the length of time your talented team members remain with you and your company.

The U.S. remains the country with the highest rate of new COVID cases due to the Delta variant, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine misinformation. Thankfully, the FDA granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine just yesterday, so hopefully that will inspire more people to get vaccinated. In the meantime, law firms across the country continue to take action on this important matter, and have decided to put their employees’ health and safety at the forefront when implementing new office return policies, including recent vaccination mandates.

For reference, the following firms are requiring all employees to be vaccinated before they return to the office: [Akin

The latest firms to announce mandatory vaccination policies are Willkie Farr and Kramer Levin. Although Willkie isn’t requiring anyone to return to the office [prior to January 2022](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/neither-of-these-top-biglaw-firms-will-require-attorneys-to-return-to-the-office-in-2021/), for those who do wish to head back to the office, effective August 23, all personnel (and visitors, like clients, guests, and vendors) must be fully vaccinated and provide proof their vaccination. For all those who continue to work remotely, they must be fully vaccinated upon the firm’s full reopening early next year, and be able to provide proof as well.

As for Kramer Levin, effective August 25, only those who have been fully vaccinated (with proof) will be permitted to enter the office. This new policy will also apply to third parties, like clients, guests, and vendors. A presence at the office is still fully voluntary, and the firm will provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to its reopening.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know.

(Flip the page to read the memos from Willkie Farr and Kramer Levin.)

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

# The View From Up North: Why Are Toronto First-Year Salaries Stagnant?

A huge tremor rumbled through the grand glass prisons of Manhattan on June 6th when U.S. legal juggernaut Cravath announced it was [raising first-year associate salaries to U.S. $180,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1).

That, of course, raises the question: on that fateful day, how many times did equity partners at Cravath’s competitors say, “Thanks a lot, Cravath” (probably in much dirtier language)?

My guess? A lot.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Many aftershocks followed as other major U.S. firms tried to look progressive by [announcing their own salary increases](http://bit.ly/2016salaryincreasePromo).

Meanwhile, back in Toronto… crickets. I’m not surprised, but none of the Canadian Biglaw firms jumped in with raises of their own. Why should they? New York’s New York and Toronto’s Toronto.

Did you know, however, that Canadian Biglaw firms haven’t raised starting salaries substantially since 2008?

Let me trace a bit of the Toronto salary history. I commenced my lawyerly journey at Biglaw firm Goodman & Carr in 2003. As I recall, my starting salary was $78,000. That was about industry standard back in those days.

The Toronto legal market was white-hot from 2005 to 2008. By 2008, first-year salaries at most major firms had jumped to between $95,000 and $100,000.

Fast forward another eight years to present day. Here is the current salary scale for one of the Seven Sisters, provided to me by an intrepid associate who wanted me to share this information with his colleagues everywhere. I’m not going to reveal the firm name to protect my source, but it’s not Davies, which my source says pays slightly better.

1st: 100k

2nd: 110k

3rd: 130k

4th: 150k

Up 20k each year after that. Bonus at 2000 hours (25% of base).

Between 2003 and 2008, salaries jumped about $20k. Between 2008 and today, nearly a decade hence, salaries have increased by essentially nothing.

Zip, zilch, nada.

Since 2003, the cost of living has increased about 1.77% year over year. Since 2003, Toronto first-year salaries have increased about 1.93% per annum—barely better than the inflation rate. Actually, first-year salaries have lost ground against inflation since 2008.

What up with that?

That’s a multi-faceted question, but I will focus on what I think are the most important factors:

A. One hundred grand ain’t too shabby in relative terms. Where else can a twenty-six-year-old make a hundred grand during her first year in a position? Thus, while $100,000 may not represent a fair split of pie, or be as much as the firms might pay if pushed by competitive forces, none of the lawyers I talked to think they need to join a union to fight for higher wages. Young lawyers are still going to run to Bay Street because it’s the home to the sexiest and most prestigious work. And, they’re going to do that whether they start at $100k or $150k.

B. I love America, but I would characterize its philosophy as thus: “if you can get it, get it.”

Canadian culture is more like, “shut up and work—be glad you’re getting what you get.” As a result, Canadian lawyers are culturally less inclined to push for salary increases. Feel free, of course, to agree or disagree with that.

C. U.S. lawyers are much more gossipy. They are willing to share salary information. Additionally, U.S. firms publicly share all kinds of information a Canadian firm would never release. Try to find information on Stikeman Elliott’s profit per partner or Blakes’ total revenue—you’ll never get anything “official.” Yet, the American Lawyer publishes this information every year for major U.S. firms, some of it coming from the firms themselves.

Information is power. It gives people a basis upon which to take action. It creates buzz. It creates momentum.

What if, for example, Canadian firms published their profits per partner every year? What if we could see the profits per partner going up every year? Do you think the firms could justify no increase to first-year salaries in that scenario?

Of course not.

But, Canadian firm don’t share profits per partner and, by keeping information close to the vest, they control that power.

I have made this request before, and I’ll make it again now. I’m here to help. If you want to reach out to me anonymously with salary information, please do so: [steve@stevendykstralaw.ca](mailto:steve@stevendykstralaw.ca?subject=Your%20ATL%20column).

I would love to get a public conversation going about Canadian salaries. I would love to see the firms bump salaries for the first time since Obama took office. But, that’ll only happen if associates everywhere want it to happen.

IMHO, sharing information is a key to increasing salaries.

Let’s ask the question together: “Hey, Biglaw, why haven’t you raised salaries in nearly a decade?”

That’s the View From Up North. Have a great week.

# Profession Loses Steve Susman To COVID
## Tragic news.

Susman Godfrey founder Stephen Susman has passed.

The famed trial lawyer was [in a coma earlier this year after a cycling accident](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/susman-godfrey-founder-seriously-injured/) and later contracted the coronavirus. His wife announced yesterday that “the combination of COVID and his weakened lungs were finally too much for his body.”

Susman founded the legacy firm in the 70s and over time the shingle grew into a 150 attorney firm securing over [a billion in verdicts a year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/a-deep-dive-into-the-history-of-one-of-americas-premier-law-firms/). The megaboutique — because you can’t just use “boutique” after a firm opens multiple offices — attracted all-star talent over the years. Some of that talent [went on to politics](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/powerhouse-litigation-shop-keeps-producing-all-star-political-candidates/). And the driving force behind the outfit was the Susman. From a [Lawdragon profile](http://www.lawdragon.com/2017/12/03/dont-mess-texas-susman-godfrey-became-americas-leading-trial-firm/):

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
He started out clerking for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black and teaching at University of Texas Law School before helming an antitrust case for purchasers of corrugated boxes. He won $550 million and understood that his success should come from his results rather than his effort. There’s a sturdy Chevy truck in that recipe: federal clerkship, Texas and bet on yourself, even if there are today Rauschenbergs hanging on the wall.

Others quickly signed on. Rather than joining the big Texas firms, Lee Godfrey, Parker Folse, Mark Wawro, and a rustle of other smart graduates of, primarily, the University of Texas School of Law, bought into the Susman vision in the early days. It was big and bold, like Susman, and leavened by the elegant Godfrey. The contingent fee work had swagger, but necessitated the firm taking some small, not necessarily good cases to keep the lights on and everyone occupied. The vision was awesome, but the business model was a work in progress.

The business model worked out, with [a heavy dose of contingency fee work](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202765210643/lifetime-achiever-stephen-susman-susman-godfrey/), which was a novel concept for a firm doing that kind of work.

It’s a sad loss for the profession and a reminder of the stakes as we struggle against this virus. Above the Law’s thoughts are with Steve’s family and his friends at the firm in this difficult time.

# Biglaw Firm Settles Racial Discrimination Lawsuit Alleging That Attorney Called Assistant 'Our Slave'
## The firm says they are 'pleased to have resolved this matter.'

The Biglaw firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath has settled a racial discrimination case[ filed against them earlier this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/biglaw-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-legal-assistant-claims-attorney-called-her-our-slave/). In that case, Syneetra Hill, an African-American legal assistant in their Princeton office, alleged pay discrimination and that she was subjected to a hostile work environment and retaliation.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/10/23/drinker-biddle-settles-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-in-princeton/) the American Lawyer, the case was dismissed with prejudice as part of a confidential settlement. Though the specific terms of the deal are unknown, Hill’s attorney indicated she is happy with the outcome:

[T]he case was dismissed pursuant to a confidential settlement on Sept. 27. Hill’s lawyer, Allan Schorr, said he is unable to discuss the terms other than to say “the matter is resolved,” and his client is no longer working at Drinker Biddle. But he added that his client is pleased with the outcome.

“It was an important case and I’m glad it was resolved,” said Schoor, of Schoor & Associates in Cherry Hill.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And, as one might imagine, the firm is also glad to be done with the lawsuit. In a statement the firm said, “We are pleased to have resolved this matter.”

In the lawsuit, Hill, who’d worked at the firm for 11 years, alleged the environment was hostile to African-Americans. The complaint detailed several examples of behavior Hill alleges created a problematic work environment:

- A former, unnamed supervising attorney was allegedly allowed to keep a collection of Confederate memorabilia throughout their office.
- The lawsuit claims [Marsha Beidler,](https://www.drinkerbiddle.com/people/b/beidler-marsha-w) of counsel in the firm’s trusts and estates practice for whom Hill worked, referred to Hill as “our slave” in front of a client. The complaint says Beidler tried to save face by saying Hilled worked like a slave.
- Beidler allegedly told Hill to “read a good book” about how segregation was “good for blacks because at least they could go to their own colleges.”
- After seeing a picture of Hill’s infant son, Beidler allegedly said “he should be ready to get a basketball in his hands.”
The firm has not commented on the specific allegations in the complaint, neither have any of the attorneys mentioned in the filing.

# Standard Of Review: 'The Last Days of Night' Puts A New Spin On Cravath

[](http://amzn.to/2beSw6D)When you hear the word “Cravath,” what comes to mind? If you are a lawyer who is not actually employed at [Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cravath/), you may think about the [Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), which recently upended attorney compensation at large law firms. But before Cravath (the firm) was the cause of attorneys seeing dollar signs, Cravath (the person) was a newly minted lawyer just trying to make it in the world. It is this latter version of Cravath that is the protagonist of Graham Moore’s excellent new novel [The Last Days of Night](http://amzn.to/2beSw6D), which depicts how Cravath becomes embroiled in the dispute between inventor Thomas Edison and industrialist George Westinghouse.

The Last Days of Night is set in the 1880s, and Paul Cravath is an attorney in his mid-20s who has just graduated from Columbia Law School. But when the firm that Paul joins quickly disintegrates, Paul joins with the senior partner at his old firm and that partner’s son-in-law, future Chief Justice of the United States Charles Evans Hughes, to form a new firm that is hungry for business. Through a tenuous family connection, Paul, despite his lack of experience, is hired to defend famed entrepreneur Westinghouse in the patent lawsuit filed by Edison. After claiming to invent the lightbulb, Edison obtained a patent so broad that it threatens to put any other putative lightbulb manufacturer, including Westinghouse, out of business. However, the feud between Edison and Westinghouse has more to do than just lightbulbs; Westinghouse – aided by quirky scientist Nikola Tesla – wants to use his nascent alternating current technology to power the United States, while Edison believes that his preferred direct current is superior. As Cravath embarks on his long-shot representation of Westinghouse, he begins to rub noses with the elite of New York society, including Edison’s investor J.P. Morgan and popular singer Agnes Huntington.

Moore is best known for writing the film The Imitation Game, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. I am admittedly not a fan of that film (and even once wrote about it in a [column about Suits](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/standard-of-review-framing-a-subpar-suits-episode); I have no idea if Moore was responsible for The Imitation Game’s clumsy framing device). But thankfully, The Last Days of Night has a more straightforward narrative. Indeed, despite fundamentally centering around a nineteenth-century patent dispute, the novel moves at a brisk pace and is extremely entertaining. The book is very easy to read and Moore avoids the temptation to include too much technical or legal jargon (though he does include a clunky scene in which Westinghouse provides a very long explanation of the difference between direct current and alternating current). The underlying feud between Westinghouse and Edison is extremely compelling, particularly because its consequences are still felt today. Moreover, it is fascinating to read about how 1880s technology like the lightbulb was considered to be so magical and awe-inspiring.

My one qualm with the historical aspects of the novel is that occasionally Moore gets too cute. For example, after Tesla suggests the possibility of a wireless phone, Paul asks himself who would ever use such a device. These winks at the 2016 audience detract from the narrative.


Paul Cravath

As a lawyer, it is odd to think about the eponym for one of the world’s most prestigious firms as a neophyte attorney with barely a clue. But I related to Paul Cravath; I definitely know the feeling of attempting to undertake a legal task while feeling completely over my head. Moore succeeds in describing that feeling on the scale of a history-altering lawsuit. Indeed, the perpetually nervous lawyer in me cringed when Paul makes a mistake in a contract negotiation that leads to an undeserved massive royalty from Westinghouse.

Of the secondary characters, Agnes is the most rounded. Moore depicts her as witty, smarter than Paul in certain respects, and not the society girl that Paul initially believes her to be. Edison is clearly the villain of the novel; he will do anything, and even resort to underhanded tactics, in order to beat Westinghouse. And Westinghouse (for the most part) is portrayed as saner than Edison, on the right side of history.

The Last Days of Night is thus a very good novel and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to lawyers, law students, and non-lawyers who have interest in the history of industry in the U.S. As reported in Above the Law earlier this week, a film adaptation is already in the works, with The Imitation Game director Morten Tyldum set to direct and Eddie Redmayne signed on to star. I would have gone with Domhnall Gleeson as Paul, and while I am giving free casting advice, I would hire Mr. Robot’s Portia Doubleday as Agnes, Stranger Things’s David Harbour as Westinghouse (unfortunately Gaten Matarazzo is too young), and veteran actor Jason Clarke as Edison. You can thank me when the film with that cast inevitably becomes a hit.

(Disclosure: I received a review copy of this book.)

# Lawyers Should Keep Emails Short And Sweet

Lawyers are not always known as professionals who value brevity. Indeed, when I worked as a lawyer at a Biglaw shop, we routinely fought with space limitations when drafting briefs. Lawyers can be especially long-winded when it comes to written communications, and numerous attorneys could be more succinct when drafting emails to lawyers and clients. If attorneys are too dense in their communications, there is a solid chance that emails will not be read. Sometimes, less is more when putting things into written communication.

I did not always realize that brevity can be an asset in the legal profession. Earlier in my career, I was much more likely to send dense, long emails. I thought that if I made a number of solid points to my adversaries, I would be more likely to obtain benefits for my clients. Moreover, I thought that if I was extremely detailed with clients, they would better understand a legal position and would appreciate the thought I put into our legal strategies.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
When I started dealing with adversaries and clients more directly after opening my own shop, I realized that being brief was often better than being detailed. For instance, before a closing one time, I sent my client a long email describing the closing process, steps that needed to be taken before and at the closing, and items that needed to be brought to the closing. I wanted to provide all of the useful information my client needed for a successful closing in one place so that my client could refer back to this communication when preparing for the closing.

When it came time to appear at the closing, I asked my client if she had brought an item that I told her to bring to the closing. The client replied that she did not know that she had to bring the item to the closing. I then pulled up the email in which I specifically asked the client to bring that specific item to the closing. While I felt like I had covered myself by conveying in writing that my client needed to bring the item to the closing, this still did not fix the situation. Luckily, the client was able to go home and bring the item, but if I had kept the email briefer and highlighted the items the client needed to bring to the closing, it is possible we would not have ended up in the situation to begin with.

Dense emails between counsel can also cause problems. One time, I was working with some co-defendants’ counsel about scheduling depositions and dealing with certain discovery-related issues. Because discovery was complicated, the emails were dense, and counsel discussed alleged discovery deficiencies in long-winded ways. In one email, a lawyer said that a given deposition date worked for the lawyer, but the attorney buried this information in a dense email about other issues related to discovery.

Several weeks later, when the proposed date for the deposition came, counsel circulated a follow-up email about whether a given date still worked for a party’s deposition. Some of the lawyers had not seen that the given lawyer was indeed free for a particular deposition related to the case and so the attorneys did not calendar the deposition to go forward. This delayed the case, since we needed to go back and forth a second time about dates that worked for the deponent and all of the attorneys to hold the deposition. Had the lawyer been clearer the first time about the critical issue at hand (i.e., whether a given date worked for a deposition), the lawyers would have saved a ton of hassle in scheduling discovery in that case.

In any case, the expression “less is more” definitely applies to the legal profession, and wordy lawyers should consider if they can embrace brevity. Using less space to get a point across can usually have a number of benefits in communications with counsel and clients.

Just when we thought that law firm merger activity was lagging, in steps the largest law firm in the world to even further expand its enormous footprint. Dentons has swooped in to swallow up yet another firm, and this time, the Biglaw behemoth is entering India’s legal market for the first time.

Earlier this week, Dentons announced that it would be combining with Indian law firm Link Legal, adding more than 100 lawyers in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad to its battalion of more than 20,000 attorneys across the globe. According to Dentons, this is the first time an international firm has combined with an Indian law firm, and thanks to its Swiss verein structure, Link Legal — or we should say Dentons Link Legal — will be able to work under the Dentons platform, all while maintaining control of its own affairs locally.

Here are some details from the firm’s [press release](https://www.dentons.com/en/about-dentons/news-events-and-awards/news/2022/october/dentons-announces-an-historic-combination-with-link-legal-in-india):

The combination with Link Legal would offer an established, physical presence in five of the six largest cities in India: Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. Dentons Link Legal Indian lawyers would represent clients inside India and Dentons lawyers would represent Link Legal’s clients outside of India, becoming one firm consistent with the rules and regulations of India.

“This is history in the making in India because this is not a joint venture, not a “best friends” relationship, not a “referral agreement,” but a combination as Dentons has done around the world,” said Joe Andrew, Global Chairman of Dentons. “The combination in India again makes Dentons not only a first-mover but a first-mover in a market that matters to our clients.”

“India will be the most populous country in the world next year with a fast-growing economy making it an increasingly important market for our clients around the world,” said Elliott Portnoy, Global CEO of Dentons. “This historic combination will allow Dentons to connect clients to leading talent in India and provide a seamless one firm experience in more than 200 locations around the globe.”

According to Andrew, the Dentons tie-up with Legal Link will launch “within the next couple of months.” Which firm will be the next to find a home under the gigantic Dentons umbrella? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see.

# Biglaw Business Development: 5 Insights From Chief Marketing Officers
## Some practical advice on generating new clients and new business, from top CMOs.

As we’ve discussed ad nauseam in these pages, demand for the services of Biglaw firms is [flat or declining](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/why-these-global-100-numbers-should-scare-the-bejeezus-out-of-you/). And this year promises [more of the same](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/2018-looks-like-another-year-of-blah-for-the-legal-industry/) on that front.

What does this mean for law firms? If the pie isn’t getting bigger, then growth must be achieved by grabbing a larger share of that pie — which is no easy feat. It’s [very difficult](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/nothing-you-can-say-can-cause-me-to-retain-you/) to displace a [competent incumbent](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/inside-straight-how-do-you-displace-a-competent-incumbent/) (as in-house columnist Mark Herrmann has noted repeatedly).

So the name of the game in 2018 is business development — getting new clients, or getting more business from existing clients. In light of the importance of “BD,” I wasn’t surprised to see a full house for an excellent panel at the Practising Law Institute (PLI) last Thursday, “Business Development Coaching from Chief Marketing Officers.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

(The panel was part of a great conference, [All Star Business Development for Lawyers](https://www.pli.edu/Content/Seminar/All_Star_Business_Development_for_Lawyers/_/N-4kZ1z0zxnc?fromsearch=false&ID=323958&t=BCV8_9AFAC), organized by [Deborah Brightman Farone](https://www.deborahfarone.com/biography), who [stepped down as CMO of Cravath](http://www.lawdragon.com/2017/09/05/legal-consultant-limelight-deborah-farone/) to start her own advisory firm, and [Katherine D’Urso](https://www.pli.edu/Content/Faculty/Katherine_DUrso/_/N-4oZ1z0zxm5?t=BCV8_9AFAC&ID=PE916684), chief client development officer at WilmerHale. I spoke on a different panel, “Reporting from the Press Box: The Interplay between Law and Journalism,” featuring Ashby Jones of the Wall Street Journal and Gina Passarella of the American Lawyer, with Katrina Dewey of Lawdragon as moderator.)

[Despina Kartson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/despinakartson), global director of business development and communications at Jones Day, moderated the CMO panel, which featured the following high-powered participants: [M. Ashraf Lakhani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashraflakhani/), director of business development and marketing at Porter Hedges LLP in Houston, as well as current president of the Legal Marketing Association (LMA); [David McClune](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mcclune-7498334/), global chief marketing officer at Shearman & Sterling; and [Adam Stock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamstock/), chief information officer at [Allen Matkins](http://www.allenmatkins.com/Professionals/Stock-Adam/Biography.aspx) in San Francisco. Here are my five takeaways from the discussion.

1. It’s all about relationships.

Yes, technology is great (and we believe our [legal technology coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/technology/) here at Above the Law is some of the best in the business). But at the end of the day, even though law firms can and should use the tech tools at their disposal to improve the bottom line, business development in Biglaw remains relationship-driven.

The most important relationship, of course, is the one between lawyer and client (see item #2 below). But other relationships matter too.

First, CMOs need to have strong relationships with the lawyers at their firms — who are, at the end of the day, their clients. To be as effective as possible, the CMO needs strong support from firm leadership. Without such support, the CMO could encounter difficulty in [getting cooperation from lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/alt-legal-the-biglaw-caste-system-an-impediment-to-innovation/).

Second, at larger firms with sizable business development and marketing departments, the CMO needs to provide support for her own team members. As firms get serious about business development and continue to grow their BD departments, which now might include experts in everything from customer-relationship management to pricing to social media, the CMO needs to manage as well as market.

2. Know your clients — and know their industry.

Yes, truly [listening to your clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/to-be-a-good-litigator-you-must-be-a-good-counselor-and-therapist/) is critical — but you knew that already.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
What was somewhat more novel from the panelists was the observation that clients are increasingly seeking lawyers who don’t just have legal knowledge — how to draft a merger agreement, how to [try a case](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/how-litigators-evade-the-question-of-trial-experience/) — but who also have deep industry knowledge. Clients don’t want their lawyers to have to get up to speed on how their sector works (and certainly don’t want to pay for it). When a lawyer enters a pitch meeting, the client will want that lawyer to know her business inside out.

As a result, many firms now conduct business development at an industry level. They’re figuring out the half-dozen or so industries that generate the bulk of their work, and they’re presenting themselves as experts in those sectors. Traditionalists might scoff at such an approach — “I’m a litigator, I can handle any case you put in front of me” — but the generalist is rapidly becoming an endangered species.

Maybe certain famous lawyers with international reputations or certain white-shoe law firms with institutional clients can still get work from across the spectrum. But for most lawyers and law firms, even partners and even Am Law 100 firms, clients increasingly want and expect industry expertise.

So figure out what you excel at (as a lawyer and as a firm), emphasize those strengths (in practice areas and in industries), and de-emphasize the rest.

3. View business development broadly.

Many lawyers view BD in too narrow a fashion. They’re too focused on themselves or maybe their group, not on the broader firm or legal market. While specialization is important, as just discussed, lawyers and law firms must also see the big picture.

CMOs can also make this mistake, seeing their job as little more than helping out on pitchbooks. A great CMO needs to understand the firm’s long-term strategy — and hopefully the CMO has been involved in formulating that strategy.

This requires the CMO to have knowledge about a broad range of subjects beyond just marketing — for example, the firm’s business plan, its approach to pricing, and the industries it’s focused on.  It also might explain why the caliber of professionals in law firm marketing and business development is increasing, with many CMOs having degrees like JDs or MBAs.

4. Embrace the opportunities of social media.

Business development typically involves a one-on-one relationship (think of a lawyer pitching to a prospective client), while marketing typically involves a one-to-many relationship (think of using media coverage to establish one’s expertise in a field). Social media is powerful because it offers a lawyer the opportunity to do both marketing and business development — provided that the lawyer seizes the opportunity.

Niche practices lend themselves especially well to social media. By blogging and tweeting about a specific topic, a lawyer can establish herself as an expert in a particular area of law (e.g., [marijuana law](https://abovethelaw.com/author/hbricken/) or [assisted reproductive technology (ART) law](https://abovethelaw.com/author/ellentrachman/)). The opportunity to [build a practice in a niche area](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/power-niche-marketing-turning-your-niche-into-a-power-niche-augmenting-your-power/) is stronger than ever (as our marketing columnist, managing partner [Bruce Stachenfeld](https://abovethelaw.com/author/brucestachenfeld/), has stressed).

As a result, law firms are getting over their aversion to social media. Shearman & Sterling, for example, has two full-time employees who oversee its social-media efforts. The firm and its lawyers are active on LinkedIn, where around 90 percent of its attorneys have profiles, as well as Twitter and even YouTube. For a major international law firm like Shearman & Sterling, it might be hard to generate clients through social media, but the firm sees it as an important investment in overall brand building.

5. The media matters.

In the olden days, it was much easier for a law firm to ignore the media, responding to every inquiry with “no comment.” Those days are over. Given the proliferation of outlets and the relentless, 24/7 news cycle, lawyers ignore the media at their peril.

Yes, some clients don’t want their cases or matters in the media — and if that’s the case, then the firm should aid in the effort. But in certain situations, involving major clients with major matters, media coverage is inevitable. In that scenario, the lawyers on the matter should work closely with business development and marketing professionals, at the firm and even at the client if necessary, to shape the narrative.

Some firms, especially larger firms, find it helpful to have a centralized and coordinated media strategy. Otherwise, the firm runs the risk of a lawyer saying or writing something in the media that’s adverse to a client’s interest — and that might even get used against that client. This is why firms sometimes kill client alerts on new developments in an area of law. Generally such client memos are helpful at showcasing the firm’s expertise (see, e.g., [Wachtell Lipton](https://biglawbusiness.com/when-the-wachtell-memo-strikes/)), but in some situations it’s too fraught with peril.

Finally, marketing professionals should encourage their lawyers to develop relationships with journalists. Even just talking “on background” with a reporter — not for attribution, just helping the journalist understand a complex legal issue — can generate goodwill. That goodwill could come in handy down the road, when the lawyer is hoping to be quoted on breaking news, or when the firm finds itself in an unwelcome spotlight.

**********

In this highly competitive market for legal services, marketing and business development are more important — and more complicated and challenging — than ever. There’s a reason why chief marketing officers have the [shortest average tenure](https://www.wsj.com/articles/average-tenure-of-cmo-continues-to-decline-1489777765) of any C-suite executive, and why the comings and goings of Biglaw CMOs sometimes feel like Game of Thrones.

But on the positive side, a talented chief marketing officer is more valuable than ever. As reflected in their [robust](http://blog.larrybodine.com/2011/07/articles/current-affairs/average-bigcity-law-firm-cmo-salary-is-386294/) pay [packages](https://www.legalwatercoolerblog.com/2010/10/15/can-i-get-a-side-order-of-work-life-balance-with-that-job-please/), great Biglaw CMOs are worth their weight in gold.

# Biglaw Firm Actually Does Something About Work/Life Balance
## This firm is showing real dedication to the concept of work/life balance.

Big news from the world of Biglaw — well, at least if you care about work/life balance, it seems [one firm cares too](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/biglaw-firm-makes-big-joke-out-of-worklife-balance/?rf=1). (To be clear, you should care about work/life balance. Even if you’re hardcore Biglaw4Lyfe and scoff at the notion you’d show even a hint of weakness, you never know when burnout or other obligations will hit and then you too will enjoy some balance to your life.)

Biglaw behemoth [Shearman & Sterling](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/shearman-sterling-llp/) has just announced they are implementing an official policy allowing associates to work from home two days a month. Sure, two days a month isn’t going to radically alter anything, but it is a nice step forward. The policy is as follows:

Subject to the day-to-day needs of their respective practice groups, associates and counsel in good standing may work from locations outside of the office up to two (2) days per month; provided, that: (i) they are not needed to be physically in the office on the day(s) they choose to work remotely; (ii) their deal/case teams are informed in advance that they will be working remotely and the supervising partners on such teams have not objected to such arrangement; and (iii) they are actively working (and not just checking emails on a personal device, for example). It is the firm’s expectation that an associate or counsel working from outside of the office on a particular day will bill the same number of hours he or she would have billed in the office.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I’ve worked at jobs with the option to work from home on occasion, and, I have to say, it is a really nice perk. Deciding who is going to wait for the super to fix the dishwasher isn’t a fight between you and your spouse; you can get to your sister’s wedding a day early and avoid the panic when the flight scheduled to arrive six hours before the ceremony is delayed; meeting with your kid’s teacher doesn’t require a half-day off, schlepping back and forth to the ‘burbs; and some days it is just nice to wear your pajamas all day long.

According to our tipster, the reaction has been pretty positive:

We just heard form the partnership that, along with boosting the Seamless budget, the firm is instituting a new work from home policy where associates can work from home two days a month. They are going to provide laser printers and scanners for every associate that wants one. These announcements came as part of a town hall meeting discussing a number of issues, but work-life balance and trying to increase associate satisfaction metrics were big issues at the meeting. From what I can tell the reaction from the associates is very positive.

And note, more than just paying lip service to a policy, the firm is backing it up with tech support. All associates and counsel can request a firm printer/scanner to assist in working from home. That shows real dedication to the concept of work/life balance, and it is refreshing to see leadership on the issue.

# Top Biglaw Firm Will Keep Associates, Staff 'On Call' Instead Of Naming Third Potential Reopening Date
## What's the point in setting a new return-to-office date these days?

Biglaw firms were once so eager to schedule — and then reschedule, and reschedule again — the reopening dates of their offices. Some have grown tired of this seemingly endless rescheduling of events, and one firm thinks it may have found the solution to the problem.

Akin Gump, a firm that brought in $1,208,738,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 33 on the most recent Am Law 100, was originally supposed to reopen its offices on September 13. That plan got scrapped in favor of an October 11 reopening. Thanks to the rise of the Delta variant, that plan has also been tabled, and now the firm has a new idea.

Instead of offering up a third reopening date, the firm is placing all attorneys and staff on a standby of sorts. Here are the details from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/09/16/rather-than-delay-office-returns-again-one-firm-is-now-keeping-personnel-on-standby/):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In a Wednesday memo, firm chairperson Kim Koopersmith said the firm is delaying its Oct. 11 return-to-office date and will not be replacing it with another. Instead, the firm will give personnel three weeks’ notice before it decides to bring everybody back.

“We will advise you of the new date as soon as we set one,” Koopersmith said in the memo.

Will your firm take this “on call” approach in the future?

Help us help you. Let us know what your firm is doing to protect employees and adjust to the new normal during this unprecedented moment in time.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# U.S. Soccer HAS To Pay Men More, Because Playing For A Crowd Of Hooligans Is A Big 'Responsibility'
## And they said it with a straight face!

Sometimes a good legal strategy is a lousy publicity strategy. Case in point, the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF), which is defending itself in a pay discrimination suit by several popular female players by pointing out that they are smaller and slower than the male players, and thus should be [paid less](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2019/07/10/breaking-down-pay-gap-between-uswnt-and-usmnt-players/1671361001/) for winning than the men are paid when they lose.

“Plaintiffs ask the Court to conclude that the ability required of an WNT player is equal to the ability required of an MNT player, as a relative matter, by ignoring the materially higher level of speed and strength required to perform the job of an MNT player,” argues the USSF in its latest [motion](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6807270/USSF-Arguments.pdf). And while they may have a valid point about the Men’s National Team (MNT) and Women’s National Team (WNT) each negotiating separate contracts covering their different schedules and venues, saying that the women are intrinsically inferior makes USSF sound like … an asshole.

As does mentioning that, “Plaintiff Alex Morgan is receiving 75% of her $100,000 annual salary even though she cannot play because she is pregnant.” Although it does, in some sense, bolster the argument that the contracts are different, not because of sexism by USSF, but because the women chose to give each player a decent base salary, rather than compensating individual players based on performance like the men.

USSF has similarly pointed to the $34 million prize differential between the Women’s and Men’s World Cups, as if FIFA could justify an American employer paying women less than men. Here’s USSF President Carlos Cordiero doing just that in an open letter Saturday, on the eve of the SheBelieves Cup game between the USWNT and Spain. Timing is everything!

U.S. Soccer has offered a proposal for equal pay for our women and men players in all matches controlled by U.S. Soccer.

We look forward to discussing our proposal with the WNT and to resolving this in the best interest of everyone involved. [pic.twitter.com/c3xZ3AtnT7](https://t.co/c3xZ3AtnT7)

— Carlos Cordeiro (@CACSoccer) [March 7, 2020](https://twitter.com/CACSoccer/status/1236439340294770689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“I guess if that’s how you want to celebrate International Women’s Day and show support for, not only your players, but future players and girls all over the place, that’s one way to do it,” Megan Rapinoe told [The Athletic.](https://theathletic.com/1665888/2020/03/09/on-a-day-of-empowerment-ill-timed-u-s-soccer-letter-adds-to-players-resolve/?article_source=search&search_query=Meg%20linehan)

In its most recent motion, in addition to taking multiple swipes at the women’s game, USSF insists that the men play at a higher level, because “[t]here is a significantly deeper pool of competition in men’s international soccer than there is in women’s international soccer.” Simultaneously, USSF argues that the men have a harder job because men’s soccer fans are all hooligans, and, even at home games, the stands are filled with supporters of their Central American opponents.

Opposing fan hostility encountered in these MNT road environments, especially in Mexico and Central America, is unmatched by anything the WNT must face while trying to qualify for an important tournament. (2nd King Dec. ¶ 16.) Even the hostility of fans at home crowds for the MNT in some friendlies can be unlike anything the WNT faces.

This might possibly have something to do with the fact the WNT has won four of the past eight Women’s World Cups, including the most recent rounds in 2015 and 2019. The men’s team is undoubtedly stronger and faster, but they might find more of their own fans in the stands if they won more.

Indeed, there may be strong legal arguments that the women’s and men’s contracts are not comparable for reasons having nothing to do with sexism. But arguing that the women play more games, but carry less “responsibility” because the prize money is lower and their fans don’t throw beer bottles on the field certainly gives the impression the USSF is bunch of sexist jerks.

# MoFo Scores Partial Victory In 'Mommy Track' Gender Discrimination Lawsuit
## Two claims against the Biglaw giant have been dismissed, though plaintiffs will have the opportunity to replead their case.

The legal maneuvers are continuing in the $100 million [gender discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/) case against Morrison & Foerster. As you may recall, a total of [seven plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit-against-mofo-spirals-and-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/) have come forward alleging there’s a “mommy track” at the firm that they were placed on after they took maternity leave, and the firm is fighting back against the allegations.

[MoFo has already ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/mofo-files-for-sanctions-against-firm-plaintiff-suing-them-for-gender-discrimination/)tried, [and failed](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/mofos-attempt-to-play-hard-ball-with-gender-discrimination-plaintiff-fails/), to bring sanctions against one plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe 4. The firm argued Doe 4 had signed a release of all claims against the firm when she negotiated a severance package from the firm. But magistrate judge Jacqueline Scott Corley found plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded Doe 4 signed the agreement under economic duress (she was eight months pregnant when she was fired from the firm).

While the hardball tactics may not have yielded much fruit for the Biglaw giant, some regular-old lawyering has netted a modicum of success. Last week, Judge Corely dismissed two of the claims in the complaint, one by Doe 4 and another by Jane Doe 5, though they will have an opportunity to replead these claims.

Though Doe 4 sufficiently pleaded she was under economic duress when she signed the release, the judge found a second claim of retaliation by MoFo was insufficient on the pleadings. As Big Law Business [reports](https://biglawbusiness.com/morrison-foerster-trims-some-female-attorneys-claims-for-now):

Jane Doe 4 also failed to state actionable retaliation under federal or California law, the court said. She didn’t allege Morrison & Foerster provided any prospective employer with a negative employment reference. She only stated that she “believed” it did.

MoFo also argued Doe 5’s claims were time barred. Doe 5 argued she experienced “extraordinary circumstances” — namely complications from a second pregnancy that happened after she was told she was being let go from the firm, but before it become effective — that should toll the statute of limitation. However, Judge Corely found she didn’t sufficiently plead she had diligently pursued her federal claim.

We’ll continue to monitor all the legal twists and turns in this case.

# The Great Divide: Good Firms Versus Bad
## Do you work at a bad law firm? Here are some signs to look out for, according to in-house columnist Mark Herrmann.

Many of us, I think, talk past each other.

It’s because there’s a chasm between lawyers who work at good firms and lawyers who work at bad ones; those people don’t even speak the same language.

Suppose you work at a good law firm.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
You return phone calls to clients within 24 hours.

That’s not taught to you; that’s assumed. It’s ingrained; it’s in the air you breathe. A client — a client! — called. The call gets returned as soon as humanly possible. If the call won’t get returned with 24 hours, your secretary calls the client and explains why: “I’m sorry, but Mr. Herrmann is in trial for another week. Can he return your call after the jury goes out, or does your issue require urgent attention?” “I’m sorry, but Mr. Herrmann’s wife is in labor. Can he call you after Junior is born?” “I’m sorry, but Mr. Herrmann died yesterday and so won’t be returning your call this afternoon. (Perhaps tomorrow.)”

This isn’t something that’s optional, that you try to do on occasion. It’s fundamental. You know in your very soul that clients are what keeps your joint running, and you return their calls promptly. Period.

But if you read surveys about client satisfaction, you see clients saying that one of their main issues with outside lawyers is that they don’t return phone calls promptly.

In good law firms, that’s inconceivable. It just doesn’t happen.

The dissatisfied people who are responding to the surveys are hiring bad law firms.

(Suppose you work at a law firm, and you’re reading these words, and you’re thinking, “That’s silly. I often avoid calling clients. If we have bad news to deliver, or I’m working on other things, or I just don’t feel like it, we let clients wait.” I’m sorry to break it to you, but here’s the truth: You work at a bad law firm.)

The same thing happens when we talk about meeting deadlines.

At a good law firm, you meet deadlines. Period.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If the discovery is due on Monday, you produce it on Monday (or request an extension before Monday arrives). If the expert report is due on Wednesday, you serve it on Wednesday (or request an extension before Wednesday). If you promise the client an answer by Friday, you deliver the answer on Friday (or call, explain why you can’t deliver the answer on Friday, and find out if that’s acceptable).

You don’t learn that.

You breathe it. It’s what happens.

(Suppose you work at a law firm, and you’re reading these words, and you’re thinking, “That’s silly. I often miss deadlines. No judge has ever dismissed a case for serving discovery responses or an expert report a few days late. Judges always give you a second chance. Herrmann’s just a compulsive nutcase.” I’m sorry to break it to you, but here’s the truth: You work at a bad law firm. (Thank me: No one else was going to tell you; now you know.))

When we speak to each other about practicing law, sometimes we miss each other’s meaning.

People who work at good firms assume that phone calls will be returned promptly and deadlines met. People who work at bad firms can’t imagine living in that world. So when these lawyers talk to each other, they speak past each other. They don’t recognize their lack of shared assumptions.

(I notice this too when I give “book talks” about [The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590316762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590316762). I overwhelmingly give those talks at good firms: Kirkland, Skadden, Latham. When I talk about the relentless pursuit of quality, the partners are nodding in agreement with me (and the associates are looking concerned). But when I give my talk at bad firms (no names here) or before associations of lawyers who practice in lowbrow fields of law (again, no names here), the audience is baffled: “What’s up with that guy? He takes this way too seriously.” I no longer accept invitations to speak at lowbrow joints. There’s no reason to speak to an audience that won’t understand you.)

At good law firms, they have a word for people who fret the small stuff: “Lawyers.”

At bad firms, this entire column didn’t make much sense at all.

Mark Herrmann spent 17 years as a partner at a leading international law firm and is now responsible for litigation and employment matters at a large international company. He is the author of [The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590316762/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1590316762) and [Inside Straight: Advice About Lawyering, In-House And Out, That Only The Internet Could Provide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614385394/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1614385394&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20) (affiliate links).

## * WHATCHA GONNA DO, BROTHER, WHEN THIS JURY'S PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD RUNS WILD ON YOU?!? Gawker was hit with an additional $25M in punitive damages yesterday in Hulk Hogan's sex-tape lawsuit, on top of the $115M award the jury had already slapped the media company with last week.

[[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-hulkhogan-idUSKCN0WN1Q2)] * They were gonna grant you leave to file, but then they got high? The Supreme Court has puff, puff, passed on the opportunity to hear a challenge posed by Nebraska and Oklahoma to Colorado's legalization of marijuana. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, contending that the case fell within the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. [[NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/21/471295765/supreme-court-denies-marijuana-suit-from-colorado-s-neighboring-states)] * This took longer than the iOS 9 download: Hot on the heels of the announcement of new Apple products, we got the news that the tech giant and its rival, Samsung, will face off next term before SCOTUS in a patent case that's been going on since the iPhone 4 was still considered the latest and greatest in smartphone technology. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/03/21/samsung-v-apple-patent-case-headed-to-supreme-court/?ref=/blogs/law)] * ""Once you start seeing leading law firms offering this, it's going to become more prevalent and pretty rapidly, because it's going to be required to compete.""

Vault recently released its closely watched rankings of [the nation’s 100 most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/vault-100-rankings-2024/). It was there that we learned Cravath held onto its title as the most prestigious firm in America for the seventh year in a row, and that Davis Polk slipped out of the top 5 firms, despite becoming a compensation leader in Biglaw’s recent salary and bonus wars.

But what if your firm wasn’t top-ranked in the Vault 100? Perhaps your firm isn’t the most prestigious, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have clout. Some law firms reign supreme when it comes to certain practice areas, and others are known to dominate entire regions of the country.

Which law firms are considered to be at the top of their game by practice area and region in our post-pandemic world? Let’s find out!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For the purposes of the practice area ranking, Vault asked associates to vote for up to three firms they think of as the strongest in their own practice area, and the overall ranking indicates the firms that received the highest percentage of votes. Associates were not allowed to vote for their own firm. Pay attention, prospective laterals, because this ranking could be quite useful for you.

We’ve picked out a dozen of the practice areas that were ranked by Vault (you can see the full list by clicking [here](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-practice-area)):

Appellate Litigation: Williams & Connolly (replacing Gibson Dunn)

Bankruptcy/Restructuring: Kirkland & Ellis

Energy, Oil and Gas: Vinson & Elkins

General Commercial Litigation: Quinn Emanuel

General Corporate Practice: Cravath

Intellectual Property: Fish & Richardson

International: White & Case

Labor and Employment: Littler Mendelson

Private Equity: Kirkland & Ellis

Real Estate: Fried Frank

Securities/Capital Markets: Davis Polk

Tax: Skadden

Next up, we’ve got a ranking that matters to those who think “location, location, location” is the most important thing in life. Vault’s regional rankings are based on votes tabulated from associates who were asked to rate firms on a 1 to 10 scale based on their prestige within the region.

Congratulations to the firms that moved up in this year’s practice area and regional rankings, and congratulations to all the firms that made the cut in the first place. It must be nice to see which firms associates consider as their peers in prestige, and it must be even nicer for partners to know whose pricing models they need to undercut the next time around.

# Open Layoffs v. Stealth Layoffs: What's Preferable To Associates?
## No layoffs at all is the most preferable answer here.

Current associates have expectations for how partners communicate that vary markedly from those of their decade-ago peers. They demand more openness, honesty and compassion. Stealth layoffs are highly visible internally and run counter to these expectations. They would cause profound and lasting damage to the respect associates have for partners and firm leaders, with consequent impact on motivation and loyalty. …

It’s clear that today’s associates would see stealth layoffs as management failing to take responsibility, being dishonest and lacking compassion. They’d exact a heavy toll on relationships with partners and leaders, and thus on motivation and ultimately firm productivity and vitality.

— [Hugh A. Simons](https://twitter.com/simonshugh?lang=en), formerly a senior partner and executive committee member at The Boston Consulting Group and chief operating officer and policy committee member at Ropes & Gray, suggesting that [open layoffs would be preferable](https://www.law.com/2020/07/27/open-not-stealth-layoffs-the-way-to-go-with-current-generation-of-associates/) to stealth layoffs for today’s generation of Biglaw associates.
