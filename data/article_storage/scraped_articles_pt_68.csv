# Are Layoffs On The Horizon For New York's Biglaw Firms?
## Trouble may be brewing in Manhattan.

We haven’t heard of New York firms doing these performance reviews as of yet. But, we will likely see those in December and January. The numbers just aren’t there to support the staffing. They have all been suffering from a dearth of capital markets activity, and I’m not sure at what point they say they have had enough.

— Owen Burman, senior consultant for Wells Fargo Legal Specialty Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2022/11/21/new-york-law-firms-take-heavy-profit-and-revenue-hits/) concerning the heavy profit losses Biglaw firms in New York City have experienced through the first three quarters of the year. Specifically, profits for New York firms have declined by 18.3%, while demand in New York has dropped by 2.9%, perhaps fueled by 34% hit in M&A work.

# Biglaw Firm Offers New Pandemic Perks, Including Fertility And Family-Planning Benefits
## Which firm just rolled out coverage and reimbursement for IVF, egg freezing, adoption, and surrogacy?

Here at Above the Law, we know how difficult it can be to have children and successfully return to work, so we make it a habit to applaud the expansion of Biglaw firms’ parental leave programs — especially if they’re gender neutral and applicable to all firm personnel, from staff members to associates. What we rarely have the opportunity to praise are firms that offer health benefits that include fertility treatments and family-planning services — not because these benefits don’t exist, but because they’re not publicized as often as parental leave plans are.

Finding assistance to conceive a child or freeze your sperm or eggs can be complicated, the adoption process can be overwhelming, and paying for any of these things can be financially out of reach, even for Biglaw employees. That’s why benefits covering fertility and family-planning services are viewed as major perks.

Which firm is willing to step up and assist its associates and staff members when it comes to starting families? It’s Loeb & Loeb, and here’s a description of the specialized services the firm will be offering through WINFertility:

[  ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As of October 1, 2021, the firm is introducing an important new family building benefit. We have partnered with WINFertility, a specialized concierge service that provides care, education and oversight for comprehensive fertility benefit management to administer fertility benefits with or without a diagnosis of infertility; and, otherwise not covered under the firm’s medical plans. Services include in-vitro fertilization, egg and sperm freezing, adoption and surrogacy. The benefit provides for a $30,000 lifetime maximum toward these services, utilizing the guidance of WINFertility nurse care managers who offer clinical expertise and ensure you understand your benefits.

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Loeb & Loeb.)

These benefits — coupled with the firm’s yet-to-be announced enhanced benefits, like a staff parental leave policy, a more generous staff salary continuation policy, transitions benefits group Medicare/retirement planning, and a more robust wellness initiative — are part of Loeb’s plans to compete in the Biglaw benefits arms race to attract and retain employees.

Kudos to Loeb & Loeb on its new family-friendly suite of benefit offerings. This is something we’ll keep an eye on as firms continue to cater to work-life balance requests in the “post”-pandemic new normal. Hopefully your firm is will decide to offer important benefit policies like these soon if it’s not doing so already.

We have some disturbing news to report out of the Houston, Texas, legal community, where two young law firm associates were identified earlier this week as the deceased in a recent murder-suicide. The associates in question are [Candace Rechtmann](https://www.germer.com/attorneys/candace-rechtmann/), 29, and [Tyler Greenwood](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xBefxDjMOz4J:https://www.chamberlainlaw.com/media/news/574_Tyler_Greenwood_joins_Chamberlain_Hrdlicka_Houston_Office.pdf&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), 31, who both died from gunshot wounds on January 25. Rechtmann, an associate at Germer, and Greenwood, an associate at Chamberlain Hrdlicka, were reportedly involved in a relationship that ended in the summer of 2022.

The [Texas Lawyer](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2023/01/30/houston-associates-identified-as-two-dead-in-murder-suicide/) has additional information from local police:

According to police, patrol officers responded to a welfare check call on the evening of Jan. 25 and found the woman, 29, and man, 31, suffering from gunshot wounds. Paramedics pronounced them deceased at the scene.

The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences found that Rechtmann was the victim of a homicide, with multiple gunshot wounds the cause of death. The institute found that Greenwood committed suicide and died due to a gunshot wound to the head.

Houston police reported that the man had a gun near his body and a gun holster in his waistband.

Rechtmann was a 2018 graduate of FSU Law, while Greenwood was a 2018 graduate of Emory Law. They had both completed federal clerkships before joining their respective firms.

Rett Holidy, managing principal of the Germer office in Houston, offering the following statement on Rechtmann’s untimely passing: “It’s been very difficult, a young bright talented lawyer with a very promising future in front of her. Everyone who worked with her respected and liked and loved her. It’s been devastating.”

Larry Campagna, managing partner of Chamberlain Hrdlicka, also provided a statement on the associates’ deaths: “All of us at Chamberlain Hrdlicka are deeply saddened by the tragic news. We send our sincerest condolences to the Greenwood and Rechtmann families and their loved ones at this incredibly difficult time. Out of respect for the families’ privacy, we do not wish to comment any further.”

# Chadbourne Class Action Lawsuit Gets Juicy AF -- Lawyer Fires Back Against Criticism

Kerrie Campbell

There have been [a lot of recent lawsuits](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-male-dominated-culture/) filed by [women partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-alleges-sexism-derailed-her-career-in-a-new-lawsuit/?rf=1) at Biglaw firms alleging gender discrimination. But none have been as intriguing as the purported class action lawsuit filed against Chadbourne & Parke.

The [allegations in the complaint are juicy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/), natch, with Kerrie Campbell alleging she was paid less than her male counterparts and that the firm is in the “dark ages” when it comes to gender issues. But the really interesting part came earlier this week, when a group of [14 female partners at Chadbourne wrote a letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/these-biglaw-partners-are-super-pissed-someone-filed-a-class-action-lawsuit-on-their-behalf/?rf=1) to Campbell’s attorney, David Sanford, taking issue with the lawsuit.

Now Sanford has responded.

You’ll remember one of the primary issues the group of 14 took with the lawsuit is that the case cannot be on their behalf, since Sanford didn’t speak with them. Indeed, they called it “patronizing and patriarchal,” arguing that failing to reach out to them before filing silenced their voices. Only one problem with that. Ethical rules prevent Sanford from doing that:

As you may know, many states, including New York, where the complaint was filed, prohibit lawyers from soliciting clients with whom they have no prior relationship. You represent that our firm “made no effort” to contact any of you and that this is an indication of our lack of respect for you. While we welcome the opportunity to speak with any female Chadbourne partner interested in finding out more about the case or their rights within a class action discrimination context, our unsolicited contact with any of you arguably would have violated the legal ethics rules that we strictly follow as responsible attorneys.

I love that Sanford took these Biglaw partners to task over legal ethics — though, to be fair, I don’t imagine the need to solicit plaintiffs comes up too frequently in their practice.

Sanford also notes that even though the women who signed the letter take issue with the lawsuit (though they don’t comment on any of the factual allegations in it), Campbell is far from a lone voice crying in the wind:

We have been contacted by current and former Chadbourne partners and associates, men and women, who feel the class action complaint captured well the claims of gender discrimination at Chadbourne. We expect to amend the complaint in October to reflect the additional information we have gathered.

Next up on As The Biglaw Firm Turns: the amended complaint.

Welcome to the bonus party, Skadden!

After [Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) started the bonus war by handing out special spring bonuses to have associates share in the firm’s largesse,[ Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) went over the top with even bigger bonuses. Now Skadden has announced their own spring bonus plans.

They’re matching the Davis Polk scale, according to the following chart:



Full announcement [available on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/skadden-spring-bonuses/2/)

They went with June/December disbursements, rather than the earlier April/September some firms are rolling with, but, most importantly, the amount of money remains the same. The firm also clarified, like their peers, this will be in addition to the regular year-end bonuses, which they anticipate will be at least as big as last year’s bonus pool.

Additionally, the firm noted that if an associate does not meet the hours requirement for the June bonus payment (though that threshold is not disclosed in the email, it’s expected it’ll be in line with the firm’s usual hours requirements), they’ll have an opportunity to garner a make-up payment along with the December bonus.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# One Of The Top 40 Largest Law Firms In The Country Is Cutting Associate Salaries
## There's a little twist of the knife on these salary cuts.

BakerHostetler is a pretty big law firm, with over 900 attorneys they clock in at 39 on the National Law Journal’s 2019 ranking of firms based on size. With that many attorneys it’s not a surprise the firm also does well when it comes to gross revenue, making $732,494,000 last year. But as we well know at this point in the COVID-19 crisis, that means nothing when talking about austerity measures.

So what’s going on at the firm? Sources report there are pay cuts across the board with associates and staff (making more than $80,000 or $70,000 depending on the market) seeing a 10 percent cut, 15 percent for counsel, and partners will see unspecified reduced distributions. But BakerHostetler’s take on the the cuts is different than at most firms.

Because they say it’s a 10 percent cut, but then you have to read the fine print. It’s 10 percent annualized, meaning in upcoming paychecks greater than 10 percent is being taken out (roughly a 16 percent cut going forward) in order to lead to a 10 percent cut for the year. Which is the opposite of how most Biglaw firms are announcing their pay cuts, most places are saying associates will have a X percent pay cut which is a number less than X annualized.

This is how the firm explained the cuts in an internal slide:



At least the firm is not laying anyone off at this point.

We reached out to the firm for comment, but have yet to hear back.

# Biglaw Partner Nominated For Ambassador Role Faced Sexual Harassment Allegations At His Former Firm
## Given the White House's vetting process and the public nature of the claims, this was a known issue before the nomination.

[Adrian Zuckerman ](https://www.seyfarth.com/AdrianZuckerman)is a real estate partner at Seyfarth Shaw who’s been nominated by Donald Trump to be the U.S. Ambassador to Romania. With this additional publicity, Zuckerman’s past is now being looked into, and according to [a report from the New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/09/14/trump-ambassador-pick-faced-sexual-harassment-claims-at-former-law-firm/), he’s been sued over allegations of sexual harassment.

Back in 2008, when Zuckerman was a partner at Lowenstein Sandler, he, along with his then firm, faced a lawsuit by his former secretary, Jamie Ferrauiola, for sexual harassment. According to reports, the lawsuit included allegations that Ferrauiola was forced to view pictures of semi-nude women, that Zuckerman spoke to her in graphic terms, and he repeatedly asked her out:

Ferrauiola claimed that after she was hired at Lowenstein to work as Zuckerman’s secretary, he frequently asked if she wanted to meet him for dinner and would invite her to have drinks with him during working hours.

According to the suit, he would force her to have closed-door meetings, where he would show her pictures and screen savers of semi-nude women and update her on his love life. She alleged he spoke about his sex life in graphic detail and asked for dating advice.

She also claims she was humiliated by remarks that Zuckerman made to others in the office, including that she “was bearing Zuckerman’s child.” Her suit references a vulgar term that Zuckerman allegedly made toward Ferrauiola and claims Zuckerman “frequently made sexual gestures” when referring to women in the office and spoke about “big breasted women.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Within in year of the case being filed, it was settled for an undisclosed amount.

Despite the import sexual harassment claims have recently received, a source says that given the White House’s vetting process and the public nature of the claims, this was a known issue before Zuckerman’s nomination was announced:

An attorney familiar with the Trump administration’s nominations process said any nominee facing Senate confirmation must go through a two-track clearance process, including an ethics analysis and a deep investigation of the person’s fitness for the position. The latter would include past conduct and allegations, such as lawsuits, said the attorney. Harassment issues could be disqualifying, but allegations are not presumed to be true, the attorney added.

“The fact that this nomination was announced means this analysis was done and he survived,” the attorney said.

Asked about the case, Lowenstein offered this:

In a statement this week, Lowenstein said the firm “does not comment on personnel or legal matters, however, the firm takes pride in promoting a culture of respect for all of its employees, that is positive, fair and free from intimidation of any kind.”

While Ferrauiola’s attorney in the matter said:

Ferrauiola could not be reached for comment. Albert Adam Breud, who represented Ferrauiola in the complaint, said the settlement is confidential. “The matter was resolved to the satisfaction of all parties,” said Breud, of Firestone & Breud.

Zuckerman must still be confirmed by the Senate before he becomes ambassador.

# Overnight Success, 2 Decades In The Making
## What happens when you choose work you enjoy instead of jobs that aren’t aligned with what you want out of life.

In 2005, [Laura Frederick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurafredericklaw/) traded her Biglaw job in San Francisco for an in-house role in Allentown, Pennsylvania, that paid half her former salary. “My goal was finding a job where I could leave at 5 p.m. every night, and didn’t have to work weekends,” she explained. “I wanted more time with my kids. I wasn’t focused on my professional life.”

Fast forward to today. Laura owns a solo law practice, and runs [How To Contract](https://www.howtocontract.com/), a paid community where legal professionals receive practical training on commercial contracts. The best part? She has the freedom to decide who to work with, when she works, and what to work on. And for the first time in her career, she’s taking off for an entire month this summer.

And in doing so, she makes far more money than at any of her previous jobs.

I remember when I first discovered Laura. It was a few months into the pandemic, and one of her daily contract tips showed up on my LinkedIn feed one day. I mean it was good. Really good. You could tell by the reactions to her post, too. “Laura’s tips were incredibly helpful,” a lawyer recently told me. “I mean, they were so clearly written and so easy to understand.”

Those daily tips helped Laura to build a dedicated following on LinkedIn. I saw it all happen firsthand. She’d tapped into something that the world really wanted. A few months in, Laura turned her daily tips into a book, “[Practical Tips On How To Contract](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Tips-How-Contract-Techniques-ebook/dp/B08NSM4YMV/),” and then launched How To Contract, a contracts training business, that immediately exploded in popularity.

It seemed like Laura had found success immediately after she started. But after getting to know her and learning her story, I realized that Laura’s “overnight success” was anything but. Instead, it came from decades of hard work, focused on doing work that she enjoyed, instead of chasing things that didn’t align with her goals in life.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“At one point I wanted to be a general counsel because that’s what you’re supposed to want to be,” Laura explained. When she finally interviewed for a general counsel job, she had second thoughts. “They told me all of the different things I’d be doing, and I was like — I don’t want to do that. Why would I do that when I knew I would be happier working on commercial contracts?”

So that’s what she decided to focus on instead. Which explains Laura’s career decisions in the decade and a half after leaving that Biglaw job. She declined big titles or roles that didn’t seem interesting, and chose jobs that let her do what she truly enjoyed.

That’s how she ended up at Tesla in 2017. There, she says, she found herself in the best job of her career. She had the opportunity to do sophisticated work with amazing people, all with a mission to improve the world. Laura loved her role managing supply chain contracts and operational issues for one of Tesla’s gigafactories and being the lead attorney on vehicle-related environmental regulatory credits worldwide.

After two years at Tesla, Laura decided that it was time to move on. “I felt like I’d won the job lottery. But I still felt like something was missing. It took a lot of soul-searching, but I finally figured it out. It was because I didn’t have freedom,” she explained. “Freedom to choose who I worked with, who I didn’t work with, what I focused on, and how I spent my day.”

So just as she did many years earlier, Laura decided to walk away from an enviable position to do something that made sense for her, at that point in her life. She quit her job at Tesla to open up a solo law practice. When she left, she had no clients, no experience running a law firm, and no idea if she’d make enough as a single mom to support herself as a single mom and her four boys.

And that’s when things got really interesting. Because success came almost immediately. Within a year of going solo, Laura was earning more than she ever did as an employee. Pretty soon, she was focused on how to expand her growing practice. Which is how she ended up on LinkedIn, posting one contract tip per day.

Before long, Laura — through her practice and How To Contract — found herself earning four times as much as she ever did at Tesla.

“I created How To Contract to provide the kind of practical contract training I wanted for myself 15 years ago,” Laura explained. “These days, so many lawyers are coming straight from law school to in-house, or who are former litigators or corporate securities lawyers, who are suddenly finding themselves responsible for commercial contracts. They’re smart, capable, and well trained, but not well trained in this. And the market doesn’t have anything to help them.”

The market doesn’t have anything to help them. That’s the other part of this story. You never know when the thing you’re genuinely interested in is suddenly high in demand. When that happens, the market can turn your passion into something truly extraordinary.

Like for [Marty Lipton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lipton), who [wanted to be a professor and authored corporate law on the side](https://businesslawtoday.org/2020/07/interview-marty-lipton/) when demand for his expertise suddenly exploded during the hostile takeover boom. Or [Larry Sonsini,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sonsini) who [enjoyed working with founders of early stage companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidparnell/2015/08/11/larry-sonsini-of-wilson-sonsini-on-building-a-law-firm-from-the-ground-up/?sh=47f667106d18) when he suddenly became uniquely qualified to advise and invest in startups during the tech boom. Hell, my friend [Matt Margolis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flattorney/) just wanted to make funny tweets and [ended up with a valuable skill that multiple legal tech startups needed.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/engaging-content-meet-the-legal-community/)

So here’s what I’m taking away from Laura’s story.

When you’re at a career crossroads and considering doing something else, stop trying to overachieve. Instead, choose something you’ve got a genuine interest in, that lets you “stay in the game” for as long as possible. Maybe that means focusing on a niche with no known exit options. Or maybe that means taking a lifestyle job for a few years.

Don’t think too far ahead. Just choose what you think is right for you given what you want out of life. Because if you really enjoy what you’re doing, you might be able to do it forever. Which means you’re eventually going to become exceptionally good at it. And then, who knows? Maybe one day, the market will catch up to what you’ve been working on.

And that’s when things get really interesting.

# The Legal Profession's Reckoning
## The tight constraints of an inflexible culture must be abandoned to fight a common enemy and then rebuild.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Lauren Stiller Rikleen to our pages.

What a difference a few months and a global pandemic can make in thinking about the future of the legal profession and diversity. When approached earlier this year by MothersEsquire about writing this article, it seemed an opportune time to reflect on why inequalities remain in the legal profession.

As someone who has been working in, writing about, and consulting to this profession for decades, I welcomed the chance to analyze why the two key measures of success — compensation equality and achieving equity partnership — remained an intractable challenge for women and minorities. I wrote the piece, sent it off mid-February, and promptly got on a flight to speak at a bar leadership retreat. Now, all those activities feel like they were from another time.

Ironically, the earlier draft observed that the diversity data was reminiscent of the classic movie Groundhog Day in which Bill Murray lives the same day over over. I wrote that the part of Murray was instead played by the thousands of women and diverse attorneys who daily faced the unaddressed institutional impediments that thwarted their careers because the fix required difficult conversations about money and power that leaders have avoided.

The irony, of course, was that, within a few weeks of submitting the article, all of us were living a very real Groundhog Day drama of social isolation. The question now is whether, in today’s frighteningly altered world, these challenges still matter.

My answer remains a resounding yes. The landscape may have changed dramatically, but if ever there was a good time for difficult conversations, it is now, as we learn to rebuild a drastically altered work environment.

Key impediments to a diverse and inclusive culture have always included a management structure unwilling to holding leaders accountable for diversity and inclusion metrics, a failure to insist that everyone adhere to a culture of mutual respect, a failure to eliminate workplace misconduct, and an unwillingness to offer flexibility without stigma. Nothing about the insidious coronavirus has made this less important.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
My original article expressed optimism that changing demographics would shift attitudes. I observed a growing activism among law students that demonstrated a willingness to use their voices more strategically and effectively than ever before. For example, students had protested against law firms that required summer associates and new lawyers to sign arbitration and nondisclosure agreements in the face of misconduct. Law students were avoiding judicial clerkships with newer judges whose appointments may have been based more on their social agenda than their legal qualifications. Law student activism even extended into efforts to boycott a global firm for its representation of an oil company alleged to have misled investors about climate change.

I also wrote that challenges long labeled as “women’s issues” now reflected the aspirations of both men and women who seek flexibility without stigma and technology without strangulation. I observed a possible link between how young families were structuring their lives at home and what they seek and expect once in the workplace.

The article recommended — as I have for decades — that firms redefine the vague but career-damaging concept of “commitment” as a measure of someone’s value at work. Too many years and careers have been lost to the false assumption that motherhood equates to a lack of commitment unless accompanied by inhumane demonstrations of devotion that have no relationship to one’s capabilities and desire to succeed.

The past months have supported how arcane that notion of commitment actually is. Men and women have both been home, balancing client demands and firm needs while unexpectedly home-schooling their children and checking on their parents. The personal and professional have merged in ways that could never have been imagined, yet nonetheless handled with grit and grace.

Law students and young lawyers are now immersed in an unprecedented world of fear and uncertainty. Can they dare hold onto the aspirations they had before COVID-19 crashed their world? Will firms become so immersed in the crisis that diversity and inclusion are seen as the well-meaning concerns of a bygone era?

My original conclusion still holds. The successful emergence from this merciless pandemic will require creative minds and a willingness to rethink every structural component of the workplace. In a world where the mightiest have been humbled, there has never been a greater need for the talented, creative thinking that can only come from a diverse, multigenerational talent pool.

The tight constraints of an inflexible culture must be abandoned to fight a common enemy and then rebuild. The virus that paralyzed us has also forced a reckoning.

Firms must compete for talent, and the talented will want to vet firm culture.  Those with a reputation for respect and inclusion will hold a competitive advantage and a greater opportunity for institutional sustainability.

So, I remain optimistic that firms will respond to this grave challenge, take stock of their legacy, and create a better future for the profession. There really is no other choice.

# In-House Perk: Affirmation
## When you leave Biglaw to go in-house, the insecurity, lack of confidence, and feeling of dread and that something was going to fall apart any minute -- it’ll vanish.

I haven’t written about this topic previously because I thought it was my unique experience, but a recent text from a friend, who just went in-house this year, changed my mind. One perk of being in-house counsel is the affirmation that I am excellent at what I do.

Before you chalk this up to hubris, it’s helpful to contrast my experience in Biglaw.

When I was at a law firm, where I felt like the expectation was nothing less than perfection, my entire vibe, especially as a young lawyer, was “don’t mess up, you cannot mess up.” Rightly or wrongly, I felt like there was no room for mistakes, even small ones, if I wanted to continue receiving work from shareholders. Even when I performed well and achieved a good result for a client, I didn’t feel jubilation or pride or satisfaction. I simply felt relief — relief that I hadn’t messed up, relief that I didn’t feel bad, relief that I survived another day without getting found out that I didn’t know all the answers. Even when I received compliments from shareholders or clients, I couldn’t “feel” or enjoy them, my mind often already preoccupied with the next case or matter.

Does this sound like imposter syndrome? Maybe. It also probably didn’t help that the Biglaw environment felt deeply competitive, where associates felt like they had to outshine one another in billable hours or rainmaking in hopes of making partner one day. But importantly, when I transitioned in-house, this insecurity, this lack of confidence, this feeling of dread and that something was going to fall apart any minute — vanished.

In contrast, now that I’m in-house, I often find myself in a very engaged and fulfilling flow. I am intellectually stimulated and challenged; I am highly motivated to help my client solve their problem, and I feel like I’m a part of something bigger than just the one issue currently before me. When I receive compliments from colleagues or gratitude from clients, it affirms that I not only know what I’m doing, but I’m really good at it. And at least for me, that affirmation is priceless.

Meyling “Mey” Ly Ortiz is in-house at Toyota Motor North America. Her passions include mentoring, championing belonging, and a personal blog: TheMeybe.com. At home, you can find her doing her best to be a “fun” mom to a toddler and preschooler and chasing her best self on her Peloton. You can follow her on LinkedIn ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/meybe/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meybe/)). And you knew this was coming: her opinions are hers alone.

# The Biglaw Partner That Called Out Judge Kozinski
## Is retirement taking the easy way out?

Katherine Ku

On December 18th, famed Ninth Circuit judge [Alex Kozinski retired](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/breaking-judge-kozinski-is-retiring/). While it was the end of a notable legal career, it came amid [a sexual harassment scandal](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/judge-kozinski-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/) and so it wasn’t met with the typical rosy accolades that typically accompany a 30+ year stint on the bench. While the jurist’s bawdy sense of humor [was well known](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-women-acknowledge-judge-kozinskis-behavior-was-an-open-secret/) the[ extent of the alleged harassment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/more-yes-more-allegations-against-judge-kozinski-reading-them-will-make-you-feel-gross/) — asking women clerks to view pornography with him in his chambers, making inappropriate sexual comments, and verbal abuse heaped on female juniors — was only whispered about. But once the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/prominent-appeals-court-judge-alex-kozinski-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/2017/12/08/1763e2b8-d913-11e7-a841-2066faf731ef_story.html) did an exposé on the experiences of clerks working for Kozinski, others felt compelled to tell their #metoo tales — over a dozen women came forward — about the judge and within a week he was [off the bench](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/what-will-it-take-to-get-alex-kozinski-off-the-ninth-circuit/).

But that doesn’t have to be the end of the story. Indeed, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati partner [Katherine Ku](https://www.wsgr.com/WSGR/DBIndex.aspx?SectionName=attorneys/BIOS/15734.htm) argues it shouldn’t be. Ku clerked for Koz in 2003-04, and earlier this month she wrote her [own WaPo op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/pressuring-harassers-to-quit-can-end-up-protecting-them/2018/01/05/0d44aeba-ea5d-11e7-8a6a-80acf0774e64_story.html?utm_term=.d4c7840a6ac6) detailing her experience. In what has become a familiar story, she alleges Kozinski  “regularly diminished women and their accomplishments” and even asked her to look at a picture of a nude man with him. As she describes, that experience profoundly changed her clerkship experience:

For the rest of my year-long clerkship, I closed the door to my office and communicated with the judge as little as possible.

In a[ new interview](https://www.law.com/sites/therecorder/2018/01/17/qa-wilson-sonsinis-katherine-ku-talks-about-decision-to-call-out-kozinski/) with Law.com, Ku reveals she was compelled to go public with her story after Kozinski resigned. While some viewed Kozinski’s resignation as the end of the story, Ku explains that the cased-closed attitude disturbed her and she believes an investigation into the judge’s pattern of behavior is critical for the legal profession as a whole:

The legal profession’s and general public’s reactions to the allegations against the judge and to the likely consequences of his resignation for the federal judiciary’s inquiry into his misconduct struck me as muted. That concerned me.

His behavior was not as shocking as what we’ve heard about figures like Harvey Weinstein, but the allegations concerned a highly regarded and influential Article III judge—someone with significant public duties. An investigation to fully uncover what had happened seemed critical, for the reasons I explained in the piece.

Ku remains the only lawyer still in private practice to come forward under her own name to describe the “hostile, demeaning and persistently sexualized environment” of his chambers. (Kozinski’s first named accuser, Heidi Bond, left the law to begin a career as an author). As Ku’s original piece notes, in the absence of an official investigation others, perhaps afraid to be seen as “piling on” are less likely to come forward. And as she told Law.com, it can also be uncomfortable for attorneys to have their role in a public controversy inverted:

[T]hose of us in private practice wish to be viewed by our clients and colleagues first and foremost as professionals and advocates. That can be hard to reconcile with voluntarily involving oneself in a situation like this as a victim or bystander, rather than as counsel.

If or when Kozinski attempts a second act — after the #metoo zeitgeist has passed — Ku notes that he’ll benefit from cutting off the continued conversation about his behavior that was orchestrated by his retirement.

[I]t appears that Kozinski’s future in the legal profession almost certainly will be decided without the benefit of a robust investigation. At some point, a law school dean may have to weigh whether to place him in a position of trust over budding legal careers. Law firms may need to assess whether he’d be a fair mediator or arbitrator for their clients’ disputes. And the people making those decisions will have to do so without knowing the full scope of his misconduct.

Ku’s coming forward — and when she did it — is a demonstration that women who have stories to tell haven’t missed their moment. And we’ll all be better off when the allegations see the light of day.

# Associates Are Kings For A Day With New Raises
## The wait for raises is over at another firm!

At King & Spalding associates have been patiently wait (and counsel still are) for word that the firm would ante up the cash for raises. After all, with over a billion dollars in gross revenue last year ($1,529,418,000 to be exact) and ranking 21st on the Am Law 100, K&S sure seems like the kind of elite firm that will match market compensation.

Well, today the wait ended.

In a firmwide email, Chair Robert D. Hays announced that partner-track associates would be getting raises, and yes, they’re moving to the Davis Polk scale effective July 1:

# Associate Compensation Scorecard: Biglaw's 2020 Bonus Bonanza
## Is your firm listed here? If not, what are the partners waiting for?

Since we broke the news of the market bonus scale for associates at large law firms in the United States — a trend that was [started by Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) on Wednesday, November 11, 2020, and finally [followed by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) on Monday, November 23, 2020 (with the addition of special bonuses) — many firms quickly fell in line and matched the scale. When will your firm announce its bonuses?

As usual, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have already matched the new bonus scale, whether special bonuses are or were included, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if available), and the date those bonuses will be paid. Today, we unveil that table for your viewing pleasure. We will be updating this table on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, as news on bonuses is announced. If you see any information here that is incorrect or needs clarification, [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus%20Scorecard%20Correction).

Help us help you now (and if/when you decide to make a lateral move in the future). Let us know what your firm’s minimum billable hours targets are for bonus eligibility and when your firm will pay those bonuses. You generally must remain at your firm until the payout date to receive them, as stated in most memos, which could make it all the more difficult for you to leave your place of employment.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

# Firm Report Doesn't See A 2020 Recession, The Folks Actually Running The Law Firms Disagree
## Partners have a more bearish view than the banks.

The Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group released its latest report and once again informed us that revenue is up — but only because firms have jacked up their rates — demand is sluggish, and firms are taking longer and longer to collect on their bills largely because in-house counsel have [made everything unduly difficult](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/in-house-counsel-make-increasingly-arcane-billing-demands-and-its-costing-firms-money/).

The biggest sticking point in the report is over just what the next year to 18 months will bring. Citi Private Bank takes the firm stance that there is no looming recession, but the people running the firms and spending every day with access to financial records of businesses across sectors are totally smelling that recession. A majority of “industry leaders” surveyed believe the bottom falls out next year and an even larger majority see trouble by 2021.

“Although 2020 is expected to be a positive year for the law firm industry, it is an opportunity for firms to ensure they are well-positioned should there be a downturn in the market,” said Gretta Rusanow, Head of Advisory Services for the Law Firm Group at Citi Private Bank. “Despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility, and a challenging talent market, we expect the most successful firms will continue to expand and innovate in 2020. For those firms, expansion will be closely aligned to the firm’s business strategy – more so than pursuing opportunistic growth.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This view doesn’t necessarily clash with firm leadership’s sense of a recession. Law firms often experience recessions on a bit of a lag. It’s why law firms talk about the Great Recession as a 2009 phenomenon instead of something that burned everyone in 2008. There’s money to be made in law when the rest of the economy begins its skid. Indeed, right up until the point where firms can’t continue to boost revenue by raising rates, recessions aren’t bad at all for firms.

Rusanow’s advice for firms may not come out and say it, but she’s telling everyone to invest in countercyclical talent.

So if you’re in bankruptcy, this might be a good time to test the waters.

# Am Law 100 Biglaw Firm Gets Ready To Screw Associates On Salary
## Associates will be crossing their fingers for a decent salary.

There’s some not great compensation news on the horizon for attorneys at [Nelson Mullins](https://www.nelsonmullins.com/) — specifically non-equity partners, of counsel, and associates. Beginning in 2023 the firm is changing how those attorneys’ compensation is calculated “in light of current economic conditions, including increasing concerns about a recession next year.” That… doesn’t sound good at all.

The firm’s plan is to have compensation include a fixed component as well as an “earn-up” component based on collections goals. So… associate compensation will now be based in part on something (collections) they have absolutely no control over? That sounds terrible.

From internal documents at the firm:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“For Non-Equity Partners, Of Counsel and Associates, in light of current economic conditions, including increasing concerns about a recession next year, we are implementing an “earn-up” component to base incomes next year. Over the past two years, we have increased compensation significantly based on competitive market expectations and, like the legal profession in general, we are now experiencing a slowdown in the demand for our services in certain practices. Accordingly, we are taking proactive measures to mitigate potential negative financial implications next year. The intent of the earn-up is also to encourage all of our attorneys to begin 2023 with a faster start towards achieving their collection goals and to bill and collect cash at a more accelerated pace given the recession predictions. Thus, the base incomes in 2023 will include two components – a fixed component and an earn-up component. The earn-up component may be earned and paid quarterly to those who meet their pro-rata collection goal each quarter. Details will be provided to you next week in a separate email prior to this being communicated to the rest of our attorneys.”

This system is similar to what the firm did during [the height of COVID ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/nelson-mullins-cuts/)when 9 percent of an associate’s salary was held back pending collections.

As was true then, this kind of a system is demoralizing for associates. Associates have virtually no ability to influence collections, so all they can do is bill and cross their fingers that clients pay. As one tipster noted:

This will be an effective salary cut for most associates who have no control over collections and whether partners give discounts to clients.

All this is very concerning for folks at Nelson Mullins — particularly since there’s been no word from its peer firms of similar moves. For the record, last year the firm took in $680,826,000 in gross revenue making it 70th on the Am Law 100.

We reached out to the firm for comment, but have yet to hear back.

# Giant Law Firm Overlooks Giant Trump Conflict... Sends 'Oops' Letter
## This is why you perform a conflict check BEFORE you write your screeds.

Rep. Tom Price

Perhaps [Dentons](http://www.dentons.com) has finally grown too big. The global behemoth of a law firm sent a threatening letter to CNN last week, after CNN pointed out that Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Rep. Tom Price, had purchased shares in an implant company conveniently before introducing legislation that would financially benefit the company.

Then someone [performed the conflict check](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/01/19/law-firm-withdraws-retraction-request-to-cnn-over-price-story/?utm_term=.c257c04f8e2f).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Dentons attorneys [J. Randolph Evans](http://www.dentons.com/en/randy-evans) and [Benjamin P. Keane](http://www.dentons.com/en/ben-keane) wrote [the original letter to CNN](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/01/18/in-retraction-request-to-cnn-trump-team-confirms-cnn-story/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.f1665f86034d), complaining that CNN had omitted key facts about Price’s investment, and demanded a retraction from CNN — implying that legal action could follow. The omitted facts, mind you, didn’t make Price look any better. In their account, CNN should have noted that Price was working on the policies that would aid his investment for over a year… and that his broker bought the stock as part of a portfolio rebalancing. If we take this story at face value, then someone with a basic sense of ethics would have, at some point during that year, maybe told the broker not to be investing in stocks that would raise obvious red flags and create disquieting conflicts of interest.

No wonder these people wanted to [eliminate the independent ethics committee](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/02/politics/office-of-congressional-ethics-oversight-of-ethics-committee-amendment/).

Well, it turns out that someone else at Dentons performed a simple conflict check and revealed that Dentons actually does a whole mess of work for CNN, prompting [Mike McNamara](http://www.dentons.com/en/mike-mcnamara), Dentons’s U.S. Chief Executive Officer, to write [another letter apologizing to CNN](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/01/19/law-firm-withdraws-retraction-request-to-cnn-over-price-story/?utm_term=.487e85280ed0).

On behalf of the Firm, we apologize for the letter, which should not have been sent by Dentons given our representation of CNN on other legal matters.

He should have apologized for the firm concocting a bullying threat in a shameless effort to chill media coverage, but this will have to do.

In any event, the withdrawal is a responsible and professional move on the part of Dentons. If only, say, a certain House member worried as much about conflicts….

# Last Year, Women At This Magic Circle Firm Earned About 40 Percent Less In Bonuses Than Men
## Women are being seriously shortchanged at this Biglaw firm.

Linklaters has a problem: women in the firm’s senior associate ranks are being shortchanged when compared their male colleagues. Say hello to the Magic Circle’s gender pay gap in merry olde England.

Under the Equality Act 2010, companies in the United Kingdom with more than 250 employees must submit data to the government each year on their gender pay gaps. Law firms are not required to submit data on their equity partners. Earlier this week, Linklaters became the first Magic Circle firm to release data on its 2017 wage information for men and women, and at first glance, the numbers seem pretty stark. Men at the firm, on average, received about 58 percent more in bonus money and about 23 percent more in hourly pay than women. On the bright side, slightly more women at the firm earned bonuses than their male counterparts in 2017 (about 78 percent versus about 76 percent). Take a look at this table:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Rather than separating attorneys from staff members, the firm has broken down its pay data into four separate quartiles. From the firm’s [report](https://lpscdn.linklaters.com/-/media/files/about-us/responsibility/gender-pay-gap-report_2017.ashx?rev=f353a0cb-5f8a-4d1e-ba86-cf800c5e1328):



Women in the firm’s upper pay quartile — likely senior associates — earn 6.50 percent less than men, which is very disappointing. Linklaters explains away the fact that its average pay for women is lower than it is for men by providing details for its lowest pay quartile, which significantly impacted the firm’s overall gender pay gap data:

We have a more significant gender imbalance within our lower pay quartile. The roles that sit within this lower quartile are predominantly secretarial and junior business team positions, and around 80% of these roles are held by women. Whilst these roles are competitively rewarded with reference to the market, the fact that so many of them are held by women has the effect of reducing the average pay of women in our firm, impacting our overall gender pay gap.

As we mentioned above, it’s disheartening that women who have been with the firm long enough to be in its upper pay quartile are being paid less than men, but Linklaters seems pretty upbeat about it. The firm wrote in its report that “[w]hile we still have some way to go, the gender balance in our upper, upper-middle and lower-middle pay quartiles is encouraging evidence that our efforts over recent years to attract and retain women in more senior roles have begun to pay off.” The firm is “confident that [it] pay[s] men and women fairly for equivalent roles.”

Many law firms have yet to submit their gender wage gap data, but a few have. For example, Silver Circle firm [Herbert Smith Freehills](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/prominent-law-firm-paid-female-employees-30-percent-less-in-bonuses/?rf=1) revealed that women earned 30 percent less in bonuses and 19 percent less in average hourly wages than men.

Gender-based pay gaps remain at Linklaters and many other law firms in the U.K. and the U.S., but it is only through transparency that we can begin to address the issue. Reporting like this calls attention to the fact that women continue to earn less than men for the same jobs, and when firms are forced to publicly release potentially embarrassing data like this, things may change — and quickly.

Will my firm raise my salary?!?!?

It has been exactly one month since [Cravath tried to break our tiny ‘lil corner of the internet](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) by announcing a new compensation scale for associates, raising salaries for first-year associates to $180,000 and giving more senior associates a raise between $20,000 and $35,000, depending on class year. In the days that followed, over 100 other firms raised salaries, the majority of which have matched the MoneyLaw scale.

Which is all well and good for those that have gotten raises to market scale, but there were some tense times as associates worried whether their firm would pony up the big bucks. Here at Above the Law, we made an editorial decision to bring you all of the salary news as it happened, confident that our audience was very interested in the information. And we were right; you were desperate for the latest in the salary wars, as it turned out. We received emails from a flood of readers expressing their gratitude that our coverage was putting pressure on firms that hadn’t yet increased pay.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But which firms were the most interested in the latest on associate compensation? We took a look at the traffic analytics for Above the Law over the last month to determine which Biglaw firms had the most users visit the site, and the results are interesting to look at.

Now, the below is not a perfect list — plenty of employers hide the names of their networks so they cannot be captured by our statistics or their networks are named after their service providers, instead of the name of the firm, and can’t be traced. And no, this doesn’t capture associates that visit ATL from their personal networks. But it is meant to be fun, and give us a brief glimpse into how much the Cravath raises shook Biglaw.

Remember it’d been almost a decade since there’d been any movement on associate salaries, and the industry was ripe for some big changes. So here are the top 25 Biglaw firms, ranked by visits to Above the Law since the associate raises were announced:

- Sidley Austin
- Jones Day
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Davis Polk & Wardwell
- Gibson Dunn & Crutcher
- Dechert
- Skadden Arps
- Mayer Brown
- Paul Weiss
- WilmerHale
- Proskauer Rose
- Goodwin Procter
- O’Melveny & Myers
- Covington & Burling
- Paul Hastings
- Pillsbury
- Latham & Watkins
- King & Spalding
- Morrison & Foerster

Can you get a judicial order to put the toothpaste back in the tube? Fox News is aiming to find out.

Yesterday, the company filed a [motion to seal](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.595940/gov.uscourts.nysd.595940.9.0.pdf) portions of the employment [discrimination case](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/fox-news-gets-employment-discrimination-suit-to-go-with-1-6b-dominion-defamation-suit/) filed on Monday by Abby Grossberg, a former booker for Tucker Carlson and Maria Bartiromo. Grossberg alleges widespread sex discrimination at the network, as well as a a hostile work environment where derogatory comments about women and Jews was pervasive. But it’s allegations about conduct by Fox’s lawyers as they prepared Grossberg to be deposed in the $1.6 billion Dominion defamation suit which have the network flipping out.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In her [complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.595940/gov.uscourts.nysd.595940.1.0.pdf), Grossberg describes conduct which is perilously close to suborning false testimony. For instance:

Ms. Grossberg also left the deposition preparation sessions with the distinct impression and understanding that it was in her clear best interests to respond to questions with the generic, “I do not recall” whenever she had the opportunity.

Ms. Grossberg left the deposition preparation sessions without knowing that by giving such false/misleading and evasive answers like the ones Fox’s legal team reacted to positively to during the prep sessions, she not only opened herself up to civil and criminal liability for perjury, but was subtly shifting all responsibility for the alleged defamation against Dominion onto her shoulders, and by implication, those of her trusted female colleague, Ms. Bartiromo, rather than the mostly male higher ups at Fox News who endorsed the repeated coverage of the lies against the Dominion.

Grossberg alleges that Fox’s lawyers encouraged her to deflect blame away from her male colleagues and the male hosts and onto herself and Maria Bartiromo, whom management described as “menopausal,” “hysterical,” and a “diva.” The complaint characterizes this as part of a pattern of discrimination the plaintiff encountered and adds that Grossberg was discouraged from telling Dominion’s lawyers that Bartiromo lacked sufficient staff to properly read all the emails from Dominion warning them not to put Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani on the air to slander the voting machine company.

For its part, Fox has been trying to head off this complaint since before it was filed. On Monday, Fox [sought a TRO](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=qP3YkE2tdjchZ45eMXvjLA==) in New York state court blocking Grossberg from disclosing anything about her communications with its lawyers. On Tuesday, after Grossberg filed her federal case, it withdrew the state complaint. Then Wednesday, it filed the instant motion to seal, more or less pasting in the language from the withdrawn TRO.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Fox argues the Grossberg “met with inside and outside counsel for Fox News on several occasions to provide Fox News’ attorneys with information to assist in their provision of legal advice to Fox News and their defense of the case, as well as to prepare for Ms. Grossberg’s deposition.”

“These sessions were aimed at further developing a legal strategy and defense to the claims alleged against Fox News in the Dominion Lawsuit and ultimately providing Fox News with legal advice,” they continue, adding that the plaintiff “publicly filed privileged and confidential information belonging to Fox News without Fox News’ consent.”

So the defendant would like to seal portions of the complaint which have already been on the public docket for almost three days now. Perhaps this is in preparation for an eventual breach of contract counterclaim against Grossberg, which might go some way to inducing her to settle. But if the aim is to actually hide this information from Dominion, that ship has probably sailed. But thanks for letting the rest of us know that paragraphs 135-140, 143, 145, 146, 149-151, 155- 156, 160-162, and 312 are where the juicy stuff is.

Sounds like more Biglaw merger mania is in the air! The Legal Intelligencer is reporting that Philadelphia-based Fox Rothschild is in merger talks with the North Carolina firm of Smith Moore Leatherwood.

Fox Rothschild has been on a bit of a merger and lateral tear the last few years, but potentially picking up the 130-attorney firm of Smith Moore would be a large addition to the firm’s bottom line. If this acquisition goes through, it would be Fox Rothschild’s largest pickup to date (the 2016 merger with the [Minnesota-based 82 lawyer firm of](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/almID/1202744799989/Fox-Rothschild-to-Acquire-Minneapolis-Firm/) Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly currently holds the record).

But as you might expect, the firms are being appropriately discreet in discussing their plans. Fox Rothschild’s chairman is vague in his comments:

“We’re pretty active in our growth strategy. We are always talking with lawyers and law firms, and until we have something conclusive we don’t comment on those discussions,” Fox Rothschild chairman Mark Silow said Wednesday.

Smith Moore managing partner Julianna Theall Earp neither confirmed nor denied the merger rumors.

This rumored merger continues the [larger industry trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/merger-mania-dominates-2018-in-the-legal-industry/) of merger mania sweeping the nation.

Just like that, another firm bites the dust when it comes to COVID-19 salary cuts.

Sources tell us that Am Law 200 firm Kelley Drye has instituted firmwide salary cuts to ensure its “economic vitality” during the upheaval that’s been caused by the coronavirus crisis. Kelley Drye is the 179th highest grossing law firm in the world, but as we know all too well, high revenue is no match for a pandemic.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here’s an excerpt from an email (available in full on the following page) that all Kelley Drye employees recently received from [James Carr](https://www.kelleydrye.com/Our-People/James-S-Carr), the firm’s chairman:

The economic impact of the coronavirus crisis is beginning. Our clients are focusing on their business needs first, as is expected, and we are seeing a slowdown in payment of our invoices. As a result, and given the uncertainty around when we might return to our offices and when all businesses will be operating at full capacity, Firm management will take the following steps:

• Equity partners’ draws will be reduced on a proportional basis by as much as 20%, effective April 30;

• There will be an across-the-board, prospective salary reduction of 10% for all other lawyers and employees earning over $100,000, effective May 15, 2020. Please note that no one subject to this reduction will be cut below $100,000 annually; and

• The July 1 administrative staff salary increases will be postponed.

Kelley Drye did not immediately respond to requests for comment. We will update this article if and when we hear back from the firm.

In his memo, Carr notes that these salary cuts come in addition to the firm’s earlier cost-cutting measures, including shortening its summer program, deferring the start date of their incoming first-year associates, and postponing the hiring of non-essential employees. Perhaps most importantly, according to Carr, “We hope to be in the position to revisit and possibly restore salaries to pre-COVID levels at some point in the future, once the crisis abates and our practice returns to its normal rhythm.” On that note, one distraught source said, “They’re never going back.” Ouch.

# Reminder To Laid-Off Biglaw Associates: You're Just A Product
## And that just might work in your favor.

It’s hard to work at Biglaw for any length of time and *not* feel like a cog in a machine. Firms don’t have widgets to sell to clients, they have the hours associates and partners put in to make their money. So, humanity aside, in a very real way, you are the product being sold.

Last year, [there was a run on cogs](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/) — that is, associates — when there weren’t enough bodies to staff all the deals clients wanted to do. But that was 2021, and in 2022, the corporate market is down. So a bunch [of big firms that snatched up all those useful cog](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/)s last year now [want to unload them](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/classic-stealth-layoffs-those-performance-based-layoffs-at-cooley-hit-high-billers-too/) on the market. Hence the dreaded stealth layoffs that a number of firms have engaged in this year.

Losing your job — and feeling like you’re to blame for the firm’s economic decision — is rough. But, as reported by Bloomberg Law, there may be opportunities for those associates who suddenly find themselves out of work, as they describe the unique market conditions in [“Big Law Layoffs Mean Buyer’s Market for Firms Raided During Boom.”](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-layoffs-mean-buyers-market-for-firms-raided-during-boom)

There’s great information in the piece that should give hope to attorneys who suddenly find themselves out of work.

“This is the moment for us to be opportunistic and go grab some talent that either got poached from us or we couldn’t afford in the last few years,” said Husch Blackwell chair Catherine Hanaway.

….

Irwin Kishner, executive chairman of the New York-based Herrick Feinstein, said the firm fought last year to preserve its talent base. The changing conditions present a chance to compete not only for top associate talent, but also partners, he said.

“It’s just going to be a greater talent pool now to be able to decide who you’re gonna bring in and who you’re not,” Kishner said.

And that’s a key difference between the l[ayoffs that shook the legal industry in 2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/06/how-did-latham-become-the-poster-child-for-layoffs/) and the ones we’re currently experiencing. In 09, the layoffs were much wider spread, were not limited to particular practice areas, and coincided with a much larger economic downturn. And importantly, the frenzy of lateral moves that characterized 2021’s legal market helped to create a class of waiting employers eager to scoop up the unemployed in 2022.

So, yes, it might *feel* like your career is cold product getting offloaded to a buyer anxious for a bargain, but it could be a lot worse. Just ask the law school class of 2009.

# Bar Exam Passage Rates Continue To Plummet Across The Nation
## How many states have seen drops in their bar exam passage rates thus far?

Thus far, to our knowledge, 36 states have released their results from the July 2016 administration of the bar exam. In how many states did the overall passage rates for test-takers decline since the exam was given in July 2015?

Hint: In many of the states where bar passage rates declined, it was their worst performance in decades.

# Texas Market Update: Lateral Opportunities Abound
## For out-of-state candidates interested in making the move, hiring conditions have never been better.

Texas has received plenty of national attention over the past couple of years, with Austin now [ranking first](https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/02-08-2022-migration) among the top 50 largest metros for new residents as a proportion of total population. Even before the pandemic, Texas was attracting inbound migration from states like California and New York, buoyed by its lack of state income tax, high-paying jobs, and relatively lower cost of living. But as reflected in the recent wave of [major](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oracle-moves-corporate-headquarters-to-austin-texas-11607724881) [companies](https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/12/01/tesla-headquarters-officially-move-austin-factory/8828422002/) relocating their corporate headquarters to the state, that trend has lately kicked into overdrive.

All of this growth has boosted the market for legal services and created terrific opportunities for lateral candidates, including in some practice areas that historically were not prominent in Texas. For out-of-state candidates interested in making the move, hiring conditions have never been better.

Austin’s emergence

The most striking change is the emergence of Austin as a genuine Biglaw hub. Austin has historically supported a relatively small legal community compared to Dallas and Houston, and to be clear, it remains in third place today. But the growth rate has been impressive: over the past year or so, firms including Gunderson, Latham, Kirkland, Quinn Emanuel, and MoFo have opened Austin offices, principally to serve their expanding roster of Austin-based tech clients.  To put Austin’s growth into perspective, since January 2021, there have been approximately 70 corporate lateral associate moves compared to 17 corporate moves in all of 2019. (I did not include 2020 stats because of the pandemic and stall in hiring.)  The larger cities have also seen growth, such as O’Melveny’s opening in Dallas, but Austin is the big story.

Some new practice areas in demand

Transactional roles in Texas have tended to focus on M&A, and the demand from M&A groups is still strong in the current market. But an interesting new development is the growth in firms seeking capital markets attorneys. Currently, there are over 240 posted corporate opportunities in Texas. On the litigation side, there has lately been an uptick in demand not just for complex commercial litigation but also for IP litigation specialists. Hiring has also been strong in ERISA and real estate practices.

Profiles that firms seek

The sweet spot for making a lateral move remains 2-5 years of experience. But in addition, we are seeing an increase in firms seeking more experienced attorneys who can hit the ground running and take on substantial responsibility. So there are some great opportunities for candidates with 6-8 years of experience who can enter as a senior associate or counsel.

Another notable trend is the declining importance of strong prior ties to Texas. It used to be a real challenge to break into Texas offices without having lived in the state previously. Today, firms will still ask the question, but in this hot market, even weak ties like having law school friends who live in Texas will generally be an acceptable answer.

In summary, the Texas legal market is flourishing, with available positions for associates of all practices and seniority levels. Law firms are open and HAPPY to relocate worthy candidates — and some firms are still offering phenomenal sign-on bonuses for the right attorneys. If you are interested in hearing about the Texas market, please feel free to reach out to me at WendyBoone@laterallink.com.

# Fortune 500 Clients Tell Law Firms To Go Right Ahead And Work From Home
## 'Yeah, we don't know what Morgan Stanley's smoking.'

After Morgan Stanley [beclowned itself](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/we-need-all-lawyers-in-the-office-says-bank-definitely-not-freaking-out-about-commercial-real-estate-portfolio/) in a memo encouraging its lawyers to shun work from home policies and get back to work, other elite clients are rushing to assure attorneys that they really don’t care where people work from as long as the quality remains top-notch.

Legal chiefs from Dell, Qualcomm, and Adobe [told Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/tech-legal-leaders-veer-from-morgan-stanley-return-to-work-order) that they couldn’t care less about the issue that seems to have Morgan Stanley so hot and bothered.

“I feel no need to dictate to my outside law firms how they should manage through these difficult times,” said longtime Qualcomm general counsel Donald Rosenberg.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s a message that places the major companies more in line with the mood of Biglaw, where top lawyers [privately expressed shock](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2021/07/19/arrogant-and-tone-deaf-morgan-stanley-clo-stance-draws-ire-from-uk-european-finance-partners/) at Morgan Stanley’s gumption in presuming to lean on its counsel.

“It’s so out of tune with the rest of the market – a complete outlier”, a finance partner at a U.S. firm in London says. “When I saw that, I thought he was tone deaf.”

“If [investment banks] cannot even give us freedom on where to work, they may as well hire robots,” the partner adds.

They also argue that the stance does not match up with the reality of working with the bank. That partner recently advised the bank on a cross-border transaction, with the matter entirely conducted via Zoom and email.

They say that there were no hints of any unhappiness with where they worked on the mandate, and as a result, they doubt “anybody is taking this seriously.”

It brings us back to our original suspicion that the bank might be more concerned about the prospect of permanent work from home models creating problems for the bottom line. Problems that other top-tier clients don’t share.

Indeed, as Bloomberg Law points out, Adobe is already in the process of permanently shifting to a 50-50 office/home work model. The company is hardly going to take its lawyers to task for coming to the same conclusions.

“While we haven’t yet had discussions with our outside counsel about their work arrangements, the quality of their work is more important to us than where they do their work,” [Adobe GC Dana] Rao said. “Our outside law firms are our partners, and we trust them to figure out the model that works best for them and us.”

“The customer is always right” may be a well-worn maxim but it’s got limits. We’ll see how far it can stretch as we get into the autumn and firms begin the put up or shut up phase of reopening.

# Spicer Confirms President Stands With Kasowitz... Start The Countdown To His Firing

Could this union be heading toward Splitsville?

Rumors have circulated for over a week about [tensions between Donald Trump and Marc Kasowitz](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-is-waking-up-to-a-bad-morning/) that have careened toward a breaking point. And that was before Kasowitz’s week from hell. Yesterday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer fielded a question about Marc Kasowitz and the tempest in a teapot over his [aggressive lack of patience with a critic](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-writes-angry-emails-and-everyone-completely-overreacts/).

“Does the White House and the President still have confidence in Mr. Kasowitz to speak for the administration on this Russian matter?”

“Yes, he does, and I know Mr. Kasowitz has issued an apology in that matter,” Spicer said before moving on.

Stick a fork in him, he’s done. To think, I’d actually argued that Kasowitz’s brusque handling of his online detractor might mend his fences with the president. Alas, it looks like Kasowitz’s time may soon be done.

I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking that Spicer’s statement sounds like the exact opposite of an impending break with the Manhattan litigator. Well, only if you’ve not been paying attention.

Because there’s actually no surer sign you’re on your way out the door than receiving a “vote of confidence” from this administration.

Don’t believe me?

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“The president has confidence in the director,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters.

That’s what Sean Spicer said [when asked about Jim Comey](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/331793-spicer-trump-has-confidence-in-comey) six f**king days before Comey got fired. And that’s got nothing on Kellyanne Conway saying “General Flynn does enjoy the full confidence of the president” hours before he was forced out.

It’s not that the administration has an official “kiss of death” policy of praising someone right before they’re shown the door. Frankly, Spicer probably has no idea he’s sealed Kasowitz’s fate. But to use the Comey situation as an example, Spicer’s relatively benign answer kicked off days of wall-to-wall coverage on cable news of how ridiculous it would be for Trump to keep the dedicated lawman in charge of the FBI. Trump took the hint.

To that end, Kasowitz may well benefit from the demise of the Senate health bill sucking up enough cable bandwidth to keep Spicer’s comment off the radar for a day or two. But eventually, some producer is going to need to fill 20 minutes of airtime and they’ll herd a bunch of talking heads together to explain why Trump should not have confidence in Kasowitz and then it’s just a matter of time until Trump watches it and decides the bobblehead on TV gives better advice than his inner circle and Kasowitz is sent packing.

So let’s start wagering. When does Kasowitz leave the Trump matter?

Throughout the past decade, employers have placed a heavier emphasis on investing in the well-being of their employees than ever before. Corporate wellness programs have evolved from providing health information and counseling to using financial rewards to incentivize workers to stay in shape. A late research study found that workplace culture is the largest barrier employees face in their efforts to feel healthier and happier. Twenty percent of adults suffer from mental health issues each year, resulting in companies losing 200 million workdays and approximately $200 billion.

Consequently, this insight has shed some light on the need for law firms to do more than offer an excellent benefits package. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to the perfect wellness program. Still, many steps can be taken, both from an organizational and an individual level, to create a workplace that fosters humanity and compassion. A workplace where employees can bring their whole selves to work and find comfort in knowing their employer has their back regardless of mental health issues or any other challenges one may experience. The following offerings below are recommended to be considered as part of your firm’s wellness program, which has proven to reduce attrition and increase employee satisfaction, productivity, morale, and overall health.

Educate Your Team on Mental Health

When was the last time someone mentioned mental health in your office? While more and more employers are sharing about how important it is to speak about mental health in the workplace, many employers are not doing a good enough job creating a safe space for their workers to open up about their issues. Nor are they educating them on who they can go to talk to, how they can seek help, and which resources they can tap into for guidance. By investing in mental health education, law firms can teach employees at all levels how to build confidence, vocabulary, and skillset to seek and offer emotional support.

Increased Flexible Work Arrangements

Studies have shown that employees’ performance and well-being prosper in workplace environments with flexibility around where and when work can happen. Flextime, which gives the worker the ability to adjust the time in which they begin and end work (as long as they put in the number of hours required by the employer) can go a long way for an employee. Other great flexible working arrangements include telecommuting and compressed workweeks.

Lead with Compassion

When leaders tend to display compassion in the workplace, they enable trust and positivity among employees. This type of trust improves both employee performance as well as creates an environment for the employees that makes them feel safe to open up about their personal issues. Employees who work with compassionate leaders appear to be more innovative and adaptable, which results in the delivery of a higher quality work product.

Wellness Events and Fairs

Does your firm have a specific event dedicated to educating your employees on wellness? In addition to the healthcare insurance program, your firm offers, setting up a scheduled annual wellness event provides an exciting opportunity to encourage employees to look forward to, which promotes healthy habits and shows the employees that the company they work for cares about them.

Fitness Consultations

Some firms will provide fitness consultations at their wellness event, which can conveniently provide employees with various assessments to prevent and reveal issues before they become more problematic. This routine evaluation can include BMI, body fat analysis, and other evaluations to help the employee understand where they need to focus their energy on their wellness planning.

Team-building Activities

Team building is at that core of an organization’s success, and as lawyers, we often are too busy to take the time to focus on this essential exercise. It’s so important to carve out time to develop your team both inside and outside of work to uncover the best ways of working together by connecting on a deeper level, getting to know each other’s interests and personalities.

Firm-wide challenges

Whether you decide to implement these on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, firm-wide challenges are a fun way to engage the employees on a different level while improving health at the same time. An example might be water consumption or total walking steps as a way to get employees involved, especially those who may not admit they are particularly as interested in wellness to begin with.

Monthly Individualized Follow-Up

In the legal world, we tend to be so incredibly busy and often forget to pause and celebrate our wins, discuss our challenges on a deeper level, and track our progress, even as it pertains to wellness. This can be addressed simply by having an informal dialogue with your employees about wellness. Perhaps in your next firm meeting, ask your employees what they are focusing on in regards to their wellness plan. As leaders and colleagues, be sure to keep a record of what was shared and go out of your way to check on their progress. Your commitment and investment of their wellness will go a long way!

# Vault Ranks The Best Summer Associate Programs (2022)
## Which law firm do summer associates love most?

Summer associate programs at many firms are wrapping up if they haven’t already come to an end, and early recruitment interviews begin in less than a week at law schools across the country for next year’s crop of summer associates. What better time to release Vault’s closely watched rankings for the best summer associate programs?

Hot on the heels of Vault’s rankings of the [most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2022/) and the law firms with the [best quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2022/) comes the career website’s ranking of the best summer associate programs in Biglaw. Junior associates (first- through third-year attorneys) who summered at their current firms were asked to rank their experiences on how much fun the program was and how well it prepared them for life at the firm through six different categories (attorney interactions, substantive assignments, training and mentoring, preparation for associate life, quality of events, and satisfaction with firm-sponsored social opportunities and social interactions). From those ratings, Vault the best summer associate programs in three categories: Attorney Interactions, Career Development, and Social Experiences. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that many of the firms that made the Top 10 list for having the best quality of life made the Top 10 for having the best summer associate program.

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year — and of course there was, since this was the first summer after the majority of associateships went remote due to the pandemic. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Firms With the Best Summer Associate Programs](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-summer-associate-programs) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2022:

Christopher Tripp Zanetis

We’ve got some very sad news to report about a promising, young associate who lost his life last week in a helicopter crash.

[Christopher Tripp Zanetis](https://www.debevoise.com/trippzanetis), a 2017 graduate of Stanford Law School, had a unique résumé. According to his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tripp-zanetis-5512b910/) profile, he was a fire marshal with the New York Fire Department, a captain with the 106th Rescue Wing of the U.S. Air Force, and an associate with Debevoise & Plimpton. Zanetis, who was on his third tour of duty in Iraq, died last week during a troop transport when HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter that was carrying him and six other airmen hit a powerline along the Syria-Iraq border. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/03/17/debevoise-associate-killed-in-iraq-helicopter-crash/) has some additional details about the accident:

The accident, which military officials said was not a result of enemy fire during a combat mission, occurred near the western Iraqi town of Al-Qa’im, where U.S. forces operate a logistics center and resupply base, [according to news reports](http://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/seven-troops-killed-helicopter-crash-iraq.html). Al-Qa’im, part of [Iraq’s restive Anbar province](http://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1450759/iraqis-continue-security-clearance-operations-in-territory-once-held-by-isis/), was the [last ISIS stronghold in the country](http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/03/middleeast/isis-iraq-qaim/index.html) until pro-government forces backed by the U.S. pushed out the extremist group late last year. The border region [reportedly remains an active transit point](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/02/iraq-qaim-syria-isis-security.html) for ISIS fighters fleeing Syria.

“This tragedy reminds us of the risks our men and women face every day in service of our nations,” [said a statement](http://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1468051/us-aircraft-crashes-in-western-iraq/) by Brig. Gen. Jonathan Braga, director of operations for the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Iraq and Syria.

According to Dean M. Elizabeth Magill of Stanford Law, Zanetis was a “beloved student, friend and community member” at the school and would be “deeply missed.” Dean Magill said that everyone at Stanford was “heartbroken at his loss.” All flags on campus were lowered to half-staff in honor of Zanetis. “Our thoughts are with his family and with all who knew and loved him,” Dean Magill continued. “He was one of the most extraordinary students I had the privilege of knowing and he will long be remembered in the institution.” The law school is planning an event to celebrate his life later this spring.

Here’s a statement from Debevoise on Zanetis’s death:

We are deeply saddened to learn that our colleague Tripp Zanetis was lost in Thursday’s U.S. military helicopter crash in Iraq. He was an exceptional person and will be greatly missed by his many friends and colleagues in the firm. Our thoughts and prayers are with Tripp’s family.

# Associates Will Never Be Fully Satisfied Without Work-Life Balance
## Associates said they would leave their firms thanks to a loss of flexibility associated with office attendance policies.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

They’re not chasing the almighty dollar, they’re saying we want recognition for the work and the toll that it takes on our lives.

What comes across loud and clear from the data is that this is a very engaged set of associates, contrary to how they’re sometimes represented. They are committed to their firms, their colleagues and their careers, and they’re willing to put in the time and effort to develop. They’re just looking to do so in a sustainable way.

— Fiona Trevelyan Hornblower, president and CEO of the NALP Foundation, in comments noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/07/compensation-work-life-balance-among-top-drivers-of-associate-satisfaction/) on the results of NALP’s inaugural report, [“Should I Stay or Should I Go? Key Factors Driving Law Firm Associate Retention.”](https://www.nalpfoundation.org/stay-study) The two factors that associates rated as the [most important](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/why-do-associates-stay/) in keeping them at their current job were earning a high base salary and maintaining work-life balance. “Associates were not at all keen for firms to retrench on flexibility and remote work opportunities,” Hornblower said, citing that post-pandemic change as one of the top reasons associates said they would leave their firms.

# Biglaw Firms Abroad Encourage Employees To Work From Home As Coronavirus Outbreak Spreads
## Law firms are trying to protect their employees at all costs.

The main guideline is for people to stay at home if they want to, but if there are reasons they have to come in, they can. There is no news of firms shutting down yet, but it would be absolutely disproportionate to what is going on. If you go around in Milan today, it is not a dead city. Of course people are scared, but I think they’re more scared because of the press coverage.

— a partner at BonelliErede, an Italian Biglaw firm, commenting on what precautions members of the legal profession have been taking due to the [sudden coronavirus outbreak in Milan](https://www.law.com/2020/02/24/italian-law-firms-crack-down-on-staff-movement-amid-coronavirus-threat-292-62052/). A partner at Bird & Bird, a U.K. firm with offices in Rome and Milan, said that meetings at the Milan office are “highly discouraged” and “travels from and to our office in Milan are restricted.” The Hogan Lovells office in Milan is still open, but “people have the option to work remotely” during the health scare.

On the latest episode of The Jabot podcast I speak with [Dana Rosenfeld](https://www.kelleydrye.com/Our-People/Dana-B-Rosenfeld), incoming Managing Partner at Kelley Drye & Warren. We talk about her path to the top of the firm’s leadership, the surprising thing about the managing partner role, her advice for attorneys in the lateral market, and her priorities for her tenure in the firm’s leadership.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

# From Books To Bytes: A Legal Research Showdown In The Age Of AI
## Custom generative AI tools can enhance your legal research capabilities.

Once upon a time, in the thriving metropolis of Legalia, two skilled lawyers approached legal research differently. Max, the traditionalist, spent hours poring over statutes, regulations, case precedents, law review articles, and legal resources in online legal databases and at the library. Armed with a yellow pad, sticky notes, and a word-processing program, he meticulously analyzed each piece of information, slowly but steadily making connections and drawing conclusions. 

Levi used a generative AI tool developed explicitly for legal research. With just a few clicks and prompts, he accessed vast databases of legal texts, including cases, court opinions, laws, statutes, regulations, articles, and more. The AI tool quickly generated concise summaries tailored to his needs. 

When Levi and Max were assigned a complex intellectual property rights case, Max spent days sifting through legal volumes, cross-referencing cases, and manually extracting relevant details. Meanwhile, Levi entered the case’s details into the AI tool. He received a comprehensive overview of relevant laws, statutes, and recent court decisions in seconds. 

The AI tool searched a broader range of legal texts across more jurisdictions than Max could ever cover manually. It pinpointed specific passages in legal texts directly relevant to Levi’s queries, saving him from sifting through irrelevant information. It even highlighted potential arguments and counterarguments based on similar cases. 

Max struggled to keep up with new cases and regulations concerning fast-moving legal issues as the trial approached, while Levi’s AI tool continuously updated its database with new information. With proper citations and references included in AI-generated results, Levi could easily verify and incorporate his findings into his legal briefs.

Both lawyers presented compelling arguments at trial, but Levi emerged victorious. The custom generative AI tool had given Levi access to a wealth of information quickly and efficiently, saving him valuable hours and ensuring he accessed more of the most up-to-date legal information.

Conversational AI Speeds And Eases Legal Research

This tale illustrates how custom generative AI tools can enhance your legal research capabilities. Vendors typically build generative AI models for legal research using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. They train the AI on massive legal databases that include court decisions, case histories, statutes, and other legal texts. The AI models learn to understand legal language, the contexts surrounding legal issues, and the relationships among various legal concepts. 

When a user prompts an AI system with a legal question, AI offers concise and accurate answers. Prompting is done conversationally, in the form of questions and answers or directions and responses between the user and the tool. The conversational aspect offers a more intuitive experience than traditional keyword-based and boolean search interfaces. You get comprehensive and contextually relevant answers, saving time and improving efficiency. But as with any great invention, generative AI comes with challenges. 

- An AI model’s accuracy and reliability depend on the quality and relevance of its training data. Biases and inaccuracies in the training data can lead to erroneous research results. 
- Interpretability also remains a concern, as lawyers need to understand how the AI reached its conclusions to ensure the legal reasoning and principles apply in the context of the case at hand.  
- Data privacy and security are critical considerations while using AI tools to explore sensitive legal information.
- Lawyers must apply their domain-specific knowledge and expertise to appropriately interpret and apply AI’s findings.
But, no doubt, using generative AI can potentially revolutionize legal research. By dramatically improving your research efficiency, accuracy, and depth, AI empowers you to make more-informed decisions and represent clients more efficiently. Are you excited about the future of legal research? What challenges do you foresee with the use of AI in legal research? Have you used or will you use an AI-powered tool for your research?

In this episode, I interview Erin Gordon, author of “[Look What You Made Me Do](https://eringordonauthor.com/),” a memoir exposing a toxic culture in a prominent law firm. Erin shares her experience of continuous micro-harassments, personal defamation, and inadequate work allocation, leading to extreme stress and impeding her professional growth. Despite having a strong legal case against the firm, practical difficulties meant she had to endure the environment with minimal improvement.

Highlights

- Insights on the pressure to stay in Biglaw firms despite negative experiences
- The turning point when she consulted employment lawyers who advised her to leave the firm
- The long-term impact on her career, including self-esteem issues, lack of professional growth, and financial loss
- Erin’s realization that she wasn’t a bad lawyer, but rather a victim of a system that prioritizes loyalty over individual experiences

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# The Glass Ceiling Report: A 'Bleak' Picture For Women In The Legal Profession
## The future is female, and perhaps Biglaw would be best served with more women-led firms.

Despite the fact that in the new #MeToo era, women across the country are taking charge and leading movements for gender equality and equal pay, women continue to be underrepresented in private practice, especially when it comes to attaining leadership roles. In fact, in the last year at the average law firm, from associate to equity partner, women’s representation has increased by no more than a percentage point, a statistic that’s rather depressing.

There are now [more women in law school](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/there-are-now-more-women-in-law-school-than-ever-before/) than ever before, but men still lead the pack when it comes to private practice, making up about two-thirds of attorneys in this sector of the legal profession with gender-discrimination suits being filed by women at breakneck speeds. What’s more (but really, less) is that within those private practice firms, only 21 percent of equity partners are women, with women making up just 12 percent of those in firms’ highest firm leadership roles.

How can progress for women in the law be made when the odds seem to be against them in private practice? Some law firms are leading the way, and thanks to Law360’s annual Glass Ceiling Report, we now know which ones are the best for women.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Law360 surveyed more than 300 U.S. firms, or vereins with a U.S. component, about the demographics of their lawyer workforce as of December 31, 2017. Firms were then grouped into tiers based on U.S. attorney headcount, and ranked by the percentage of female nonpartners and female partners at the firm. Women make up at least 50 percent of the total attorney workforce at each top-ranked firm in every tier.

In the biggest of Biglaw category, those with 600+ attorneys, the top 5 firms are:

1. Littler
2. Ogletree Deakins
3. Jackson Lewis
4. WilmerHale
5. Baker McKenzie

For Biglaw firms with slightly smaller headcount, 300-599 attorneys, the top 5 are:

You can [check out Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1045618/the-best-law-firms-for-female-attorneys) (sub. req.) for rankings of smaller law firms.

How can women in private practice ensure they’ll have a say when it comes to the direction of their firms? According to Law360’s data, having a woman in charge will be of great service to them, now and further down the line in the future:

Having a female leader sets an example for younger associates that they have a future and a path at the firm. In fact, the Glass Ceiling Report found that the 43 firms with women in a leadership role averaged a better representation of female attorneys across the firm.

In fact, the average representation of female attorneys at firms with a woman in a leadership role was 3 percentage points higher than the average of all firms surveyed, and the representation of female equity partners at women­led firms was 5 percentage points higher than the overall average — accomplishments worth celebrating.

## The firm denies the allegations.

Back in April of 2019, the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) director Craig Leen[ told legal industry representatives](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/trump-administration-warns-biglaw-to-improve-diversity/) his office was concerned about issues of diversity and representation at law firms, and [they’ve been busy](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/sidley-settles-federal-probe-over-diversity-of-its-summer-associate-program/) holding Biglaw’s feet to the fire.

Earlier this month, OFCCP announced a settlement worth $150,000 with the Biglaw firm of Locke Lord. As[ reported by Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1316108), this resolves allegations that female associates in a Rhode Island office received smaller bonuses than their male counterparts over a two-year period (2012-14). During the time of the alleged violation, the office was operated as Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP, prior to Locke Lord’s acquisition of that firm in January 2015.

OFCCP notified Locke Lord of evidence of pay discrimination involving 22 female associates in October of 2018:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“OFCCP’s analysis demonstrates that a statistically significant disparity in bonus compensation remained even when legitimate factors affecting bonuses were taken into account,” the agreement reads.

The settlement, which also stipulates the firm will not retaliate against associates receiving money from the agreement, has been lauded as “an outstanding example for the legal industry to follow,” by Diana Sen, northeast regional director of OFCCP. And Leen had this to say about the agreement:

“Locke Lord is working with us to ensure pay equity for its female associates,” Craig Leen, director of the DOL office, said in a statement Thursday. “Together, we will ensure that the company’s employment practices comply with equal employment opportunity requirements.”

Though the firm denies the allegations, their statement on the settlement affirms Locke Lord’s commitment to diversity:

“Diversity and inclusion are integral parts of Locke Lord’s strategic plan for success and one of our core values,” according to the firm’s statement. “The firm is committed to ensuring that all of our attorneys and staff are afforded equal employment opportunities.”

Regardless of the specifics in this case, it’s good to see the issue of equal pay getting attention.

# It’s Never Dull In California
## A question we'll never tire of asking: 'What were they thinking?'

The days of “party hearty” for California judges may be coming to an end. Given the post-Tom Girardi climate here, [perks enjoyed by certain judicial officers](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/legal-ethics/california-ethics-group-tells-judges-not-to-party-with-lawyers?context=search&index=0) who were recipients of his largesse may now be a thing of the past.

No surprise here. My question is why it took so long. For years, there have been stories about judges being feted, comped by lawyers. Girardi was the most egregious example, but I would hazard an educated guess that there have been others. Those good times may well be a thing of the past.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

The California Supreme Court’s Committee on Judicial Ethics Opinions is [circulating a draft opinion](https://www.judicialethicsopinions.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/Invitation-to-Comment-on-CJEO-Draft-Formal-Opinion-2023-024.pdf) that should provide guidance on whether a judicial officer could or should attend a particular function. Specifically, the committee frames the question as “whether a judicial officer may accept an invitation from a law firm to attend its 50th anniversary celebration, which will take place at the law firm’s office and include complimentary food and beverage.”

Many judicial officers over the years were guests at lavish functions both here in SoCal and elsewhere, events hosted by Girardi and his firm. Now it may be that judicial officers should decline those invitations. No way that solos or small firms could compete with such events. Judicial officers who attended Girardi functions apparently did not hesitate to do so. Hopefully, such hospitality did not influence any judicial decisions.

The answer in the commission’s draft opinion is succinct: Don’t attend such an event if you want to keep your judicial robes on. In other words, just say, “No.” And if being polite is important, then just say, “No, thank you.”

The draft advises that a judicial officer may not accept an invitation to a law firm’s 50th anniversary celebration as it could likely violate several canons of the Code of Judicial Ethics. How many canons may be violated in this situation? The draft counts the ways.

Why say no? How about the following: the suggestion that the judicial officer may have a special relationship with the law firm (coziness perhaps?), the impression that the firm could influence the judicial officer’s neutrality, the impression that the attendance of the judicial officer lends to the firm’s prestige (trophy judge?), and last, but not least, the acceptance of complimentary food and drink as inappropriate gifts.

One exception is that “it may be appropriate for a judicial officer to attend the celebration of a law firm with which the judicial officer has a pre-existing relationship warranting disqualification, provided the judicial officer’s attendance is otherwise consistent with the canons.”

Another exception is footnoted: distinguishing attendance at a law firm celebration from attending a bar association or legal education event sponsored by a law firm. The draft opinion states that such activities do not generally undermine judicial neutrality. Why? “[E]ven when underwritten by law firms, judges are expected to maintain relationships with the bar and such events do not cast doubt on impartiality.” There’s nothing wrong with an exception for gifts incident to bar related functions and “activities devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system or the administrations of justice.” The test, the draft opinion says, is whether “the event appears to promote a particular law firm or is geared to the improvement of the law and legal system in general.” Events at law firms that host law student mixers and events to improve diversity in the profession should pass muster.

Speaking about judicial ethics, have you ever heard of a sitting judge (Judge A) moving to disqualify another sitting judge (Judge B) because Judge B has a pending motion where Judge A was the prosecutor in that case? Is this something that could only happen in Los Angeles County?

In an [article in the Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-31/how-a-convicted-murderers-bid-for-freedom-sparked-a-fight-between-two-l-a-county-judges), Patrick Connolly (Judge A) asserts that Daniel Lowenthal (Judge B) is “biased again law enforcement” and claims that Lowenthal’s rulings could hurt Connolly’s stature as a judge. Wait, what? If Connolly’s argument is taken to a logical or illogical extreme, would that mean that every single time an appellate court tells a trial court that they got it wrong and reverses the trial court ruling, that the appellate court is “biased” against the trial court and that the trial court has lost “stature?”

Do you think that Judge A has ever heard of the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)? Maybe he needs to read about it.

And I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the [crashing and burning of the two name partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/barber-ranen-resign-racist-sexist-antisemitic-emails/) who boogied out of the Los Angeles Lewis Brisbois office taking a bunch of lawyers with them, only to find themselves booted out of their new firm and with good reason. Staci Zaretsky explains it all.

Will I ever tire of asking, “What were they thinking?” Nope, especially not in the case where these two purportedly smart lawyers availed themselves of the firm’s email system for their disgusting, hateful comments that were racist, sexist, and antisemitic, to name just a few descriptors. I hope that State of California Chief Trial Counsel George Cardona files disciplinary charges against both of them. I could ask why the Lewis firm waited so long to share them. I also could ask why no one in the firm’s IT department surfaced these emails long ago.

No amount of mea culpas or explanations will suffice, nor should they. Are they truly sorry and remorseful or is it just that they got caught? Perfect examples of apologies that are TLTL.

# Former Biglaw Partner Gets 3-Year Suspension For Double-Billing Scam
## There's also the matter of the faked invoices.

Approximately one million years ago — that is, January 2020 — [we first told you about](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/biglaw-partner-allegedly-fired-for-faking-invoices-to-pay-golf-fees/) the hot water former Vedder Price partner Robert Hankes was in, seeing as he was facing a disciplinary complaint by the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission.

Hankes, a one-time member of Vedder Price’s transportation finance team, faked invoices for more than $100,000 in fraudulent payments to client. Hankes was allegedly terminated by Vedder Price on Oct. 2, 2019 over the scheme, which had begun in January of 2018. Hankes was home grown at Vedder Price, he began working there in 2005 as a summer associate, and was made partner in 2014. Before joining the firm, Hankes, also a CPA, was auditor at Arthur Andersen and a financial analyst with Winston & Strawn.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now [according to a January 20th](https://ilcourtsaudio.blob.core.windows.net/antilles-resources/resources/58e641c6-8bd2-4be7-a03e-61989a97cc3d/Miscellaneous%20Record%20-%2001-20-22.pdf) order, Hankes won’t be a lawyer — at least for the next three years. The Illinois Supreme Court has suspended him, what with the double-billing and faked expense reports.

ABA Journal [reported on](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-vedder-price-partner-gets-3-year-suspension-for-double-billing-false-expense-requests) the scheme:

The double billing stemmed from Hankes’ representation of a financial institution in financing and leasing matters involving other companies. The financial institution’s agreements with the customer companies allowed them to be billed directly for legal services in certain circumstances.

Hankes billed the financial institution and its customers for the same legal work, wrongly collecting nearly $109,000 that he applied to the reactivated account, the review board said. He also billed another client nearly $7,500 using a false invoice, according to the review board.

But those weren’t the only issues. According to the review board, Hankes also sought reimbursement from the firm for expenses unrelated to the firm, such as $2,100 for nonexistent a “client event” and “race day,” ~$2,600 for a crossbow, purportedly for a gift, and ~$17,000 for first-class plane tickets he never used (the flight credit went instead to his personal credit card). The review board say Hankes banked almost $80,000 this way.

In deciding his fate, there were mitigating factors:

Hankes made restitution on the eve of his disciplinary hearing, the review board said. Other mitigating factors were that Hankes admitted his wrongdoing when confronted by Vedder Price’s general counsel, self-reported his conduct to ethics authorities, and was forthright during the ethics hearing. He also had no prior discipline and a history of significant pro bono legal work.

In 2020, Vedder Price said the money scammed from clients was returned.

# Top Biglaw Firm Sets Its Sights On A September 2021 Office Reopening
## Are you ready to return to work this fall?

Many Biglaw firms have remained mum on both their plans for COVID-19 vaccination and their eventual return to the office, but now one of the most successful firms in the country has announced a target date for their reopening, and it’s possible that other firms will follow in their footsteps.

Late last week, Ropes & Gray — a firm that brought in $1,903,616,000 gross revenue in 2019, putting it in 13th place in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings — issued a memo to attorneys and staff letting them know that permissive office usage will continue until Labor Day. Thereafter, “look[ing] ahead with great optimism as COVID-19 vaccines become more readily available,” it’s likely that everyone will be back to the office for business as usual.

Here’s an excerpt from chair Julie Jones’s memo (available in full on the next page):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We hope that sharing a more certain long-term plan now helps you address some of the logistic stress you and your families may experience as the seasons change and lead to new living, childcare and family obligations.

Even in advance of September 6th, as more members of the Ropes community are vaccinated and safety conditions improve, we hope you will find safe and creative ways to be together in person.   For example, we anticipate that many more of you will begin returning to our offices voluntarily well in advance of September 6th.   We think that you will find that being in the office will be a welcome change; it has been an energizing experience for many of us.

Ropes is being respectful of its employees’ unique homelives and will provide “at least 45 days’ notice before moving from permissive usage to a broader office return.” A source from the firm had this to say about the new return-to-work plans:

I appreciate that the firm is being flexible and understanding with people returning, especially with summer coming. It shows they’re understanding of the situation and that it will take time for everyone to adapt to going back to a workplace setting.

Jones made no mention of Ropes & Gray’s plans for employee vaccination, if any.

Are you ready to return to work this fall? We certainly hope so, because now that a firm like Ropes & Gray has made its intentions known, it looks like that may be what other firms are expecting of their attorneys in just a few months. As with all things having to do with COVID-19, these plans are likely subject to change, but be sure to prepare yourselves for office life once again — just in case.

# Biglaw Firm Sues Landlord To Recover $30M In COVID Rent
## The firm really wants its money back.

Thanks to the pandemic, many Biglaw firms voluntarily closed down their offices, encouraging their attorneys and staff members to work remotely to help stop the spread of COVID-19. But in some areas of the country, Biglaw firms were essentially forced out of their offices entirely due to local occupancy orders and restrictions.

One of those firms was Crowell & Moring. The firm says that it was put out of its Washington, D.C., office for more than a year thanks to the pandemic, and now is attempting to recover $30 million in rent it claims it was not required to pay during the height of the coronavirus crisis. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/law-firm-crowell-sues-recoup-30-mln-covid-era-rent-2023-03-27/) has the details:

Washington-based Crowell said in its complaint this month in District of Columbia Superior Court that [its lease](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/jnvwyjrgovw/crowell-lease-dc.pdf) gave the firm a right to abate rent after a “material interference” inhibited using its 391,757 square-feet of office space near the White House.

Local orders restricted Crowell’s office access from March 2020 through May 2021, which ran contrary to its lease agreement on use of the space, the firm said.

Crowell said it paid TREA Trust more than $30 million in rent between April 2020 and May 2021 but is entitled to a 98% abatement because office access “was reduced to less than 2% of the normal use and access” under the lease.

Crowell has remained in its D.C. location for 30 years, but with such a great monetary loss, a spokesperson said the firm was “left with no choice” but to sue. TREA Trust says it will “vigorously defend against this meritless action.”

This is neither the first time a Biglaw firm has sued to recover funds related to COVID-19 rent, nor is it Crowell’s first time at this rodeo. The firm sued its landlord in San Francisco in 2020, and that case was dismissed last spring. Jenner & Block settled a claim with its landlord back in 2021, while Schulte Roth & Zabel will be going to trial on a $10 million rent abatement claim this year.

Best of luck to the firm as it tries to recover on its multimillion-dollar claim.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Rewards Its Hardest Workers With Special Bonus Money
## We love to see it. Congrats!

Ever since Biglaw bonus season started — and now that even more money is headed associates’ way thanks to the [latest salary wars](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) — we’ve been thinking of law firm support staff and wondering what their fate may be as money continues to rain down upon associates.

Thanks to the coronavirus crisis, the past few years have been incredibly difficult for everyone. It remains important to remember that Biglaw is not made of attorneys alone. It takes an army for law firms this large to run, and the behind-the-scenes battalions of staff members deserve their due, too. That said, many firms have gone out of their way to show their support staff that they truly matter — with cold, hard cash, of course.

The latest firm to say thank you to staff is Sheppard Mullin.

Late last week, Sheppard Mullin staff members were notified that they, too, would be receiving regular bonuses and special bonuses. Here’s an excerpt from a memo sent by chief operating officer Ted Tinson:

Our Firm has always shared success with our staff – indeed it takes our whole village to support 1.5 mm billable hours on 34,000 legal matters. To recognize the staff contribution to our 2021 effort, the Executive Committee has approved our Profit Sharing Bonus payment at the maximum 200% (two weeks’ pay). An additional Staff Special Bonus of another 1⁄2 week’s pay was also approved. So each staff member should be receiving in today’s paycheck an amount equal to 2.5 weeks’ pay (prorated for a partial year for newer folks).

Thanks everyone for a wonderful effort in 2021! Let’s look forward to working together in a strong 2022…

Congratulations to everyone at Sheppard Mullin!

How has your firm rewarded staff during these unprecedented times?

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Sheppard Mullin.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

UPDATE: To clarify, the law school didn’t make this call, but Harvard College. The thrust of the article remains the same, but it’s been updated to reflect this.

After sparking a protest over his decision to represent Harvey Weinstein, Harvard Law School [Professor Ron Sullivan is now out as faculty dean](https://abcnews.go.com/US/harvey-weinsteins-lawyer-loses-position-harvard-bowing-case/story?id=62985775). Professor Sullivan had already bowed out of the Weinstein case over the uproar, but that wasn’t enough for the school to keep Sullivan in his position as public representative of the school administration.

As one might suspect, this move has kicked up outrage among the right-wing “televisentia,” like fellow Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, who felt the need to complain about [the “New McCarthyism” of not standing up for sexual predators](https://www.foxnews.com/us/alan-dershowitz-harvard-harvey-weinstein-lawyer-dean-new-mccarthyism) despite [also having sex scandal accusations hovering over him](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/dershowitz-wanted-a-trial-over-sex-trafficking-accusations-hes-getting-one/).

Right about now, making Jeffrey Epstein connections isn’t really the help Sullivan needs.

However, Harvard made the right move, and no amount of sanctimonious hand wringing about everyone’s right to zealous representation changes that. Harvey Weinstein absolutely has a right to hire a lawyer and there’s no reason to fault an attorney for taking on that representation per se.

Weinstein’s press flack jumped head first into this faux idealistic claptrap:

“Mr. Sullivan believed that Mr. Weinstein deserved a vigorous defense, and it is a sad moment for us all right now,” Engelmayer said. “We, as a country, have now reached the point when a Harvard lawyer and professor cannot serve his duty to, and belief in, the law and defend a person who may be deemed unpopular or unworthy of a legal defense by segments of the public.”

But there’s more to a decision to represent someone than holding a law license and a willingness to work. For Sullivan — and by extension Harvard — this case more closely resembled the brief, ill-fated Lisa Bloom engagement. Bloom, the noted feminist attorney, took on Weinstein as a client in the early days of the scandal that now has him facing serious jail time. When she pulled out [after being scolded by her mom](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/mother-knows-best-gloria-allred-disses-daughters-decision-to-rep-harvey-weinstein/), I wrote:

But while that moral high horse is saddled perfectly for the attorney as lawyer, it doesn’t always suit the attorney as businessperson. Building a practice is all about finding that niche, and Lisa Bloom’s success is built on her reputation as an advocate for victims of sexual misconduct. Her clients seek her out, not just for her experience in this field, but because victims who already face an uphill battle with trust can feel confident that they have someone firmly in their corner. In fact, that’s why a mother with a practice focused on showing that consistency releases a statement like this about their daughter.

There are potential impacts to an attorney’s long-term business in every engagement. For a lawyer positioning themselves as a committed, dispassionate criminal defense attorney, unsavory clients don’t matter. For a feminist attorney, representing accused rapists undermines the core credibility of her mission.

Sullivan had “Harvard dean” attached to his name and bringing Harvard into this case put Harvard’s professional reputation on the line. Putting aside the long shadow of Jeffrey Epstein, and the school’s persistent sexual violence problems. An administration figure trying to get a wealthy and famous man out of sexual violence allegations while serving in an administration that faces serious pressure to prove that it cares enough about the problem on its campus to take serious action undermines the school and the school is right — for its own reputation — to distance itself.

This isn’t a blow to the rights of the accused unless you think so little of the legal profession that every lawyer must be a mercenary in a world with no memories. If Ron Sullivan were in private practice there would be no quibble over his involvement. But he was a public face for an institution whose professional reputation relies on serving, first and foremost, its students. Having someone those students might approach to address an episode of sexual violence publicly arguing that women aren’t to be believed undermines his obligation to the school.

Instead of embracing some half-cocked jeremiad about political correctness run amok, consider this as an internal conflict check. Sullivan chose to associate himself with a firm in the form of Harvard Law, and this case would put him in conflict with the interests of the firm’s biggest clients.

No one rails against the decline and fall of the justice system when personal injury firms don’t take on insurance defense cases.

She got a Biglaw job!

Rankings season is upon us, and many publications are rolling out their best offerings for readers’ perusal, in advance of the release of the 2019 U.S. News & World Report Law School Rankings and the latest edition of the Above the Law Top 50 Law School Rankings.

For more than a decade, Law.com has published a list of the best law schools to go to if you want to work in Biglaw after graduation. Law.com refers to these institutions of higher education as the “go-to law schools,” and this year, they’re ranked by the percentage of 2017 graduates who took associate positions at the 100 largest law firms based on lawyer headcount.

Before we get to the list of the go-to law schools, it’s worthwhile to speak about the landscape for entry-level employment in the legal profession. While offer rates were sky-high this summer, hiring percentages from America’s top law schools are still dramatically different than they were during Biglaw’s heyday. But things continue to improve from the doldrums of the recession. [Law.com](https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2018/03/08/the-2018-go-to-law-schools/?et=&bu=&cn=&src=&pt=) has more info:

New associate hiring held strong in 2017, with the country’s largest 100 law firms bringing on 4,199 recent law graduates. Among the 50 schools most popular with those firms, 29 percent of last year’s graduates landed associate jobs, up slightly from the previous year.

That said, things are looking up for the Go-To Law Schools. Here are the Top 10:

- Columbia Law: 68 percent
- U. Chicago Law: 60 percent
- NYU Law: 57 percent
- UVA Law: 56 percent
- Penn Law: 52 percent
- Northwestern Law: 52 percent
- Duke Law: 51 percent
- Harvard Law: 50 percent
- Cornell Law: 48 percent
- Berkeley Law: 46 percent

With more than 50 percent of its graduates heading to Biglaw firms after graduation, Columbia has ruled this ranking for the past five years. While U. Chicago was able to hold on to its second-place finish, there was otherwise a great deal of movement in the rankings. NYU is up three places to No. 3, UVA is up three places to No. 4, and Penn is up three places to No. 5. Of note is the fact that Cornell sank from No. 4 to No. 9, and Berkeley switched places with Stanford, sending the higher-ranked T14 school packing. (It’s worth mentioning the fact that clerkship placements aren’t considered in this ranking, which is likely the reason why Yale barely made it into the Top 20 on this list, and why Stanford was booted from the Top 10.)

Law.com also has a list of “Firm Favorites,” noting the law schools that specific firms recruited most heavily from. Here are some highlights from that list:

Latham: Georgetown (20 students)
Skadden: Harvard (20 students)
Cleary: Columbia (19 students)
Sidley: U. Chicago (18 students)
K&E: Northwestern (17 students)
Ropes & Gray: BU (17 students)

Things still aren’t where they used to be, but they’re getting better each year. More notable than these numbers are the tuition figures appended to this year’s rankings. While the total costs aren’t wildly different, the employment percentages are. Why pay $58,000 to go to a school that sends 26 percent of its graduates to Biglaw when you can pay the same amount to a school that sends 56 percent of its graduates to Biglaw?

Either way you slice it, this list is incredibly useful. It’s a great way for law students, both current and prospective, to gauge their employment prospects in a still-recovering market. Use these rankings wisely — or ignore them, at your peril.

We have some incredibly unfortunate news to report out of California, where one of the founding partners of Am Law 200 firm Munger Tolles & Olson recently passed away. [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger), 99, founded the firm in 1962 and worked there for a number of years before leaving the practice of law to enter the world of business and finance. While Munger served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway as Warren Buffett’s right-hand man, he was able to watch his firm grow into one of the best in America.

Munger, a graduate of Harvard Law, went on to become a business titan who “laid the foundation for the firm’s success today,” according to a statement from Munger Tolles. The firm started with seven attorneys, and has since grown to about 200 attorneys across three offices, and is considered one of the highest grossing law firm in the world, bringing in $317,381,000 gross revenue in 2022.

Here’s what name partner [Ron Olson](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/Ronald-L-Olson/) had to say of Munger in the firm’s [memoriam](https://www.mto.com/news/headlines/2023/in-memoriam-charlie-munger-1924-2023/):

“Today, the world has lost a giant, and our firm has lost one of its founders, a man whose name we proudly bear. While Charlie’s vision, philanthropy, and ability to tell it like it is are known to all, he was to us a dear and generous friend. He will be missed, but his values will live on, and that is great comfort at this time.”

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Charlie Munger’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

# Yes, Biglaw Firms Will Absolutely Take Your Money If You Don't Put Your Timesheets In
## No time entry? No money (or at least less money).

Biglaw firms are serious as a goddamn heart attack about timesheets. It is, after all, how they collect money from clients. But damn, after a long day of actually *doing* the work of lawyering it can be a pain in the ass to actually write down all the lawyering you did. So, you procrastinate to the next day, but days of not doing timesheets can so easily slip into weeks. And this is why more and more firms have implemented policies that financially disincentivize late time entires.

It was [back in 2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/02/associate-bonus-watch-dechert-docks-associates-for-dilatory-billables/) that Above the Law first noted the trend — have too many late time entries and you’ll see your bonus slashed. [Other firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/12/hughes-hubbard-is-the-latest-firm-to-crack-the-time-keeping-whip/) were quick to hop on the trend, with some taking a bite not just [out of bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/11/you-want-your-bonus-we-want-your-time-sheets/),[ but of salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/11/simpson-thacher-threatens-to-withhold-salary-for-delinquent-time-keepers/).

But these policies are not relics of the past — not at all. As TikTok user [@legallypriscilla](https://www.tiktok.com/@legallypriscilla?lang=en) learned, firms are still very serious about you getting your timesheets in. After receiving warnings, she reports her paycheck was docked 20 percent.

It’s a super harsh way for a Biglaw firm to make their point — especially when associates tend to be the most delinquent with timesheets when they’re busy billing hours.

# Another Firm Stiffs First-Year Associates On Bonuses
## Everyone but first-years are happy with the bonuses...

On Friday Morgan Lewis left fun little voicemails for associates detailing their 2017 bonuses. Well, the voicemail was fun as long as you aren’t a first-year associate. First-years get a big fat goose egg from the firm this year, but 2016 (and earlier) grads will get the expected market rates, set by Cravath two weeks ago.

Sure, the class of 2017 hasn’t been working at the firm all that long, but that doesn’t mean they haven’t been working hard. And while no one is suggesting they get the full dollar amount for a first-year, a pro-rated bonus is appropriate. The firm collects money on (some of) the hours they’re billing after all. Plus the end of the year is when you traditionally recognize good employees, and it just makes sense to give a little something to new employees who meet expectations (not to mention they’ve likely mentally considered themselves employees of the firm since the start of their 2L year over two years ago). Maybe the firm saves a few thousand dollars per associate, but isn’t their appreciation and loyalty (not to mention avoiding the bad publicity) worth that much?

UPDATE: More tipsters reached out with clarifications about first-year bonuses. According to them it is the firm’s calculation of the fiscal year that screws over the new associates. Still sucks when you look around and all your colleagues got a nice, fate bonus and you’ve got coal in your stocking (not to mention the twinge of regret when you see classmates that chose other firms receive a pro-rated bonus):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Morgan Lewis operates on a fiscal year ending September 30 and its bonuses are based on calculation of hours and other factors from September to September.  First years did not start until October and are therefore not bonus eligible.

Here are the the bonuses Morgan Lewis is giving out, as per tipsters:

2017: $0 (they don’t give pro-rated bonuses)
2016: $15,000
2015: $25,000
2014: $50,000
2013: $65,000
2012: $80,000
2011: $90,000
2010 and earlier: $100,000

In order to receive the bonus, associates must have a satisfactory year-end performance review with a 1900 billable hours requirement. A wrinkle to the hours requirement is the firm has a “pro bono challenge” which stipulates at least 20 of the counted hours must be pro bono.

The firm also provides additional discretionary bonuses for the best associates, though as one tipster noted, “nobody knows how or why those are decided.”

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Do you like to be in the know? Do you love gossiping with friends and co-workers over the latest bonus news? Then you simply must sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts. It’s easy, just scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Another Am Law 100 Firm Turns To Furloughs And Salary Cuts Amid COVID-19 Crisis

It’s a crazy time in Biglaw. The global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has led to the shutdown of many industries and the economy is reeling. Biglaw has been far from unscathed — there’ve [been layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/) and [furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/). Other firms have opted for salary cuts ([10 percent pay reductions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [25 percent pay cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/), and partners who’ve [slowed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-back-partner-compensation-amid-covid-19-economic-upheaval/) or [eliminated](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/) their payday) and [benefits have taken a hit](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-retirement-matching-in-effort-to-avoid-layoffs/). Now another firm is making big moves for the “financial stability” of the firm.

Am Law 100 firm Baker Donelson is taking a number of steps to reduce the financial burden of COVID-19. Partner salaries have already been slashed. But that isn’t the end of the salary reductions. In the coming weeks, the entire firm will take a pay cut — that is, if they still have jobs. That’s right, the firm is also furloughing employees (exact numbers remain unclear). Though the firm would like to bring the newly unemployed folks back “once this crisis subsides,” there is not currently a defined timeline or date for that.

A Baker Donelson spokesperson provided the following statement:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In the wake of the unprecedented and far-reaching impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Baker Donelson has unfortunately been faced with some very difficult decisions. We have undertaken a number of measures to ensure the financial stability of the Firm moving forward, which includes shareholder reduction in draws and salary that have already been implemented. This will be followed over the next few weeks by temporary salary reductions across the Firm and with a furloughing of some employees. We are focused on doing all we can for all of our employees, while also ensuring uninterrupted service to our clients and meeting our temporary operating needs throughout this global crisis and beyond. Our hope is that, once this crisis subsides, we will eventually be able to bring the furloughed team members back to Baker Donelson. Until then, we are providing them with support to help minimize the impact of what we know is an extremely trying situation, particularly in these highly uncertain times.

Good luck to all those bearing the brunt of the economic downturn.

# Major Biglaw Firm Suffers Cyber Security Breach Of Mergers & Acquisitions Data

Biglaw firm Proskauer Rose recently suffered a major cyber security event, when client data was left unsecured for six months. The firm confirmed the incident, saying, they “recently become aware of a cyberattack against the cloud storage used by the firm.”

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1594867) Law360,

The firm claimed that an unnamed outside vendor retained by Proskauer had not properly secured an information portal, exposing data stored on a third-party cloud platform.

“Our IT security team immediately took steps to reconfigure the site and secure its data,” the spokesperson said Friday. “This is an ongoing investigation, and we have been urgently working with in-house and third-party cybersecurity experts to confirm our current understanding of the facts.”

The firm added that it would “communicate promptly” with any affected parties as “we gain sufficient information to responsibly do so.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So what kinds of data are we talking about? TechCrunch [has the deets:](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/proskauer-confidential-client-data/)

A person with knowledge of the incident told TechCrunch that data from Proskauer’s merger and acquisitions business was left on an unsecured Microsoft Azure cloud server.

TechCrunch obtained a portion of the exposed dataset, which included approximately 184,000 files total, the person told us. These files were accessible from the web browser by anyone who knew where to look, and contained private and privileged financial and legal documents, contracts, non-disclosure agreements, financial deals and files relating to high-profile acquisitions.

Yikes.

According to reports, the issue has since been resolved. The firm’s statement on the matter continues, “We take the protection of our data incredibly seriously and take aggressive steps to monitor and protect against any unauthorized access or use of that data.” “We conduct regular security reviews, including penetration testing performed by expert third parties, and continually monitor our data environments, including the environment targeted by the attack, to ensure our data is secure.”

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Will Biglaw Firms Make 'Deeper Cuts' Or Offer Smaller Payouts For Partners?
## Take a wild guess while you brush up your resume....

Those law firms that are able to retain and develop their talent, rather than jettison them, could come out of a short period of economic uncertainty stronger than their rivals. This, however, assumes that any further economic turmoil is relatively light and bearable. If it is not, these same firms will find themselves making deeper cuts than they may have originally.

— An excerpt from the recently published [Law Firm Financial Index report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/lffi-q3-2022-tough-decisions-ahead/) by Thomson Reuters, focusing on the [“inflection point”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/07/for-law-firms-across-the-board-declines-mean-an-inflection-point/) at which law firms now find themselves due to the economic downturn. Just about every practice area has seen a decline in demand, and faced with equity partners receiving smaller financial payouts, firms will have to grapple with the prospect of layoffs and targeted separations. Stealth layoffs have [already](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/) [occurred](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-junior-associates-top-20-biglaw-firm-cooley/) at several large law firms.

Patricia Anne Bronson via The Pinellas County Jail

Florida attorney Patricia Anne Bronson was arrested over the weekend after leaving two young girls — ages 7 and 3 — alone at a beach for at least a half hour. Bronson was charged with two counts of third-degree felony neglect of a child without great bodily harm. She was also charged with a third-degree felony charge of introducing/possessing contraband in a county detention facility after a vape pen was found on her during booking.

As [reported by](https://www.tampabay.com/news/breaking-news/2023/10/11/tampa-lawyer-faces-child-neglect-charges-after-kids-left-pinellas-beach-cops-say/) the Tampa Bay Times, witnesses reported the children were alone for between 30 and 45 minutes.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
On Saturday morning, witnesses watched Bronson drop the girls off at Upham Beach, then get back in her car and leave, an arrest report states. The arrest report described Bronson as a “caregiver” to the girls.

One witness told deputies that she asked the 7-year-old where her sister was and the girl responded by pointing to the water. The witness ran to the water and found the 3-year-old in “waist deep” water by herself, reports state. The girl continued to run off, the witness told deputies. The witness later persuaded the 3-year-old to stay with her and the 7-year-old.

Bronson admitted to officers she left the kids alone while “parking the car.”

As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer-said-to-have-biglaw-connection-is-arrested-after-young-children-are-found-alone-at-beach) ABA Journal, Bronson was previously suspended by the Florida Bar:

Bronson was suspended for 90 days in 2017 after she conditionally admitted to working with a nonlawyer paralegal who gave others the impression that he was an attorney. Bronson said she didn’t know that the paralegal was soliciting clients, accepting client funds and trying to negotiate resolutions with prosecutors.

I tell a lot of stories everywhere I go and especially on LinkedIn. One of my recent posts explained that if you and I ever have a meal, I will likely follow you wherever you want to go. Unless we are in Manhattan, where I’ll say, “Let’s go to Tony’s.” 

The post then explains what makes Tony’s so special to me. It’s a story about making decisions, large and small, and how your personal and professional lives intertwine to shape who you become. 

Public storytelling is how professionals network in today’s interconnected world, especially as the boundaries between our personal and professional lives continue to blur. An interesting human being exists behind every professional bio and social media profile. A person with a history of experiences and passions — someone likely to share a story or idea if asked.

That someone is YOU! But why wait for others to ask you to tell your story? Why not just start? You must put yourself out there to be found. 

Networking has gone from mingling in crowds at industry events to purposefully expanding your presence in your field to drive your career forward. Effective networking today requires us to tell our stories in various forums, from social media to speaking engagements to blogs and beyond. 

Embrace Social Media To Build A Robust Network Via Storytelling

With so much of our lives online today, embracing social media can help you build a robust network of colleagues and friends.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Don’t try to build a large presence on every platform immediately. Start in a forum where your clients, friends, and supportive colleagues are. For lawyers, that’s often LinkedIn, though many lawyers feel more natural on Twitter or Instagram. Others feel they belong on Reddit or Medium. Some blockchain and Web3 enthusiasts flock to Discord and Telegram. 

Start where you are genuinely interested in the shared experience. This is how you wind up in the right place at the right time to build authentic relationships and find the right collaborators. 

You can always expand into other areas when you’re ready. (Or, be daring and push yourself out of your comfort zone before you think you’re ready!)

5 Tips For Sharing Engaging Stories

Whether online or in person, sharing personal anecdotes that show your humanity is much more engaging than reciting dry facts and figures and listing accomplishments. You genuinely connect with others when you share stories demonstrating your values, beliefs, and experiences.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Start with a compelling hook such as an intriguing quote, bizarre juxtaposition, or unusual fact. Evoking curiosity is a great way to keep people’s attention. (I purposefully didn’t share why I love Tony’s so much above. I wanted to ratchet up your curiosity. You can [find out here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/olgamack_law-generalcounsel-lawstudents-activity-7023673270725939200-toC4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).)
- Use as few words as possible. Relentlessly cut tangents and excess details as appropriate for the forum (e.g., in-person presentations are often longer than a LinkedIn post, which is longer than a tweet). 
- The heart of each story should be a lesson relevant to your audience. Share one, three, or five relevant life or work lessons, depending on the forum. As interesting as someone’s breakfast foods may be to them, most of us don’t want to hear about them unless it leads to an eye-opening or life-confirming insight. 
- Be humble. Don’t brag or try to make yourself look superhuman (i.e., avoid appearing on [this Twitter account](https://twitter.com/StateOfLinkedIn)). True humility comes across as authentic and trustworthy. Stories about overcoming challenges are especially effective. Stories about growing from failure are even more powerful.
- Encourage engagement. One of my favorite ways to end a story is with a question about the reader’s perspective or experience. You can direct readers to another story or ask them to contact or follow you.

There’s no question that technology has changed the way we practice law. Smarter legal software has ushered in a new era of legal practice. This change was already well underway as we entered 2020 — the unprecedented demands of the pandemic only accelerated it.

Today, legal organizations are relying on technology more than ever. Technology providers like LexisNexis, in turn, are focusing on smarter legal software solutions to help support these shifting behaviors and allow the legal industry to thrive in the face of uncertainty.

##Rapid Change to Meet New Demands
If 2020 has shown us anything in the legal technology sphere, it’s that we’ve fast forwarded the adoption of tools that allow for remote work and collaboration far faster than most would have thought possible. Even law firms and corporate legal departments who just eight months ago were not even considering remote functionality have implemented a whole host of new solutions with incredible speed.

The result of all of this is change that’s happening right before our eyes. Smarter legal technology opens up a tremendous number of opportunities for legal organizations going forward. Better collaboration is just the beginning. 

Leading organizations right now are looking for applications that are designed for the new normal, not the old normal. That’s why legal software providers like LexisNexis are designing around the need for maximum flexibility. For Lexis+, the comprehensive new solution from LexisNexis, that means an increased emphasis on important integrations within the LexisNexis universe of products, a seamless user experience, and the ability to customize workflows, among other things.

The big risk is that legal product designers will design to the old normal, because that’s what they know. Instead, companies should be looking forward and studying the dynamic changes that have happened because of remote work. The practice of law next year will look very different than it did coming into 2020.

##Lexis+ Is Leading the Charge to Smarter Legal Software
In designing for the new normal and determining what legal users need going forward, it’s critical to incorporate feedback from those users. While clients often can’t describe what they want or need, they can describe the problems they have. By focusing more on what their clients are trying to do and accomplish and where they encounter unique challenges or difficulties, LexisNexis is able to translate that information into new product ideas, like Lexis+.

In and of itself, this isn’t a new concept, but it’s one that isn’t followed often enough. LexisNexis is a big believer in the framework that underpins the design thinking movement known as a jobs-to-be-done approach. Smarter legal software places an emphasis on the job its users are trying to do, not just features they’ll use — and the jobs they’re trying to do have changed fairly significantly in recent months.

What used to take place on paper now takes place entirely electronically. How teams work together to draft shareholder agreements or pleadings has changed dramatically with remote work. In parallel with Practical Guidance, Lexis+ incorporates a range of machine learning capabilities that allow users to parse vast data sets, quickly find market standards, and visually view the results in a way that allows for greater insights. Similarly, research around motions or briefs is enhanced in Lexis+, as users are automatically guided to additional insights beyond case law in Legal Research, Brief Analysis and other Lexis+ experiences.

This is just one example of the superior integrations in the Lexis+ ecosystem. Clients wanted to see better connections between what were once stand-alone products. As a result, Lexis+ integrates tools that were once separated to give users the best path to finding the most comprehensive answers to important legal questions, more efficiently than ever before.

Another key aspect of Lexis+ is that its workflows can be customized to specific practice areas or practitioners. Litigators and corporate attorneys will likely approach data and tasks very differently, so Lexis + customizes the data it presents based on factors like the user’s type of law practice. The result is a bespoke set of analytics tools and data review capabilities that are tailored and customizable for each user.

All of this is part of the intention for Lexis+ to provide a superior user experience and introduce new benefits for everyone who uses it. Users were clear that they wanted a better user experience, similar to that which they get with consumer products, and Lexis+ brings that to the professional world. Lexis+ offers a modern user experience that’s comparable to any product experience in the consumer realm. The focus is less on the individual products in play and more on the questions the user is trying to answer or the task they’re trying to accomplish. Users can start anywhere in Lexis+ and be guided to the best possible insights, wherever they exist in Lexis+ or other Lexis products, without having to do additional work.

[Lexis+](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-plus.page?utm_campaign=1-9918009411_M-LexisPlus+Launch-ATL+Native+Post+1_1-9556367711&utm_medium=digital+non-ln&utm_source=LexisPlus_Launch_PM_atlnative&utm_term=Mkt+Product&utm_content=&access=1-9556367711&treatcd=1-9918009411) is smarter legal software, but it also allows users to understand exactly how it’s smarter. The product removes the “black box” that has long existed around much of legal technology by incorporating features that allow users to both understand how their searches are being run and help them control and adjust the search experience. This is just one more way that Lexis+ has turned the user experience on its head.

##Looking Forward
LexisNexis is increasingly focusing its thinking on how it can continue to evolve Lexis+ to expand and support the legal industry’s changing work behaviors. In the development of Lexis+, the emphasis was on capabilities like collaboration, because it was clear that the new way of working was going to last for the foreseeable future. Now, LexisNexis is looking forward and continuing to design for the new normal. They’re constantly creating more integrations and focusing on solutions that are customizable and easy to use.

Legal technology providers need to recognize that clients are working differently than they did in the past. Smarter legal software is necessary to support that shift and whatever additional shifts may arise, so that users have the tools they need to practice law not just in the new normal, but in the future as well.

# Many People Assume Self-Employed Lawyers Can Be Bothered During Work Hours
## Self-employed lawyers have many of the same limitations that attorneys who work at larger law firms have. It isn't all just sunshine and laughter.

Self-employment is pretty awesome, and self-employed lawyers have substantial flexibility over their schedules and work life. Unlike people who work at larger law firms, self-employed lawyers generally do not need to report to bosses and can arrange their work schedules pretty much as they see fit. However, self-employed lawyers do not have unlimited flexibility in how they arrange their work time, and people should understand that they have many of the same limitations in their work life as people who work at larger shops.

I have been self-employed for a number of years, and people usually assume that because I work for myself, I can perform tasks during the workday that other people cannot complete. For instance, when there is a family responsibility that a group of people might need to complete, it is usually suggested that I do this since I have the most flexibility with my work schedule. In addition, people call me during the day for personal matters thinking that I can take the calls since I do not have bosses that I need to report to.

However, the reality is that self-employed lawyers have many of the limitations that attorneys who work at larger law firms have. Self-employed lawyers need to attend all of the same court appearances and depositions as lawyers who work at larger firms. Indeed, self-employed lawyers might have more difficulty managing court appearances, depositions, mediations, and the like than other lawyers because they have fewer people to lean on in order to appear at all of these appearances. For instance, this week, I had four appearance scheduled in my lawsuits, and this occupied a substantial portion of my week. Lawyers have limited ability to schedule these appearances, and this makes it hard for self-employed lawyers to have flexibility in their work life as other people might imagine.

Moreover, self-employed lawyers often need to occupy themselves billing hours more than some people who work at some larger firms. For most self-employed lawyers, the less time they spend billing hours, the less money they can expect to earn. This is not always the case at larger law firms in which there may be flexibility over the course of a large time horizon like a year when it comes to billing, and billing less in a given month does not lead to a lower salary. If self-employed lawyers need to take time off from work in order to complete personal tasks, they might not generate enough money in a given month to cover expenses.

Moreover, many larger law firms have organized methods for dealing with personal issues. For instance, many lawyers have an allotted amount of sick and personal days that they can use throughout the year to deal with a sickness (theirs or a family member’s) or to take time off just because they need to complete some task in their personal life. Generally, attorneys are allowed to take such time off without any impact to how people view their job performance and without suffering an adverse impact to their salary. A self-employed lawyer obviously does not have this luxury, and self-employed lawyers might be more likely to feel implicit pressure to work since they do not have a system in which they can seamlessly take time from work. This impacts the flexibility of self-employed lawyers to schedule their work time.

Additionally, in small law firms, self-employed lawyers might not want to take time off to complete personal tasks because this could look really bad to their partners. Since partners at a small law firm all have an impact on how much money each of them makes, it is difficult for partners to be seen “off the grid” during working hours since this could indicate that they are not pulling their own weight for a firm.

I am a law partner with my older brother, so, fortunately, I get some slack when it comes to being fluid about work and personal responsibilities over the workday. However, at various points, I have scheduled golf outings during the day and other personal matters in which people would typically be working. It definitely did not feel good knowing that I was out on the golf course while my partner was in the office billing hours, and the implicit pressure to be at the grind at a smaller law firm can keep people from being more fluid about work responsibilities.

In any event, it is undeniable that self-employed lawyers have the power to schedule their workdays more how they please than people who work as associate attorneys at larger law firms. However, explicit and implicit pressure can keep self-employed lawyers from having fluidity with their schedules.

# Just How How Much Did 2020 Suck For Law Firms?
## It was a rough year, but things weren't as bleak as one might think.

When the pandemic first hit, law firms understandably freaked out. Firms cut salaries and laid people off. Few really understood how to work remotely when this all kicked off. But by the end of the year, firms were reinstating salaries, holding the line on annual bonuses, and many even offered additional COVID-appreciation payments. So just how bad was the year for law firms?

The [2021 State of the Legal Market Report](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/reports/2021-state-of-legal-market), a joint effort from Georgetown Law’s Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession and the Thomson Reuters Institute, offers some insight into exactly how this all played out. As it turns out, while there were definitely trying times in the early going, the year ended on a fairly positive note for attorneys.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
From February until August, things looked bleak for the legal sector. At this point, the economy was in neutral and many courts were closed, putting a drag on both transactional and litigation work. But despite the pandemic only getting worse over the latter half of the year, firms had settled into a functioning model and clients were running back to the warm embrace of their lawyers.

As one might suspect, bankruptcy had the best year, becoming the only practice area to experience growth in 2020. But other practice areas held their own, experiencing modest dips, mostly during the five or six months’ worth of early shutdown.



While furloughs and layoffs plagued the industry, they paled in comparison to the 2009 catastrophe. Attorney headcount ended up off about 1.7 percent, while it reached as high as 4 percent during 2009. That said, firms laid off a good deal of support staff over the course of the year, which makes the human toll of the cutbacks more severe than it appears based on this figure alone.

Where firms really came out ahead was on managing costs beyond simply firing people.



Running a law firm got a lot cheaper in a lot of areas, but the slashing of recruiting and business development expenditures were steep. Obviously, those should see a significant rise once the legal industry returns to a new routine.



With revenue down a little and costs down a lot, you can imagine how profits per equity partner worked out.

No wonder firms were willing to hand out COVID appreciation bonuses. And to the extent firms stiffed the associates, it makes you wonder how far off the market the firm ended up this year.

There are more insights to be had in the full report, but all in all it appears as though the legal industry managed to come out of this crisis well-positioned for a breakout stretch once the virus is eradicated.

Now known as President Donald Trump’s [favorite law firm](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/donald-trump-s-favorite-law-firm), the Biglaw firm of Jones Day didn’t begin as a D.C. firm. What year did Jones Day open its Washington, D.C., office?

Hint: The firm began in 1893 in Cleveland, Ohio. The D.C. office was the first the firm opened outside of Ohio.

Jonathan F. Putnam

Biglaw life is not for the weak. It takes countless hours (scratch that, the hours are meticulously counted and billed out accordingly), hard work, and dedication to be successful there, and the biggest Biglaw prize is partnership. Not that the hard work is over when you make partner — much like a pie eating contest where the prize is more pie, once you reach this summit of the profession there is work to be done to stay there.

But what if  you don’t want to do it anymore? Perhaps you have other goals in mind, ones that are not compatible with time requirements of a Biglaw partnership? Would you have the guts to turn your back on the only professional life you’ve known and take a chance on a creative dream?

Meet [Jonathan F. Putnam](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=7985), a former litigation partner at Kirkland & Ellis. His longtime dream of being a novelist is finally coming true with today’s release of [These Honored Dead](http://amzn.to/2bcaBFY) (affiliate link), a historical mystery featuring the adventures of Abraham Lincoln and his friend, Joshua Speed.

The novel is an engaging mystery that is written with an authenticity towards the historical details that speaks well of the research skills Putnam learned in Biglaw. The first in a planned series, the book has even been optioned by a director and may be making its way to the big screen soon.

I had an opportunity to interview Putnam, and find out what exactly motivates someone to switch careers, balancing Biglaw and creative pursuits, and the intricacies of writing historical fiction.

According to your bio materials, you left your position as a partner at Kirkland & Ellis to be counsel there and to be an author. Why’d you make the decision to leave the top of your profession?

About 10 years ago I had the idea for a series of historical legal mysteries starring the young Abraham Lincoln, with the stories told by his real-life best friend Joshua Speed. My conception was young Lincoln and Speed as a sort of Holmes and Watson on the American frontier, with Lincoln as the great man, representing clients and solving mysteries in the courtroom, while Speed was his right-hand man, sometime sparring partner, and the chronicler of their shared adventures.

At the time I was working long hours at my job, having tried a number of big cases in the past few years.  So I didn’t really have time for reflection. A while later I got some breathing room and the space to reflect. I had been practicing law for 20 years, and I wasn’t positive what I wanted to do for the next 20. Ever since college, writing had been the path not taken for me.  I always would have regretted it if I hadn’t given it a shot.

I’ve also read that your parents were excited you made the move to be an author. Is it safe to say writing a book has been a long-term goal of yours?

My entire family has been very supportive of my new career.  When my wife Christin and I first met, a long time ago — we were both still teenagers — we talked about a life together in which I was a writer. It only took about 30 years, but finally I’ve made that come true.

Do you find writing fiction to be more fulfilling than being a Biglaw partner?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I really enjoyed my legal career and I’ve been fortunate to spend it all in the New York office of Kirkland & Ellis, which I think is the best litigation firm in the country. (I remain of counsel at the firm, which has been incredibly supportive of my new career.) So I don’t regret devoting so much time and energy to being a lawyer.

But — I was ready for a new challenge. Fundamentally, being a trial lawyer is about telling someone else’s stories (your client’s), while being a writer is about telling your own stories. I’ve found that I greatly enjoy telling my own stories.

Was writing something you were always able to integrate into your life, even while in the midst of Biglaw practice? How did you balance the two? Did you miss writing when you had to take a break from it for particularly big cases?

For several years while I was still a Kirkland partner, I tried to write in my spare time.  But I made almost no progress. Part of this was a “there’s only so many hours in the day” problem, but more of it was that I could never find the mental bandwidth to be creative alongside my day job as a big firm trial lawyer. I literally wrote about three pages in four years. On the first day when I was “of counsel” and therefore didn’t think of myself as a full-time lawyer anymore, I think I wrote six pages. Now, in retrospect, those six pages weren’t much good, but it was a start and I was off and running.

So the short answer is that I was not able to balance the two. I’ve continued to work on some cases as a Kirkland of counsel, and when one of those cases has heated up I’ve put my writing aside to focus on the case. I know some writers can successfully juggle the two careers simultaneously, but I definitely haven’t been able to.

What was the biggest challenge in deciding to take the plunge and be an author?

I had been at a great firm, Kirkland, for 20 years (my entire career since being a summer associate at K&E/New York in 1991); I had a corner office and worked every day with talented, hard-working lawyers and staff; I was good at my job; and I got paid a lot of money to do it. So, there were a lot of reasons beyond inertia keeping me there.

“Taking the plunge” is the right metaphor. I remember like it was yesterday walking down the hall to tell a partner on the management committee that I wanted to take a leave of absence right in the middle of my career and thinking to myself, “Is this a HUGE mistake?”

What advice do you have for Biglaw attorneys who find the law doesn’t provide enough of a creative outlet for them?

Take a deep breath, make sure your family is fully behind you (because they’ve probably invested as much in your career, in their own way, as you have) and take the plunge.

And don’t expect “success” — however you choose to define it in a new field — to come easily or all at once. It was four years from when I left the Kirkland partnership until I sold my novel to Crooked Lane Books in New York. There were lots of days when I was frustrated about how long it was taking, but I tried to remember that it took me three years of law school plus several years of being an associate before I started to feel confident in my law job. And it had taken me 20 years to get to where I was in my law career.

One of your main characters, Joshua Speed, exhibits some of the casual racism and sexism that were typical for the time period the book is set in, but modern readers may find jarring. Was it difficult to convincingly write such a nuanced character? Without spoiling any plot points, we also see his opinions on these issues start to evolve by the end of the book. Did you think that was necessary to make Speed sympathetic to the audience?

This is one area where I think the actual history is more interesting than anything I could invent.  Lincoln is one of the seminal figures in U.S. history, the man who freed the slaves and saved the nation. Yet for the four years in which my series is set (1837-41), Lincoln shared a room — and, indeed, the same bed — every night with this son of a large slave-owning family from Kentucky. Speed remained Lincoln’s “most intimate friend” for the rest of Lincoln’s life. As the great friend of the great man, there must have been something remarkable about him. I tried to capture that in my portrait of Speed.

At the same time, it must have been that Lincoln affected Speed’s worldview and vice versa.  How could it be otherwise when you share a bed for four years with your best friend? One of the things I imagine in the book is Lincoln influencing Speed (slowly) on the issue of slavery. And I imagine Speed influencing Lincoln, too, on other matters.

First and foremost, I wanted to write an entertaining, lively mystery story. But I think any good historical novel also gives you a new way to think about some aspect of that history. By portraying the interplay between Lincoln and Speed over the issue of slavery I was trying to capture the debates that occurred at the time and I think you can see the Civil War looming in the distance.

On the role of women, Lincoln and Speed are joined in their detecting by Speed’s younger sister, Martha. I’ve portrayed Martha as a very independent-minded young woman, and Lincoln and Speed’s interactions with her illuminate the things women could and could not do in the society at the time.

Your main characters are historical figures, one of which is very well known. Did you feel a responsibility to portray them as realistically and accurately as possible? How did you approach the task of researching personalities who lived so long ago?

I tried to stay very true to Lincoln’s history and character, because he’s so well known. I thought people would have objected otherwise, and the fact that I am historically accurate with him makes the less well-known aspects of his biography (such as that he shared a bed with Speed) all the more effective, I think. The first chapter of the novel, which tells the story of Lincoln and Speed meeting, is essentially non-fiction. The close friendship at the core of the novel is all fact. I felt a little more freedom to shape Speed’s story and more still with the minor characters. There’s a “historical note” at the end of the book that separates fact from fiction.

As for research, I read Lincoln and Speed’s extant correspondence, everything that’s been written about Speed (which is not much) and a sampling of the huge literature about Lincoln. Lincoln’s legal career has been very well documented by historians who scoured the clerk’s offices in courthouses throughout central Illinois for all of the pleadings and papers filed by Lincoln, and I’ve read many of those as well. In addition, I read a bunch of 19th Century newspapers and travel diaries and the like to get the texture of the times right.  I also visited Springfield, IL, and the other places depicted in the book. And I talked with a number of experts in the field.

Did your training as an attorney help in your historical research for this book?

Absolutely. As a litigator you’re trained to go through a mass of material quickly, looking for what’s most useful and relevant. And this was a lot more interesting than document review.

What are the biggest differences between writing drafts of a novel and writing drafts of an appellate brief?

Writing a novel is a lot closer to writing out an opening statement for a trial, because you need figure out how to tell a coherent, compelling story that will resonate with your audience — your readers as a writer; the judge and jury as a trial lawyer.

The big difference is that, as a trial lawyer, you are telling your client’s story, while as a writer, you’re telling your own. This is enormously freeing and exciting, but it’s also more than a little scary, precisely because no one tells you what the story is about, to say nothing of what the beginning, middle or ending is.

One of the themes of the novel is the quest for justice. Given your legal background, did you always suspect justice would play a central part in your first novel?

One common piece of good advice for writers is “write what you know.” I spent two decades learning about law and courtrooms. It’s pretty much the only thing I could write about — except for fantasy football or running (I’ve run a number of marathons, closer to the back of the pack than the front.)  And no one else is actually interested in my fantasy football team or running split times — I know this from personal experience.

The book provides some vivid and disturbing descriptions of the life and circumstances of the poor and the mentally ill in the 1800s. In the course of your research, what were some of the most surprising things you learned about how society’s less fortunate used to be treated?

The scenes in my novel regarding the poor and the mentally ill are based directly on 19th Century sources that I read.  The United States of the 1830s was an incredibly harsh society, especially on the frontier, where the novel is set, where no one had any time or excess resources to expend on persons less fortunate or less capable than themselves.  The mentally ill were very often locked away in attics or basements.  And the poor were sometimes confined to poorhouses, where conditions weren’t much different from the infamous Victorian workhouses described by Dickens. 

Will there be more adventures for Speed and Lincoln?

Yes. These Honored Dead is the first in the Lincoln and Speed Mystery series. The sequel, called Perish from the Earth (like ‘these honored dead’, a phrase from the Gettysburg Address), will be published by Crooked Lane next summer. I’m hoping to publish a book a year going forward. And a movie director recently optioned These Honored Dead, so hopefully Lincoln and Speed will be coming to the cinema or series TV before long, too.

# Text Is Really Only Part Of Context
## Adventures in impeachment linguistics!

What does the Constitution really say about impeachment? It’s not crystal clear, but what is obvious is that some people claiming to divine the “plain meaning” have already reversed themselves making you wonder just how “plain” these meanings can be. Meanwhile, the Biglaw revolving door or lack thereof continues to spin for former administration officials. Stepping away from the political scene, we have Biglaw partners attacking associates and a frank conversation about what it means to be an effective lawyer-manager.

As we get closer and closer to the end of 2020, more and more Biglaw firms that instituted austerity measures during the height of the coronavirus crisis have walked them back either in part or in full. Today, we have news from Stoel Rives, a firm that came in 132nd place in the most recent Am Law 200 rankings, with $236,541,000 in gross revenue in 2019.

Back in April, the firm announced [across-the-board salary cuts and employee furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/associates-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-taking-a-20-percent-pay-cut/). Partner distributions were reduced by 20 percent; associates, staff attorneys, and of counsel attorneys had their salaries slashed by 20 percent; and staff saw hourly reductions with corresponding pay cuts (5 percent for those earning less than $75,000; 10 percent for those earning $75,000-$100,000; 15 percent for those earning $100,000-$150,000; and 20 percent for those earning over $150,000). In September, all of those cuts were [partially rolled back](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-firm-announces-better-than-anticipated-financial-performance-rolls-back-austerity-measures/?rf=1), with third quarter partner distributions reduced by 15 percent instead of the 20 percent; associates, staff, and of counsel lawyers had their salaries slashed by 10 percent instead of 20 percent; and staff saw their hours and compensation cuts reduced as well (staff with a 20 percent reduction changed to 10 percent; staff with a 15 percent reduction changed to 7.5 percent; staff with a 10 percent reduction changed to 5 percent; and staff with a 5 percent reduction returned to full salary and schedule).

Now, thanks to the firm’s financial performance, all of these cuts have come to an end. Melissa Jones, the managing partner of Stoel Rives, released this statement:

Stoel Rives is pleased to announce the elimination of its temporary pandemic and economic uncertainty pay cuts. By October 12, 2020, all lawyers and staff will have their base pay returned to its pre-reduction level. This decision is based on the firm’s performance through the end of Q3. The firm will continue to operate in a conservative manner as the fourth quarter remains uncertain for the legal industry.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm on getting back to their full salaries. Now it’s time for them to wonder if they’re going to be made whole.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Layoffs continue apace at Biglaw firms across the country, and show no sign of stopping.

The leaders of Katten Muchin — a firm that brought in $742,885,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 67 in the most recent Am Law 100 — just announced a series of layoffs among attorneys and staff. Less than 5% of attorneys were affected by these cuts.

Although the firm’s gross revenue and profits per equity partner went up last year, its revenue per lawyer went down by 2%, perhaps due to the firm’s 6.2% increase in head count. And now, unfortunately, layoffs have arrived to account for the firm’s oversized hiring practices amid poor economic conditions for their clients.

When reached for comment, a spokesperson from Katten offered this statement on the firm’s behalf:

Like all businesses, we must adapt to the needs of our clients. The rapidly shifting economic conditions of the last couple years have been challenging for many of our clients, recently decreasing their demand for some of our legal services. After working through these conditions for some time and a careful review of our business, we made the difficult decision to address this overcapacity by parting ways with a small number of our attorneys and business support professionals. Where possible, we reassigned team members to practice groups where demand exceeds capacity, and our reductions were limited to groups where existing and expected demand is diminished. Consistent with these circumstances, we will be deferring a portion of our incoming class to a February 1 start. The rest of our incoming associates will begin with the firm as usual, in October.

Parting with talented colleagues and good friends is not easy. Our actions are not a negative reflection on our colleagues or their contributions to our firm. Rather, the decision reflects the reality of the business environment in which we find ourselves and our commitment to continually provide development opportunities that allow our people to grow. While difficult, we believe our decision will keep the firm strong and well prepared to serve our clients and our people.

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Katten.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Biglaw Firms To Lend Associates To NYC Law Departments For Public Service Fellowships
## The associates will still be employed -- and paid -- by their firms during their fellowships.

The city has never needed lawyers more than it does today. There are currently hundreds of lawyer positions vacant, and the city’s lawyers at the law department and within its agencies do incredible work every day even though they are shorthanded.

— Brendan McGuire, chief counsel to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, in [comments given](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/shorthanded-nyc-agencies-borrow-lawyers-major-law-firms-2022-11-03/) during a press conference announcing the New York City Legal Fellows Program, which will allow junior associates from major Biglaw firms to gain public service experience through one-year stints working with city agencies’ law departments. The Biglaw firms involved in this initiative include King & Spalding; Kirkland & Ellis; O’Melveny & Myers; Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; Ropes & Gray; Shearman & Sterling; Simpson Thacher & Bartlett; and Willkie Farr & Gallagher.

# Another Biglaw Firm Moving To Hudson Yards

After generations upon generations of parsing the New York legal industry between downtown and midtown, there’s a new pole in the Manhattan office market. We’ve been covering the slow burn of firms announcing moves to the new Hudson Yards project, with Boies Schiller and Milbank both committing to a future life on the far, far, West Side. One firm was an outlier, a second was a curiosity. With a third major firm making the leap, we have an official trend.

[Cooley LLP](https://www.cooley.com) has just signed a lease that will move its New York office to Eleventh Avenue. The Palo Alto-based firm, currently located in the Grace Building on the Avenue of the Americas[[1]](#f1), will be moving into 130,000 square feet over five upper floors at the 51-story, 55 Hudson Yards building.

It makes sense for Cooley, a firm synonymous with Silicon Valley, to buy into the new development that’s being billed as the city’s new home for tech innovators. If the clients are buying into that image, then there’s no reason the firm shouldn’t join them. After all, isn’t that the same thinking that uprooted Cooley from San Francisco to Palo Alto in the 80s?

While the move is still a ways off, the firm’s website offers a glimpse of what the offices might look like [with these artist’s renderings](https://www.cooley.com/news/coverage/2017/2017-07-31-move-to-55-hudson-yards).

For the record, every time someone points to 55 Hudson Yards I’m going to somberly declare, “That’s no moon.”

Here’s another look at that massive window:



Not exactly dispelling the Death Star comparisons, but this angle evokes another idea for me. With people standing in each of these windows looking out, I can’t help but say, “I’ll take Cooley CEO [Joe Conroy](https://www.cooley.com/people/joe-conroy) for the block.” Seriously, if some enterprising group of associates wants to put cardboard cutouts of Charles Nelson Reilly and Jim J. Bullock — or the cast of the Brady Bunch — in their windows and get someone in another building to take a picture, I will happily write it up. Sadly, this may not be possible since Cooley is expected to take over upper floors where the windows are more rectangular than on lower floors. Alas, someone needs to make this happen.

But these are just pics of the outside. We eagerly await [our tour](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/white-case-has-built-the-new-modern-law-firm-office-and-its-awesome/) of the finished product.

While there’s no such thing as a working subway line in New York these days[[2]](#f2), once this move is complete, times will be especially hard on all those attorneys and staff who made housing decisions based on the firm’s current location. The 7 Train does get you to Hudson Yards, but unless you’re in Queens, that means you’re making a transfer. If you’re a 2L with a Cooley offer this Fall, perhaps it’s time to familiarize yourself with all Long Island City has to offer.

But look on the bright side — you’ll be able to [get to the airport from your office faster](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/the-smartest-trip-youll-ever-take-in-your-biglaw-career/).

[ [1]](#reff1) Which is a complete fraud. The Grace Building doesn’t in any way touch the Avenue of the Americas, but it trots around a prestigious avenue address. New York has a number of buildings that try to cheat geographic logic to improve their stationery, and it’s an abomination that has to stop. Has anyone else been bothered by this or is it just me?

# Will Any Other Biglaw Firms 'Surprise' The Market With Bigger, Better Compensation News?
## Is any firm going to try to one-up Cravath when it comes to associate salaries and bonuses?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I don’t think we’re done yet. If history is any guide, I think there might be a few additional surprises over the next couple of weeks as the firms duke it out.

— Jeff Lowe, of Jeffrey Lowe Partners, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/30/smaller-group-of-law-firms-may-match-associate-pay-scale-this-time-around/) on the state of Biglaw’s compensation market in the wake of Cravath’s decision to announce [salary raises and bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/). Many firms have already matched Cravath, but many others have remained silent thus far. Lowe said he’d be surprised if firms through “at least the top 50 firms and further into the top 100” didn’t match Cravath’s salary scale, but that if others tried to keep up, he’d be even more surprised. “Definitely as you move your way down the Am Law 100, there’s just less money to play with,” he said.

# Cravath Speaketh: Year-End Bonuses Announced!
## Bonus season has really started now!

Baker McKenzie may have been first on the bonus train this year, but Biglaw insiders *know* bonus season hasn’t really begun till Cravath announces their scale. Well friends, the wait is over.

Today, Cravath announced their year-end bonuses. And despite the forecasted economic downturn, it’s a good year in Biglaw.



Interestingly, the class of 2015 is off the scale, which can work out great — or terribly — for associates.

Check out the full email on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cravath-bonuses-22/2/)

Cravath matched the scale set by Baker McKenzie — which is slightly above the scale from last year for junior associates. And this makes sense. The economic waters are troubled, but they aren’t particularly feisty for Biglaw. Cravath acts from a position of strength to hold the line and declare with Biglaw’s loudest voice, “This too shall pass!”

Even if it passes after some of y’all go under.

Congratulations to associates on the generous bonuses!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for all of your help!

In 2014, Above the Law published my series on Planning for a Legal Career Overseas ([Part I](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/03/planning-for-a-legal-career-overseas-part-i-picking-the-right-practice-area-and-the-right-firm/) and [Part II](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/03/planning-for-a-legal-career-overseas-part-ii-language-skills-caveats-and-what-you-can-be-doing-now/)) that outlines your best route for moving overseas as a U.S. JD. I stress the importance of working in the capital markets space if you are committed to working overseas. This still holds true for Paris and other European financial centers: Frankfurt and Milan, for example. But over the last few years, we’ve seen a decline in opportunities for U.S. capital markets lawyers in London and an uptick in opportunities for U.S. JDs trained in M&A (on the private equity side) and emerging companies work (venture capital, technology transactions, privacy, etc.)

Why this shift? Ever since Brexit became a certainty, hiring for U.S. capital markets in London has been slow. Firms were still sending their own associates on overseas rotations, but the lateral market all but dried up. But with the boom in private equity and emerging companies work recently, firms are realizing they can use this (U.S.-qualified) expertise in other time zones.

I am currently working with two top international firms, assisting them in finding solid mid-level to senior U.S. JD associates:

- with M&A, capital markets, or venture capital experience for a top emerging companies practice, and
- for a Chambers Band 1 global M&A (primarily private equity) practice.
Capital markets associates, hang on! There will inevitably be more openings in London soon. Capital markets can only be booming in the U.S. for so long without some of that need crossing the pond. But this new diversity in practice areas in London that U.S. lawyers can aspire to is exciting!

If you are a U.S. JD with a top firm and curious about opportunities in London, Paris or elsewhere in Europe — now or planning for down the road — please reach out to me at [agordon@laterallink.com](mailto:agordon@laterallink.com) and we’ll discuss!

“Goliath,” a new television show starring Billy Bob Thornton about a lawyer rebuilding his career after being drummed out of Biglaw, will premiere on what network?

Hint: Jonathan Shapiro, former federal prosecutor and former attorney at Kirkland & Ellis, co-wrote/created the series with David Kelley. The series, to be released on October 14, will be sure to explore [gritty side of Biglaw](https://bol.bna.com/new-amazon-show-asks-if-big-law-is-too-big/).

Selwyn Goldberg

Some Biglaw firms are major players in the lateral market — increasing headcount like it ain’t no thang. But others are more choosy, generally preferring homegrown talent to trying to lure big names away from other firms.

Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz usually falls into the latter category. The hyper-elite firm tends to stay above the lateral fray, but there must be something in this spring air that brings out the adventurous. Now comes word Wachtell has added a lateral to its roster of legal talent — former Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati senior partner [Selwyn Goldberg](http://www.wlrk.com/SBGoldberg/).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Goldberg comes to Wachtell in an of counsel role, having left WSGR in March for personal reasons. And as[ Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/2018/04/04/wachtell-once-again-makes-a-rare-lateral-hire/) he is happy in the role of counsel:

Goldberg said he left on good terms with Wilson Sonsini and attributed his move as “very much a personal decision,” one grounded in the need to have a more permanent presence closer to his family and an eagerness to embark on a new—and likely final—chapter in his career. Asked about whether he has any aspirations to join Wachtell’s exclusive partnership, Goldberg laughed and said he is content in his current role.

Goldberg’s background — as an advisor to transactions in the technology sector notably on the legal teams that counseled Toshiba’s proposed sale of its chip business and Microsoft’s 2016 purchase of LinkedIn — was what appealed to the powers that be at Wachtell:

“I think [Wachtell] wanted someone for IP and tech transactions,” said Goldberg, when asked how he came to be hired by the firm. “The M&A expertise is obviously already here.”

# Biglaw Firm Cuts Ties With Local Prosecutor's Office Citing Racial Justice Concerns
## George Floyd's death is forcing the firm to rethink exactly what programs it supports.

Since 1978, Dorsey & Whitney has been sending a steady stream of litigation associates to the Minneapolis City Attorney’s Office to help prosecute misdemeanors. But earlier this month, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, the firm did away with the program, with managing partner [Bill Stoeri](https://www.dorsey.com/people/s/stoeri-william-r) citing the racial imbalance in the prosecution of misdemeanors and the impact that has on black communities.

As Stoeri [told American Lawyer,](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/06/03/dorsey-whitney-nixes-partnership-with-minneapolis-prosecutors-spotlighting-racial-imbalance/) the firm aims to be “part of the solution”:

“What George Floyd’s death did is really cause us—and I think a lot of other people around the country—to really reexamine things and look at it and see what we thought was appropriate to be doing,” Stoeri said. “A change is needed, and I think this is an area where, instead of just saying we’ll explore things … we can take some action and examine our own programs.”

The firm will also be doing more pro bono work focused on supporting the recent Black Lives Matter protests and working with public defenders in the city. Plus, the firm will be matching employee donations to “charitable organizations working for racial justice and providing community support,” up to $50,000.

# Dismantling The Gender Pay Gap: The Role Of Non-Promotable Tasks
## When these tasks and the time they require are added up, they put the women doing them at a significant disadvantage.

Despite an increased emphasis on diversity and inclusion in recent years, there’s no denying that gender equity gaps still exist throughout the legal industry. Some of them are more obvious, in the form of things like salary differences. Some disparities, though, tend to fall under the radar.

A prime example is non-promotable tasks – things that people are regularly expected to handle at the office, but are technically unrelated to the actual job. These “office mom” tasks tend to revolve around office morale, like coordinating birthday cakes or baby showers, or they may be work-related but non-billable “scrivener” roles, like taking notes at big meetings. You can probably think of a lot more – and you can also probably think of who ends up handling them.

One thing these tasks all have in common is that they more often than not are handled by women. And though they may appear positive and important in an office environment, they can put the women doing them at a significant disadvantage in performance reviews and when it comes time to make decisions for promotion or partnership.

To help attorneys at all levels understand this issue and its impact on women in the workplace, PLI is offering a one-hour program, [Non-Promotable Tasks and Gender Effects in Performance Reviews](https://www.pli.edu/programs/N/Non-Promotable-Tasks-and-Gender-Effects-in-Performance-Reviews?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2). The program will investigate recent research related to non-promotable tasks and gender’s role in performance reviews. Program participants will learn tips and tactics to address some of the most common issues faced by women in the legal profession – as well as strategies they can use to promote themselves and others in a positive way.

Eradicating the imbalances caused by non-promotable tasks is a critical factor in achieving gender equity in the legal profession. [Sign up](https://www.pli.edu/programs/N/Non-Promotable-Tasks-and-Gender-Effects-in-Performance-Reviews?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) for the program to get practical advice that you can implement today.

# The Biglaw Pay Raises Head South
## These salaries aren't at New York levels, but they're perfectly reasonable, and associates are pleased.

Fortunately for associates, birds aren’t the only ones heading south for the winter. Biglaw pay raises are as well.

The Cravath-led pay raise from June is giving rise to salary hikes in September. Here’s the latest news, announced in meetings earlier today at the 140-year-old, 500-lawyer firm of Womble Carlyle (as related by a source in attendance):

Womble Carlyle just announced they are increasing salaries (starting January 1st) across the board.

In North Carolina and Georgia, first-year salaries go from $135,000 to $155,000.
In South Carolina, first-year salaries go from $120,000 to $125,000.
In Maryland and Delaware, first-year salaries go from $145,000 to $160,000.
In Virginia, California, and D.C., first-year salaries go from $150,000 to $170,000.

Everyone else gets a corresponding salary increase on a percentage basis:

North Carolina and Georgia associates get a 14.8% increase.
South Carolina associates get a 4.2% increase.
Maryland and Delaware associates get a 10.3% increase.
Virginia, California, and D.C. associates get a 13.3% increase.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Although these salaries [miss the MoneyLaw cut](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/), they are perfectly respectable for a firm that’s [a little outside the Am Law 100](http://www.americanlawyer.com/law-firm-profiles-result?firmname=Womble+Carlyle+Sandridge+%26+Rice&slreturn=20160819135110) (#111 in the most recent rankings).

But there is, of course, a catch (there’s always a catch):

Along with that comes increased billable hour expectations — which start October 1st, a full quarter before salary increases take effect.

Associates are now expected to bill 1850 hours instead of the previous minimum 1800. To be bonus-eligible, though, they have to bill 1900, of which 50 can be pro bono hours.

So there’s that. But Womble Carlyle isn’t the only firm that’s [raising hours requirements](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/with-great-raises-come-great-increased-billing-requirements-the-other-side-of-raises/) along with pay. And by Biglaw standards, an hours requirement of 1850 to 1900 is still quite civilized.

Not surprisingly, Womble Carlyle associates are happy, as one of them told us:

Reaction was generally positive. There were some negative comments regarding the fact that increased hours are starting a full quarter before corresponding salary increases, and they didn’t yet have any information on what bonuses would be if you hit the 1900 or 2100 thresholds. But other than that, people seem pretty pleased!

Congrats to the Womble Carlyle associates on their pay raise. January will be here before you know it.

Remember, when your firm raises, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. Thanks.

UPDATE (5:08 p.m.): An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Maryland and Delaware starting salaries were going from $150,000 to $160,000. They are actually going from $145,000 to $160,000.

# Will We Soon See an American Law Firm Go Public?
## And which firm would be the likeliest first mover?

The notion of a publicly traded law firm has traditionally been an oxymoron in the United States. Ethical constraints and deep cultural roots have kept the partnership model firmly entrenched. But with some law firms in other common law jurisdictions going public in recent years, an intriguing question arises: will the United States soon see its first publicly traded law practice?

The Situation Overseas

In 2007, Slater & Gordon made history as the first law firm in Australia to list publicly. The firm used the funds raised through its IPO to enable a strategy of acquiring other law firms: in the years following its listing, Slater & Gordon acquired scores of smaller firms in both the Australian and UK markets. That growth trajectory was somewhat rocky, with the firm suffering over AU$1 billion in losses on its failed 2016 acquisition of British legal services business Quindell. But even if its execution was uneven, Slater & Gordon’s acquisition strategy demonstrates one potential rationale for a law firm to enter the capital markets.

Several other firms followed Slater & Gordon into the public markets in the 2010s, first in Australia, and then also in the UK, where in 2015 Gateley became the first British law firm to go public. Although the most prestigious firms in Australia and the UK remain private, there are now enough publicly traded firms to indicate that the listed law firm model is here to stay.

Rule 5.4 Barrier

Ethical constraints have long made it impractical for an American law firm to consider going public. Specifically, [Rule 5.4](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer/) of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct regulates fee-sharing with non-lawyers. Rule 5.4(d) provides:

A lawyer shall not practice with or in the form of a professional corporation or association authorized to practice law for a profit, if:

(1) a nonlawyer owns any interest therein, except that a fiduciary representative of the estate of a lawyer may hold the stock or interest of the lawyer for a reasonable time during administration;

(2) a nonlawyer is a corporate director or officer thereof or occupies the position of similar responsibility in any form of association other than a corporation; or

(3) a nonlawyer has the right to direct or control the professional judgment of a lawyer.

On its face, this prohibition would seem to foreclose the possibility of a publicly traded American firm. But it would not be surprising to see the ethical constraints begin to loosen in the coming years. As a parallel, we might look to the history of the [litigation finance industry](https://thepractice.law.harvard.edu/article/a-brief-history-of-litigation-finance/). The business model of funding claims in exchange for a portion of the ultimate recovery operated on uncertain regulatory ground when it initially arose in Australia in the 1990s. But after first establishing itself in the Australian market, funding spread to the UK in the 2000s, and then to the United States, where it has steadily become an increasingly typical feature of commercial litigation. It is conceivable that liberalization of restrictions on non-lawyer ownership is on a similar path, following about a decade behind the litigation finance wave.

The Likeliest First Mover

If and when we see a legal business go public in the United States, it will almost certainly be an alternative legal services provider, rather than a traditional law firm. Legal talent provider Axiom [announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190219005568/en/Axiom-Announces-Confidential-Submission-Draft-Registration-Statement) its submission of a draft registration statement to the SEC in 2019, but it later decided to accept private equity investment in lieu of an IPO. Also in 2019, Bloomberg Law [reported](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/law-company-elevate-raises-25m-aiming-for-2021-public-listing) that legal services business Elevate aimed to go public in 2021. Last year, however, Elevate [pushed back](https://www.law360.com/articles/1309259/pandemic-delays-legal-consultancy-elevate-s-ipo-to-2022) its target to 2022, citing flat growth in 2020 due to the pandemic.

Even if Elevate eventually proceeds with an IPO, more typical law firms may not rush to the markets. The main appeal of becoming a public company is the opportunity to raise equity capital. But law firms generally are not structured to take advantage of a large capital infusion. As we illustrated [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/law-firm-consolidation-perpetually-out-of-reach/), the industry remains highly fragmented, and no American law firm has indicated an intention to pursue acquisitions on the scale of Slater & Gordon.

Law firms in need of a more modest infusion of capital have ready access to obtain it through other channels. For example, a firm could enter into a portfolio funding agreement with a litigation finance provider. In such a deal, the funder provides upfront capital to the firm in exchange for a portion of the future contingent fees that the firm ultimately recoups from a portfolio of cases. The firm can use the capital to bridge the gap until it receives fee income, and in the unhappy event that the funder’s investment exceeds the fees the firm ultimately collects from the portfolio, the firm does not have to reimburse the difference.

Goldman as Cautionary Tale

More broadly, a look at how the transition from partnership to public company has unfolded in other industries may give firms reason for caution. Consider the case of the 1999 Goldman Sachs IPO. Going public was great for the bankers who happened to be Goldman partners in 1999, but it constrained the compensation trajectory for subsequent generations and made it more difficult for Goldman to compete with the buy side for top talent. For the past two decades, Goldman has sought to navigate an awkward balance, straining to preserve elements of its traditional partnership culture despite external shareholder ownership. [Recent reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/business/goldman-sachs-partner-exits.html) indicates that CEO David Solomon is abandoning the balancing act and embracing a more typical public company management structure, precipitating a wave of senior executive departures.

If a top American law firm were to go public, it would, like Goldman, confront shareholder pressure to keep a lid on compensation growth. Meanwhile, its private competitors would be less constrained, similar to the buy side employers that have recruited many former Goldman stars. The problem would be even more acute in the law firm context than in finance, given that junior law firm partners are highly mobile on the lateral market. As we discussed [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/law-firm-consolidation-perpetually-out-of-reach/), professional ethics rules prevent law firms from locking in clients or using noncompete agreements to hinder rainmakers from making lateral moves.

When top American firms weigh the risks of a public listing against the benefits of access to equity capital, they are likely to decide to stick with a more traditional partnership structure. Even if a modified Rule 5.4 removed the ethical hurdle, basic business considerations would inhibit public listings by the Am Law royalty.

[](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b1w551jMW6rIerj)Despite the ongoing disruption and uncertainty of our current circumstances, it is safe to assume that mandatory continuing legal education will continue to be an obligation for all practicing lawyers.

We wanted to check in with the ATL audience and get a sense of how you feel about mandatory continuing legal education during these unprecedented times.

Which of the following best describes your circumstances?  Take a [quick poll here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b1w551jMW6rIerj).

# Who’s Sorry Now?
## Time for a little doom scrolling ...

Everyone has regrets. Some peeps will talk about them, and others won’t. But if you say that you’ve never had any, then you are a lying sack of s**t, as one of my clients used to say with some regularity. There’s a classic Frank Sinatra (who he? Google him) song, “My Way.” One of the lines in the song is “Regrets, I’ve had a few, but then again too few to mention.” The songwriter was Paul Anka (Google him). Sorry, Frank, but I don’t think you counted correctly.

All you need to do is doom scroll through the pages of ATL and any other website and you will read examples of peeps who did stupid dumb things (they didn’t think so) and didn’t get away with them. As well they shouldn’t.

There’s a [new book out by Daniel Pink](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Regret-Looking-Backward-Forward-ebook/dp/B097XNT4RT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=14JTIWELOKJ0V&keywords=the+power+of+regret&qid=1649268251&s=books&sprefix=%2Cstripbooks%2C118&sr=1-1), who’s authored other books about how life has evolved since the turn of this century.   He writes about the various kinds of regrets that everyone has. Just as no one gets out of this life alive, no one lives without regrets.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Examples of regrets abound in our profession. An attorney who was convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud five years ago and who has done everything demanded of him while on a three-year suspension, including paying a fine, community service, and the like, didn’t get what he wanted. When he sought reinstatement, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals’ Board on Professional Responsibility said, “[not so fast](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/former-biglaw-partner-fails-to-understand-seriousness-of-his-misconduct/).” The Board found that the attorney had not evidenced sufficient regret for his conduct and that explanations for his conduct did not add up.

Do you think regret is something that you didn’t do that you wish you had done or something that you did that you wish you hadn’t?

Another example, [this one in discovery](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/gibson-dunn-on-wrong-end-of-854k-sanctions-motion/): foot-dragging by either the client or the attorney or both, failure to meet and confer, and other peccadillos. What do you think will be the response when a Biglaw firm is facing a possible $854K sanctions by playing fast and loose in discovery? Regrets about how this was handled? Regrets in how it looks to the court?

How can one argue (with a straight face, of course) that it is too late for the plaintiff to move for sanctions now, of course not saying that delays were due to defense delays? Wait, what? Is this analogous to the situation of a person who murders his parents and then throws himself on the mercy of the court claiming he’s an orphan?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
What about regrets over things you did that you knew very well would not go well?  That’s the question that could/should be put to [Rudy Giuliani](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/the-king-of-disgrace-rudy-giuliani/), ATL’s King of Disgrace for 2022. My 9/11 admiration for him was misplaced as was shown in the ensuing years, but now he’s not just a disgrace, but a disbarred one. Do you think he has any regrets?

Of course, regrets require some thinking, some contemplation, some deep dive into consciousness and conscience. Given Rudy’s antics ever since 45 was inaugurated and even before that, I doubt if deep thinking was part of his analysis, given his master/servant relationship with 45.

Does John Eastman really think that he made all the right moves for the right reasons in his defense of 45? Will he lose his license to practice here in California?

Does he care about his reputation, whatever is left of it?

We understand that our role as advocates is to zealously represent our clients. We also understand that we should never do anything that would sully our professional reputation, that is, if we care about that. We are all told, from the earliest moments of our careers, that our professional reputations are all that we have. We regret not winning a motion/trial we should have won. The regret in those cases is a useful tool for improvement. We learn from those mistakes and move on.

But some regrets are much longer lasting and have consequences beyond immediate apologies and promises to do better. I don’t think that regret factors into many peeps’ thinking anymore. Two examples:

The Virginia State Bar has disbarred the Oath Keepers attorney for a panoply of violations of [the professional rules](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/oath-keepers-lawyer-who-claimed-clients-were-security-guards-at-jan-6-riot-gets-disbarred/). Do you think he has any regrets in representing his clients on January 6? He claims he’ll appeal; good luck with that.

Do any Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have any regrets for their treatment of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson? It was like a frat party gone wild with members of the Grand Old Party (not anymore) trying to outdo their Republican colleagues on irrelevant issues, trying to make her look bad, trying to dismantle whatever respect that the public has for the “advise and consent” process of the Senate. They were polite at the outset, just barely, but their contempt for the first Black woman nominee to the court was evident and appalling. I would hope that every woman and every thinking man were turned off by what they saw. As Elton John sings, “Sorry seems to be the hardest word.”

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

* “We want him to testify openly. I think the American people need that. I think, frankly, it’s his duty to the American people.” House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said that he could subpoena former special counsel Robert Mueller in the next two weeks if they can’t come to an agreement for his public testimony. [[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/nadler-subpoena-mueller-1356183)]

* After refusing even more subpoena demands, it’s highly likely that the House is going to hold AG Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress. Let’s see if this goes anywhere… [[Washington Post](https://beta.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democrats-likely-to-hold-william-barr-wilbur-ross-in-contempt-after-subpoena-demands-are-rejected/2019/06/06/c879e7de-88b0-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html?outputType=amp)]

# Biglaw Associates Should Interact With Clients More
## Not only is client interaction important to professional development, but it can strengthen client relationships as well.

Biglaw firms usually have a regimented way of doing business. Partners are often charged with managing clients and interacting with them to obtain information that is relevant to a representation. Partners then break up parts of the representation into projects and assign associates to complete the work. Of course, some firms use different methods of doling out work, and counsel or senior associates might also be involved in this process, but more senior lawyers are usually almost exclusively involved with connecting with clients at top firms. However, more Biglaw shops should encourage associates to communicate with clients directly in order to improve the representation and realize other benefits.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, I never interacted with clients unless we were completing a pro bono assignment. I relied on partners to tell me the facts, provide me assignments, and there was definitely a disconnect between the clients and me. Of course, Biglaw partners might not trust associates enough to interact with clients, especially when clients might have questions that would be difficult for associates to answer. Moreover, partners often have deep connections with clients that associates do not have since they have not been practicing for long. If we’re being honest, senior lawyers might also not wish for multiple lawyers to interact with clients for fear that the client may end up moving their work to the other lawyer.

When I worked at smaller law firms, it was very common for me to have client contact. At those shops, junior attorneys had much more autonomy over their files since we all needed to manage a large number of cases, and partners could not handle all client communications. When I first started interacting with clients at smaller firms, I felt disadvantaged because I had no experience interacting with clients at a bigger shop. I had no prior chance to develop a “bedside manner” and a cool-headed way of speaking with clients, which is important because clients often come to lawyers about emotional issues. For months, it felt awkward picking up the phone and speaking with clients because I never had a chance to hone my customer service skills with respect to clients when I was working at a larger firm.

However, having associates interact directly with clients has many advantages. Perhaps most importantly, it can help associates learn accurate information about a matter. In Biglaw, in cases in which associates do not interact with clients, it is usually up to the partner to convey information about a matter. However, just like in the game “telephone,” when you convey information through multiple people, the message often gets lost. Indeed, sometimes in Biglaw, I would make assumptions about a client’s situation that might or might not have been correct because I did not want to trouble the partner to go to the client to get the information. If clients interacted directly with associates, there would be a straight line of communication that might ensure that more accurate information is reflected in the work product an attorney produces.

Another benefit of having associates interact with clients more is that this is solid training that will be useful to associates later in their careers. Law firms invest much time and resources in their associates, and it is hoped that many of the associates will stay at the firm for a long time and make careers at a shop. Should associates get promoted and become counsel or partner, they will likely need to interact with clients frequently. Some firms do begin to bring associates into the fold with speaking to clients as they progress in their careers so that they are ready for the next step in their advancement at a firm.

However, associates can be even better trained if they start interacting with clients earlier on. In this way, associates may get used to the process of intake and interaction that comes with connecting with clients for more years and can be even better at this should they be promoted. The bedside manner and aura that is needed to successfully deal with clients takes time to learn, and Biglaw shops should start the learning process earlier.

Another major benefit of having Biglaw associates interact with clients earlier is that many clients might enjoy seeing the junior attorneys who are working on an account. Many clients get a kick out of seeing the young blood that is dedicated to their work, and clients often like to see that firms are providing opportunities for advancement to junior attorneys. Indeed, earlier in my career when I interacted with in-house professionals, these lawyers loved telling me about experiences they had in their careers and imparting advice on a junior lawyer. This interaction can help build relationships with clients and ensure that clients get to see all of the lawyers who are performing work from them.

All told, although some Biglaw firms might be hesitant to let junior attorneys interact with clients, such interaction can also have a number of benefits. Not only is client interaction important to professional development, but it can strengthen client relationships as well.

# Will More Biglaw Firms Join In On The Associate Deferral Party?

[Some firms] may take the opportunity to let go of attorneys because they can do so without being in the spotlight.

I’m not convinced it’ll hit the industry across the board. Given how much work has slowed, some firms may have overhired. But I don’t think every firm fits into that category.

— [Summer Eberhard](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/summer-eberhard?byconsultantorauthor=summer-eberhard), a legal recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa in San Francisco, in [comments given](https://www.law.com/2022/09/29/as-gunderson-defers-associate-class-will-other-follow-suit/) to the American Lawyer on Gunderson Dettmer’s decision to [defer the start date for the firm’s incoming associate class](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/gunderson-deferred-associate-start-dates/). As we first reported, the firm confirmed the delay, and a spokesperson stated that “this is a personnel matter and we have nothing more to say.”

# As Usual, Going Above And Beyond For Bonuses At Quinn Hardly Seems Worth It
## If you're going for Quinn's high-billing bonuses, you're kind of an idiot.

The Quinn Emanuel bonus scale is out and, it’s [exactly the same as last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-litigation-powerhouse-announces/). And last year was exactly the same as the year before. So, score one for consistency I guess.

Here’s the scale:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Since there’s nothing surprising here, I’ll take this opportunity to bitch.

You’ll note that, as per usual, Quinn gives a higher bonus to people who bill more hours (they also give less to people who bill fewer than 2100 hours). But look closely at those higher payouts. A 2016 associate who bills 2650 hours gets… $3,000 more than an associate who bills 2150 hours.

For those who are not good at math, that works out to $6 extra an hour. An associate who bills 800 hours more than the minimum bonus requirement is making $6.50 per extra hour. A 2016 associate would be financially better off spending 500-800 extra hours BABYSITTING THE PARTNERS’ CHILDREN than billing clients for the firm. Significantly so. The bonus structure itself is a perverse incentive to hit 2100 hours and then stop working altogether.

Of course, Quinn gets around that problem by not actually giving associates the choice to manage their hours in their economic best interests. If you’re on pace to bill 2800 hours (I’ve been there), you know you don’t have the option to say “No, I’m good, I’m just going go through Halloween, then work as a seasonal helper at Lowe’s, I’ll make way more money that way.”

Nobody actually tries to bill 2800 hours. Some people FAIL TO ESCAPE on time and end up billing 2800 hours. Those high billers got captured. Their reward for getting caught is some loose change Quinn Emanuel partners found in the lobby.

Of course, when you’re captured, [somebody putting six bucks into your commissary account](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/filming-porn-in-the-attorney-meeting-rooms-is-frowned-upon-in-this-penitentiary/) is a big deal.

# Proskauer Wins Temporary Restraining Order Against Former Chief Operating Officer
## The latest in the Biglaw legal drama.

Last week, we [brought you news ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/proskauer-files-lawsuit-against-fired-chief-operating-officer-what-you-need-to-know/)of the explosive lawsuit top Biglaw firm Proskauer filed against its former Chief Operating Officer. The firm alleges the now-former COO, Jonathan O’Brien, downloaded 34 gigabytes of internal data to a USB drive before announcing he was leaving the firm. The complaint also alleges O’Brien attempted to delete emails subject to a litigation hold.

Among the relief sought by the complaint was an ex parte temporary restraining order to preventing O’Brien from disseminating the internal documents he downloaded. And that’s exactly what Southern District of New York Judge John Cronan granted in the case. O’Brien left on a paid vacation to Mauritius on December 22 and is scheduled to return to the country January 4.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/03/proskauers-suit-to-safeguard-trade-secrets-highlights-fierce-industry-competition/) Law.com:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Cronan’s order on Dec. 28, nearly identical to Proskauer’s request for relief, requires O’Brien to return files no later than Jan. 5, the day after he’s scheduled to return to the states. That deadline was set in advance of a Jan. 10 hearing on Proskauer’s motion for a preliminary injunction.

“Injunctive relief here will advance the public’s compelling interest in upholding the sanctity of confidential information and other trade secrets and preventing the unauthorized use of such information,” Cronan said at last week’s hearing, according to a transcript of the hearing that was obtained by The American Lawyer.

Although it remains unclear where O’Brien planned to work when he turned in his notice at Proskauer, according to the complaint, O’Brien indicated firm leaders would not be “happy” when they learned of his new employer. But Cronan’s order would also apply to that party:

[T]he temporary restraining order also applies to “anyone acting in concert” with him and it temporarily bars O’Brien from working or consulting for any entities with whom he has discussed or disseminated the allegedly stolen material.

In granting the TRO, Cronan said “the plausible inference is that his next employer will be a competitor of Proskauer Rose and that the defendant would be seeking to use the information he stole during that employment.”

At the TRO hearing, partner Michael Mervis represented the firm and indicated that the alleged stolen documents were internal strategy, financial, and compensation documents. No documents “that would reveal client confidences, attorney-client communications and work product and the like” were compromised.

# Clifford Chance Doesn't Believe In Second Chances

Some firms want to maintain a reputation for supporting the budding lawyers they take on staff. Clifford Chance is not one of them. After falling short on test scores, the only support these students got from the firm was a boot. From [Legal Cheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2024/03/exclusive-clifford-chance-cancels-tc-offers-for-students-who-failed-sqe/):

Magic Circle giant Clifford Chance has revoked the training contract offers of future trainees who recently failed the Solicitors Qualifying Exam (SQE). Legal Cheek understands that the firm contacted around four future trainees to inform them that their TC offers had been rescinded because they failed to pass SQE1 on the first attempt.

It is believed some students missed out by just a few marks. Members of the firm’s HR team apparently delivered the bad news via a phone call last week and…included advice on what students can do next as well as career consultancy support.

There’s no word on if the advice included “delete the firm’s number from your phone,” but that wouldn’t be out of line with closing the door over a few points. Would it really have strained the firm’s pockets to defer the offer and let the students re-take the exam?

Aspiring solicitors should take this as motivation to hit the books a little harder. Life doesn’t always afford redos — Netflix can wait.

We’re nearly midway through summer associate season, and on-campus interviews begin in about a month at law schools across the country for next year’s crop of summer associates. What better time to release Vault’s closely watched rankings for the best summer associate programs?

Hot on the heels of Vault’s rankings of the [most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2020/) and the law firms with the [best quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2020/) comes the career website’s ranking of the best summer associate programs in Biglaw. Junior associates (first- through third-year attorneys) who summered at their current firms were asked to rank their experiences on how much fun the program was and how well it prepared them for life at the firm through six different categories (attorney interactions, substantive assignments, training & mentoring, preparation for associate life, quality of events, and satisfaction with firm-sponsored social opportunities and social interactions). From those ratings, Vault the best summer associate programs in three categories: Attorney Interactions, Career Development, and Social Experiences. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that many of the firms that made the Top 10 list for having the best quality of life made the Top 10 for having the best summer associate program.

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Firms With the Best Summer Associate Programs](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-summer-associate-programs) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2020:

- [O’Melveny & Myers](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/omelveny-myers-llp) (no change)
- [Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe-llp) (+7)
- [Clifford Chance (US)](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/clifford-chance-us-llp) (+5)
- [Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/akin-gump-strauss-hauer-feld-llp) (+11)
- [Crowell & Moring](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/crowell-moring-llp) (-2)
- [Thompson & Knight](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/thompson-knight-llp) (not ranked; first time in Top 10)
- [Choate Hall & Stewart](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/choate-hall-stewart-llp) (+4)
- [Eversheds Sutherland (US)](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/eversheds-sutherland-us-llp) (-6)
- [White & Case](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/white-case-llp) (-3)
- [Williams & Connolly](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/williams-connolly-llp) (+10)
O’Melveny, Orrick, Clifford Chance, and Choate Hall each made appearances in the Top 10 for firms with the best quality of life. Let’s give these firms a round of applause for keeping their attorneys happy from their days as summers through their days as junior associates. (We’re sure their salary raises didn’t hurt, either.)

# Morning Docket: 11.22.17
## * After about two weeks of silence, President Trump has finally spoken out about the sexual misconduct allegations that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is facing. Seeming to indicate support for the accused child molester, the president said, ""Roy Moore denies it. That's all I can say,"" before he ripped into Moore's opponent. [[AL.com](http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/11/trump_on_roy_moore_president_i.html)] * ""Practically every law school in the country is offering more tuition discounts or scholarships than they did pre-2010."" Now is apparently a great time to apply to law school, if only because it'll wind up being cheaper than it's been in years. [[U.S. News](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/paying/articles/2017-11-20/law-schools-shell-out-deep-tuition-discounts-to-students)] * Biglaw is getting in on the green rush in Canada ahead of its nationwide legalization of recreational marijuana. Dentons, Cassels Brock, and Stikeman Elliott each have roles as counsel in a huge cannabis deal in the Great White North. [[Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/21/three-firms-see-green-in-big-cross-border-cannabis-deal/)] * Another federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from banning transgender people from serving in the military, ruling that the ban ""cannot possibly constitute a legitimate governmental interest."" We can't wait to see the president's angry tweets about this. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-transgender/second-u-s-judge-halts-trump-ban-on-transgender-troops-idUSKBN1DL2J6)] * When it comes to parental leave at Biglaw firms, staff members are really getting the short end of the stick. In fact, at some firms, hourly staff members aren't even considered for parental leave benefits.

Roy Moore

* After about two weeks of silence, President Trump has finally spoken out about the sexual misconduct allegations that Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is facing. Seeming to indicate support for the accused child molester, the president said, “Roy Moore denies it. That’s all I can say,” before he ripped into Moore’s opponent. [[AL.com](http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/11/trump_on_roy_moore_president_i.html)]

* “Practically every law school in the country is offering more tuition discounts or scholarships than they did pre-2010.” Now is apparently a great time to apply to law school, if only because it’ll wind up being cheaper than it’s been in years.

* Biglaw is getting in on the green rush in Canada ahead of its nationwide legalization of recreational marijuana. Dentons, Cassels Brock, and Stikeman Elliott each have roles as counsel in a huge cannabis deal in the Great White North.

* Another federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from banning transgender people from serving in the military, ruling that the ban “cannot possibly constitute a legitimate governmental interest.” We can’t wait to see the president’s angry tweets about this. [[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-transgender/second-u-s-judge-halts-trump-ban-on-transgender-troops-idUSKBN1DL2J6)]

* When it comes to parental leave at Biglaw firms, staff members are really getting the short end of the stick. In fact, at some firms, hourly staff members aren’t even considered for parental leave benefits.

# A Warning To Summer Associates
## Enjoy work, while you can.

We are deep into July and for law students hoping to start their career at a Biglaw firm, that means summer associateships.

There’s an old joke — [it’s been making the rounds for more than 30 years](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/14/nyregion/law-associates-find-good-times-must-end.html) — that paints a stark picture of the difference between being a summer associate and being a full-fledged associate.

A popular joke going around New York City law firms this summer tells of an old man who is accidentally sent to hell, only to be surprised by its splendor and tranquility.

Suddenly, he finds himself back on earth, where he commits every possible sin until he is banished to hell again. But this time it is as cruel as he had once imagined and he asks the Devil what happened.

”Oh, you must have been here for our summer associate program,” the Devil responds.
