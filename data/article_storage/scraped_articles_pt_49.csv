[[NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/21/us/supreme-court-investigation.html)] * Three Days of the Counsel-OR. OK that was a stretch, but the Am Law 100 is coalescing around three-day office policies. Even if firms remain divided over what that looks like in practice. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/01/19/3-days-in-the-office-is-the-new-normal-at-am-law-100-firms/)] * Director Doug Liman did a more comprehensive job vetting Brett Kavanaugh than the FBI. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/01/21/brett-kavanaugh-doug-liman-sundance/)] * Government asks to hold Martin Shkreli in contempt.

The conversations are characterized as “way beyond preliminary” by sources who spoke with [Texas Lawbook](http://texaslawbook.net/large-texas-corporate-law-firm-in-merger-talks-with-troutman-sanders//), but “far from a done deal.” Very interesting Biglaw news, though neither firm was willing to confirm the merger talks.

As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/06/05/winstead-and-troutman-sanders-in-merger-talks/) Law.com, Winstead chief executive officer and chairman David Dawson isn’t saying anything specific about Troutman Sanders, but said they do get approached about potential mergers by “a variety of firms, large and small, domestic, international, and we from time-to-time have reached out on our own.” That doesn’t sound like a denial.

Neither does the Troutman Sanders statement about the need to expand the firm’s “geographic footprint”:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

“That includes evaluating potential new U.S. and international offices, to the extent they help meet the goals under our strategic plan. Texas continues to be a market in which we are interested for these reasons,” the firm said.

The firm is definitely serious about their interest in the Lone Star State. As far back as February, they were talking up the need to expand there:

In an interview in February with The Daily Report, Troutman Sanders managing partner Stephen Lewis said [Texas is on the firm’s radar](https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2018/02/23/troutman-sanders-posts-revenue-profit-gains/). “We are willing to go quickly if we find the right group, but we are willing to be patient, too,” he said at the time, noting that the firm also wants a group that is a good cultural fit and a good fit for its practice.

If — and that’s a big if — this merger happens, it won’t be the first Texas merger of 2018. Hunton & Williams and Andrews Kurth merged to create [Hunton Andrews Kurth.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-merger-creates-new-1000-lawyer-firm/) Dallas-based Gardere Wynne Sewell paired up with with Foley & Lardner, forming [Foley Gardere](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/morning-docket-04-02-18/). And another Dallas firm, Strasburger & Price merged with Clark Hill, creating [Clark Hill Strasburger.](http://bit.ly/2JzMCOY)

Of course we’re breaking out the Drudge siren for this!

This afternoon we are pleased to report that [Cravath, Swaine & Moore](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cravath/) — the venerable New York law firm, arguably the biggest and best name in Biglaw — has raised base salaries for its associates. The new CSM salary scale is as follows, with the increase over the current [Simpson Thacher scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/) noted parenthetically:

1st year (class of 2015) – $180,000 ($160,000 + $20,000)
2nd year (class of 2014) – $190,000 ($170,000 + $20,000)
3rd year (class of 2013) – $210,000 ($185,000 +$25,000)
4th year (class of 2012) – $235,000 ($210,000 +$25,000)
5th year (class of 2011) – $260,000 ($230,000 + $30,000)
6th year (class of 2010) – $280,000 ($250,000 + $30,000)
7th year (class of 2009) – $300,000 ($265,000 + $35,000)

The scene outside Worldwide Plaza today?

According to the memorandum, which we received from multiple Cravath sources, “The increase is effective July 1, 2016, and will be reflected in paychecks commencing on July 8, 2016.” The memo is posted in full on the next page. You saw the news and memo here first, folks; PLEASE CREDIT ABOVE THE LAW. Thank you.

The news of a Biglaw pay raise comes as a pleasant surprise to many. Two weeks ago, in a [reader poll](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-if-not-now-when/) asking you to predict when the next pay raise would happen, the most popular response was “later than the second quarter of 2017” (36 percent), and the second-place response was “never” (24 percent). The correct response, “very soon — before the end of the second quarter of 2016,” received a measly six percent of the vote. Biglaw associates, aren’t you happy to be wrong? (Last week, I [suggested](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-190k-what-should-the-new-pay-scale-look-like/) that readers were being overly pessimistic and that the pay hike could come sooner than the first quarter of 2017 — which is why we’ve had a draft version of this post in our system for a while now, just in case.)

The fact that Cravath is leading the charge is less of a surprise. As I [recently wrote](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-who-will-lead-the-charge/), “Personally I’d bet on Cravath. It is still, in the minds of many, the quintessential Biglaw firm, synonymous with profit, power, and prestige.” And in a reader poll in that same story, asking readers who would lead the next round of Biglaw base salary increases, Cravath got 31 percent of the vote, more than any other named firm. (In a [subsequent story](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-an-addendum-on-leverage/) that tossed Quinn Emanuel into the mix, QE got more votes than Cravath, but Cravath still came in second.)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The scale is very logical. It’s not the “NY to 190” scale from the old [ATL comments](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-farewell-to-comments/) meme, but in some ways it makes more sense. It reflects two aspects of what we [discussed last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-190k-what-should-the-new-pay-scale-look-like/) (and what readers voted on as likely features of the new pay scale): a $180,000 starting salary, and pay raises that get larger with seniority (as opposed to a uniform raise across the board), to reward and retain midlevel and senior associates.

One thing to note about the Cravath scale: it ends with eighth-year associates, reflecting Cravath’s commendably short partnership track. It will be interesting to see if other Biglaw firms, especially those with decade-long tracks, do anything differently on base comp for their very senior associates and counsel.

Now let’s tackle some questions that this news raises:

How did this event come to pass? (Besides, of course, Above the Law’s launching its “NY to 190” series of articles [on May 5](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/) — Biglaw associates, you’re welcome.)

Credit goes to both Cravath associates and Cravath partners. Word on the street is that in recent town hall meetings with presiding partner [Allen Parker](https://www.cravath.com/aparker/), CSM associates had the guts to raise the issue of base salaries (which can be awkward to mention to the partners you work for; this is why many associates convey comp concerns through Above the Law).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Associates provided Parker with [arguments and information](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/) in support of an adjustment to the base salary scale. They noted that the last pay raise took place in January 2007, [almost a decade ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1), and the cost of living in New York City, where Cravath has almost all of its lawyers (aside from a small London office), has increased dramatically since January 2007. During this period, the cost of health insurance to associates has grown (at pretty much every firm), and law school tuition and debt burdens have [risen as well](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/everything-thats-wrong-with-legal-education-according-to-law-school-deans/). At the junior levels, some associates were having a hard time making ends meet.

Presumably Allen Parker shared these concerns to the Cravath partnership and the partners decided it was the right thing to do, an investment in the firm’s famously talented and hardworking associates. Based on the timing of the memo, we’re guessing the partnership approved the move at its lunch meeting today. (As we’ve [mentioned before](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/where-are-the-biglaw-bonuses-associate-bonus-watch-day-3/) in the context of bonus timing, the Cravath partnership still has a weekly partnership lunch meeting — a nice tradition, and one that CSM can still maintain because it has fewer than 100 partners, almost all of them in New York.)

Will other firms match the new Cravath scale? Of course! As we know from bonus season, Biglaw dances to Cravath’s tune. CSM’s peer firms, including all the other members of the [“Fab Five”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/where-are-the-biglaw-bonuses-associate-bonus-watch-day-3/) (Davis Polk, Simpson Thacher, Skadden Arps, and Sullivan & Cromwell), will all match in short order. But it will be interesting to see which Am Law 100 firms cry “uncle” at this point and don’t adopt the Cravath scale all the way up the ranks or in all offices. Expect some firms to adopt that $180,000 starting salary, so they can give the impression of keeping up with the Cravathians, but then pull the trick of [salary compression](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/on-growing-forever-when-the-economy-is-not/) (i.e., tiny pay increases for more-senior associates).

How fast will the matching happen? Pretty fast, I’m guessing; I expect at least a half-dozen firms to match before this week is over. Whether the pay raises will spread fast enough to trickle down to 2016 summer associates, who are traditionally paid at the prevailing rate for first-year associates, is an interesting question. The pay raise doesn’t go into effect for full-time associates until July and the memo says nothing about summers, so my guess would be no (and summers already have pretty sweet gigs — even at Cravath, where they work hard compared to summers at other firms).

Will any other firm beat the new Cravath scale? I doubt it. The CSM scale is both generous and sensible, so many firms will just be happy to match. And some firms won’t be all that happy; firms that aren’t doing as well as Cravath will match slowly or grudgingly. (In recent town halls at a fellow Fab Five member, management brushed aside associate inquiries about comp and expressed contentment–on the partners’ part–with current base salary levels. Expect this firm to match but not top Cravath.)

What does this mean for bonuses? The memo says nothing about bonuses. We’re guessing that Cravath will at least keep bonuses [the same as last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2015-associate-bonuses/). In 2007, the last time CSM raised base salaries, it paid [great bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/10/cravath-announces-bonuses-special-and-otherwise/). But that will depend on what kind of 2017 the firm has. So far Cravath has been having an [excellent year](https://www.cravath.com/cravath-in-the-news/), but things could change between now and November or December.

We will, of course, track each and every Cravath match — with your help, of course. When your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Kudos and congrats — to Cravath associates on their raises, and to Cravath partners for doing right by their hardworking junior colleagues.

UPDATE (3:22 p.m.): Cravath is a classy place, but one of our elated sources couldn’t resist dropping the f-bomb: “F**king thrilled that we’re exhibiting leadership in compensation!”

UPDATE (3:29 p.m.): We have reached out to Cravath for comment and will update this post if and when we hear from the firm, of course.

UPDATE (4:10 p.m.): Here’s a question from the reader mailbag:

If firms’ New York offices match Cravath, and the non-NY offices have a policy of matching NYC, do you think those offices would match too? Is there any info about how non-NY offices of NY firms have responded as such in past salary hikes?

Hard to say. After Simpson announced its new pay scale [back in January 2007](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), it took a while for non-NYC offices to adopt the full STB scale. But the current trend, as we’ve seen in so-called [“unified bonus scales,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/associate-bonus-watch-new-york-bonuses-go-to-washington/) is to place less of a priority on geography when it comes to compensation — which makes sense, given that work can be done anywhere in the digital age.

On the other hand, if the Cravath scale is too rich for some firms’ blood, they can easily invoke the “New York is special” excuse. Geography is not an issue for Cravath, which has almost all of its lawyers in the Big Apple, but it is an issue for many other firms.

UPDATE (4:54 p.m.): Here’s additional coverage from the [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/cravath_raises_first_year_associate_pay_to_180k_effective_july_1) (and thanks to them for crediting and linking to us).

UPDATE (6:15 p.m.): And here’s the take of [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/180k-for-a-first-year-associate-thats-what-cravath-is-paying/) (quoting yours truly, among others). Casey Sullivan reached out to various law firm leaders, including John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel, who wrote in an email, “The increases happen periodically.” An uncharacteristically understated response; does Quinn have something up his sleeve?

UPDATE (8:34 p.m.): The dominoes have already started to fall — the first firm has announced that [it’s matching Cravath’s new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/).

UPDATE (6/7/2016, 11:45 p.m.): The pay raise is spreading like wildfire; here’s our [collected coverage of the 2016 salary increase](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/).

Woohoo! Biglaw bonus season is really picking up!

The latest firm to announce their year-end bonus scale is Hogan Lovells, a firm that took in $2,308,401,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 9th on the Am Law 100. As is becoming increasingly common, the firm is matching the enhanced bonus structure revealed by Cravath last week. The bonuses will range from $20,000 to $115,000, depending on seniority.

The year-end bonuses — which, again are on top of[ previously announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/holove-special-bonuses/) special bonuses — will be given out on the following schedule:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
2014 (and senior)	$115,000
2015	$105,000
2016	$90,000
2017	$75,000
2018	$57,500
2019	$30,000
2020	$20,000
According to the memo circulated — the full memo is [available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/holove-bonus-year-end/2/) — bonuses will be paid to “all eligible associates who meet our quality, firm citizenship, and minimum hours expectations.” Plus, where there are “outstanding contributions significantly in excess of expectations” bonuses may be “adjusted upward.”

That’s certainly one way to show the love to hardworking associates.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Is Hustle Worth It In A Legal World That Now Looks Like 2009?
## It’s in our DNA as lawyers. But is that hustle gene always a good thing?

Pop quiz: who is the famous, then infamous, baseball player who had and probably still has the nickname “[Charlie Hustle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#)?” Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds. As Wikipedia explains, the name was originally bestowed upon Rose as a derogatory term, but he embraced it. “During another spring training game against the New York Yankees, Whitey Ford gave him the derisive nickname ‘Charlie Hustle’ after Rose sprinted to first base after drawing a walk. Despite (or perhaps because of) the way Ford intended it, Rose adopted that nickname as a badge of honor.”

We all hustle; I think it’s in our DNA as lawyers. But [is that hustle gene always a good thing](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230417-hustle-culture-is-this-the-end-of-rise-and-grind)?

Given all the concern about mental health, substance abuse, and work-life balance, newer people in the profession may not have the same interest in clawing their way up the Biglaw ladder to maybe get a partnership ring (nonequity or equity?) after many years. Perhaps one reason is that the newbies have seen the sacrifices that we dinosaurs made in our careers, only to find that the purported prize wasn’t worth all the effort and those personal sacrifices. [Think layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/biglaw-associates-are-growing-increasingly-worried-about-layoffs/), being passed over, being impliedly (or expressly) told that you were not good enough.   Junior lawyers see these situations often enough and wonder: Why work so hard? Why chase after something that, in the end, may not be worth the psychic and other prices paid?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As a [recent article in BBC WorkLife](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230417-hustle-culture-is-this-the-end-of-rise-and-grind?xtor=ES-213-%5BBBC%20Features%20Newsletter%5D-2023April28-%5Bbbcfeatures_hustleculture_worklife) pointed out:

The hustle-culture narrative promotes the idea that there’s always more to strive for: more money to make, a bigger title or promotion to secure and a higher ceiling to smash. Although not all entrepreneurs embrace these tropes, some experts say some people have still felt the pressure from the decades-long trickle-down effect of total immersion in work, often to the detriment of other facets of their lives.

We see this detriment all around us. It used to be “rise and shine,” but as the article points out, it has become “rise and grind.” And I don’t mean the alluring aroma of freshly ground beans that your favorite barista uses. We boast about our availability 24/7, but are we really that available? Should we be that available? I know, the excuse is that if you are not available, someone else is drooling to take up that slack. We pride ourselves in overworking, considering it a badge of honor as we ascend whatever ladder we think will lead us to wherever we think we want to go. But here’s my question: are you a commodity or a person?

Over the past several years, peeps have hit the “pause” button on the hustle code, working remotely or on a hybrid basis and realizing that face time may not be much more than an app on an iPhone. The calls (I won’t say “clarion”) by employers to cudgel employees to return to the office are more of a stick than a carrot.

Linking bonuses to attendance is akin to what we dinosaurs derisively referred to as “bed check.” In those days, no one came out and said that a part of your performance evaluation was attendance, being in your places with bright shiny faces. It was subtler then. Now, it’s more of the “velvet hammer” approach, or even no velvet at all. It’s an edict, a command, and very few, if any, lawyers respond well to such commands, except from judicial officers, and sometimes not even then.

So, with one Biglaw firm, it seems like it’s now [bonus (literally) points for attendance](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/simpson-thacher-bonus-attendance/), or at least that’s how it seems. It’s not “pay to play,” but “bonus for being there.”

And another Biglaw firm has decreed those attorneys in its litigation practice group “[physically attend the office on three set office days each week](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/morgan-lewis-office-attendance/), after initially requiring only one or two office days per week.” Note the use of the word “set,” as in “carved in stone.” Attorneys are purportedly professionals and thus traditionally have been allowed to act as such. It was perfectly okay to act like a professional during COVID-19, but now, not so much.

And it appears that [deferrals of incoming classes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/biglaw-deferral-praised/), which was such a thing during the “Great Recession” of 2009-2010, may be staging a comeback. Just what newbies needed to hear.

For some newbies, deferrals may be how to figure out whether Biglaw is all that it’s cracked up to be, especially when they are seeing no loyalty at the outset, other than a stipend and maybe a promise of health insurance. Is it a preview of how these firms act when there’s a downturn and their unwillingness to tighten their own belts even just a little to help the newbies get a toehold? And please don’t tell me that belts can’t be tightened. Managers manage; leaders lead and often by example.

What about [reducing office space](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/biglaw-lawyers-must-return-to-the-office-to-justify-managements-reckless-office-space-leases/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=258683701&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RYWIpEB7inlqhaD0a9hhm9SlOKEPM32R0GC6obVndslnC3-kw5_WQXqUdkDhhnpylP8-fnbrYALLltBeJ0pRzGKURkQ&utm_content=258683701&utm_source=hs_email) instead of mandating return to work? Silly question.

Renting out whole floors of unneeded office space is now a thing, at least here. Law firm eyes were bigger than their stomachs and overestimated their office space needs. Impressing clients with huge office spaces and conference rooms the size of bowling alleys are relics of a bygone era. Clients were not impressed; only the lawyers were.

Our profession is composed of hundreds of thousands of lawyers who are not in Biglaw and who think that Biglaw is not the be-all and end-all of how and where to practice law. Just look around you and take heart that there are many ways to practice, at least until AI takes our jobs. However, that day may be sooner than we think.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# The Great (Law Firm) Resignation: How To Resign (Part I)
## How to prepare for and execute a smooth resignation, while managing the emotions accompanying this process.

We’ve all heard a lot this year about “The Great Resignation.” As is the case in many industries, law firms are contending with an unusual volume of resignations. In our role as recruiters, we at Lateral Link have a front row seat into both the mechanics of the resignation process and also the emotional angst that it sometimes entails. From uncertainty over the decision to resign to a lack of knowledge of how to give notice in a professional manner to anxiety over how to respond to a counter-offer, lawyers who are considering leaving their jobs have a lot on their mind.

This week we’re taking a look at some of these issues, in two parts. Today we address how to prepare for and execute a smooth resignation, while managing the emotions accompanying this process. On Thursday, we will discuss counter-offers.

Managing doubts about the decision to leave

For some people, the decision to resign is an easy one, but others really struggle with it. Perhaps it’s fear of the unknown, fear of burning bridges or disappointing people, or self-doubt about one’s ability to succeed elsewhere. If you experience this anxiety, keep in mind that it’s normal, and it doesn’t mean you’re making a bad decision. At the end of the day, you have to trust your gut. You’ve weighed the pros and cons and made a thoughtful determination about what’s best for you and your career. Be confident and comfortable in this choice and know that you are doing the right thing, even if the process isn’t a fun one.

Resigning is like ripping off a band aid — the fear is generally worse than the act itself. Nine times out of ten, your manager is an experienced professional and will have been in this situation before, so it will only be awkward if you make it that way. If you commit to leaving in the most professional and ethical way possible, the knowledge that you’re going about the process in the right way should help to calm your nerves.

Timing your resignation

Start by getting your ducks in a row prior to resigning. Do your best to tie up loose ends and stay on top of your workload to avoid a scramble when your last day comes.

Try to arrange it so that immediately before resigning, you have time to do whatever it is that helps you de-stress: meditation, deep breaths, exercise, or yoga can set you in the right frame of mind. Give notice first thing in the morning when your mind is clear, stress level is lower, and your boss is more likely to be around. If you wait until the end of the day, you may find your boss is distracted or busy with other matters.

Give at least two-weeks’ notice. Not offering any notice at all is completely unprofessional. Even if you think your employer will want you to leave immediately, it is customary to at least offer to stay on for two weeks to help transition your matters. Once you resign, leave promptly after your notice period ends. Each of us is fungible, so there is no good reason to stick around for an extra week or two.

Who to tell?

You should resign to just one person, preferably your direct supervisor or department head — even if you don’t like that person. There’s no need to reach out to several members of management, and you shouldn’t tip off your resignation to other colleagues beforehand.

Resign in person (or if necessary, via video). Don’t resign by e-mail, voice mail, or letter (unless a written resignation is also required). You must put your big kid pants on and summon up the courage to resign face-to-face.

What to say?

Keep it simple: “Karen, I want to let you know that I will be leaving Adam & Brown to join Cox & Smith. This was a very difficult decision to make. I’ve had a good experience here but I believe this is the right decision for me at this point in my career. I hope we can stay in touch.” Leave it at that.

You should be prepared for any reaction. Your boss may be supportive and collegial, cool and dismissive, skeptical, angry, or disinterested. Questions may range from “where are you going?” to “why are you leaving?” to “why didn’t you tell me you were unhappy?” Whatever the reaction, don’t take it personally. Be mindful that your boss has other matters to tend to besides your career plans.

Whatever you do, resist the urge to “send a message” with a proverbial mic drop. You can’t control your employer’s reaction, but you can control how you comport yourself. Don’t be petty or childish — keep things mature, professional, and courteous. Realize that you are likely to cross paths with these people again in the future. Passive-aggressive (or in some cases, just plain aggressive) actions may give you short-term satisfaction, but there’s a good chance you will regret them later. There is no upside to criticizing colleagues or the experience you’ve had. Take the high road and be complimentary — even if you don’t mean it.

What to do after you have given notice

Just as you should approach the resignation conversation professionally, you should behave in a professional manner during your notice period. Don’t gossip with colleagues who stop by for the blow by blow. Tell them you’d be pleased to stay in touch after you leave. Wind down, transition your matters, and move on.

Be sure to follow your firm’s guidelines on resignation and departure. Don’t be cute about files, forms, hard drive contents or anything else — it’s not worth the risk.

***

What if your firm tries to convince you to reconsider and makes you a counter-offer? How should you think through a potential decision to reverse course? We’ll talk about that in Part II of this series.

Last month, allegations of inappropriate behavior were made against a partner at megafirm Dentons. In response, the firm conducted an investigation and suspended the partner while it was ongoing. The allegations against the unnamed partner were for incidents that occurred while he was a partner at Scottish firm Maclay Murray & Spens. Maclay Murray merged with Dentons in July.

The investigation began in January, and now the firm has announced the partner in question is no longer at the firm. As Legal Week [reports](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2018/02/09/dentons-ousts-partner-after-investigation-into-inappropriate-behaviour-claims/), a spokesperson said they “found no evidence of sexual harassment” but that the “behaviour of the partner concerned fell well below the expectations that we have of our partners.” The spokesperson went on to add:

Last month we became aware that reports of inappropriate behaviour were made against a Maclay Murray & Spens (MMS) partner about 15 months ago, more than a year before MMS’s merger with Dentons. Immediately upon becoming aware of these reports, we launched an internal investigation and placed the partner on a leave of absence […] We can confirm that he has now left the firm.

It’s also reported that the employee who made the allegations against the partner is still at the firm.

This incident comes shortly after a partner at Baker McKenzie [left the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-under-investigation-for-failing-to-disclose-partners-alleged-sexual-assault-to-regulators/) after being sanctioned following a [sexual harassment investigation.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-admits-to-sanctioning-partner-after-sexual-harassment-investigation/) This seems to be part of a trend of finally recognizing the sexual harassment and assault that happens in Biglaw. The [legal profession does not insulate](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/metoo-no-a-law-degree-doesnt-insulate-you-from-sexual-harassment/) women from harassment, but too ofter fear of professional reprisals have kept the allegations solely within the whisper network.

Now we are seeing more people come forward with the troubling, inappropriate behavior that’s been allowed to[ fester at firms](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/). Reports, like this, of firms acting quickly and decisively when confronted with allegations only helps foster a profession where employees are comfortable reporting harassing behavior. That’s an essential step forward, because as any woman who has worked at a Biglaw firm knows, the prevailing [silence](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/are-lawyers-perpetuating-a-culture-of-silence-surrounding-sexual-assault/) isn’t cutting it.

We know that despite the turmoil of COVID, Biglaw has done pretty well for itself over they last few years, see, e.g., the [fire lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/). But we haven’t quantified just how good 2021 was. Enter the Am Law 100.

The [latest ranking](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/) from ALM takes the top 100 Biglaw firms and ranks them by gross revenue. The highlights from the report reveal there were a TON of Biglaw firms raking in the dough in 2021. Indeed, every — that’s right, ALL OF THE FIRMS — on the Am Law 100 had an increase in gross revenue in 2021 over 2020.

Plus, an impressive 52(!) Biglaw firms crossed over into the billion-dollar club, meaning they took in over a billion dollars in gross revenue in 2021. That is… a lot of firms. Here are those firms, in order of gross revenue:

For the [fifth year in a row](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/05/kirkland-with-6b-in-revenue-poised-to-remain-on-top-of-am-law-rankings/), Kirkland has stayed on top of the gross revenue mountain — taking in over $6 billion. In the number two spot, Latham made $5.4 billion in gross revenue. Overall, the top 100’s revenue went up 14.8 percent this year. Revenue per lawyer was up 12.5 percent (the top firm[ by that metric](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-lawyer/), by a healthy margin, is Wachtell) and profits per equity partner were up 19.4 percent (Wachtell also took the top spot in[ the PPEP ranks](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/04/26/the-2022-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-equity-partner/)).

We will undoubtedly have even more to say as we dig into these numbers. But what’s clear is Biglaw had a very good year. Let’s see if they can keep it up.

# Jones Day Hit With Explosive Gender Discrimination Case
## The complaint takes aim at all things Jones Day: from the compensation black box, to Trump support, to their ""fraternity"" culture.

Jones Day has been hit with a gender discrimination lawsuit, filed by a former hiring partner, alleging the Biglaw firm acts as a “fraternity” and their infamous “black box” compensation system is used to pay women attorneys less than their male counterparts. The plaintiff, Wendy Moore, filed a representative lawsuit today in California Superior Court in San Francisco under the California Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violations of the California Equal Pay Act, as amended by the Fair Pay Act of 2015, and for violations of the California Labor Code.

The complaint alleges that male partners at the firm actively assist male associates “climb[] the ranks to partnership” while “[f]emale attorneys are treated as second-class citizens. They are not, nor can they be, full members in the fraternity.” The firm’s black box compensation model — which has gotten[ a lot of attention](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/?rf=1) from Above the Law — also plays an important role in the complaint.

See, unlike the majority of the Biglaw market which operates in[ lockstep fashion for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2018-associate-salary-increase/) and via formula for partners, Jones Day believes everyone is a special goddamned snowflake, which means, after their first year, everyone gets individualized compensation. The whole thing is also supposed to be kept a big ole secret, and nobody knows what anyone else makes (at both the associate and partner level). The firm claims this [“closed comp”](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/) or [“black box”](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/inside-straight-analyzing-black-box-compensation/) system breeds congeniality, but well, we here at Above the Law know the truth — it sows the seeds of frustration. And according to the complaint, it also acts as a cover for a gender pay gap:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Jones Day’s fraternity system extends to its compensation scheme: a “black box” compensation structure that all but ensures that female attorneys are paid less than their male counterparts. For example, when a male sixth-year associate recently joined the Trump administration, his federally mandated disclosures revealed that in 2015 he had been compensated $810,000. This sum approximately equaled Ms. Moore’s compensation as an eighth-year partner (and was well above her starting salary of $740,000 when she joined Jones Day as a sixth-year partner in 2013). For much of its existence, Jones Day has ensured that these disparities continue unabated by forbidding attorneys from discussing their compensation. Jones Day has enforced this policy by retaliating against female attorneys who have sought to address—or even openly discuss—disparities in compensation.

The subjective performance review system at Jones Day facilitates and exacerbates the gender disparity in pay by providing cover for male partners to ensure that male associates receive top compensation. That this performance review system ensures male associates at Jones Day receive the highest compensation was in fact confirmed for Ms. Moore during a conversation with Jones Day’s Northern California Partner-in-Charge David C. Kiernan.

Only in the last few months has the Firm edited its written guidelines to comply with California law. Now, instead of saying outright that associates are forbidden to discuss their pay, the Firm’s guidelines merely say that they are strongly discouraged from doing so. In person, however, and at every opportunity—from performance reviews to conversations about pay— partners reiterate the true message: Pay at Jones Day is and must remain confidential, even between partners.

It gets even more outrageous, as the complaint goes on to allege that when Moore complained about the pay gap under the California Labor Code and the California Equal Pay Act she was promptly fired by the firm — just six days later. When she was terminated the complaint alleges there were severe financial consequences: the firm refused to return $337,500 of capital; withheld more than $200,000 in previously-earned compensation; and most astoundingly, on the very day that Moore was terminated, Jones Day paid $43,000 as part of a regularly scheduled payment for work completed but the firm turned around and revoked and refunded the payment.

Moore’s attorney, David Sanford, who has made[ a name for himself](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/david-sanford/) suing Biglaw firms over gender discrimination, said:

“Jones Day’s message in terminating Wendy could not be clearer,” said David Sanford, “Ms. Moore was punished soon after she summoned the courage to speak out against gender discrimination and demand the same pay that her male peers received.”

The complaint also alleges that while men at the firm bond over sporting events, women were forced to participate in degrading events that even firm clients complained about:

For example, in 2013 and 2014, Ms. Moore was required to help organize and to participate in an event called “Women’s Spa Day,” in which male partners invited their female clients to a spa. During the event, Ms. Moore and other female partners were expected to disrobe in front of the clients and to serve as “hostesses.” The Firm’s all-male business development committee chose to host this event year after year, over the repeated oral and written objections of Ms. Moore and other female partners. These female partners repeatedly notified the Firm of the event’s degrading nature and relayed direct and unambiguous feedback from female general counsel that the Firm’s clients found the event inappropriate, gender-stereotypical, and offensive.

The complaint further alleges that Jones Day’s…. [full throated support of the president](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/jones-day-advertising-its-trump-admin-ties-because-they-have-no-shame/) also led to issues. Specifically, the complaint says that in her role as hiring partner, Moore dealt with “female law students [that] were unambiguously stating in their interviews with Jones Day that the Firm’s express support for Mr. Trump and its black-box compensation model left female attorneys behind.”  Moore informed the Firm that “women did not want to risk the adverse impact on their careers by joining a Firm that proudly supported Mr. Trump and black-box compensation.” The firm’s response? The complaint alleges Sharyl Reisman, the Firmwide Chair of Recruiting and a member of the Firm’s Diversity & Inclusion Task Force, told Moore to “tone down her criticism, lest she provoke a negative response from Firm management.”

We’ve reached out to Jones Day for comment, and will update the story if they have a statement.

# What Does 'Flexibility' Mean At Your Biglaw Firm? In True Lawyer Fashion, It Depends
## Its meaning seems to change based on how much control the firm wants to exert over its attorneys.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

For one firm, it could mean three days in, two days out. To another, it means four in, one out. Or, if you’re at three days [in the office], you pick the two days, but one day is going to be an anchor day, and it’s the day that everyone on the list needs to come to the office. I’m starting to hear ‘flexibility’ along with just being thoughtful about — how do you become a bit more rigid about mandating people to come in?

— Joe McSpadden, senior vice president of the Americas arm of Williams Lea, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/08/14/in-big-law-flexibility-is-a-word-for-all-seasons/) on the meaning of remote “flexibility” for employees during a time when Biglaw firms are [mandating office attendance](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/office-attendance-mandates/) up to four days each week, and at some firms, compliance (or the lack thereof) may affect associates’ year-end bonus payouts.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# 5 Hot Practice Areas In A Biden Administration
## Plus Lateral Link's 2021 promotions -- congratulations to all!

President Joe Biden (public domain).

The replacement of the Trump Administration by the Biden Administration will bring changes to countless areas of American life, including the legal sector. Here are a few practice areas that we at Lateral Link expect to heat up over the next few years. (Thanks to my colleague Gloria Sandrino, who previously shared her thoughts on this topic with [Law360](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1345871/how-law-firms-are-hiring-to-adapt-to-a-biden-presidency), for her help in putting this list together.)

1. White-collar, investigations, and enforcement work. White-collar prosecutions fell to a [record low](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/trump-pardons.html) under President Donald Trump. Over the past two years, I’ve spoken to numerous white-collar and investigations lawyers who have had to turn to civil and commercial litigation to keep themselves busy. Law firm hiring out of government also slowed significantly; with firms struggling to keep their current white-collar lawyers busy, their appetite for former prosecutors dropped significantly.

Many industry observers expect this to change under the Biden Administration. We’ve been meeting with firms right now to discuss their talent needs for the year, and many of them expect a [significant increase](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/white-collar-crime-probes-likely-to-intensify-under-bidens-doj) in SEC, DOJ, and congressional investigations. Widely reported fraud related to the Paycheck Protection Program and other pandemic relief efforts is already starting to generate work, and with the change to a Democratic administration, also look for an increase in traditional white-collar work, such as Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigations and prosecutions.

2. Banking and financial regulation. Related to the anticipated uptick in white-collar expect, expect an increase in banking and financial regulatory work as well. In particular, look for the new administration to reinvigorate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) — and create work for lawyers and law firms that specialize in consumer finance regulatory matters.

3. Environmental. Even though he has been in office for just a few weeks, President Biden has already made clear that protecting the environment will be a priority for his administration, with an especially strong focus on addressing the climate change crisis. According to this [overview from Hogan Lovells](https://www.engage.hoganlovells.com/knowledgeservices/viewContent.action?key=Ec8teaJ9VaoddLP5vd3CmcxgHJMKLFEppVpbbVX%2B3OXcP3PYxlq7sZUjdbSm5FIetvAtgf1eVU8%3D&nav=FRbANEucS95NMLRN47z%2BeeOgEFCt8EGQ0qFfoEM4UR4%3D&emailtofriendview=true&freeviewlink=true), look for the Biden Administration to “seek to undo many of the deregulatory actions of the Trump administration… [and] to strengthen environmental protections by adopting new standards, revising existing standards, and increasing enforcement.” The upshot: more work for environmental lawyers, especially those who advise companies trying to keep up with the new standards and to respond to investigations and enforcement actions.

4. Labor and employment. As noted in this [analysis by Littler Mendelson](https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/what-expect-labor-and-employment-law-under-biden-administration), the close divide in the House of Representatives will limit President Biden’s ability to enact much of his agenda. But we can still expect significant changes, including changes that can be made through administrative action.

If it’s passed by Congress, President Biden’s proposed COVID-19 stimulus plan includes a number of L&E-related provisions, including extension of unemployment insurance benefits, renewal of emergency paid sick and family medical leave mandates from prior coronavirus relief packages, authorization of OSHA to develop a national COVID-19 protection standard, and an increase in the minimum wage to $15 nationwide. Companies will need legal help to respond to any number of these changes.

5. Private equity and venture capital. On the transactional side, private equity and venture capital should continue to be active areas, but with a shift in emphasis to focus on the healthcare and environmental sectors. Investment in the healthcare and life sciences space should remain robust, as the nation continues to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and its after effects, and investment in the environmental space could see a boost from President Biden’s plan to invest $2 trillion in clean energy and sustainable infrastructure, which would be a boon for the cleantech startup ecosystem. This will also generate lots of work for project finance lawyers, especially those who focus on cleantech and renewable energy.

These are just some of the sectors that could see significant growth over the next few years. Others include state attorneys general, antitrust, and healthcare practices. A change in administration often means changes in the law, and changes in the law are good news for lawyers and law firms.

If you’re thinking about what you can do with your career to take advantage of these developments, please feel free to reach out [to me](https://www.laterallink.com/team/david-lat/) or any of [my colleagues](https://www.laterallink.com/team/) to explore your options. This is an exciting time — not just for the country, but for lawyers and the legal profession — and you don’t want to miss out on any opportunities

Here at Lateral Link, we also have some exciting news of our own for the new year: promotions.

# Stroock Suffers High-Profile Departure As Judge Shira Schiendlin Heads To Boies Schiller Amid Merger Talks
## The former federal judge did not have the urge to merge, citing too many conflicts.

When we last checked in with Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, the firm had recently signed a non-exclusive [letter of intent to merge with Pillsbury Winthrop](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/stroock-is-talking-to-another-am-law-100-firm-about-merging-but-its-not-exclusive/). Unfortunately, the news of yet another prospective merger — recall that its [would-be merger with Nixon Peabody was called off](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-merger-effort-crumbles/) late this past summer — hasn’t stopped lawyers from leaving the firm. The firm’s most recent departure was perhaps its most high-profile departure yet.

This morning, Boies Schiller & Flexner announced that Judge [Shira Scheindlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shira_Scheindlin), formerly of the Southern District of New York, would be joining the firm as of counsel, leaving Stroock after working there for seven years. The [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/29/citing-conflicts-as-merger-looms-former-sdny-judge-leaves-stroock-for-boies-schiller/) has additional details:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In an interview, Scheindlin said she had been “very happy” at Stroock, but was already having to decline nearly a third of incoming inquiries due to conflicts with the Big Law firm’s numerous institutional clients. “I know their intention is to merge with a bigger firm, so that would just increase the number of institutional clients and the number of conflicts, which would not be good for me,” she said.

In contrast, Boies Schiller’s exclusive focus on litigation presented fewer conflicts and an opportunity to contribute to investigations, mock trial work and criminal defense work, Scheindlin said. “It was an opportunity that couldn’t be missed,” said Scheindlin. “That means this is the right firm for me at the right time.”

[Matthew L. Schwartz](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/matthew-l-schwartz.html), Boies Schiller’s managing partner, offered the following statement on the firm’s new hire: “We are thrilled to bring a jurist with Judge Scheindlin’s wisdom, litigation skills, and breadth of knowledge to Boies Schiller. Her experience will be invaluable to our existing clients on a wide range of cases – particularly trials and criminal matters – and we look forward to increasing her practice as a leading neutral, as well.” As noted by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/judge-scheindlin-jumps-to-boies-schiller-as-stroock-mulls-merger), Schwartz clerked for Scheindlin after graduating from law school, so this is an interesting reunion for the pair, where he’ll serve as boss to his former boss.

Congratulations to Judge Scheindlin on her new role at Boies, and best of luck to Stroock as the firm attempts to hold onto as many attorneys as it can while its merger talks progress with Pillsbury.

# Single Office Firm Matches Salary Scale
## More good news.

Choate Hall seems to always find its way on those “great places to work for” lists. Perhaps it’s the one-office outlook that places all the value on the people working right next door. Or maybe staying close to less of a pressure cooker market. Though it might also be a willingness to pay at the top of the Biglaw scale despite staying a tad smaller than its competition.

Hanging out in the high second hundred of the Am Law 200, Choate only boasts around $274,746,000 in revenue, but that’s a deceiving figure. The one-office firm also nets $3,243,000 in profits per partner and has a revenue per lawyer figure north of $1.6 million. Those are numbers the upper crust of the Am Law 50 would take.

We don’t have a memo for Choate, but tipsters have reported a full match of the new scale.

(UPDATE: We’ve now received word that the scale goes up to $375K. We’ve updated the table accordingly)

2014	$350,000
2013	$365,000
2012	$375,000
Congrats to all.

# Biglaw Partners May Yet Be People Employees

Kerrie Campbell

Buckle up kids — there’s a new development in the $100 million class-action case brought by former Chadbourne & Parke partner [Kerrie Campbell](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kerrie-campbell/) against the Biglaw firm [hoping to merge](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-firm-losing-attorneys-as-it-preps-for-merger/) with Norton Rose Fulbright. You may remember Campbell — joined as lead plaintiff by two other former partners [Jaroslawa Zelinsky Johnson](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-pay-discrimination-case-adds-a-new-plaintiff/) and [Mary Yelnick](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/3rd-former-partner-files-suit-against-chadbourne-over-unequal-pay/) —  was[ booted from the partnership](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/chadbourne-kicks-out-partner-suing-them-over-gender-discrimination/) just a few months ago. Despite the personal setback that likely was, there is good news for her today.

Some of the bigger issues surrounding the class-action lawsuit brought by Campbell against Chadbourne were the Biglaw firm’s motions for summary judgment and to dismiss class- and collective-action claims. At the heart of the disputes is the notion that partners of law firms, by virtue of the partnership agreements and being part owners of the firm, [are not properly considered employees](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-firm-claims-partners-are-not-employees/) as defined by employment discrimination statutes. Those motions have been set aside — for the moment — along with plaintiff’s motion to dismiss the counterclaims against her and to certify a conditional class under the Equal Pay Act. As Law.com [reports](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202789854949/Judge-Keeps-100M-Chadbourne-Gender-Bias-Case-Alive-Proskauer-Looks-to-Escape), District Judge J. Paul Oetken has decided he’d like some discovery before ruling on the motions:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Concluding that it’s too early to answer that question, Oetken denied the competing motions and ordered “limited” discovery to determine if the three former Chadbourne partners deserve protection under employment laws, or if their former status as partial owners of the firm disqualifies them from bringing the suit. The judge said he would allow the two sides to renew most of their motions after the discovery period.

Obviously, this is far from a killing blow for either side. But Chadbourne now has to go through the expense and time of discovery before the issue can be cleared up, though in a statement they are still “confident that after such discovery the court will find that the plaintiffs are not employees under the law, and that their claims should be dismissed.” The plaintiffs, who likely bear a smaller discovery burden, are taking it as a much larger victory. David Sanford, of Sanford Heisler Sharp, and lead counsel for the Chadbourne plaintiffs released this statement:

Today’s ruling makes clear that law firms aren’t insulated from liability simply because their employees bear the title of “partner” or have signed a “partnership agreement.” Discovery will establish that law firm partners are entitled to the full protections of this country’s laws against discrimination and retaliation.

But the real winners are those of us who have been following the case closely, eager for that sweet, sweet Biglaw gossip.

# Smaller Law Firms Should Have Associates' Retreats Too
## Getting to know attorneys who work at different offices can help build interoffice connections.

Many larger law firms have associates’ retreats — or used to before the COVID-19 pandemic made large gatherings impractical. At associates’ retreats, many or all of a law firm’s associates gather in one place and undergo trainings, socialize, and connect themselves to their law firm and the other people who worked at a shop. For whatever reason, most smaller law firms do not have associates’ retreats like in the world of Biglaw. However, associates’ retreats can be a great experience for associates and can have a number of positive impacts on a firm.

I went to associates’ retreats at both of the larger firms I worked at before starting my own practice. While an associate at a Biglaw shop, I went to two associates’ retreats organized by the firm. One was just for newly hired associates, and the firm flew all of their first-years to their headquarters in order to conduct a few days of training. This was a great time to learn about firm practices, procedures, and begin the onboarding process at that shop.

That firm also had an annual associates’ retreat for all of the associates at the shop. The firm flew in dozens, if not hundreds, of associates from all over the country and the world to attend. It was amazing to get to know attorneys who worked at different offices, and this helped build interoffice connections that were important to completing certain projects. Moreover, this event helped associates complete their CLE credits, which was always a help.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

I later worked at a smaller firm that still had several hundred associates throughout the country. This firm had associates’ retreats every other year, and the retreat happened over the weekend, which was frustrating because this took personal time away from the associates, but it was still good to score a free trip. This retreat was a great way for associates to meet people who worked in different offices and to build social connections with people who worked in the same office.

Although associates’ retreats can impact the ability of associates to bill hours and can be costly, such events have a number of benefits. Perhaps most importantly, such retreats connect associates with people who work in different offices and connects people with the firm for which they work. The current workplace is very fluid, and people move to different jobs far more frequently than they did in prior generations. People may have less of an attachment to a given firm if their only experience with a firm is going to work every day. However, having fun social experience with people who work at a shop in different offices can go a long way toward building the fabric of a firm.

Moreover, social connections forged during such retreats can help associates complete projects with attorneys who work in different offices. It is common for different offices to share tasks on projects, either because a certain practice area is needed to complete the work or because a small office lacks the headcount to complete larger assignments. If people remember meeting an associate in another office at a retreat, it can be much easier for associates to share projects and complete work. There are a number of other benefits to associates’ retreats: blowing off steam, learning material at trainings, and other advantages.

None of the smaller firms at which I worked conducted associates’ retreats, and such events are not common outside of Biglaw. There are likely a few reasons for this. Perhaps most importantly, associates’ retreats can be costly, and smaller firms might not have the financial cushion available to organize them. Moreover, attending an associates’ retreat can keep associates away from billing, and smaller law firms might have smaller financial margins that require the associates to bill as much as possible. Moreover, some smaller firms do not have multiple offices, and there is no reason for associates to go on a retreat since everyone knows each other pretty well by virtue of the office size.

However, smaller firms should consider having associates’ retreats if they can afford to and if it makes practical sense. Firstly, all of the benefits of associates’ retreats at Biglaw firms can be realized by smaller firms since associates who attend a retreat may become more bonded to the shop and the people with whom they work. Moreover, associates’ retreats at smaller firms can potentially have a bigger impact than at larger shops since training and other events can be tailored to a smaller audience of associates. Furthermore, associates’ retreats at smaller firms, even if they are not on the same scale as retreats at larger shops can help associates unwind and break the monotony of practicing law that many of us encounter.

In the end, smaller law firms may not have the financial resources to organize associates’ retreats, and sometimes, it is just not practical to hold such events. However, more law firms should consider organizing associates’ retreats when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides in order to realize all of the benefits such events can have.

# Lawyers+AI Equals 4 Growth Stages That Change Legal Practice Forever
## When lawyers and AI join forces, they form an unstoppable team.

The growing partnership between AI and lawyers ushers in a new era of enhanced capabilities and efficiencies. Think of lawyers as experienced mountaineers, skillfully navigating treacherous legal terrain, adept at identifying pitfalls, and charting an ethical course toward favorable outcomes. AI is like a cutting-edge GPS device, providing detailed maps, real-time guidance, and warnings of potential obstacles along the way.

AI boosts lawyers’ analytical skills, while legal professionals provide essential human qualities like sound judgment, ethical practices, and legal expertise. This collaborative partnership changes legal work forever as it progresses through four growth stages.

1. Creating A Balanced Foundation

Legal professionals are most commonly at the initial stage of AI adoption, using AI-backed tools for legal research, contract review and analysis, and document creation. According to a few surveys, nearly three in four lawyers expect to integrate generative AI into their legal work in the coming year.

AI needs your guidance to provide the most relevant results. You must tweak AI prompts and continually refine AI-generated outputs. And you cannot rely solely on AI’s results without thoroughly reviewing and verifying their accuracy. 

It’s a balanced, foundational relationship. You understand legal intricacies and craft strategies to overcome challenges. AI excels at analyzing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and trends, and providing insights that would otherwise remain hidden. 

2. Enhancing Legal Specialization

Lawyers can customize AI tools to suit their practice areas, such as corporate law, employment law, or intellectual property. Training AI models with data specific to a legal practice area or industry helps ensure AI outputs are more accurate and relevant to client needs.

Your role now is to help train AI models, ensuring data includes specific terminology, case law, and relevant regulations. You must also dissect and explain complex legal labyrinths to help AI understand the stakes.  

You are a strategic interpreter, ensuring AI systems adhere to facts, legal principles, and ethical considerations. AI, in turn, enhances your capabilities with real-time legal updates, early issue detection, personalized client services, and more. 

3. Guiding AI Expertise 

AI systems can tackle sophisticated challenges, including predicting litigation outcomes and analyzing complex contractual arrangements. To do this, AI systems employ multiple AI models to coordinate advanced workflows and analyze large data sets. 

Your role is to design and oversee AI-driven workflows, from selecting appropriate AI models to ensuring outputs are accurate, relevant, and ethically sound. 

You become an AI navigator, bridging the gap between AI’s analytical prowess and the complexities of the law. You interpret and contextualize AI’s findings within a legal framework. AI learns to grasp the intent behind legal documents, the nuances of legal reasoning, and the ethical implications of legal decisions. 

Together, you enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of legal practice and safeguard the legal system’s integrity.

4. Empowering The Enterprise

As AI becomes integral to law firms and legal departments, its use extends across practice areas, uniting fields such as mergers and acquisitions and intellectual property rights. This integration further streamlines operations to deliver even more comprehensive legal insights and enhances client service.

You set the strategic direction for the enterprise-wide application of AI. This involves identifying where AI can create the most value. You are also an ethical guardian overseeing AI’s impact on client interactions and ensuring its use meets ethical standards. From start to finish, legal decisions always rest solely with you. 

You provide AI with context and guidance and ensure stakeholders use AI insights responsibly and ethically. AI significantly enhances legal practice’s efficiency and effectiveness and elevates legal services’ quality. 

When lawyers and AI join forces, they form an unstoppable team. It is a balanced partnership that will help us build a future where justice is served with greater speed, precision, and fairness.

# The 2021 Biglaw Diversity Scorecard
## In a pandemic year marked by calls for racial justice, there's been progress for diversity -- but not much.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to recruit, retain, and promote more minority attorneys. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve the stature of their diverse hires in the law, there is still much more to be done, even after a year where the importance of diversity and racial justice took center stage and was brought to the attention of everyone across the country, if not the world at large. If there’s ever going to be any real change in the legal industry, diversity has to be more than just a buzzword — it must be a priority at every law firm.

According to the American Lawyer’s 2021 Diversity Scorecard — a ranking that tracks the average number of full-time-equivalent minority attorneys (both partners and nonpartners) at Am Law 200 and National Law Journal 250 law firms — there has been some progress over the past year, but it’s been slight:

The total number of minority attorneys rose to 18.5%, up from 17.8% last year and 16.9% in 2019. The number of minority partners also climbed, reaching 10.9%, up from 10.3% in 2020, and the percentage of minority nonpartners hit 24.6%, up from 23.7% in 2020.

Some attribute this continued progress to a maturing system of diversity and inclusion at law firms, while others have said the Black Lives Matter movement and the galvanizing effects of George Floyd’s murder and the ensuing wave of national protests pushed D&I to the forefront at firms. Both likely played a role in avoiding the setbacks of the last crisis [when firms shed 6% of all attorneys and 9% of minority attorneys between 2008 and 2009].

The firm that took top honors this year — Berry Appleman & Leiden — retained its position as the nation’s most diverse firm, but the top five firms changed once again this year. Overall, firms surveyed were able to raise their average score on the scorecard by 3.41 points, a 13% increase over their 2020 average of 24.71.

Berry Appleman & Leiden was the top firm by score again in this year’s ranking, having taken the top spot as a new entrant in 2020. The firm had a score of 74.7, up from 72.4 in 2020 and 5.6 points ahead of second-place newcomer Cole, Scott & Kissane (69.1).

The rest of the top five, in order, included immigration firm Fragomen (63.6) and newcomers Kelley Kronenberg (63.4) and Kubicki Draper (62.4). …

White & Case, which was knocked down to No. 7 from No. 4 last year by the new entrants while still increasing its overall score from 54.4 to 55.8, was the only firm in the top 10 by revenue to also place in the top 10 in the Diversity Scorecard.

# White & Case Showers Associates With Cash In Year-End Bonus Announcement
## This elite firm is making it rain.

You know what’s sure to brighten up a Thursday afternoon during a pandemic? A bonus announcement from an elite firm.

White & Case, a firm that boasted $2,184,850,000 in 2019 gross revenue, earning it the No. 9 spot on the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, just showed associates the money with its Cravath bonus match.

Here’s what the White & Case 2020 year-end bonus scale looks like:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Class Year	Year-End Bonus*	Special Bonus**
Class of 2019	$15,000	$7,500
Class of 2018	$25,000	$10,000
Class of 2017	$50,000	$20,000
Class of 2016	$65,000	$27,500
Class of 2015	$80,000	$32,500
Class of 2014	$90,000	$37,000
Class of 2013	$100,000	$40,000
Class of 2012	$100,000	$40,000
See those asterisks? They’re important this year, because they represent which bonuses have hours requirements, and perhaps more importantly, which ones don’t. While White & Case is holding associates to a 2000-hour eligibility requirement for its year-end bonuses, the special bonuses have no hours requirement.

The firm will pay its special bonuses on December 31, 2020, and its regular bonuses on February 14, 2020. Congratulations to everyone at White & Case!

# Should The Supreme Court Write This?
## We draft a possible opinion for the Supreme Court in its consideration of storage of important government information.

PER CURIAM.

This case concerns whether a person or entity can be civilly liable for the improper storage of important government documents.

We hold that a person or entity can be held civilly liable if it takes inadequate precautions to guard sensitive documents.

In the case before us, Respondent knew the importance of many documents in his or its possession. Respondent announced that precautions would be taken to protect the documents. In a sense, articulating those precautions established the standard of care to be used by Respondent; having established those rules, Respondent should of course have followed them. If a person, for example, instructs his staff to cull important documents from unimportant ones, the person should ensure those rules are followed. And the standard of care obviously prohibits allowing sensitive documents to be stored in a way that allows them to be stolen. (Imagine, for example, if a former president or vice president stored classified documents in a storage room at a private club or in a locked garage. We would never condone such conduct.)

But that is not the case here.

In the case before us, a powerful and sophisticated entity possessed extremely sensitive documents.

Respondent instructed employees to use secure servers for email communications. Respondents’ employees frequently ignored these rules and used personal email to transmit sensitive documents.

Respondent purchased and used printers that did not produce logs or were able to print documents on off-site locations without tracking. These are self-evident failures in information security that any reasonable person would have corrected.

Respondent used “burn bags” to ensure that sensitive documents were secure before the documents were transmitted for shredding. But the burn bags were then often left open or unattended in hallways. The burn bags were occasionally secured only with staples.

These practices were apparently “going on for years.” Respondent had ample time to correct them.

Respondent insists that it was unable to instruct its employees to use secure servers or to protect burn bags because several of Respondent’s employees were elderly or perceived themselves to be very important people. Respondent insists that no one could tell these employees to be more responsible about securing information because of the employees’ age and status.

To write these words is to see how unpersuasive they are. All employees — old and young, important or unimportant — are equal under the law. All employees can (and should) be compelled to understand and obey rules that are necessary to secure information.

Accordingly, we hold that Respondent can be held liable for negligence in connection with its handling of sensitive documents, and this Court should be sanctioned for having permitted a draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization to be leaked. We will determine the appropriate remedy to be imposed upon us at a later date. And we reserve for the moment the question whether we should have recused ourselves from hearing this matter because we are passing judgment upon ourselves.

(For a recent news report explaining the publicly available facts of this dispute, see [Exclusive:  Supreme Court justices used personal emails for work and ‘burn bags’ were left open in hallways, sources say](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/6659879761731009697#).)

So ordered.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Sorry, Law Students, But Your Starting Salary Will NOT Be $190K

‘Where’s my $190K?’

Current law students and prospective law students who have been reading Above the Law this week must be absolutely, positively pumped about the [new $190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) that is slowly but surely catching on among Biglaw and boutique firms alike. Who cares about that humungous student loan balance? You’re going to have a gigantic starting salary!

It’s a very exciting time for the associates whose firms have decided to adopt the new compensation system, but for everyone else, it’s a bit depressing. The thing that’s more depressing is the fact that the vast majority of current and prospective law students will likely NEVER have an entry-level salary of $190,000. Yes, you read that correctly. You will likely NEVER have a starting salary that high.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
How do we know? Check out the bimodal starting salary distribution for the law school class of 2016, courtesy of James Leipold’s informative lecture on employment statistics at the most recent National Association for Law Placement conference.



Please pay very close attention to the fine print at the bottom of this slide:

The left-hand of the graph reflect salaries of $40,000 to $65,000, which collectively accounted for not quite half of reported salaries. The right-hand peak shows that salaries of $180,000 accounted for almost 16% of reported salaries.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Only about 16 percent of law school graduates had starting salaries of $180K, and thus far, Biglaw firms haven’t adopted the $190K pay hike as uniformly — or nearly as quickly — as they did back in 2016 when the $180K scale was first announced. Accept the realism of your situation and embrace the suck. $190K is simply not for everyone.

Stop trying to make $190K happen, it’s not going to happen — unless it’s your outstanding student loan balance, of course. That could totally happen.

Adorn your desk with the perfect reminder of exactly what it’s like to work in private practice. It’s called a Useless Box, but honestly its value as a metaphor of the Sisyphean struggle of lawyering in a firm environment.

Whenever you turn a fifth draft only to receive a redlined copy that returns it, in substantial part, to the exact same form it had when turned in the first time, just flip the switch on this handy memento and a little hand will crawl out… [and shut itself off](http://amzn.to/28QxHjL) (affiliate link).

That’s your existence! A “hurry up and wait” drill followed by unceremonious shut down. There are many versions of this, but this one boasts “surprise varied movements,” which is even more perfect because it can simulate that one day when something inexplicably goes your way.

It’s also just a cool office toy. Buy it for that reason.

# Biglaw Firms May Be Raising Rates, But Clients Are Still 'Paying Up'

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Being in an elite law firm is a wonderful place to be. They can raise rates and demand doesn’t drop as much. It’s a great business to be in.

— Owen Burman, a senior consultant at Wells Fargo Private Bank’s Legal Specialty Group, in comments given to [Law360 Pulse](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1769214) on top Biglaw firms’ ability to raise rates for the work they handle for clients. Although demand is virtually flat over last year, according to Burman, “clients are paying up for the work.”

If you have to be stuck in the office the afternoon before Thanksgiving, the very least the firm can do is announce their year end bonus scale. (Unless, of course, they’ve already announced bonuses, in which case, well done!) The folks at Sheppard Mullin received their good news this afternoon.

As expected, Sheppard Mullin’s bonuses are in line with the market scale set by Milbank earlier this month. Though as their grid below shows, they divide it up by associate levels rather than class year.


In order to be eligible for these bonuses, attorneys must hit the 1,850 billable hour threshold. Bonuses will paid in January of 2020. ([Full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/sheppard-bonus-2019/2/).)

What Biglaw firm was founded in 1792 by John Wells and was known as Wells & Strong; Strong, Bidwell & Strong; and Bidwell & Strong at various points before settling on its most famous moniker?

# Virtual Is The New Boutique
## The virtual law firm revolution is a new take on a familiar theme.

The way a lot of people tell it, virtual law firms are a brand-new category of firm, one that offers a savvy, efficient alternative to the traditional full-service firm. This is true in part — and there’s much Biglaw and mid-sized firms can learn from the model. But virtual firms didn’t completely reinvent the wheel. In this second part of my examination of the new breed of technology-based firms, I learned that this fast-growing segment of the legal industry actually has a pretty obvious ancestor. They’re the 21st-century version of the legal boutique

Same Problems, Different Decade

Travel back in time with me to that simpler era when clients paid their bills, associates spent all day in the law library, and the demand for legal services was on the rise. You’re a senior associate or young Biglaw income partner contemplating your future. You’ve built a decent book of business, but not enough to make it to the ranks of the handful of equity partners at the top of the pyramid. Maybe your firm’s compensation system is lockstep or seniority-based — making that payday you’ve been waiting for feel like it’s an eternity away. You’ve become exhausted running in the wheel of a 2000+ lawyer machine, where balance seems impossible and “family time” means looking at the picture of your significant other on a bookshelf.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Historically, these are the lawyers that left Biglaw for more balanced mid-sized firms like [the one I’m at](http://www.fclaw.com/), or went even smaller to so-called “boutique” firms. In these small shops, lawyers could pool their expertise, cross-sell with one another, and share the costs of overhead and firm resources. By staying small, and focusing on a few areas of expertise, the firm could keep its overhead down. This, in theory, meant attorneys could keep working the same hours and possibly make more money, or work less without taking a pay cut — or getting the side-eye from senior management.

Today, the same formula that created the traditional boutique is driving virtual or “distributed” firms. During my interviews of the heads of several major players in the VirtualLaw space, time after time they cited these same drivers as the impetus behind their own firms. Dissatisfaction with the longstanding problems of the Biglaw model was mentioned constantly.

Michael Moradzadeh of Rimon Law cited his frustration with the “old paradigm” of his white-shoe firm experience. “The attorneys here are great, the work is really cutting edge, we get paid a lot of money, [but] why are people so unhappy?” Kelly Culhane of Culhane Meadows first felt the itch to leave Biglaw when she knew she wanted to start her family. “Three babies in four years and partnership at a large national or international law firm” at the time didn’t seem practical to her. Back in 2002, “I saw a lot of women do it, and do it really well, but the way I wanted to do it, how I wanted to be home with my children and practice at that really high level, I couldn’t do it” in Biglaw.

These are hardly new complaints. These same problems have been around for decades, and for decades some lawyers have jumped to boutiques in search of solutions.

Squaring the Circle

Boutique law firms endeavor to solve the problems of Biglaw by sizing down. Am Law 100 firms need huge infrastructures. They need to be all things to all people. They need to shock and awe with their location and office decoration. Biglaw can be lucrative, but you spend a lot to make that money back. And to cover that overhead and make the infrastructure investments necessary to compete with the rest of Biglaw, huge chunks of revenue need to be diverted to the firm as a whole.

Boutique firms run smaller, leaner, and meaner. They can focus on the resources they need, and just worry about marketing to the industries they service — not to the world as a whole. By scaling down and keeping numbers low, they avoid the bloat that can come with larger firms. But the need to stay small is also limiting for the boutique. How many 25-lawyer shops have you heard of that represent Fortune 500 companies in bet-the-company litigation or billion-dollar transactions? If it exists, it’s exceedingly rare. Smart lawyers like doing sophisticated work, and the challenge at some boutique firms is they don’t have the perceived horsepower or bench strength to land the major deals.

Virtual firms claim to have found a way to square this circle. They aren’t defined by their size, but by their technology. By relying heavily on tech to cut costs and overhead while remaining connected to the firm as a whole, these virtual outfits may have figured out a business model that scales up with far less friction and added cost than a traditional brick-and-mortar boutique. Virtual firms don’t generally need to take on new office space for their new hires, and if the new hires want office space they pay for it themselves. Some firms avoid taking on permanent staff unless an attorney is paying for it. Others, like Rimon Law, keep their attorneys distributed but maintain their back-office staff in a single, low-cost location for far less expense than a traditional office. Virtual firms are experimenting every day, figuring out ways to scale up in size without sacrificing their efficiency. FisherBroyles, for instance, is now up to 230 lawyers.

How Far Can They Go?

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

So if virtual law firms can offer the advantages of a boutique structure at potentially the scale of traditional Biglaw, does that mean the rest of the brick-and-mortar legal world is done for?

Don’t crack open the casket for Biglaw just yet. For as many strides as VirtualLaw may have made, it may already be too late for it to break through to the top tiers. As we’ve discussed in this space [previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaws-blockbuster-moment/), Biglaw has found itself increasingly stratified by market forces. High-stakes, existential matters for large publicly traded companies are generally reserved for the Am Law 25, which only really compete with each other. I think even the biggest of virtual firms are unlikely to crash the Am Law 25 party any time soon. To paraphrase Marc Taylor of Taylor English, GCs are under pressure to hire performers, and no GC of a Fortune 500 ever got fired for hiring Kirkland & Ellis. For the foreseeable future, there’s still probably a ceiling on VirtualLaw’s ability to steal work from the biggest kids on the block.

But the threat, and promise, of VirtualLaw is real. The managers I spoke to believe they were responding not just to demands among the attorney class, but that they’re also responding to unmet needs of their clients. Clients have been complaining for years that they aren’t receiving the value or cost certainty they need. These managers think they’ve found an answer.

The VirtualLaw story may have started with the classic boutiques, but the ending has yet to be written. With the power of scale and technology, the new wave of firms may have found a way to get bigger, stronger, and faster than the traditional small firms ever could. VirtualLaw is growing faster than any other segment of law firms, and Biglaw and Midlaw should be taking notes and stealing any innovation they possibly can to stay relevant. Whether they can or will is another story we will examine in an upcoming column.

Above the Law is writing a lot about Biglaw COVID-19-induced austerity measures, because, well, they are tearing through the Biglaw ranks. Plus, you know, transparency is paramount and folks are eager for information as they try to figure out exactly what is going across the industry.

Well, we’ve got some more news for you. Yet another Am Law 200 firm has determined that, in order to survive the economic upheaval surrounding the coronavirus, they’ll need to take some cost-cutting measures. According to tipsters, earlier this week, Fisher Phillips announced what steps they’re taking to improve cash flow at the firm.

Tipsters report that at Fisher Phillips, there are salary cuts across the board with no end date currently announced. Associates and salaried staff have had their paychecks cut by 20 percent. Hourly staff member have had their hours cut by 20 percent, and those who are unable to work remotely have been furloughed. Partners have also taken a pay cut, though the exact amount is unknown.

Hopefully, these measures will be enough to help the firm pull through the tough times.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Who Is Better Compensated: Elite Biglaw Partners Or Top General Counsel?
## Biglaw partners and general counsel are both, typically, well-compensated positions. But, which path is more beneficial for your pocket?

If you’ve paid any attention to the ballooning compensation figures of Biglaw partners in recent years, you already know that it pays to be an equity partner at a large firm. Meanwhile, as average partner compensation escalates, top in-house lawyers are being [left behind](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2020/12/17/as-gc-compensation-stalls-disparity-between-in-house-law-firm-pay-glares/).   

In 2020, a Major Lindsey & Africa [survey](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/knowledge-library/research/2020-partner-compensation-report) of partners in “Am Law 200 size firms” found average compensation of above $1 million. The ALM Intelligence 2020 Law Department Compensation Benchmarking Survey found general counsel and chief legal officers earned average total compensation of $573,000. So, as a general rule, it’s more lucrative to be a Biglaw partner than a general counsel.

But what about at the very top end of the profession? In this article, we take a look at the pay packages of the top 100 highest-paid general counsels, in comparison to partners of top Biglaw firms (as measured by profits per equity partner). We find that on a cash compensation basis, equity partnership is more lucrative than being a general counsel. But the story is more complicated when taking stock options into account.

A quick note on sources. For general counsel compensation data, we look at the top 100 highest-paid GCs as listed in the 2020 ALM Intelligence GC Compensation Survey. This data set is not comprehensive. For one thing, ALM compiles its data from proxy statements filed with the SEC, so only public companies are included. Our source for Biglaw partner compensation is the 2020 edition of the Am Law 200 ranking.

It’s hard to outearn a top Biglaw partner

The General Counsel Compensation Survey ranks general counsels based on total cash compensation. The top 100 highest-paid GCs earned total cash compensation of $2.42 million on average. We don’t know how much the 100 best-paid Biglaw partners earned in the comparable period, but we can say that the top firm in the Am Law ranking — Wachtell — had 85 equity partners and profits per partner of $6.33 million.

Just two general counsels took home cash compensation higher than $6.33 million: Alan Braverman of Disney ($8 million) and Eric Grossman of Morgan Stanley ($6.94 million). Meanwhile, 38 Am Law firms had profits per equity partner in excess of the $2.42 million average general counsel cash compensation.

How does this compare to the situation a decade earlier? Analyzing the 2010 editions of the same surveys, we find that not much has changed. Based on the 2010 General Counsel Compensation Survey, the top 100 general counsels took home average total cash compensation of $1.56 million. Wachtell’s profits per partner were $4.3 million, a figure exceeded by just one general counsel. 28 Am Law firms had higher profits per equity partner than the $1.56 million general counsel average.

What about compensation growth over that ten-year period? From a growth perspective, who did better: the top 100 general counsels or the partnership of the top Am Law firms? The table below shows the results, ranked by growth rate. The law firms in the table were the top 10 firms in the 2010 Am Law 200. We see that general counsels fall in the middle of the pack, outpacing some partnerships and trailing others.

Group (equity partnership or GCs)	10-year compensation growth
Kirkland & Ellis	108%
Simpson Thacher	83%
Paul, Weiss	75%
Cravath	63%
Sullivan & Cromwell	57%
Top 100 GCs	55%
Cahill Gordon	51%
Wachtell	47%
Quinn Emanuel	46%
Boies, Schiller	17%
Irell & Manella	8%
But stock options can make a big difference

The comparisons above obscure some important factors. On the in-house side, it is critical to note that the very highest-earning general counsels receive a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of equity. Taking stock options into account, some general counsel roles start to look considerably more attractive. For example, revisiting the 2020 surveys, when accounting for equity compensation, the number of general counsels topping Wachtell’s profits per partner rises from two to 41. And some of the general counsels have total compensation that would exceed that of even the highest-paid Biglaw rainmaker. For example, Chewy GC Susan Helfrick had total compensation of $30.3 million (of which less than $1 million was in cash). Apple GC Kate Adams had cash compensation of $3.56 million, but her total compensation was $25.2 million.

On the law firm side, profits per equity partner gives little indication of the rewards that flow to top rainmakers. Firms vary widely in their compensation ranges. At the most traditional end of the spectrum, a firm’s highest-paid partner might take home 4x the pay of the lowest-paid partner. In contrast, at a firm with a strong eat-what-you-kill culture, that ratio may be 10x or higher. A 2018 New York Times [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/business/cravath-kirkland-ellis-partner-poaching.html) about the lateral talent wars reported on eight-figure pay packages for star hires at firms like Kirkland & Ellis and Paul, Weiss. It’s impossible to know how many Biglaw attorneys have breached $10 million, but the lateral market for partners with a strong book of business remains red hot.

Conclusion

There are a lot of reasons why an attorney might prefer to be a general counsel than a law firm partner. But viewed strictly through the lens of compensation, high-performing lawyers are typically better off staying on the law firm track. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean they should stick with their current firm. With Biglaw partnerships increasingly diverging in their approaches to compensation, it’s a mistake to assume that a partner with a given book of business will be paid similarly at any comparably prestigious firm. Productive partners have a variety of options — and it pays to know about them.

Law firms need a customer relationship management (CRM) to improve relationships with customers and drive sales growth. Businesses of all sizes are reaping the benefits of a CRM that helps them onboard new clients, build engaging relationships, and consistently deliver polished client experiences.

##What is CRM?
Customer relationship management (CRM) is technology businesses use to manage their interactions with current and potential customers. Some CRMs are generic while others cater to certain business verticals or even specific sizes of businesses, such as [Small Law Firm CRM](http://bit.ly/3mj0Yve). The most effective CRMs include powerful tools to help companies:

- Expedite growth. Once a business begins to grow, friction may result, allowing valuable leads to fall through the cracks. But all-in-one CRM platforms enable organizations to track everything in one centralized space, so nobody drops the ball on lead follow-up.
- Keep everyone on the same page. With various natively built tools and integrations, CRMs help businesses align their sales, marketing, and service teams to centralize daily workflows and business goals around clients.
- Share information. No matter who speaks with a potential client – sales, service, or marketing professionals – information is automatically synced and updated in the CRM system, giving a team access to accurate records that can be shared within the platform.
- Gain insight. CRM platforms do more than tell a business where a lead originated. They provide actionable insight into precisely what a potential client clicks on when they receive an email marketing message, how many times a prospect opened an email, how often a lead interacted with a sales team, and more. 
- Make better decisions. The data a CRM allows businesses to effectively communicate with their current audience and reach out to those who have shown interest in the past. In doing so they seize the opportunity to provide valuable guidance during the decision-making process.
With CRM in place, marketing departments can focus on creating campaigns that resonate with an audience, sales teams can offer more in-demand products and services, and efficient companies can better serve customers. 

###5 key benefits of CRM for law firms
CRM software provides numerous benefits to law firms eager to increase efficiency, reduce administrative overload, and provide stellar client service. 

- Custom dashboards. When a business uses a spreadsheet, data must be inputted manually, an error-prone and labor-intensive process. However, a CRM does most of the work, and customized dashboards can be set up for every user with login credentials. Intuitive dashboards allow users to see the data that is most important to their unique workflows without having to sift through data or run a report.
- Personalized client outreach. A CRM continually gathers data regarding the audience, market, and industry relevant to a particular business. As a result, users can create more relevant, personalized messaging via a [drip campaign](http://bit.ly/3YcDYeB) – a series of automated emails triggered by specific actions directed to a particular audience.
- Automation potential. CRM platforms offer automation, which reduces the time spent nurturing leads, prioritizes which marketing qualified leads (MQL) will most likely transition into sales qualified leads (SQL), and handles routine questions from prospective clients with chatbots or other automated messaging.
- Enhanced collaboration. A cloud-based CRM platform provides an up-to-date, shared record of all customers’ conversations, interactions, and contact information. Some systems also offer built-in collaboration tools that enable multiple users to work on one file simultaneously and follow the progress of individual matters to create a seamless workflow.
- Reliable data and metrics. Data is a valuable resource for businesses; however, it’s not usable until it is organized and converted into an actionable format. A CRM system helps companies see who interacts with the organization and through what channels. It enables the team to run reports to see where opportunities exist, how they communicate with prospective and current clients, and review sales and client service trends.
Finding clients is challenging, and once you find them, you must establish and maintain strong relationships to keep them. CRM allows businesses such as law firms to offer high-quality, consistent, and timely customer interactions at all stages within the [sales pipeline](http://bit.ly/3ZdVNLv).

##What is the purpose of CRM at a law firm?
Strong client relationships are at the foundation of a successful law practice. To thrive in today’s competitive legal environment, law firms need to be client-centered. This means they must provide a positive client experience by building trust, forming a solid working relationship, and leaving clients willing to refer others once their matter has resolved. CRM platforms help lawyers attract and retain clients, grow the firm, and support continued business expansion.

# Biglaw Is Learning Exchange Rates Are A Bitch
## Wait, what *is* the compensation for U.K. associates?

Biglaw is learning all about the whims of global finance. As most people by now have heard, the[ British pound has hit ](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/pound-tanking-massive-tax-cuts-and-talk-of-emergency-rate-hikes.html)an all-time low against the U.S. dollar. And some big international firms with offices in the United Kingdom are feeling the pinch.

Some firms (Gibson Dunn, McDermott Will & Emery) establish their U.K. pay scale in pounds, without being linked to the dollar and the Cravath pay scale which dominates the U.S. offices. But there are other international firms that link their U.K. salaries to the U.S. Cravath scale, and deal with conversion rates.

One firm that operates off of the Cravath scale is Akin Gump, but the tanking pound has left them in a world of hurt. The firm sets the conversion rate quarterly and they’re seeing some radical salary shifts. Back in June, that meant starting salaries in their U.K. offices were £164,000 but in July they were £179,000. Those were set to rise to over £200k in the final quarter of the year… until they did something about it.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-akin-gump-caps-london-pay-pound-plummets) Roll on Friday:

But in light of the tanking pound, a source told RollOnFriday that Akin Gump decided to “stop converting” salaries at the “actual FX rate” and has introduced a collar (1.2) and cap (1.5) “that hasn’t been seen in years”. The insider said the firm made an internal announcement on Monday, just a few days before a new FX rate was expected to apply.

Akin Gump’s salary scale works out as follows (based on the 1.2 rate collar):

NQ & 1 PQE: $215,000 (£179,167)
2PQE: $225,000 (£187,500)
3PQE: $250,000 (£208,333)
4PQE: $295,000 (£245,833)
5PQE: $345,000 (£287,500)
6PQE: $370,000 (£308,333)
7PQE: $400,000 (£333,333)
8PQE: $415,000 (£345,833)

But they’re not the only firm instituting new exchange rate caps in light of the pound tanking:

RollOnFriday understands that Kirkland & Ellis uses a collar rate of 1.25 with a cap of 1.63, adjusted on a monthly basis (or whenever staff are compensated). The collar rate puts Kirkland’s NQs on a base salary of £172,000.

Other firms, such as Vinson & Elkins and Goodwin Procter, set the exchange rate for the year, meaning next year could result in a windfall for associates there. Neither firm has, of yet, announced how they intend to compensate associates.

Corporate whistleblowers may not always grab the biggest headlines, but the space is seeing extensive activity — and presenting complicated challenges for lawyers and other corporate advisors. 

Last month, the [SEC awarded $6 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-67) to five whistleblowers, and earlier this year, the agency [released proposed changes to two whistleblower program rules](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-23).

To provide a deeper understanding of trends and risks, PLI is offering a half-day program, [Corporate Whistleblowing in 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/corporate-whistleblowing?t=live?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), which will provide essential insights on recent developments shaping the current risk landscape, both during the pandemic and emerging from it.

The expert panel will include leading whistleblower law practitioners as well as current and former regulators.

In the session, you’ll gain in-depth perspectives on recent regulatory and legal developments, including the current and future direction of the federal whistleblower bounty and protection programs, what regulatory enforcement developments to expect in the coming year, best practices in responding to whistleblower allegations, and the challenges of and practical strategies for prosecuting, defending, and managing whistleblower claims.

Attendees will learn more about: 

- The protections and incentives available to corporate whistleblowers
- The current priorities and agendas of the SEC, CFTC, and Department of Labor whistleblower programs, including recent amendments to the SEC’s program
- The trends and issues recently facing the private plaintiffs’ whistleblower bar
- The latest administrative and case law relating to whistleblowing
- The impact that the pandemic and return to work have had on whistleblowing

If you thought the Biglaw market was quick to match Davis Polk, then you better buckle up, because these Cravath salary matches are coming in fast and furious. The second Cravath match comes from a firm that is no stranger to this raise rodeo — in fact, this is the third time the firm has issued an announcement about raises since January.

McDermott Will & Emery was the [second firm to match Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/mwe-match-2022/), one of the first to match [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/), and is now the second firm to match Cravath. Associates must be pleased as punch that their firm is quick to match when it comes to their compensation.

Here’s what the latest new salary scale looks like at McDermott:



The firm’s second re-raise is retroactive to January 1. Congratulations, again!

# The Ongoing Process Of 'Development' For In-House Lawyers
## Professional and personal development is a dynamic and ongoing process that requires patience and persistence.

Over the past two weeks, I have taken time to reflect on 2023. I was reminded that I continue to be a work in process. Professional and personal development has no final destination. Professional and personal development is a dynamic and ongoing process that requires patience and persistence.

As I end one year and begin a new one, I will not be making any grand New Year’s resolutions. I will, however, carry forward lessons I have learned professionally and personally over the past several years. While these lessons are my lessons, I thought I would share them here in the hopes that someone else may find them helpful.

I have learned …

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It is important to set clear goals. While defining my short- and long-term goals is helpful because it provides a roadmap for my personal and professional development, I have come to accept that my life and my work will never unfold exactly as I expect. I have learned not to fear the unexpected, but to embrace it instead. Because the business landscape continues to evolve and change, I must also evolve and change. I have to be able to navigate new technologies, methodologies, and industry trends. I must be prepared to adjust, to adapt, and to chart a different course to achieve new goals.

It is important to make continuous learning a priority. Staying curious and embracing new perspectives, ideas, and attitudes is so important. Continuous learning has helped me develop a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me. Continuous learning for me has taken many forms. I have engaged in self-directed learning through online courses, books, and tutorials; I have engaged in formal learning by attending workshops, conferences, and training programs; but the way I have found that I learn best, however, is by just doing and reflecting on my own experiences, my successes, and my failures. As a result of these reflections, I have been able to adjust what I do moving forward based on what has worked well and what has not worked as well.

It is important to seek constructive feedback. Seeking and receiving constructive feedback from colleagues, supervisors, and outside parties has been critical for my personal and professional growth. With constructive feedback, I have been able to identify areas for improvement, and I have been able to make the changes to enhance my performance. I have also learned, however, that not all feedback is created equal. Feedback is just one individual’s prospective. I have learned that I need to evaluate the feedback provided. It is up to me to decide if I act on that feedback.

It is important to network and build a strong professional network. Connecting with colleagues, industry peers, and other professionals through networking has provided me with countless opportunities for learning, collaboration, and career advancement. I have learned, however, that connecting is not a one and done endeavor. If you network effectively, you do more than just make a connection. You use that connection as the foundation for an on-going relationship that you nurture and grow over time.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It is important to develop both technical and soft skills. Developing a combination of technical and soft skills has been essential for my success. Soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and emotional intelligence have complemented and enhanced my technical expertise. Unlike the development of technique expertise, I have found that I have had to be more intentional about the development of my soft skills. Aside from the leadership training courses I had in the military, I have not taken any courses on the development of soft skills. I have developed soft skills over time through trial and error and by reading everything I could get my hands on.

It is important to stay informed. By staying up-to-date on industry trends, market demands, and emerging technologies, I have found it easier to anticipate challenges for my employer. By anticipating future challenges, I have been in a better position to help my employer take a proactive rather than a reactive approach to an ever-changing business landscape. I have stayed informed by subscribing to and by reading relevant publications and newsletters.

It is important to take risks. Over the years, I have become more comfortable with who I am and what I can do. Reaching that point has been very satisfying, but it has also presented challenges. Becoming too comfortable can be problematic. Learned that taking calculated risks and operating out of my comfort zone has led me to new opportunities for growth and learning and sharpened my existing skills.

As I conclude this reflection on the past year, I am filled with gratitude for the lessons learned and the growth I have experienced both professionally and personally. The realization that setting clear goals, embracing continuous learning, seeking constructive feedback, building a robust professional network, and developing a balance of technical and soft skills are indispensable elements in my journey. The importance of staying informed and the value of taking calculated risks have become guiding principles, shaping my approach to challenges and opportunities alike.

As I step into the new year, I will make a commitment to applying these valuable lessons in my daily life. May this shared reflection inspire you on your own journeys of self-discovery, resilience, and achievement. Here’s to the ongoing pursuit of personal and professional development in the ever-evolving tapestry of life.

# Biglaw Is Filled With Some Elitist Jerks
## Biglaw interviews can really go off the rails!

Ever since [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/all-the-things-that-can-go-wrong-during-on-campus-interviews/) when Above the Law asked for your interview horror stories, tales of terror have been pouring in. And, please, keep ’em coming!

Today’s stories have something very specific in common — rude interviewers who just think they’re better than everyone else.

I was on a 2L callback at a large firm. It is important to know I went to a regionally well-respected law school, but not a national top law school, and for undergrad I went to a small alternative liberal arts college known for independent study. As part of this all-day interview I was to go to lunch with a senior associate and a junior associate. The three of us went into the elevator lobby to go down for lunch and an obviously senior partner was standing there.

The Senior Associate introduced me with “Senior Partner, this is interviewee. She goes to [Law School], but apparently she might have some other qualities that make up for that.” The senior partner and junior associate were clearly uncomfortable with this strange (and rude) introduction, but we shook hands and made small talk in an attempt to ignore it. But Senior Associate wasn’t done.

We got onto the elevator and Senior Associate turned to me and said, “You went to [College Name]. Isn’t that where people go when they can’t get into real Ivy League schools?”

Senior Partner and Junior Associate choked and kind of froze, but I’d had enough and turned to her and responded, “what a strange thing to say. No, [College Name] is known for self-directed independent study and intensive arts and writing. Honestly, I don’t think anyone who would be interested in an Ivy League would want to go there, it’s too unusual and unstructured – it only appeals to people who can handle that.” I then smiled at her and we all got off the elevator.

Most. Awkward. Lunch. Ever.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Glad the tipster could really shut that senior associate up! An awkward lunch is a small price to pay for that delicious comeuppance.

The next story speaks to an even more insidious type of elitism:

This is an old story but I remember it vividly. After graduating from UCLA Law School in 1975 I was clerking for a federal district court judge in Los Angeles. I was contacted by a representative of a very conservative old line firm and agreed to a lunch interview. There were three attorneys from the firm. Early in the interview I was asked where I lived and said I lived in West Los Angeles. A couple of minutes later a different attorney asked the same question and I said West Los Angeles again, feeling a bit perturbed that I wasn’t being heard. Toward the end of the lunch, the third attorney asked me where I lived and I smiled and said Pasadena, a more conservative city to the east of Los Angeles. They all smiled at me at that point and said something positive so I guess I finally answered the question right on the third try. They asked me to come back to the firm that afternoon for more interviews but I’d had enough. I told them the judge needed me in court and never contacted them.

Yikes! I think that’s your unconscious showing!

Have a terrible tale to tell about an interview gone awry? Please send it our way [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Interview%20Stories), subject line “Interview Stories.” We’ll read all the submissions and share our favorites in these pages.

(And remember, as we’ve previously [explained](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/interview-horror-stories-what-was-she-thinking-er-drinking/), “The ‘horror’ in ‘interview horror stories’ is loosely defined. Stories that are somewhat embarrassing or mildly amusing will suffice.”)

# Shearman & Sterling Announces Layoffs -- Associates And Staff Impacted By The Cuts
## Layoff news is never good for a major law firm.

Another Biglaw firm has announced layoffs. This time, it’s the New York office of Shearman & Sterling. The cuts are [reportedly](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/08/shearman-sterling-lays-off-associates-and-staff/) spread through the associate and staff ranks, with 12 associates and 26 staff members getting pink slips.

According to a spokesperson, “In light of the continuing and growing economic headwinds and market conditions, we made the difficult decision to adjust the size of our team in the U.S.” Unsurprising for those who’ve been following Biglaw market conditions, the majority of those impacted are in transactional practice groups. They continued, “After careful consideration, like many other leading law firms, we have implemented a limited workforce reduction which includes 26 team members in business services and 12 of our legal personnel, focused mainly on transactional practice areas most affected by current and projected market conditions.”

This is only the latest stumble for Shearman, which has [seen slower growth](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/27/shearmans-long-road-from-wall-street-darling-to-merger-partner-405-116391/) in both revenue and profits over the last 20 years compared with its peer firms. They also had a[ disappointing bonus season last year,  ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/shearman-bonus-2022/)with many associates feeling screwed by the process.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
However, they’re not the only firm to cut associates from their ranks recently — we’ve heard associate layoff news [out of Cooley LLP](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) and [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) and [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/) and [even Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/). With[ even more firms](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) trimming their staff headcount.

Maybe that the[ reported merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/hogan-lovells-and-shearman-sterling-potential-merger-on-the-horizon/) between Shearman and Hogan Lovells can’t come quickly enough .

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Biglaw Giant Settles Case Alleging Overbilling
## At least that case settled quickly.

Earlier this year, [a former client filed a lawsuit against the Biglaw firm of Morrison & Foerster alleging a “billing feeding frenzy.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/mofo-faces-overbilling-lawsuit-alleging-a-billing-feeding-frenzy/?rf=1) Plaintiffs, which include Synergies Corp., AVD Trading, FireStar Group LLC, Firestar Diamond International and owner, jewelry designer Nirav Modi, filed causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, fraud, breach of contract, and theft that stemmed from an engagement where the firm was hired to wind down the entities, and the plaintiffs were left with a bill for $484,321.39.

Now the parties have come to a settlement after mediation in the matter. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/05/13/mofo-settles-texas-suit-over-billing-practices/) Law.com, the precise terms of the settlement are unknown. However, [Peter Taaffe](http://www.txattorneys.com/peter-k-taaffe), of counsel at The Buzbee Law Firm, represents the plaintiffs and made this statement about the settlement:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“The parties have come to a mutual settlement and the terms of the settlement are confidential. The plaintiff parties also add that ‘Morrison & Foerster provided plaintiffs with valuable legal work, and plaintiffs appreciate its counsel.’”

For their part, MoFo (nor the attorney representing them in the matter, Tom O’Brien of Baker Botts) did not have a comment on the matter. But you have to imagine it was nice to have at least one [high-profile dispute](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/mofo-responds-to-explosive-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/) or [scandal](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/amid-growing-scandal-mofo-launches-investigation-into-partner-justin-fairfax/) be resolved, and quickly at that.

# Attorneys Should Follow Up With Referrals As Soon As Possible
## Time waits for no lawyer.

Attorneys often refer matters or prospective clients to other attorneys. A few of the biggest reasons why lawyers refer work to other attorneys: a given lawyer does not handle the type of legal issue involved in a particular matter, the attorney is too busy, or the attorney just does not want to work with a given client. Lawyers and clients evaluate numerous qualities of attorneys when deciding whether to secure counsel, but perhaps the most important part of landing a representation is responding to the referral quickly. In my experience, lawyers have missed out on handling lucrative matters simply because they took longer to follow up with the referral than other attorneys.

Earlier in my career, a client had a legal matter in a jurisdiction in which I practice. I knew several lawyers who practiced law in this jurisdiction, and I started calling my contacts to see if any of my acquaintances wanted to handle the matter. I first called the acquaintance with whom I was closest. This person attended law school with me and was always nice to me when we were students. I thought it would be great if I could give this work to my former classmate to solidify my connection to him and somewhat reward him for being a good guy during law school, which is a stressful environment.

Unfortunately, when I called my former classmate, he was not in his office. I left a voicemail and told this lawyer that he should call me back as soon as he could since I had an interesting matter to refer to him. I gave my friend a few hours to get back to me, but my client was expecting the name of a local counsel that day so that we could get started on defending a matter on an exigent basis. Accordingly, I started looking for other lawyers who might accept the referral.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I once took a deposition in the state in which this legal matter was pending, so I started digging through old emails to find the name of an attorney with whom I had had dinner who presumably also practiced law in the jurisdiction in which I needed to secure local counsel. I did not know this person nearly as well as my law school classmate, but this attorney seemed competent, and I thought she would get a kick out of hearing from me and discussing a potential referral. After some searching, I found this lawyer’s contact information and called her office line.

This lawyer picked up right away and seemed like she remembered me, which is not that unusual since I am one of the tallest lawyers around. She said that she would be happy to take the referral, and soon enough, I connected her with my client, and she was retained to defend the client shortly thereafter. The matter ended up being very lucrative for this lawyer, since it was complex and lasted a few years.

My law school classmate did get back to me a day or two after I left him a voicemail about the potential referral. I felt bad that he had missed out but conveyed that the client had already secured different counsel for the case. My former classmate sounded bummed, but I told him I would consider him for future legal matters in his jurisdiction.

It can be difficult to respond to referrals when people are on vacation, in court, or handling all manner of tasks within the legal profession. However, if a lawyer is on the hunt for new work, it is important that they respond to referrals as soon as possible. Any delays in responding to a referral might mean that someone else will get the work, not necessarily because they are more competent, but simply because they are the first person to respond.

Holland & Knight has been in the [news recently](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firms-in-talks-for-merger-that-could-create-one-of-the-largest-firms-in-america/), as they’re considering a potential merger with Thompson & Knight. But just because they’re focused on the long-term strategy of the firm, associates haven’t been left twisting in the wind.

Holland & Knight, ranked 38th on the Am Law 100 with $1,026,809,000 in 2019 gross revenue, has decided to show associates just how much they care with great bonus news. Last week, the firm announced their own special bonuses and matched the scale set by Davis Polk in March.

The bonus distributions will be as follows:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Level	Spring Bonus (payable in June for hours through May 31)	Fall Bonus (payable in November for hours through October 31)	Total
Level 7+	$24,00	$40,000	$64,000
Level 6	$22,200	$37,000	$59,200
Level 5	$19,500	$32,500	$52,000
Level 4	$16,500	$27,500	$44,000
Level 3	$12,000	$20,000	$32,000
Level 2	$6,000	$10,000	$16,000
Level 1	$4,500	$7,500	$12,000
To be eligible for the bonuses, associates have to be on track to bill 1,900 hours (which includes pro bono and other approved non-client hours), with the opportunity to make up a missed first payment if an associates’ hours pick up in the second half of the year.

According to tipsters at the firm, associates are happy with the largesse, saying:

Associates are thrilled that the firm is keeping compensation competitive with market leaders.

# Common Sense Is Not That Common
## From college presidents to lawyers to Lloyd Bridges characters, sometimes we all fail to read the room.

What about the debacle of the university presidents’ testimonies before Congress last week? What were they thinking? In other circumstances, I would have pointed out proudly that all three university presidents were women. Yay for progress but muted by their testimonies.

There’s a lesson (or more than one) for us lawyers in last week’s Congressional sh-tshow. We need to understand our audiences, whether they be juries, legislators, or anyone else. A prestigious law firm prepared the witnesses for their testimonies in these hearings. They didn’t need lawyers, they needed public relations people and crisis managers who could help them craft those testimonies in the best possible light for their audience. As a New York Times article pointed out, these presidents were prepped as if testifying as a deposition or in court and not for a public forum. They needed experts of a different sort. I am not the only one who thought that was not the way to go.

We are not the smartest peeps in the room about everything. Contrary to popular or unpopular belief, lawyers don’t know it all or how to do it all, which is why we turn to, or should turn to, other professionals, experts, who know their businesses better than we do. It’s the height of hubris to think otherwise.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Know your audience. This audience was not interested in legal hair-splitting or parsing. Some answers could have been short and simple if they had been prepared to answer in that way. Maybe they were, maybe they weren’t. I certainly wasn’t in the room where the preparation occurred. Intricacies and conflicts in policies are one thing, but that was not what the legislators wanted to hear. Were the speakers sandbagged in a “gotcha” game? Maybe, maybe not, but full-throated decisive answers would have been the way to go.

What’s the point of semantic wrangling? Sometimes people just need to be forthright. (An example of not doing so initially is then President Clinton’s denial in his deposition that he had had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Google if you’re too young to remember [sigh] the salient facts.)

The moral of the story, at least to me, is to know your audience, read the room. What may be perfectly appropriate in one setting can sink like a stone in another. A little human compassion, [a little human emotion on the part of the witnesses](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/college-presidents-at-hearing-should-have-spoken-from-the-heart?source=newsletter&item=body-link&region=text-section), might have gone a long way toward viewing them sympathetically in what was a touchy situation, replete with repercussions. Was it a situation of “damned if you do, damned if you don’t?” You tell me, but my lingering impression is that they acted like robots, like automata, devoid of any human touch. Doing the legally correct thing is not always the right thing, at least in the public sphere. Context anyone?

Sometimes I can’t believe what I read, even in ATL. Some stories surely must be the work of an overimaginative mind, right? Stephen Miller, who unfortunately hails from SoCal (I know, stifle the comments, please) now is trumpeting a loony-tunes [theory about Taylor Swift](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/stephen-miller-taylor-swift/). It would be hilarious (and in a way it is) if it weren’t so scary. Of course, the idea of Miller (and not just him, how about Michael Flynn?) in a second Trump administration is enough to drive us all bat-sh-t crazy, just like [Lloyd Bridges in the “Airplane” movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeI5ke0BENw).

Whatever has happened to common sense? Where has that gone? Should that be tested on the bar exam? (I know, Stephen Miller is not a lawyer.) How would that affect passage rates? Just asking.

Just one example of a lawyer who has no common sense, but apparently stockpiles Pringles cans. Two years ago, this pissed-off lawyer threw a poop-filled can of Pringles (I will never, ever buy those) into the parking lot of a county crime victim advocacy center. The Ohio Supreme Court has [suspended the lawyer](https://www.courtnewsohio.gov/cases/2023/SCO/1129/230741.asp) for one year with six months stayed.

According to the story in the Cincinnati Enquirer, the attorney — I am not making this up — had a habit of [pooping into Pringles cans](https://www.pringles.com/en-us/products/favorites.html). I wonder if he had a favorite type that he used. His defense was that he routinely pooped in the cans and randomly threw them from his car. He claimed that he pranked with Pringles at least 10 times in 2021. the [height of the pandemic](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/29/ohio-supreme-court-suspends-attorney-over-dropping-poop-filled-can/71739810007/). That was a tough time for all of us, but really?

Perhaps he can ask Santa for some common sense, while I will save the “Bottoms Up” phrase for New Year’s Eve.

And wanting to end on a happier note, how about [congratulating the youngest newly minted lawyer here in California](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-07/tulare-county-teen-passes-california-bar-exam-at-17-youngest-ever)? I’m hoping that he has some life experience before he starts representing clients.

How much common sense did you have at 17? Many attorneys who have practiced for decades still lack common sense. You can be the smartest attorney out there, but still not have it. (See above.)

# New NALP 'Rules' For Law School Recruitment Seem To Promote Organized Chaos

‘Jobs! Give us the jobs!’

This has been a long time coming. The market has become so much more diverse. This one-size-fits-all set of standards doesn’t work. Law school graduates are being hired by a much broader range of organizations. Schools have very different employment profiles for their classes. Schools have very different academic calendars.

— [James Leipold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesleipold/), executive director of the National Association for Law Placement, commenting on the organization’s [new guidelines for the on-campus recruitment of summer associates](https://www.law.com/2018/12/13/nalp-loosens-the-reins-on-summer-associate-recruiting/). Under the new “rules” (if they can really be called that), there is no longer a 28-day period for law students to decide on open offers, exploding offers will now be allowed, and law firms no longer need to wait until December 1 to begin recruiting students. Leipold says he expects different law schools to do different things, but that “common regimes” may arise when it comes to law student recruiting.

In-person trials are starting up again.

In some states, judges never believed there was a pandemic.  Those judges just barely slowed down.

In other states, judges experimented with Zoom trials.

But now, life is starting to open up again in a fair number of places.

I heard about a trial recently that made me think about a (possible) generational difference in the law. The trial was in-person. The trial lawyers were in one city, and the trial was 1,000 miles away; the lawyers would have to fly to the trial site. If folks were aggressive about it, they all could have had one, and some two, shots of the vaccine before they left. So the senior trial lawyer asked his team: “Who’s willing to fly to the trial site?”

One associate — the senior-most of the bunch — said yes.

Two associates — the junior members of the team — said no. (Yeah, that’s a lot of associates. It was a big case.)

That got me to thinking.

Suppose, a generation ago, a senior partner had asked, “You have to run through a burning building to get to the trial site. Are you willing?”

Before he finished the question, the smoldering associates would have appeared on the far side of the structure.

A trial!

We were always quiet about this, because we didn’t want the firm to know, but we would have paid the firm money for the firm to allow us to watch a trial. And more money to examine a witness. At big firms, watching is as close to trial experience as many associates get. It’s where the action is. You’d do anything for a trial.

I realize, of course, that my comparison is not completely apt. There were no pandemics back in the ’80s and ’90s, and partners weren’t really asking you to gamble your life for the opportunity to attend a trial. But partners did ask you to take on a new case when you were already swamped with work — and ruin, if not actually forfeit, your life — for the chance to see a trial. Without exception, junior associates accepted those chances; indeed, associates fought over them.

Are we really seeing a change in attitudes about work-life balance?

Alright, alright: I hear the chorus of you saying in unison, “Okay, boomer.”  Maybe you’re right. Maybe I’m just part of an older generation thinking that the younger generation is less committed to its careers.

But it’s also possible that’s true: The younger generation may in fact be less committed to its careers.

It’s also possible that’s desirable: Why did people ever ruin their lives for the right to participate in a trial?

In any event, this came screaming through to me when I watched a real-life experiment: The times may be a-changin’.

What Mr. Mueller did was very intentional. I am critical of your client for sticking his hand under my skirt and grabbing my ass.

I’m not going to allow you or your client to make me feel in anyway that this is my fault because it isn’t. I am being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions and not mine.

— Singer [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift), [testifying](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/10/us/taylor-swift-trial-testimony/index.html) this morning in a civil trial in a case brought by David Mueller, a former radio DJ for KYGO. Swift claims that Mueller groped her during a meet-and-greet session, and Mueller claims that Swift pressured the station into firing him for his alleged conduct. Swift had earlier testified that the alleged incident was “horrifying and shocking” and that she’d “never experienced anything like [that]” before.

# Elite Biglaw Firms Likely To Offer $450K In Signing Bonuses To Supreme Court Clerks
## Which firms will be throwing so much cash at supreme talent?

Just how much is a former Supreme Court clerk worth? How much are Biglaw firms and prestigious boutiques willing to pay to woo associates with supreme intellect and inside insights about how the nation’s highest court operates and how certain justices think? Back in 2018, we [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/400k-is-now-the-official-market-rate-for-supreme-court-clerk-bonuses/) that $400,000 was the prevailing rate for signing bonuses for former Supreme Court clerks. Yes, you read that correctly: former SCOTUS clerks were making almost double their Supreme bosses’ salaries in bonus money just for signing on the dotted line, on top of their base salaries and regular bonuses.

We know of several firms — off hand, those firms are Jones Day, Kirkland & Ellis, Orrick, Paul Weiss, Skadden Arps, Gibson Dunn, and Susman Godfrey — that have offered $400,000 bonuses to their SCOTUS clerk recruits in the past. Two years later, in September 2020, with the economic upheaval of a pandemic to deal with, not much had changed, and $400K was still the [status quo](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/elite-biglaw-firms-are-offering-400k-bonuses-to-supreme-court-clerks/). But now, in this post-COVID Biglaw world, where cash compensation in the form of higher salaries and special bonuses upon special bonuses is flowing fast and free for associates, the market for SCOTUS bonuses is going to the moon, with some forecasting signing bonuses of $450,000 (or more) for recent high court clerks.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to the National Law Journal, leaders of several appellate practices say their firms will be opening the coffers wide for associates fresh off a high court clerkship. Here are some of the details:

“Bonuses have been $400,000 for the last couple of years, but I suspect it will be more this year,” said the head of one appellate practice in D.C., who, like other practice leaders for this report, declined to be named in order to speak more candidly.

“This year, we’re probably looking at $450,000,” said the chair of another appellate practice in D.C. Half a million is a “psychological barrier for most firms,” said the chair, but some firms may even go that high “just for the perceived value,” especially a boutique firm.

Those figures reflect the scarcity of the resource, the appellate chair added, noting there are about 35 law clerks currently at the U.S. Supreme Court. “It reflects something about a perceived view about prestige in bringing these clerks to a firm. But to me, most of all, it represents something about the expertise they have after spending a year at the Supreme Court.”

Jones Day tends to corner the market on Supreme Court clerks each year. The firm recently welcomed nine SCOTUS clerks from the 2019-2020 term, and since 2011, 64 former SCOTUS clerks have joined the firm. That having been said, while we’re working on [cracking open](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/jones-day-raises-salaries-but-remains-a-black-box/) Jones Day’s compensation black box, it’s helpful to know just how much money may be getting paid to these clerks in the form of signing bonuses, rather than to other associates in the form of their reportedly [undermarket salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/inside-jones-days-210000-myth/).

If you know that your firm is paying $450,000 or more for SCOTUS clerks, [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=SCOTUS%20Clerkship%20Bonuses) (subject line: “SCOTUS Clerkship Bonuses”) or text us (646-820-8477), and we’ll compile a list of every firm that’s paying so generously for supreme talent.

# Biglaw Partner Explains Why His Firm Doesn't Have A Unified Associate Pay Structure
## It's different pay for different markets at this Biglaw firm -- and it's not on the Cravath scale, either.

Chicago is different than Cincinnati. Los Angeles is different than Cleveland. Because we have such disparate geographies, we think compensating at an appropriate market rate is the way to go. Some firms, their offices are primarily in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and it might be an easier decision there [to have a unified pay setup] because those markets are similar.

— [Josh Lorentz](https://www.dinsmore.com/joshua-a-lorentz/), chair of Dinsmore & Shohl’s finance committee, commenting on the firm’s salary structure during an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2022/06/21/many-holdouts-remain-in-big-laws-move-to-unify-pay-across-markets/). Dinsmore’s first-year associate salary structure ranges from $100,000 to $175,000, based largely on the market where its offices are located. The firm believes that rather than unifying its pay across the country, different market settings must be taken into consideration to fairly compensate its attorneys.

# Latham Partner And 'Dog Racism': Or, The Dumbest Thing You'll Hear Today
## When a Biglaw partner's pit bull gets an eviction notice, it's time to make some false equivalencies!

[Michelle Kelban-Carteron](https://www.lw.com/people/michelle-kelban) serves as the co-chair of [Latham & Watkins](https://www.lw.com)’ real estate practice, and yet is somehow involved in a real estate dispute with her own condo board. At issue is Luna, the five-year-old pit bull mix that Kelban-Carteron and her husband [Gino](https://www.elliman.com/real-estate-agent/gregory-carteron/22115), a lawyer for realtor [Douglas Elliman](https://www.elliman.com), keep in their [Manhattan condo](http://streeteasy.com/building/chelsea-modern).

It’s unclear to me why buildings let pit bulls live in apartments. It has nothing to do with whether or not pit bulls are aggressive or victims of bad press, they’re just big animals and frankly deserve more space than Manhattan is going to provide. The only dogs that could properly live in New York are those little rat dogs that humans have cruelly bred for generations to fit in a socialite’s purse. And those genetic mistakes shouldn’t be allowed because their incessant yapping is just the mournful cry, “Please kill me… I shouldn’t be.” Dogs should be big and live in wide open spaces.[[1]](#f1)

Now, here’s the thing, Luna has lived in the building since the couple first moved in, and so they’re fighting the building’s attempt to kick Luna out. And yet, according to the board’s attorney, Herbert Cohen of [Stiefel Cohen & Foote](http://coopandcondolaw.com), the contract they signed at the time gave the board permission to evict any pit bull. Apparently even veteran real estate lawyers don’t read the fine print on those things. Seriously, if you have pets, isn’t the first question in any real estate transaction “do you allow pets?” People ask that before they ask about utilities. So how does anybody — let alone an attorney — get into an apartment with a clause allowing the building to kick out the precise breed of dog you own?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But Kelban-Carteron’s attorney, real estate attorney [Adam Leitman Bailey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Leitman_Bailey) (whose brother [runs a dog training business](https://www.facebook.com/WhosAGoodBoyIndustries/) — I’m sensing an expert witness…), has a term for [this situation](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202792152424/Latham-Partners-Lawyer-Cites-Dog-Racism-in-Condo-Dispute):

“I call this dog racism,” Bailey said. “Because of [the dog’s] breed, they’re going after it.”

Oh no, no, no, no. No. There’s so much wrong with this. There is such a thing as “dog racism,” and it’s when you see dogs [that hate black people](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/djbfk9/key-and-peele-racist-dog). That’s it.

Let’s start with the dearth of Supreme Court precedent on the prohibition against redlining dog breeds. If breed discrimination is really the basis of this argument, well, that dog won’t hunt. But there may be another case in the offing. According to [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202792152424/Latham-Partners-Lawyer-Cites-Dog-Racism-in-Condo-Dispute), there are allegations that Luna recently attacked a Havanese mix — see above, “rat dog” — beginning the fight over Luna’s continued stay at Whiteacre or whatever they call this condo:

Shortly after this incident, Kelban-Carteron secured certification deeming Luna a service dog for her husband. A doctor’s note claims the dog provides emotional support following a cycling injury. Bailey confirmed that Carteron [sued the federal government in January](http://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2017cv00088/467237) after allegedly being hit by a postal service truck while riding in Manhattan. (Edward Steinberg of New York’s Leav & Steinberg, who is [advising Carteron in that matter](http://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/doc1/127119493445), did not immediately return a request for comment about the case.)

Getting service dogs in New York is like getting medical marijuana in California for the last decade. I know people who got service-dog licenses solely so they can take their dog into bars to pick up women. If you have a headache, some doctor will authorize you to bring a walking health code violation anywhere these days. But — without assuming this designation has any connection to the alleged attack — this certainly seems like a clever way of making this whole affair a disability issue. There might be a claim there, I suppose.

Look laws that [target specific breeds are horrible](https://abovethelaw.com/lawline-cle/2016/11/28/doggy-due-process-how-did-we-get-to-montreal/), usually vague, and can result in the deaths of tons of innocent animals. But just as a moral matter, don’t bring racism into a discussion about f**king dog breeds. And especially don’t bring it into a discussion about what dog breeds affluent, white New Yorkers get to keep in their million-dollar plus Chelsea apartments. It’s [all lives matter on steroids](http://verysmartbrothas.com/black-people-dont-hate-dogs-we-just-hate-when-their-lives-are-valued-more-than-ours/).

“I’m confident that the New York City Human Rights Commission will take this case and prosecute,” Bailey said.

Oh God, I hope not.

# Trump Lawyer Whines To Court About Getting A Mean Voicemail From Kirkland & Ellis
## Linda Kerns is upset that lawyers who have nothing to do with her case are questioning her judgment.

Attorney Linda A. Kerns, a Family Law practitioner and FedSoc contributor from Philadelphia is doing her best to undermine democratic institutions — or at least to rack up billables for this lost cause — on behalf of the Trump campaign and she’s not happy that she’s getting flack from other lawyers for doing it. Specifically, Kerns is upset that a Kirkland & Ellis associate called her and left a message that “speaks for itself and by any measure falls afoul of standards of professional conduct,” though Kerns is unwilling to actually detail any of it in the filing. Now Kerns wants the court to sanction Kirkland:

It is sad that we currently reside in a world where abuse and harassment are the costs of taking on a representation unpopular with some. It is sanctionable when that abuse and harassment comes from an elite law firm representing the Secretary of State.

Kerns would very much like to speak with the manager.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As it turns out, the actual “manager” at Kirkland dug into the matter and found out that the call came from “an associate from Kirkland & Ellis who is not part of the Firm’s litigation group, has never worked on this case, and was not aware of Kirkland’s role in the case.” Most likely, this call was prompted by the work of advocacy groups — like the Lincoln Project — urging people to call Trump’s lawyers of record to express disappointment in the ongoing pursuit of frivolous or right-up-to-the-line of frivolous lawsuits aimed at disenfranchising the people who appear to have handily own the election for Joe Biden. To that end, the Kerns motion exists mostly to chill speech from fellow attorneys by forcing them to worry that expressing their professional disappointment might land them in an internal firm conflict. As she puts it in her Reply brief:

In general, every lawyer at a firm is counsel to every client of that firm. That bedrock principle of the Rules is supposed to ennoble the profession and humble its practitioners. Yet one of the world’s largest law firms thinks its very size excuses the conduct of one of its lawyers. But size is not a defense.

There are a lot of contexts where this standard makes sense, but this is none of them. Representing an adverse party is not something the firm can shrug off. That a lawyer wholly separate from a matter expresses personal opinions on it is not.

Kirkland also challenged the idea that this voicemail was “absuive” and pledged to hand over a transcript. Wait, are they suggesting that Kerns is blowing this out of proportion in an effort to extract a petty pound of flesh from a Biglaw firm? Either by securing sanctions or posturing herself as a martyr when the judge rolls his eyes and denies the motion. No one would be that hyperbolically cynical, would they?

But if there needs to be a rule saying that Kirkland & Ellis associates should not call opposing counsel and leave an abusive voicemail then all hope is lost.

# Can Open Source Licensing Be Applied to Data?
## To date, attempts to apply the open source paradigm to the realm of data have been both problematic and unsuccessful.

Open source software has permeated the technology world in nearly every industry over the past decade. In fact, a majority of organizations today are using open source software in at least some capacity.

Open source software is software that users can access in source code form, without limitations on the scope of its use or whether it can be modified or redistributed in the future. There are numerous open source software licenses, each with their own compliance requirements.

The success of the open source model as applied to software has made many question if the same ideas could be applied in the area of data, especially as business across all sectors has become increasingly data-driven.

To date, however, attempts to apply the open source paradigm to the realm of data have been both problematic and unsuccessful. To learn why, register for PLI’s upcoming  one-hour program, [Beyond Open Data: The Only Good License is No License.](https://www.pli.edu/programs/beyond-open-data--the-only-good-license-is-no-license?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2)

The session will cover a number of the most pressing topics relevant to the open source data question, including:

- Where data licensing stands today
- The current legal landscape that is presenting problems for open source software-style data licensing and preventing its success
- Real-world examples of problems that have arisen in data licensing, particularly with AI
- Some best practices for the use of licensed data, as well as for the release of that data
[Register today](https://www.pli.edu/programs/beyond-open-data--the-only-good-license-is-no-license?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) to learn more about one of the biggest evolving issues in tech today.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Almost 150 Buyouts Across The Country
## Associates are getting concerned about the firm's financial health.

Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer combined their practices a little more than one year ago, and for those who were nervous about the merger from the get go, the chickens have officially come home to roost. The firm recently [revamped its branding](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-firm-boots-merger-partner-off-its-new-branding/), such that it will only known as Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer on paper; the firm will be referred to Arnold & Porter everywhere else. That’s not the only big change the firm is planning to make.

When the merger was [first announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/two-new-york-and-d-c-powerhouses-arnold-porter-and-kaye-scholer-agree-to-merge/), support staff were “nervous and uncertain about their futures”; after all, layoffs often come first for administrative personnel.

Yesterday afternoon, a kinder, gentler form of layoffs came for certain staff members at Arnold & Porter. The firm is offering voluntary buyouts for all of its legal secretaries in the country. UPDATE (02/07/18): The firm states that the buyout offer was made to [140 legal secretaries](https://biglawbusiness.com/arnold-porter-offers-voluntary-buyouts-to-140-secretaries/). Here’s the pertinent part of the memo that A&P sent to its associates — prior to alerting its legal secretaries about the buyouts — to notify them about the forthcoming staffing changes (and likely changes to their work routines):

[W]e are announcing today a voluntary buyout for legal secretaries, the parameters of which follow:

• The buyout is open to U.S. Legal Secretaries, but not to Legal Resource Assistants or Patent Legal Secretaries.
• Legal Secretaries will have until March 26th to accept the terms of the resignation program. Anyone who accepts the resignation program will leave the Firm on April 6th.
• A generous severance and outplacement package will be offered to any Legal Secretary who chooses to take this offer.

In developing this program, we are confident that we will be able to continue to meet the needs of our clients and our attorneys. It is important to emphasize to all that this is not a layoff but rather is driven by the manner which we and our competitors are delivering secretarial services.

One of our sources at A&P is concerned about the financial health of the firm: “Given the emphasis on ‘integration’ after the merger, announcements like this, combined with the ‘rebranding’ that took place recently, are leaving associates to wonder what’s happening/going to happen behind the scenes with management. I wouldn’t say associates are concerned for their own jobs (yet), but I do think it’s safe to say associates are concerned about the overall direction of the firm.”

This leaves us wondering what will happen to Arnold & Porter’s legal secretaries if not enough of them choose to accept the firm’s buyout offer by March 26. We have a feeling that the next mass email may be about secretarial layoffs.

We wish all of the legal professionals at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer who accept the buyout the best of luck should they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry.

UPDATE (1:45 p.m.): [Richard Alexander](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/a/alexander-richard-m), the chairman of Arnold & Porter, sent this firmwide email in response to Above the Law’s reporting on the buyout program:



If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know; this is a subject we cover quite closely. Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477) with any information you might have. Thank you.

# MoFo Delights With Associate Raises
## Damn! Those are some nice raises!

Associates won’t be cursing out this Biglaw firm — not after they all just got big-time raises!

Of course Morrison & Foerster matched the latest round of associate raises — they aren’t mofos, if you know what I mean. Plus, you know, the firm made $1,165,000,000 in gross revenue last year (making it 34th on the Am Law 100), so it’d be in pretty bad form if they opted to sit out the latest in compensation wars.

The new salary scale at MoFo is as follows, effective July 1:

- Class of 2021: $202,500
- Class of 2020: $205,000
- Class of 2019: $215,000
- Class of 2018: $240,000
- Class of 2017: $275,000
- Class of 2016: $305,000
- Class of 2015: $330,000
- Class of 2014: $350,000
- Class of 2013 and senior: $365,000
And summer associates will also see the benefit of these raises (matched to the class of 2021).

Congrats to MoFo associates on their raises!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Whatever one thinks of Remington’s liability for marketing the gun used to murder 20 six- and seven-year-old Sandy Hook elementary students and six adults, we should all be able to agree as lawyers that this is some seriously f**ked-up discovery.

Remington is being sued by the families of five of those children and four of the adult victims have filed a wrongful death action against the gun manufacturer for recklessly marketing its AR-15 offering. It’s a bold legal theory and one that frankly probably won’t work with proximate causation being as narrowly construed as it is. Despite seemingly having traditional legal theories on their side, Remington’s attorneys — [Day Pitney](https://www.daypitney.com/) — have a little discovery request that they apparently believe is likely to result in the production of evidence relevant to the underlying claims or defenses. To wit, they “[subpoenaed the academic, attendance and disciplinary records for five slain students](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/03/1033950752/remington-subpoenas-the-school-records-of-children-slain-at-sandy-hook).” And also the employment records of the adults.

Once you get over the initial horror of this request in a lawsuit about marketing campaigns, take a second to consider the rationale of Remington’s lawyers — because they haven’t offered one as yet. As I see it, there are two reasons to request the disciplinary records of murdered children and both of them are entirely messed up.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
One, Remington is going with some “he’s no angel” defense as is de rigueur whenever a child is gunned down these days. Like they’re trying to build the case that these were the sort of kids that wouldn’t follow safety instructions when a madman hopped up on the Rambo imagery of the gun industry’s marketing campaign decided to go on a killing spree. Which is particularly loony considering the death toll beyond the plaintiffs because the argument would have to be that 26 people — mostly children — were all negligent in their own deaths thereby relieving Remington of liability even if its marketing proximately caused the shooter to show up at school that day. What is the argument? “Exhibit A: Timmy never slept all the way through nap time”?

Two — and frankly more horrifying — Remington’s lawyers are prepared to go full red pill and argue that Sandy Hook is a false flag operation and that these students never actually existed. Putting aside the absolute monster of a person a lawyer would have to be to go down this road, it also makes no sense even within the internal logic of the conspiracy theory. Do these people think that a shadowy entity willing to create an elaborate “illusion” of human carnage would just sleep on building a fully realized backstory of false records? The Alex Jones-influenced numbskulls think there’s simultaneously a conspiracy so elegantly pulled off that only they can see it and that the people pulling the wool over the eyes of the rest of the world are so sloppy that they’d make it easy enough to unravel with a Cracker Jack decoder ring. Say what you will about “John Rockefeller was part of the Illuminati,” at least it makes internal sense.

And that’s it. I can’t even begin to think of a third possible reason why Remington would need these records in a case about its marketing. Neither can the plaintiffs’ attorneys:

Koskoff said there was “no explanation” for the decision by Remington to seek the records. “The records cannot possibly excuse Remington’s egregious marketing conduct, or be of any assistance in estimating the catastrophic damages in this case,” he said, according to the Post. “The only relevant part of their attendance records is that they were at their desks on December 14, 2012.”

UPDATE: All right, yesterday was hectic and I totally blanked out on this. There is ONE other reason for this which is just as morally repugnant. They may be setting up a “future earnings” argument, basically arguing that little Johnny pushed someone on the playground and therefore couldn’t become a millionaire (even though that’s entirely the profile of an I-banker).

# Abortion Rights Are About To Be Destroyed So Biglaw Firm Piles On The Bullsh*t

The Supreme Court is pretty busy [radically remaking established constitutional doctrine](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/gun-ruling-proves-supreme-court-just-coasting-on-vibes-at-this-point/). But the most seismic decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, has yet to be issued. However, given the[ leaked draft decision](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/unprecedented-scotus-leak-shows-just-how-little-respect-the-court-has-for-you-know-precedent/), we know [what awfulness](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-supreme-court-has-only-scratched-the-surface-of-awful/) is likely headed our way.

Now, there are lots of ways a firm can deal with the upcoming decision and, honestly, the leadership at Goodwin Procter picked an absolute stinker.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Chairman Robert S. Insolia and Managing Partner Mark T. Bettencourt decided to send a message out to the firm, given the anticipated ruling in Dobbs. And wooboy, is it a doozy. One tipster called it “unacceptable and an outrage!” while another begged Above the Law to “roast” the firm. Under the sus subject line “Common Ground,” they start out by noting the Dobbs decision is expected soon. But then things go off the rails:

This decision — whether to affirm, modify or overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey — will be a divisive one, and will be deeply disappointing to some members of of community and welcome news to others.

The actual fuck? This gives big Charlottesville “very fine people on both sides” energy.

No matter how strongly we may feel at the moment, we should remind ourselves that we strive to build a firm where everyone feels they belong, regardless of political, religious and other beliefs and practices.

Tell me your rights aren’t the ones being abrogated without telling me your rights aren’t the ones being abrogated.

Seriously, Rob and Mark, this isn’t some academic exercise where reasonable minds can agree to disagree. It’s the denial of a fundamental right and destroying access to (and potentially criminalizing) a [life-saving medical procedure](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-abortion-false/fact-check-termination-of-pregnancy-can-be-necessary-to-save-a-womans-life-experts-say-idUSL1N2TC0VD). But sure guys, let’s be way more concerned about whether conversation at the water cooler remains cordial. PRIORITIES.

In the epic battle between politeness and defending constitutional rights, Goodwin has cast its lot with politeness. That’s… not a good look.

Doing so helps ensure that despite our differences, we have shared beliefs and principles that unite us and around which we can coalesce.

If the firm won’t stick up for the rights of [43% of its attorneys](https://www.nalpdirectory.com/employer_profile?FormID=14984&QuestionTabID=34&SearchCondJSON=%7B%22SearchEmployerName%22%3A%22goodwin%22%7D), what the fuck are the “shared principles” folks at the firm are supposed to “coalesce” around? The desire to make a shit ton of money?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
It shouldn’t be difficult to muster more concern for those whose rights are under attack than for those who want to gloat we are another step closer to theocratic rule, but here we are. This attempt at measured reasonableness reads as absolute bullshit draped in a veneer of respectability. This is the worst kind of gaslighting that patronizes people who are angry their rights are being taken away in front of their very eyes to PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

Honestly, the more I read this email, the angrier I get. And judging by the comments Above the Law has been receiving by the bucketful from folks at the firm, I am far from alone. It doesn’t matter all [the accolades](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/firm/diversity-initiatives-women) the firm receives (seriously they were[ just honored](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/elite-law-firms-recognized-as-some-of-the-best-for-women-2022/) as a top firm for women, but um, this email tells a VERY different story) when they care more about the emptiness of being “nice” in the face of an outright assault on constitutional protections.

Given the anticipated loss of reproductive freedom, there’s been an influx of support from Biglaw. Twenty-three major law firms have [come together to create the The Legal Alliance for Reproductive Rights ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/biglaw-firms-finally-speak-up-in-wake-of-scotus-leak-and-theyre-prepared-to-defend-abortion-rights-in-america/)to provide pro bono civil and criminal defenses. And that’s [far from](https://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2016/05/big-law-women-talk-about-abortion-their-own.html) the [ only time Biglaw has stepped into the breach](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/top-law-firms-vow-fight-texas-abortion-law-even-if-it-costs-them-2021-09-16/) to defend abortion rights, putting their[ money where their mouth is.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/big-law-pro-bono-takes-on-heartbeat-abortion-restrictions)

And those are wonderful responses that truly demonstrate a firm’s priorities. But, hell, literally doing nothing would have been superior than the drivel that Goodwin put out.

Do better.

With a wave of its wand, the very first Magic Circle firm has cast a spell to summon tens of thousands of dollars into the bank accounts of its deserving associates. Congratulations!

This afternoon, in a memorandum emailed from global head of U.S. practice [Tom Shropshire](https://www.linklaters.com/en/find-a-lawyer/tom-shropshire) (who is currently in London), Linklaters announced that it would be matching the Cravath bonus scale for all of its U.S. associates, worldwide. Bonus payouts to associates will be made on December 22, 2017. The firm took so “long” to announce its bonuses this week that it didn’t even feel the need to include the relevant scale in its memo. The full memo, complete with a cutesy subject line “The one e-mail from me everyone will read…,” is on the next page.

Linklaters being the first Magic Circle firm to match this year’s market bonuses speaks volumes. When will the rest of the firm’s cohorts with U.S. offices — Allen & Overy, Clifford Chance, and Freshfields — conjure up cash for their associates?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
That’s our take on the Linklaters bonuses. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we promise we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

(Flip to the next page to see the Linklaters bonus announcement.)

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) team of expert contributors. [Cordell Parvin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellparvin/) is a Senior Director with [Lateral Link](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) based in the Dallas, Texas office. Prior to coaching and recruiting lawyers, Cordell built a national construction law practice at an Am Law 100 law firm. Cordell is a well-known speaker, writer and blogger on career development and client development. He has made presentations to law firms and bar associations throughout the US and Canada. Cordell has published four books on career and client development. You can subscribe to his blog at [http://www.cordellblog.com/](http://www.cordellblog.com/), connect with him on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellparvin), join his [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cordell-Parvin-Lawyer-Coaching/222291473905?ref=ts), and follow him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cordellparvin).

Over the course of my career, I have learned many client development strategies that helped me attain my goals. Not even strategy is made equal, and these are five of the most important client development strategies you can add to your arsenal.

Client development is not about “marketing or selling.”

I once coached a lawyer who told me she didn’t want to be a saleswoman. I told her she didn’t have to sell anything

Client development is all about serving and caring for your clients. When you are selling, you think about what you need and want (origination credit). When you serve and care for your clients, you focus on them. As a result, you are a better listener and you search for a way to accomplish their objective, not yours. You understand the business context of the work you will be doing for the client.

Being a highly skilled lawyer is merely the price you pay to get in the game.

When I was a young lawyer, I was told to “do great work” and wait for the telephone to ring. I did what I thought was great work and the phone didn’t ring. When I took time to understand my clients’ business and started identifying potential legal issues and writing and speaking on them, the phone started ringing.

You have to build a reputation for doing high quality work. But it takes more. Your competitors are highly skilled also and they are building the same reputation for doing high quality work. So, what makes you different?

Client development not just about what you do.

Clients don’t care about what you do. They only care about how what you do helps them achieve their goals or avoid problems. When I began as a construction industry litigator, I was focused on litigation. I learned over time that most contractors never want to try a case. They want to resolve disputes as early as possible. That revelation changed my focus.

Strive to differentiate yourself from your competitors.

Just suppose you were the best in your law firm at some aspect of law that clients need. Then, just suppose you became known as the best in your city and maybe later the best in the state. If your expertise is in an area that continues to be needed and one that you truly enjoy, you will likely get opportunities to serve clients and then you can build a long-lasting client relationship.

Once you have built that reputation, seek once again for ways to differentiate yourself or your firm from your competitors. You should focus on how you deliver your service. How can you be more responsive and more efficient?

Client development is about identifying and providing solutions to problems before the client realizes there is a problem.

When I joined my last law firm, I had all my files and books on moveable book cases in the hallway. I marched off to two days of orientation.

When I returned late Friday afternoon, I met a young man named Mason. He worked for our facilities management group. He said to me: “Mr. Parvin, I know you need everything organized so you can hit the ground running on Monday. If you would like, I would be happy to come in on Saturday and help you get organized.” I was blown away. Mason clearly understood the problem and offered a solution before I mentioned the problem.

I learned the same lesson later that year. I had invited executives from my largest client and their spouses to Dallas to a Cowboys football game. On the Monday preceding the game, I got a call from Jan in our marketing department. She said: “Cordell, how would you like for me to drive with you to Texas Stadium, show you which exit to get off the freeway, show you our assigned parking place, where to enter the stadium, which elevator to get on, where to get off the elevator and how to find the firm’s suite?” Jan did not say it, but she could have added: “I am willing to do this so you do not make a complete fool of yourself in front of your most important client.”

Once again, I learned the importance of identifying a problem and offering a solution. Just suppose Jan would have been able to show me all she did from my computer through a video or computer-generated animation. That would have saved at least an hour and would have been even more valuable.

Long story short, don’t try to be a salesman. It will turn your clients off. Focus on how what you do can help your clients. Find a way to differentiate yourself from your competitors and answer the question of why a potential client should select you. Finally, if you can identify a problem and offer a solution before your clients and potential clients know there is a potential problem, you will go a long way at accomplishing everything I have written above.

# New York Wants Firms To Cap Attorneys' Billable Hours. HAHAHAHAHAHA [Sad Face]

The New York State Bar Association Task Force on Attorney Well-Being has made [some bold recommendations for ](https://nysba.org/app/uploads/2021/10/Report-on-Task-Force-on-WellBeing-APPROVED-HOD-no-comments-or-staff-memo.pdf) dealing with lawyers’ mental health issues. High on the list are capping billable hours, encouraging full vacations, and managing client expectation. Now, some of those are doable — hell, [Orrick’s already doing its part to make sure everyone there is taking a vacation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/). But stopping attorneys from billing more than 1,800 hours, when that is the dominant way that Biglaw makes its money? That seems like an awfully big ask.

The recommendations come after an October 2020 survey by the state bar of New York lawyers about well-being issues. And billable hours played a big role in the burnout and stress experienced by attorneys, as one respondent noted, “If I take a week off for vacation, that’s 40 hours I have to cram into the year somewhere else.” That sense of never being off was a big problem for folks:

“An overarching theme was time off. Many people requested work-life balance, increased vacation time, sick time or mental health days. Many of those requesting such things noted that they need to feel that the time off will truly be ‘off,’ meaning no expectations regarding calls or emails. Several people indicated that having backup support, so they do not come back to an overwhelming workload, is important.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This problem was particularly pronounced at bigger firms — a whopping 73 percent of those with 101-200 attorney in their office reported the lack  of downtime was an issue.

This is a cultural issue in the legal industry that must be addressed from the top down. Because we have firms basing the trajectory of an associate’s career — everything from bonuses, to assignments, to promotions — on the number of hours they bill. As the report notes, “Unfortunately for lawyers, the actions for which they reap the highest rewards over the course of their careers can frequently cross the line into unhealthy behaviors.”

Hopefully the rupture in “business as usual” caused by the pandemic provides an opportunity to make some lasting changes. The mental health of the profession depends on it.

# These Biglaw Bonuses Are For The Birds!
## Get it? Look, I'm trying to make these fun.

For folks at Alston & Bird! See what we did there? The bonuses actually match the market, but “Bird” is in the firm’s name so we playfully wrote “for the birds!” making it sound like they’re bad, but they aren’t. Oh, we are so self-satisfied with our little bonus stories.

Yeah.

There’s not much more to be said about Biglaw bonuses that match the market. At this point it’s just a temperature check to make sure the firm is not sitting on a layoff announcement. And even that may not be true anymore because Goodwin just laid people off and [then issued solid bonuses anyway](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/goodwin-bonuses-2022/).

So here’s where Alston & Bird landed for associates meeting the 2000-hour billable minimum.

Class	Bonus
Class of 2022	$15K
Class of 2021	$20K
Class of 2020	$30K
Class of 2019	$57.5K
Class of 2018	$75K
Class of 2017	$90K
Class of 2016	$105K
Class of 2015+	$115K
The firm also approved a 10% surbonus for those topping 2200 hours and 20% more for those over 2400 hours.

Bonuses will be paid out in March, so anyone eyeing a lateral move is stuck there until then… which could well rob them of a quarter of their 2023 bonus at a future home. Golden handcuffs and all that.

In any event, congratulations!

# In Defense Of Working In Biglaw

Two weeks ago, fellow ATL columnist Richard Cohen wrote a piece (sarcastically) titled, “[5 Reasons Not To Work From Home And Stay At Biglaw.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/5-reasons-not-to-work-from-home-and-stay-at-biglaw/?rf=1)” Richard’s article talked about the benefits of spurning the traditional big firm gig and instead opting for a smaller shop or cloud law firm like his. Richard bemoaned the “fear and anxiety” of working in Biglaw; having to say “Hi!” to the managing partner every day (so that he/she knows you’re there and working); along with “the yelling, the fighting, the threats and teeth-gnashing” (purportedly) inherent in Biglaw, among other things.

I’ve read and heard enough commentary from other lawyers to realize that there are firms and offices where Richard’s descriptions are accurate. I’m sure that the lawyers who work in those places don’t have a positive take on their work environment or Biglaw in general.

But accounts like Richard’s made me afraid of working in Biglaw. I assumed from the stories I read that all Biglaw firms were dysfunctional places full of terrified, miserable associates chained to their desks toiling away their lives in despair, looking for the first reasonable exit opportunity. Those fears made me very hesitant to work in a Biglaw firm.

I decided, however, that I’d have to try it and form my own opinions. I’m very glad I did because I work for a fantastic boss who doesn’t yell, scream, insult, or send nasty emails. He’s a pleasure to work for and he genuinely tries to help me develop professionally. The other partners and associates I’ve worked with in and out of my section have been, without exception, pleasant and helpful. I work a lot, but it isn’t under a yoke of terror and anxiety. I’m doing work I enjoy with people I genuinely like.

There. I said it. I really enjoy working in Biglaw. I enjoy it so much that it’s hard to imagine myself doing anything else. After reading Richard’s article, I therefore felt compelled to write about some of the great parts of Biglaw that often get forgotten or overlooked. My hope is that people who are or will be considering a position in Biglaw will recognize these positive aspects and not be scared away by the horror stories out there.

So here are five things that I think make Biglaw firms worth at least trying out.

- Interesting, sophisticated work.

You can and will work on interesting cases and engagements if you work at a smaller firm. I think it’s fair to say, however, that the relative number of sophisticated and interesting matters on which you will work will generally be higher in Biglaw. This reality seems primarily driven by the fact that clients are reluctant to send routine or commodity-type work to Biglaw firms due to Biglaw’s higher rates, and so such work is relatively scarce. This has certainly been my experience.

- A fast-paced environment.
I personally enjoy a fast-paced work environment. It keeps me engaged, increases my focus, and maximizes my efficiency. I’m never sitting around bored because there’s always something to be done. If you’re like me and you like your work environment to keep you on your toes and stimulated, then Biglaw will almost certainly check that box for you.

- Prestige and a presumption of competence.
Working at a huge firm that handles high-profile matters for high-profile clients lends the attorneys who work there a certain prestige. It seems that people (rightly or wrongly) are more likely to assume that lawyers who work at those firms are more competent and better trained. There is thus a certain level of prestige that comes with working at a Biglaw firm that you don’t typically get from smaller firms. It’s a nice intangible benefit.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- Lots of other lawyers to talk to in different substantive areas.
If you’re working on a matter and you spot something that implicates another substantive area of the law, it’s easy to connect with a subject matter expert in that area when you’re in Biglaw. Need a tax expert’s opinion on something? Have a burning question for a securities lawyer? There’s usually someone who can answer your question in your own firm just a phone call or two away. And it’s usually free advice.

It may take a little time to track down that one expert you need in a firm with hundreds of attorneys, but it usually works out to be more efficient and cheaper for the client. Without so many attorneys within your own firm to draw on, you might otherwise have to locate and retain another firm to provide guidance on some issue, which is less efficient and probably more expensive for the client.

- Deep resources.
Working in Biglaw gives you access to resources you likely wouldn’t have at a smaller firm. From dedicated marketing and business development professionals who will help you grow your practice, to financial experts who can help you drill down on your performance, Biglaw has some amazing resources for its lawyers. Utilizing these resources allows attorneys to focus more time and energy on practicing law and developing clients that might otherwise have to be spent on things like collections and general firm administration in a smaller shop. This is a huge perk for me.

Conclusion

Look, Biglaw isn’t for everyone. It’s a tough and usually intense environment. The demands are very real. But there are also some great things about Biglaw that are often forgotten that make Biglaw firms cool places to work. There are also some great people in Biglaw who can make the job fulfilling and enjoyable.

So don’t be scared away by the horror stories. Try it for yourself. You might be like me and really enjoy it.

# Associates At This Biglaw Firm Finally Seeing A Raise
## The salary wars aren't over.

Christmas came just a little bit early for associates at Holland & Knight. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2018/12/19/holland-knight-increases-first-year-associate-pay-by-20k-in-miami/), the firm gave out associate raises this fall. The Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Mid-Atlantic, New York and California offices moved over to $190,000 as a starting salary, with senior associates getting a raise although at an undisclosed amount. Miami associates also saw starting salaries raise, to $180,000.

As managing partner Steven Sonberg notes, they had to move salaries up to maintain their competitiveness in the market:

“Associate salaries at many law firms have increased over the last few months,” Holland & Knight Managing Partner Steven Sonberg said in an email. “In response to these changes, Holland & Knight recently adjusted its compensation structure to ensure that it remains competitive and properly rewards its associates for their contribution.”

Steven Fabrizio is out as the General Counsel of the Motion Picture Association of America. The move comes after he was arrested on charges of second degree sexual abuse and blackmail in Washington D.C.

As [reported by](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/mpaa-steven-fabrizio-fired-sexual-abuse-blackmail-charges-1203315135/) Variety, Fabrizio is accused of blackmailing a woman he met on a website for sugar daddies. After they’d consensually had sex once, Fabrizio allegedly coerced the victim into other sexual encounters, threatening to expose her sexual proclivities to her job, landlord and family:

According to a police affidavit, Fabrizio is accused of threatening a woman he met on a “sugar daddy” dating site. The police allege that Fabrizio and the woman had consensual sex once on Aug. 19, after which he paid her $400. After that, she did not want to see him again. According to the affidavit, Fabrizio sent numerous texts insisting on a second meeting, and threatening to expose her if she did not comply.
“I know where you live,” he allegedly wrote. “I know where you work. Don’t think — Hospital would be happy to know that it’s young nurses are having sexual for money / Same for your landlord.”

In a statement an MPAA spokesperson expressed the proper amount of outrage over the arrest, “These charges, if true, are both shocking and intolerable to the association. We had no prior knowledge of this behavior before these charges were publicly filed.”

Prior to this dip into infamy, Fabrizio had quite the prominent legal career. Before working for the MPAA, he worked at the Recording Industry Association of America and [took the lead](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/almID/1202631261565/) in-house counsel role in the A&M Records v. Napster case, which ended the original Napster’s bid to disrupt the music industry. He also [reportedly](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2019/08/27/meet-mpaa-general-counsel-arrested-for-alleged-blackmail-sex-abuse-threats/) spent a decade at Jenner & Block as a partner and founder of the content, media and entertainment practice. His other Biglaw experience includes stints at both Cravath and Proskauer Rose as an associate. He [graduated](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenfabrizio/) from Georgetown University Law Center in 1988.

[](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/legal-tech-adoption-guide-practice-management/)Are we heading into a recession? Nobody seems to know. 

But some of your clients are probably making business decisions as if we’re already in one. 

So what capabilities should your firm be aware of? 

Here, we present “recession-proofing” steps enabled by new technology — courtesy of the tech experts who [joined a recent Non-Eventcast](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/is-law-practice-management-software-still-a-sound-investment/). 

1) You Can Embed Payment Processing Directly Into Your Platform

The easiest way to thrive is simply to make more money. 

And new technology can help you collect more of your accounts receivable — particularly as practice management software increasingly includes native payment processing. 

These features include sending an invoice to a client that includes a link to make a payment, including payment links in portals, and texting payment reminders, noted Marie Burgess of Paradigm.

“There are a number of options that make it super-easy, and the easier you make it, the more likely you are to get paid.” 

(Are you considering an upgrade to your workflow?

2) You Can Maximize Billable Time

Before you can collect your accounts receivable, you need to generate the billable work itself.

Law practice management software can help you maximize the time that is billable by taking care of administrative work. This will allow you to make more money in the first place, notes Blake Roberts of Lawmatics.

“With the practice management systems and software solutions out there — the automation, the online payments – making things as flexible and easy as possible, removing every bit of friction for the firm and their client is the best recession-proof tactic I think firms can use.” 

3) You Can Move Faster

While an economic downturn could lead to increased legal work in certain areas, it would also make speedy client service a top priority. 

The pandemic highlighted the importance of client communication — especially clients’ need for immediate answers, noted Joshua Hostilo of Filevine. 

Similarly, during times of uncertainty, clients need increased responsiveness from all aspects of their legal services.

“The clients are still looking to make money, and to get money as quickly as possible, and so with automations and the ability to move the case along at a quicker pace — I believe that is part of moving forward amid inflation and financial uncertainties,” he said.  

4) You Can Make It Easier to Onboard New Lawyers

Preparing for economic downturns also means preparing for increased job movement. 

In addition to automation and the items mentioned above, firms should use case management software to develop “work plans” or “rules” that can guide new lawyers through your processes, according to Igor Selizhuk of SmartAdvocate.

“So if you do get a new employee they can handle the case without spending years, weeks or months learning how to process a case,” he says.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

I don’t hate it (everyone talks about big law like you’re supposed to hate it).

— a midlevel associate at Latham, in response to a question found in the [American Lawyer Midlevel Associates Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/03/the-2022-midlevel-associates-survey-quotable-associates/) about what most surprised them about working at their current firm.

# A Different Kind Of Player Draft
## Younger lawyers are not just ATMs for senior partners, they are not just billable hours, but people who have lives outside of the law.

Good grief, what’s next? Some Biglaw firms are interviewing rising second-year law students for jobs already. Huh? It’s called “[precruiting](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/say-farewell-to-oci-hell-biglaw-firms-are-now-relying-on-precruiting-to-fill-their-summer-associate-classes/).” That’s “recruiting” with a “p” in front of it, like the PSAT. The first years have barely finished their wretched first year and they are already being hunted down for employment for summer associate gigs.

I can envision that this precruiting could well be extended to post bar exam job offers as well. I get that law students are anxious about opportunities, but this method of tying up candidates before they can exhale after their first year seems a bit much. Rising second years need to take a breath, some deep breaths before committing to a path that they may well regret later. The old saying, “Marry in haste, repent in leisure” applies here. Precruiting is now bumping off on-campus interviews. This is like speed-dating on steroids. And if the offer is not accepted, it may well explode. Ka-boom!

The precruiting pressure applied to these students just piles on to the pressures of law school. Some firms have told students that if they don’t accept an offer before on-campus interviewing begins, the offer can vanish, and then what? What does that say about a firm that acts in such a manner, giving the candidate no choice but to accept the offer or have it disappear? What if the candidate wants to explore other options or even choose a firm that doesn’t engage in such high pressure? The firms that aren’t doing precruiting are concerned about FOMO, so more firms will be jumping into this pool. If rising second years know where they want to go for the summer, then this is a good way for them to secure a position, but many rising second years are clueless where they want to spend their summers and their legal careers after bar passage. And there’s [no guarantee a precruiting offer will still be there](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/being-a-summer-associate-doesnt-guarantee-you-a-job-anymore/2/) when the precruit (is that a word?) has passed the bar. Landing a summer gig through precruiting may not be everyone’s definition of success. [Smokey Robinson and the Miracles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE36-7_pwI0) said it best, shop around.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For those rising second years and beyond, definitions of success are not necessarily what they were; the [pandemic made many lawyers do a full stop](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/generation-gap-widens-as-new-lawyers-redefine-success?source=newsletter&item=body-link&region=text-section), especially newer lawyers.

Unlike boomer lawyers and Gen Xers who measure success by how well we have done, that’s not necessarily how younger lawyers see things. And while that’s still one aspect of success, it’s not the only one and indeed not necessarily even the most important one today. As the Bloomberg article pointed out, the goalposts have moved, not closer together, but even further apart. The schlep (and yes, I think that’s an apt word) to partnership in Biglaw grows ever longer. Is it an equity partnership or a non-equity? How long does it take to leap from non-equity to equity, if ever? Is that a hill that younger attorneys even want to climb?

The same holds true for corporate legal departments. Usually a number of boomer and Gen X lawyers see themselves as the next generation of leadership, so it may be true that there is no room at the top. Then what? And the years of GCs working remotely are over. Time to [return to the mother ship](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/remote-general-counsel-go-extinct-as-in-house-legal-departments-move-to-hard-hybrid-world/).

Younger lawyers don’t equate the same value to working nights and weekends just because it’s accepted practice in some environments. Granted, that’s necessary at times, but to younger lawyers, there is life outside the law firm/law department, and what younger lawyers seek, among other things, is acknowledgment of that difference from those presently in charge.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Younger lawyers are not just ATMs for senior partners, they are not just billable hours, but people who have lives outside of the law. They have seen and experienced recessions and layoffs and know that jobs today have no guarantees that they’re going to be here tomorrow, and so they must plan for themselves and their families. Younger lawyers can’t afford to rely on evanescent promises that may disappear if a major client takes a hike, or the corporate entity is sold.

It’s a different world now for practicing lawyers. The various technologies today (including but not limited to ChatGPT) could not even be imagined 40 years ago. We were thrilled just to have FedEx, word processing, and fax machines. We need to respect the generational differences, figure out how to give younger lawyers places at the table, even if the table isn’t set in the same way, and value what they bring to that table.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

These are uncharted, exciting times for those looking to do business (legally!) in marijuana and hemp products. With laws evolving across the country, clients need expert advice to navigate through a haze of federal and state regulations.

Lawyers interested in practicing in this area have a robust resource in PLI Press’s [Legal Guide to the Business of Marijuana: Cannabis, Hemp and CBD Regulation](http://bit.ly/3iLsWcZ). Co-authors [James T. O’Reilly](http://bit.ly/2NrT4hs), Professor of Public Health Policy at the College of Medicine of the University of Cincinnati and author of leading references on food and drug law, and [Edgar J. Asebey](http://bit.ly/39f4VrB), a founding partner of Keller Asebey Life Science Law and a life sciences attorney with over twenty years of experience, spoke about the treatise.

What makes the Legal Guide to the Business of Marijuana stand out?

Edgar Asebey: While the state regulations that govern marijuana and the federal regulations that govern hemp and its derivatives such as CBD are relatively new, the agencies that have crafted and enforce these regulations are not. Our professional experiences give Professor O’Reilly and I a unique perspective.

Jim has been practicing law for over 40 years and has been quoted as an expert by the U.S. Supreme Court. My work in natural products (i.e., plants, microbes and fungi) -based therapeutics began in 1992 at the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health, where I worked with the natural products scientists in charge of discovering new therapeutics.

Today, clients are grappling with some of the same issues at the nexus of science, plant-derived therapeutics and regulations that we were thinking about decades ago. This insight allows us to share valuable context with readers.

[](http://bit.ly/3iLsWcZ) Jim O’Reilly: The book also stands out for its structure. We break free of the rigidity of classical law texts, offering practical insights on how regulatory controls can be satisfied with minimal red tape. The appendix lists the segments of state law that readers will actually need.

What are some issues that lawyers starting out in this area might overlook?

Jim O’Reilly: Criminal activity involving marijuana as seen on TV can catch your attention, but these days it is a distraction from the lawful cannabis business. The focus must be on the actual constraints on commercial activity; in fact, lawfully serving the needs of cannabis consumers is a commendable business initiative.

Edgar Asebey: The biggest issue that I see is the ongoing misunderstanding of how hemp and its derivatives are regulated. The framework for regulating these products already exists, as can be seen in the annual Warning Letter sent to hemp and CBD companies by both the Federal Trade Commission and Food and Drug Administration. It is great to advocate for new, better rules specifically tailored to hemp and its derivatives. But if a client places their hemp or CBD product into the stream of commerce, that product will be subject to FDA, FTC and relevant state laws. If you are advising clients, it is essential you understand these regulations.

What do you advise small law firms and individual practitioners who are interested in developing a cannabis practice?

Edgar Asebey: As regulations continue to evolve, practitioners must become familiar with the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act as well as the Federal Trade Commission Act. Particularly with regard to hemp/CBD, too many inexperienced attorneys believe that regulation of these products will look like cannabis regulation – i.e., at the state level. CBD products are, de facto, regulated like dietary supplements and OTC drugs (albeit, unapproved). Understanding the FDA and FTC regulatory frameworks will allow attorneys to better advise their clients.

Marijuana has been called “the clear winner” of the 2020 election, with voters in several states approving measures related to possession and cultivation. What trends are you watching at the state and federal levels?

Edgar Asebey: With regard to hemp and CBD, the FDA has yet to publish a much-anticipated guidance that will address some gray areas such as THC limits, toxicity testing requirements and claims that can be made for products containing hemp-derived CBD. Some states have filled this void by adopting their own rules regarding hemp and CBD-containing products, including foods. Obviously, these will be superseded by federal legislation when it occurs. Finally, both the states and the federal government will have to grapple with the regulation of newly popularized hemp derivatives.

Jim O’Reilly: The change in attitudes toward marijuana is remarkable, but for one major hurdle, simply follow the money. The 50-year-old Controlled Substances Act of 1970 blocks federally insured banks from handling the legitimate business needs of lawful cannabis dealers. While culturally, Americans have become more accepting, a political fear of being challenged as “pro-drugs” has held lawmakers back from ending the extremist “Schedule 1” view of cannabis. We will continue to monitor these issues and expect to cover big changes in further editions for years to come.

# Biglaw Partner Isn't As Famous As His Namesake

The name partner of what Biglaw firm adopted a Sr. to his name after his son, who is actually the third of his name, became famous?

Hint: The partner retired from law firm life in 1998 when the firm he founded merged with another firm (the combined firm still retains his name). He’s stayed active in retirement, serving for 15 years on the Board of Regents for the University of Washington and does non-profit work.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# $190K? That's Old News. Kasowitz Comes Over The Top On Base Associate Salary.

Well, well, well. [Complain about the lack of raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/the-top-biglaw-players-who-are-still-holding-out-on-raises/?rf=1) and, like magic, they appear. At least that’s what happened to the lucky associates at Kasowitz Benson. The firm announced yesterday that raises were in order, retroactive to July 1, and the amounts should make for some very happy associates.

That’s right, Kasowitz Benson decided to go over the top of the prevailing market rates for base compensation set by the combination of [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) and [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/). That means associates at the firm at every level of seniority get an additional $5K in base salary.

The impressive compensation scale is as follows:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

But there is some bad news. The special summer bonuses that [Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) introduced to the market and have been matched by so many firms are not happening. While the extra base compensation is nice — and might serve the associates better in the long run — mid-level and senior attorneys at the firm are still looking at less in total compensation for 2018 than associates at other Biglaw firms (barring something crazy happening with end of the year bonuses).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Will Former Stroock Partners Ever See Their Capital Again?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Our plan is to wind down the firm in an ordinary manner without the need for a bankruptcy filing. We are working closely with creditors, who understand that a bankruptcy will only divert resources that could otherwise be used to pay creditors.

We are not in a position to make any statement as to whether former partners might receive a distribution of capital. Partners are last in line after winddown costs, payments to senior lenders and payments to unsecured creditors.

— [Gary Polkowitz](https://www.teneo.com/person/gary-polkowitz/), senior managing director of advisory firm Teneo who serves as liquidation manager for Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/12/11/in-stroock-dissolution-partners-will-get-capital-back-after-hogan-lovells-is-made-whole/) on how the wind-down process is going for the failed firm. Polkowitz, who provided consulting services to Dewey & LeBoeuf in its dissolution, also said that his team has been in touch with Stroock’s creditors to “provide assurances that restructuring professionals are in place, free of any conflict of interest, to ensure that funds will be distributed fairly and equally according to the law.”

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 04.29.16
## * Given the fact that Senate Republicans have remained firm in their opposition to Supreme Court nominee Judge Merrick Garland receiving a confirmation hearing, it seems all the more likely that the vacancy left on the high court by the late Justice Antonin Scalia will remain unfilled until after Election 2016. [[Bloomberg Politics](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-04-28/obama-s-push-for-court-pick-fizzles-as-republicans-stand-firm)] * But is someone having a change of heart? ""I would have to admit it's a gamble."" Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, claims that while he hasn't second-guessed his decision not to hold confirmation hearings for Judge Garland, that it's anyone's guess as to who Donald Trump would choose to fill the position if elected as president. [[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuck-grassley-trump-supreme-court_us_57223b28e4b0f309baefffb3)] * “He said that I had to keep my attorney happy.” A Texas lawyer who was accused of trading sex with court-appointed clients for performing legal work was recently indicted on 18 counts of sexual assault and 17 counts of compelling prostitution. He faces up to 20 years in prison. We may have more on these allegations of misconduct later. [[KSAT](http://www.ksat.com/news/local-attorney-indicted-for-sexual-assault-compelling-prostitution)] * As we mentioned previously, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the District Court for the District of Columbia will be taking senior status on May 18, but we didn't know that she was chosen by Chief Judge John Roberts to take over as the presiding judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the next day. Congrats!

# Biglaw Lawyer Bills 2000+ Hours To Closed Matter... Disciplinary Committee Displeased

Padding hours is bad. No one is arguing that. But there are always gray areas where a 10-minute phone call can be rounded up or down. Or where a substantive epiphany hits during a commute. The point is there’s some acceptable leeway in the billing process and we rely on attorneys as professionals to ethically navigate those questionable waters.

That said, wherever that line is, billing over 2000 hours to a non-existent case would be over it.

The Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission[[1]](#f1)
published [its complaint against John Paul Paleczny](https://iardc.org/21PR0051CM.HTML?fbclid=IwAR1GCDV6YxwNjFifU0sVUdxbnG0cZCd34vBReNL16ma8kuGb8UMWwJpHbss), formerly of Lewis Brisbois. Lewis Brisbois has since fired Paleczny for the reasons detailed in the complaint, yet for some reason [still has his bio up on their website](https://staging.lewisbrisbois.com/attorneys/paleczny-john) (here’s [the screenshot](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-12.54.06-PM.png) if and when the firm gets around to deleting it). That seems like a substantial oversight! And yet, the further we dig into the details, this will seem entirely predictable.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It all began with a pro bono matter representing an inmate in a civil rights suit. After the judge dismissed the inmate’s claims, the partner on the matter wrote the plaintiff informing him that the firm’s representation had ended.

This was January 3, 2020.

At that point, well…

13. Between January 3, 2020 and December 23, 2020, Respondent recorded 2,061.4 hours to the Robinson matter, even though the matter had been closed and LBBS’s representation of Robinson had ended. Respondent knew by at least January 21, 2020, the lapse of the 28-day period to appeal, that the firm would not be appealing the adverse ruling on behalf of Mr. Robinson. In records created to account for the time he purportedly spent on the matter in 2020, Respondent described the work he did as drafting, editing, and amending a motion for summary judgment. For each day that Respondent claimed that he worked on the Robinson matter, he entered a description of his purported legal services and the time that he claimed he spent, with each entry specific to the tenth of an hour. Any time that Respondent spent on the summary judgment motion prior to January 21, 2020 served no purpose because the case had been dismissed and no appeal had been filed. All of the entries for January 21, 2020 and later were false because Respondent had not worked on the Robinson matter since at least January 21, 2020. Respondent knew each time he recorded time to the Robinson matter between January 21, 2020 and December 23, 2020 that his time entry was false.

That’s 2061.4 hours. For some reason, the point-4 is the funniest part to me.

Obviously the attorney is going to get the lion’s share of the blame here, but can we take a second to wonder what the hell the firm was doing this whole time? They were getting his timesheets, which for a year continued to show time entries in which he “described the work he did as drafting, editing, and amending a motion for summary judgment” even though the firm had ended the representation. Is there a billing department? Is there a partner reviewing non-billed time? Who was supervising this? Is there an assignments committee keeping track of what associates are doing? How did this go on for more than a month, let alone a year.

Scratch that, more than a year. Because for the first five and a half weeks of 2021, he recorded 245.80 hours to the summary judgment motion. That means he was on track for a 2000-hour year in 2021 too. Putting aside that the matter was closed, what kind of summary judgment motion did the firm think he was drafting for over a year?

While dishonest, at least billing time to a pro bono matter isn’t defrauding any clients. Though it would have a tangible impact if the firm keys its bonuses to hours billed.

Guess what Lewis Brisbois does?!

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
14. In 2020, LBBS awarded quarterly bonuses to associates who met an annual “billable hours” requirement. For each quarter in 2020, Respondent falsely billed enough hours to the Robinson matter to demonstrate that he would achieve the annual billable hours requirement. Based on these false representations, LBBS paid Respondent a bonus each quarter totaling $12,000 for the year.

Associates who haven’t had their passion for helping the downtrodden systematically crushed by the firm yet always complain when firms cap the amount of hours that count toward bonuses at 100 or 200. It is a wretched policy that penalizes attorneys trying to fulfill their professional obligations. But this right here is why we can’t have nice things.

In one last instance of truly astounding grit and determination, the complaint says that two partners and an administrator confronted him over the status of the case in February and he went ahead and told them he’d been working on the summary judgment motion. That’s epic levels of chutzpah.

Lest this story get better for the attorney:

21. After Respondent’s termination from LBBS, he began to seek other employment. Respondent interviewed with at least four Chicago law firms. In the course of the interview process, each of those law firms asked Respondent about the circumstances surrounding his departure from LBBS. Each time, Respondent told the law firm with which he was interviewing that LBBS had laid him off because LBBS did not have enough work to support his continued employment.

22. Respondent’s statements to the law firms that he interviewed with were false because Respondent had not been laid off because LBBS had insufficient work to support his continued employment. Rather, Respondent had been terminated on February 11, 2021 by LBBS for the misconduct described in Count I, above.

In his defense, it’s a deceit that would be pretty easy to pull off when the old firm still hasn’t removed his profile. Frankly, he was being generous by admitting that he’d left Lewis Brisbois at all — he could’ve plausibly presented himself as still working there and linked to his bio and no one would’ve been the wiser.

In any event, this is a truly remarkable fact pattern, and one that should encourage Lewis Brisbois to do some serious rethinking of its protocols. Because it’s hard to deal with dishonesty, but dishonesty on the level of these allegations should be impossible to slip past the goalie.

# Biglaw Automation: Whose Job Goes First?
## All in all, AI does not spell the demise of the practice of law. Instead, its evolution will allow attorneys to focus on more substantive work

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/1) is Managing Principal at Lateral Link, focusing exclusively on partner placements with Am Law 200 clients and placements for in-house attorneys.

There’s a new attorney named ROSS in BakerHostetler’s bankruptcy practice and it doesn’t eat, sleep, or complain about bonuses. Back in May, the Texas firm announced it would be the first to integrate artificial intelligence into its practice. Since then, Latham has entered into the fray, along with the Milwaukee-based Von Briesen & Roper.

For those fearing for their job security, don’t fret yet. The implementation of such software faces into two primary obstacles, technical shortcomings and potential client pushback.

What can the software do? The program is multi-faceted; its four main components are machine learning (continuously using data points to improve performance), natural language processing (interpreting text and using linguistics and key words), image interpretation (identifying and describing images), and discourse (back and forth communication between the user and the software).

What are the limits of this? Law, though codified and exhaustively documented, often hinges on the ambiguity of semantics — the meaning of words — to shift decisions or leverage one way or the other. The Supreme Court’s often-divisive and contentious rulings are a testament to this. Since languages evolve, so must a computer’s understanding and ability to contextualize the language to the time period. Misinterpreting language would be an egregious mistake for an attorney — though a few hundred years earlier, egregious would have actually been a compliment. As we see, language evolves.

Nonetheless, the software is an invaluable tool for law firms. In its current iteration, ROSS can only really aid in finding relevant resources, pretty much the lowest level of work an associate is tasked with. However, there are plans to expand its capabilities to contact review, drafting, e-discovery and more. In fact, there already exists an AI capable of drafting claims.

Meet DoNotPay, the world’s first autonomous robot lawyer. To date, the bot has contested over 250,000 tickets, winning 160,000 of those cases. How does it work? In the same way a lawyer does. It asks relevant questions using simple conditionals to determine the circumstances of your case, the relevant case law, and the eventual outcome.

Here’s an abridged example of the logic it follows.



Once it determines the facts of the case, it pulls relevant case law, collects your identifying information, and in a nanosecond, prints out an appeal like this:

To whom it may concern,

Thank you for taking into account my appeal. I am appealing on the basis that the alleged contravention did not occur because of contradictory signage.

Though the ticket is the result of allegedly Parking In Restricted Zone, I argue that the signs failed to adequately inform me of the regulations. I believe that because two signs conveyed alternate instructions, the rules of parking on 180 2nd St were unclear. Therefore, I argue that no offense has been committed under Article 4 of the Rules of the City of New York. I arrived on 180 2nd St and intended to park lawfully. However, when I observed the two signs, the following contrast immediately became clear:

Sign 1 had the following implication: No Stopping Anytime

Yet, sign 2 had the following implication: No Stopping Between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., 2 Hour Parking.

As the first sign was above the second, the contrast between these two instructions prevented me from making an informed decision about how to act. For this reason, I assert that liability for this penalty charge notice should be removed.

I believe that the court should exercise fairness in canceling a ticket that, according to the guidance, is perfectly justified to be canceled. I will of course endeavor to avoid this again, but I feel that the issue of a ticket is an unlawful action inconsistent with precedent.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you,

Michael Allen

Where these programs fail however, is in their discretion. The existing legal-augmenting software has a profound lack of subtly. In the example above, the program had a set number of questions and outcomes it could walk you through. While this works reasonably well for traffic tickets, we won’t see it anytime soon in bet the company litigation. The logic behind these programs relies on Boolean Logic, comparisons that are either true or false. The law is not so binary; trials rely on nuance and flexibility that are not yet native to the existing AI offerings.

From a technical standpoint, the AI revolution is a ways away. Until one firm proves that the AI operates more efficiently than human associates and paralegals, the software will serve more to increase attorneys’ efficiency than fully supplant them. It won’t likely be a Biglaw firm that bites the bullet first. Biglaw is slow to change, and its adoption of technology is incrementally slow.

One firm in particular however, is striving to accelerate the advancement of legal technology. Dentons launched NextLaw Labs in May of 2015 to develop technologies that would enhance the practice of law. Dentons is actually an investor in ROSS, though it has yet to publicly implement the service. With margins tightening and clients weary of growing rates, the adoption of legal technology will be the next revolution in Biglaw — even if it’s not a fully autonomous lawyer.

Clients may also push back against the use of AI technology for their representation. Unless AI is used to reduce the costs of legal representation, clients won’t find it palatable to eat market rates for automated work.

There’s also the dilemma of human error vs. machine error. The same conundrum plagues self-driving cars. Autonomous automobiles have a relatively sterling safety record compared to human driving, but have not been without miscues. Back in June, a Tesla Model S was involved in a fatal crash while in self-driving mode. The accident was caused when a tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the car, and it failed to automatically apply the brakes. IBM’s Watson, the prototype of ROSS, is known for [making mistakes itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2wQQ-xSE4s). Even though these programs outperform humans in their respective tasks, there will always be pushback from those who prefer human error and the assignable culpability that follows it.

Concerning liability, will insurance providers indemnify software developers against potential billion dollar errors caused by machine error? Will developers actually be able to discharge liability against machine error in waivers of liability?

The litany of questions surrounding the efficacy and implementation of AI attorneys means that fully, or even a partially, autonomous lawyers with significant responsibility and oversight are still decades away from fruition — at least in Biglaw. When the AI revolution does come, those in danger of losing their jobs will mostly be contract attorneys performing document review and discovery, paralegals conducting research and underperforming associates. However, a new class of workers, in charge of managing and troubleshooting these programs, will likely develop.

All in all, AI does not spell the demise of the practice of law. Instead, its evolution will allow attorneys to focus on more substantive work — though perhaps at the cost of their billable hour. Nonetheless, the time reclaimed from busywork can be allocated to more meaningful matters for more clients, meaning the net revenue could remain equal.

# The Best Biglaw Firms, Ranked By Summer Associates (2019)
## What matters most to summer associates? Here are the Top 10 firms.

The summer of 2019 was pretty exciting for summer associates in that law students who received offers of permanent employment knew that they’d be making bank after graduation. But it’s not just superb salaries that summer associates were satisfied with. According to a new survey from the American Lawyer, they were quite happy with just about everything having to do with their experiences in Biglaw.

So, what matters most to summer associates, and which firms did they like the best?

Before we get to the rankings, let’s discuss the methodology used by American Lawyer. As usual, firms were ranked by their average scores based on nine categories: interesting work, real work, training and guidance, partner-summer associate interaction, associate-summer associate interaction, communication of goals and expectations, accuracy of firm self-portrayal, inclination to accept full-time associateship and overall rating as a place to work. This year, for the first time ever, Am Law included a tenth category, asking summer associates whether they were concerned with their mental health or well-being as an attorney.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Without further ado, here are the Top 10 firms (ranked through No. 9 due to ties):

1. Clifford Chance: Average score 5
1. Duane Morris: Average score 5
1. Kramer Levin: Average score 5
1. Stroock: Average score 5
5. Drinker Biddle: Average score 4.990
6. Goodwin Procter: Average score 4.968
7. Blank Rome: Average score 4.966
8. Paul Hastings: Average score 4.954
9. Bracewell: Average score 4.953
9. Proskauer: Average score 4.953

Click [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/09/23/the-2019-summer-associates-survey-wined-dined-and-worried/) to see the full rankings. (Here’s a little spoiler alert: Thompson Hine is ranked dead last due to average scores below 4 for training, partner interaction, and communication of goals.)

So what was the most important to millennials, aside from work-life balance? Mental health. Thanks to Am Law’s inclusion of a ranking on that subject, we now know that 42 percent of summer associates are concerned about their mental health, their emotional well-being, and the pervasive substance abuse that seems to be ever present at Biglaw firms. Here’s some additional detail from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/09/23/the-2019-summer-associates-survey-wined-dined-and-worried/):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“It’s no secret that working in Big Law is often unsustainable for a majority of the population. The hours are long and you face incredible stress,” said a Houston-based summer associate. “It’s undoubtedly something that I’m worried about in the future, especially if I want to have a family.”

Some are worried that Biglaw’s atmosphere will exacerbate existing mental health issues.

“I have clinical depression and anxiety, so it’s always a concern, especially in a high-stress environment,” a Washington, D.C., summer associate said.

“I have a history of mental health issues in my family and want to make sure I’m taking care of myself as I embark on this new career,” said a respondent in San Diego.

Others lamented the high rate of substance abuse in the legal industry, even going as far as to note the amount of drinking they saw at their summer firm.

This year, diversity was a bit of a mix bag when factored in to the rankings. While diversity was one of the most frequently mentioned criticisms when asked what they’d change about their firms, only 11.4 percent of respondents ranked diversity in their top three factors in evaluating an offer. “Hire more female partners,” said a New York summer associate. Another summer associate in Silicon Valley, said, “Focus more on diversity, not only at the summer associate level, but in upper leadership as well.”

And one summer associate in Washington, D.C., took issue with having to pay for tampons out of dispensers in the office bathroom, a sign, she said, that the firm does not take diversity seriously.

“This is the first time I’ve seen that in a workplace, ever. And I’ve had some not-glamorous jobs,” she said. “If I saw that when I was interviewing, it would have sent me a very clear message: women aren’t heard at the decision-making table here. It’s not about the money; it’s the message.”

Things need to change in Biglaw, and if these firms want to keep their scores high on these summer associate surveys, they need to change fast. In the meantime, congratulations to all of the firms that earned the respect and appreciation of their summer associates — you’ll be paying it back to them in big bucks in just a few years.

# Predictions For 2021
## Continuing his annual tradition, columnist Mark Herrmann makes his predictions for the coming year.

Predictions that people made on January 1, 2020, about what they expected for the coming year were blown out of the water by March. I plead guilty: My [predictions for 2020](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/175578577710328373) were an abomination. (So was the entire year 2020, now that we’re thinking about it.)

On the other hand, I did okay with my COVID-19 predictions. I told you early on that hydroxychloroquine was [unlikely to work](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/175578577710328373) as a treatment for COVID-19. Even the FDA didn’t predict that; the FDA first granted an emergency-use authorization allowing hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, before [later revoking the authorization](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/175578577710328373). Who are you going to believe about complex medical issues — those silly experts at the FDA or me?  (Alright, alright: Even a blind squirrel finds an acorn every once in a while.)

So, too with the surge in COVID-19 cases after the Christmas holidays. [I warned you about it a month ago](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/175578577710328373); the physicians only started talking about it late in December. (The physicians must have known that COVID-19 would surge after the Christmas holidays. Maybe the media reports only today’s news and can’t look even a month into the future. Or maybe health professionals didn’t want to scare people, whereas I’m irresponsible and didn’t care. Either way, I was talking about it before most others in the media.)

But enough of self-criticism and boasting. What does my crystal ball see for 2021?

First, on the general political/legal front: We’ll see a bunch of legislation to restore the presidential norms that Donald Trump broke.

Here’s my thinking: Many of the things that Trump did violated well-established and worthwhile norms. Just about everyone knows that.  Democrats know it and say it aloud. Republicans know it but won’t say it aloud. But everyone knows it.

With Trump out of office, Congress can pass a few laws purportedly to rein in that lunatic Joe Biden. The laws won’t be specifically aimed at Trump; Biden will be in office and will approve the reforms. Congress will want to do something to ensure that we don’t have another norm-busting president in the future.

I’m not quite sure which reforms will be enacted in the coming year.  Presidential candidates being required to release their tax returns? More effective ways of controlling conflicts of interest in the Oval Office? Better guidelines about whether the president or presidential campaigns can be investigated and who should conduct those investigations? New rules governing executive branch vacancies?

Maybe clever people could even devise reforms to the pardon power. As a matter of constitutional law, the president has the unfettered ability to pardon people. But could we impose some requirement that pardons be granted and made public before elections, rather than after them, to cause the president to pay a political price for doing outrageous things?

Those and similar reforms are probably needed, and Congress can start thinking about them once Trump is out of office.

Here’s my second prediction, and one that’s more specifically legal: There will be a second wave of retail bankruptcies early in the new year.

January is typically a good time for retailers to declare bankruptcy: Retailers have just been paid for Christmas purchases, so they have maximum cash on hand. This year, however, we’ll see more than the usual number of bankruptcies. Holiday sales will not be enough to save some struggling retailers. And, as a general matter, many retailers are poorly structured — too many bricks-and-mortar stores, not enough online, you know the drill — and retailers can use bankruptcy to restructure debt and be more competitive after COVID-19. (I’m really thinking about private companies in the retail space. It’s harder for public companies to use bankruptcy strategically, given what happens to their public shareholders.) If you see more retail bankruptcies early in 2021, you heard it here first!

Finally, the practice of law. I suspect the practice of law will change in at least two ways in the coming year. First, business travel will stay depressed for a good long time. I’ve always thought that Los Angeles partners “stopping in for lunch” with their Chicago clients was ridiculous. The LA partner wanted to visit Chicago to see his kids, or for a wedding anniversary trip, or to get his hair cut, and used lunch with a client as a subterfuge to get the firm to pay for the trip.

We now know that many meetings, and perhaps even depositions, can be conducted long-distance, and cost-conscious clients will insist that firms make use of that new knowledge. Some airlines and hotels may continue to suffer as businesses decide that they can travel less in a post-COVID world.

On the other hand, lawyers will want to return to the office, at least a few days each week.  It’s hard to tell your whole family to be quiet for seven hours while Mom or Dad conducts a deposition from the home office. Lawyers need space. Not only that: It’s hard to develop a collegial culture, and train new associates, when you’re speaking to people only by Zoom or telephone.

Zoom and the phone are great, but for some purposes offices are greater.  Lawyers will want to go back to their offices a few days per week, and office space will still be needed in a post-COVID world.

Last but not least — not a final prediction for 2021, but a wish: Have a happy and healthy one!

It’s time once again to compile our annual list of the [top law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-2022/) in the country, according to the people who know best — you, the in-house attorneys who hire them.

ATL’s Outside Counsel Rankings are based not on deal volume, partner profits, or associate quality of life, but on the aspect most fundamental to a law firm’s business — what their clients think of them.

We invite all in-house attorneys to tell us about the firms you work with. Whom do you hire most often for routine matters? Which firms do you call on when the stakes are highest?

# Some Biglaw Seniority Norms Are Pretty Messed Up
## Everyone understands that junior attorneys need to work themselves up the corporate ladder, but they still deserve credit for the hard work they do for clients.

It is pretty well understood that in order to progress within Biglaw, you need to put in your time, and climb the corporate ladder.  Everyone knows that first-year associates will not be arguing important motions or presenting cases in front of juries until they have spent years working on more menial tasks at a firm.  Of course, it makes sense that more experienced attorneys will conduct important tasks that senior attorneys are usually more competent to handle.  However, many Biglaw firms have seniority norms that fail to give junior associates the credit that they oftentimes deserve.

It is usually a huge honor to have one’s name included on legal papers.  It always feels great to sign your name to legal documents, and having your name on papers creates a public record of all of the work you have done.  In addition, judges usually use names on briefs when including the names of counsel in legal opinions, and being included in a decision can increase an attorney’s profile.

However, many Biglaw firms only put the names of most senior lawyers on legal papers.  Oftentimes, these attorneys did very little work in drafting the papers, and they might have only reviewed the documents once (if that) before signing the papers.  As a result, more junior attorneys in Biglaw rarely get public credit for the work they did in drafting legal documents.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I’ll admit it — there are a few good reasons why it makes sense that only the names of senior attorneys usually appear on legal papers.  Many Biglaw firms rely on a small number of rainmakers to generate the majority of their business, and clients want to know that respectable attorneys at the firm are involved with their cases.  There is perhaps no better way of broadcasting to a client that an attorney is involved in a matter than having that lawyer sign papers related to a case, even if a senior lawyer had minimal involvement with drafting the papers.  In addition, there are often many junior associates at a firm in proportion to senior attorneys.  It would be impractical to list all junior attorneys who worked on a brief (although it wouldn’t hurt to name one of two junior associates who contributed the most to a project).  Furthermore, listing a name on legal papers might have ethical implications that firms may wish to avoid.

However, allowing attorneys to put their names on papers can be a huge morale boost, and give associates more buy-in about the work they perform.  In contrast to Biglaw, attorneys at smaller firms are oftentimes free to put their name on papers whenever they wish.  While working my first job after Biglaw, I was excited to begin putting my own name on papers.  This allowed me to use real-life writing samples when applying to different jobs, and prospective employers knew I was closely involved with matters, since my signature was on documents related to those cases.  In addition, showing firms that my name appeared in a number of published opinions helped me increase my profile.  I’m not going to lie, if I thought we’d lose a motion, I’d usually let my boss sign the papers so that I had a nearly undefeated record!  However, putting my name on papers was a huge bonus while working at a smaller firm.

In addition, many Biglaw firms have extremely backwards norms when it comes to internal work product.  As an associate in Biglaw, when writing memos to people at the firm, I was urged to address the memos to attorneys in order to seniority.  Before I knew everyone around the office, I used to actually waste time looking at our firm’s website to figure out which attorneys at our firm were more senior based on their attorney profiles.  This task was extremely complicated, since I was never sure how to rank people, because some attorneys had been at the firm longer than others who had graduated earlier from law school.

We also had to list authorship of internal work product in order of seniority.  However, the fairest method would be to list authorship according to how much work the attorneys contributed to the project.  Indeed, during college, I interned at a leading nonprofit that published its internal work product this way.  As a result, my name appeared first on materials even though I was a lowly intern.  Many scientific papers also list authorship in order of who contributed the most to the paper, among other factors.  However, Biglaw’s addiction to seniority and the pecking order required that the most senior attorneys be listed on materials first, and this could lead to inefficient outcomes.  If the work product was flawed, it could be harder to tell who messed up.  In addition, it is more difficult to discern who knows the most about a matter when authorship is listed in order of seniority.

All told, there is a hierarchy in each employment environment, and everyone understands that junior attorneys need to work themselves up the corporate ladder.  However, this should not mean that junior associates deserve no credit for the hard work that they do for clients.  In addition, failing to recognize the work of junior attorneys can lead to inefficient outcomes, and firms should give more credit to associates when credit is due.

# A Funny Thing Happened On My Way To A Law Career
## What should you do if you hate what you do? How do you find out what else is out there?

I never expected to be TikTok famous. But life works in funny ways. I mean, my original plan was to become a successful trial lawyer. Which is why I became a litigation associate at the most prestigious Biglaw firm that would hire me. For some inexplicable reason, I thought being in litigation meant that I’d be cross examining witnesses or delivering closing statements.

But that’s not what happened. Instead of going to court, I found myself spending all of my time managing e-discovery, building privilege logs, and dealing with “pls fix” emails from the partners. I mean, I wanted to persuade juries! This wasn’t the kind of work I wanted to do.

So at 33, six years out of law school, I decided to start over by doing something different. I decided to join a legal tech startup as an entry level sales rep.

Friends were concerned when they first heard. “You’re going to use your law degree to sell technology to lawyers?” they asked. “Like fax machines and dictaphones?” I mean, they weren’t trying to be mean about it. They tried their hardest to be supportive. Even though what they said didn’t exactly inspire a lot of confidence.

“I think it’s so great that you’ve decided to switch to a lifestyle job,” they said, apparently not knowing what it’s like to work for a startup or carry a sales quota.

I never could have imagined it then, but pivoting to legal tech sales changed the entire trajectory of my career. I joined the space right around the time the digital transformation wave hit the legal industry. Over the next few years, things really took off. And I got to ride the wave.

That’s how I ended up doing exactly the kind of work I’d been looking for. Instead of trying to persuade juries as a trial lawyer, I found my place persuading other lawyers — as a salesman. I made a small reputation for myself, which led me to be recruited for a unicorn job that was designed specifically for me and my personality.

Which brings me to this column.

I believe we’re experiencing a career epidemic in the legal profession, where more lawyers are unhappy at work than ever. Much of it is driven by student debt or golden handcuffs. But there’s more to it than just that. I’ve spoken to so many lawyers over the years who feel trapped at their jobs. What should you do if you hate what you do? How do you find out what else is out there?

That’s how I’d like to help. Over the years, I’ve discovered that there are plenty of lawyers out there, doing incredibly interesting things. Not all of them are in tech like me. Some are still at firms or legal departments, doing cool stuff on the side. But others work in uncharted territory. They’ve founded companies, worked in highly specialized roles, or created massive audiences on the internet.

And the craziest part? Most of them work at jobs that didn’t even exist just a few years ago.

That’s what happened to me. After starting over in legal tech sales, I had this newfound sense of freedom. I lost the burden of having to follow a prescribed path to reassure myself that I was Headed In The Right Direction. That freedom empowered me to experiment and try things that I never would have if I had a traditional job.

Like TikTok. I’d heard of the app but never thought much of it. At least until a few lawyers encouraged me to try it out. [One of my earliest TikToks](https://www.tiktok.com/@legaltechbro/video/6892094649180212486?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7055824250150454790) went massively viral and I quickly learned that I was pretty decent at making silly short-form videos. It dawned upon me that these videos gave me a uniquely powerful way to engage with the legal community.

Which has business value.

My social media platform has also opened my eyes to what else is out there. By engaging with the community, I’ve learned that there’s this larger, vibrant ecosystem of lawyers and legal professionals doing really cool stuff. And in the coming weeks, I’d love to share with you more about what I’ve seen and heard. There are a lot of exciting things happening in our industry.

But if there’s one thing I hope you take away from this article, it’s this: If you want something more from your career, don’t be afraid to go off the beaten path. There’s just as much opportunity out there. Hopefully my stories will help you find something better.

Stay tuned, my friends.

We’re almost midway through December, and it’s not just the air that’s getting colder. Biglaw bonuses continue to be announced, but associates at some firms feel like they’re getting the cold shoulder from partners who have decided to attach billable-hours requirements to their special bonuses.

Sidley Austin, one of the highest grossing firms in the country, is matching the Cravath scale for bonuses and special bonuses alike, but it’s the latest firm to tack on an hours requirement to its special bonuses. To say that associates at the firm are mad would be an incredibly polite way to phrase it.

Please note the numerous UPDATES below.

Here’s what both bonus scales look like at the firm:

Class Year

2020 Year-end Bonus

Special Bonus

2012+

$100,000

$40,000

2013

$100,000

$40,000

2014

$90,000

$37,000

2015

$80,000

$32,500

2016

$65,000

$27,500

2017

$50,000

$20,000

2018

$25,000

$10,000

2019

$15,000

$7,500

So, about those hours requirements… Sidley wants associates to have 2,000 qualifying hours for full bonus eligibility (1,800 of those hours must be a combination of client chargeable and legal services to the firm hours, and the remaining 200 hours can be a combination of pro bono hours, up to a maximum of 50 hours of qualifying knowledge management/practice development, and up to a maximum of 25 hours of qualifying observational training). Fine. Whatever. Plenty of firms still have hours requirements for full bonus eligibility, even during the pandemic. What is not fine is the fact that Sidley is also requiring associates to have 2,000 qualifying hours to be eligible for the special bonus that other firms are handing out just to show their kindness and appreciation for associates’ efforts during the coronavirus crisis.

Sidley associates are enraged. Here’s just a sample of what we’ve been hearing:

People are pissed on the COVID bonus hours requirement. One partner let slip only 10% of associates at the firm are eligible.

I’m disheartened that Sidley has decided to limit the COVID appreciation bonus to those who billed at least 2,000 “qualifying” hours. That’s not really showing appreciation to all the stress associates have had to endure during the pandemic, including any periodic slowdown in work.

Sidley only giving special bonuses for 2000 hours, 1800 of which must be billable. In my group, only 2 of around 20 hit hours (normally everyone does). To say people are angry is putting it mildly. Partners spent the pandemic chilling at their lakehouses and taking private jets to vacation, and Sidley keeps bragging about how financially the firm is having a record year and beating last year. Partners are lining their own pockets with extra profits instead of compensating associates who are working under shit conditions (Sidley didn’t even offer a tech stipend or anything to help associates set up home offices after shutting down the firm offices). Morale was already in the toilet, and this made it so much worse.

Sidley Austin announced its bonus scale and associates are fuming. You’re still required to hit 1,800 for good standing, 2,000 for bonus, and they’ve tied COVID bonuses to 2,000 as well.

Sidley bonuses out. Matched market, BUT added 2000 hour requirement for COVID bonuses. Associates are livid. Not only because profits are way up, but because it’s embarrassing.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sidley being cheap as usual. We’ve seen no appreciation during the pandemic. No tech stipend, no support, no outreach, and now no COVID bonus for almost all of the associates. Hardly anyone reaching the 2,000 hour requirement.

I knew Sidley was cheap, but I didn’t expect that they would be this cheap. Of all years, this year would have been a great time to be a tad more generous like our “peer firms”, show that the firm actually cares and boost associate loyalty. Turns out all that the talk we’ve heard regarding the firm’s strong earnings and focus on our people was just… talk.

At our associate townhall this fall, mgt was asked whether our hours requirement would be waived or reduced, in recognition of interrupted deal flow and challenges that folks face at home(kids or no kids). Mgt’s response was that it would be “offensive” to be paying out high bonuses, in light of the macro-economic disaster and difficulties faced by our clients. Well, show me your PPP numbers for 2020, and we can then talk about what kind of compensation is “offensive”. And they wonder why we have low morale and trouble attracting top talent from T4 schools!

On the bright side, at least we are all working from home, and I won’t have to worry about bumping into elated Willkie Farr associates in the elevator lobby at 787 Seventh Avenue.

Only 10 percent of associates reportedly qualify for appreciation bonuses at Sidley with these requirements? Ooof. “Cheap” and “embarrassing” is probably not how the firm wants its compensation to be described by its own associates, but here we are.

On the bright side, once an associate reaches 2,000 qualifying hours at the firm, they’ll be eligible for increased bonuses. Sounds like very few people will be getting that extra cash this year at Sidley. Sorry, everyone.

UPDATE (3:25 p.m.): It seems that not everyone is miffed about the bonus situation at Sidley. Here are some additional, more positive reactions we’ve received:

I’m a Sidley associate and I think folks in my office are very happy with bonuses. Everyone in my group hit hours. Made significantly more than market including the Covid special bonus. Even folks that were way under hours are still getting 50% year end bonuses in some reduced amount. Also like the 10% of associates hitting 2k seems completely inaccurate. Year over year hours were reported to be up at least in litigation.

To the extent folks hit their hours, Sidley was extremely generous in awarding over market bonuses (even including Covid bonuses). I think associates are very pleased, at least in my group where virtually everyone was over the 2000 requirement. I also think that folks who were under 2000 got 50% of market (at least). Also the litigation practice as a whole was up over last year in terms of hours. I think the 10% eligible number for special bonuses being reported is extremely inaccurate. Anyway, just wanted to give y’all a different perspective.

I have been at Sidley for almost 8 years now and I can tell you that Sidley pays well above market bonuses every.single.year. Sidley has hours requirements like most peer firms do but they are giving bonuses this year even to people who were well-below their hours. They also expanded the allowance for hours so that people who helped with non-billable COVID research and pro bono projects got credit for those hours. And that work was available in an ABUNDANCE. No one who exerted effort to meet their hours would have been unable to do so. Every year when Sidley bonuses are paid, my junior associates call me astonished at how generous Sidley is. To characterize the firm as anything less is wrong. Just for a little context, my market bonus, including the COVID bonus would be $140K. But my bonus from Sidley is [higher than a first-year salary]. That is consistent with the level above-market that other associates at Sidley are receiving and regularly receive.

I’m thrilled with my bonus – received the Cravath scale + special bonus + $50k on top. So I’m not sure what people are talking about. Sidley’s being incredibly generous. Also simply not true about only 10% receiving a special bonus. I also don’t work with any partners that have been flying around in private jets. Might want to start doing some fact checking.

UPDATE (4:30 p.m.): And still other Sidley associates want to comment on these bonuses:

I’m a Sidley associate and have not heard ANYTHING positive about the bonuses. No one I know has heard anything about getting 50% of the bonus if under hours, either. Can you check your sources on that update? Sounds like HR damage control….

Regarding the article update on Sidley, I am very curious who are these people getting 50% bonuses for being “way below” hours. No one in our group who didn’t hit hours got anything, even people who were fairly close. Really emphasizes the “individualized bonuses” part – clearly they are rewarding some people over others for the same amount of work. I guess we are the new Jones Day!

UPDATE (5:35 p.m.): We received this message from a firm partner. Sidley’s management committee sent this memo around to all partners earlier this afternoon:

In regards to the Above the Law story that came out today, please know that 80 percent of Sidley associates received bonuses. A substantial majority of associates received the extra COVID bonus. The Firm paid 45 percent more in bonuses this year compared to last year. We value our associates, who are of the highest caliber and quality. We wanted you to be aware that misinformation is circulating, and to have the facts should you be approached by our associates.

Another partner had this to say: “It’s really unfortunate that a vocal minority has twisted the narrative. Sidley stepped up.”

UPDATE (12/11): And still more associates want to chime in about these bonuses, on both sides. Some people are thrilled with their bonuses, and some are not.

The associates quoted in your article about Sidley bonuses are not representative of the firm, or reality. The firm did what it has always done: provide fair compensation to people who fall short of their requirements and generously reward those who exceed expectations. For high performers, total bonuses exceed 150% of the standard + special bonus.

The positive comments below miss the point completely: Sidley is a top tier firm (and certainly charges clients as such), and our peer firms have consistently done a better job compensating their associates by having lower or no billable hours targets. We are not surprised by Sidley’s memo but are nonetheless disappointed given the special circumstances of this year and also given that the firm has reassured us on numerous occasions that the firm is in fact UP in revenue as compared to last year. From a working parent’s perspective, the most disturbing aspect of Sidley’s memo is the fact that it seems to utterly disregard our situation. The firm set up a working parents committee and yet here they are punishing us (and other caretakers) for not hitting hours when some of us have been sick, have had family members that were sick, have had to become teachers to our kids… It REALLY saddens me that the firm is not supporting us in the same way other firms are supporting their associates.

Re: the positive comments, it is highly suspicious that associates would not advocate for a compensation system that is more in line with other top tier firms. Truly bizarre. I have not heard any positive feedback from ANY associates.

Sidley Austin bonuses above market. I lateraled into the firm and received Cravath scale + COVID bonus + step up bonus. Very pleased. Importantly, all pro bono, most knowledge management, and even diversity and recruitment hours counted. It was very difficult not to make the bonus. That said, I heard that 85% of Associates received their bonuses this year. So, (obviously) there is a vocal 15% minority.

[T]o whomever is saying that only 10% of associates are getting COVID bonuses, that is utterly false. I know from multiple partners and associates that Sidley has been giving out partial bonuses, so even if you didn’t hit 1800, you’re still getting something. More importantly, the 2,000 hour requirement to get the “full” special bonus includes essentially unlimited non-client billable hours. Although in principle those are capped at 200 hours a year, this year they’ve been counting way more of those hours towards peoples’ bonus eligibility. Basically, as long as you were breathing and doing SOMETHING for the firm (pro bono, COVID-task force, article writing, CLEs, etc), you got credit for your hours and should get the special bonus.

Sidley is definitely damage controlling. No one is happy in NYC to the point we’re having a meeting with the comp committee. These reports are fake. Sidley swears they don’t give bonuses above comp so if someone got an extra 50k then Sidley isn’t following their own policy.

Every associate I’ve spoken with in my group made hours, and everyone is extremely pleased with their bonus. I am non-New York, and my personal experience has been that Sidley exceeds market every year (by a lot). This year was no exception. It is very frustrating to see some of these comments about Sidley being cheap, and I can say definitively that they do not represent associate sentiment firm-wide.

# Lawyers Should Act Like Emails Between Counsel Will Be Made Public
## As with every single thing you communicate in our post-privacy world, just assume it's all going to go on the record.

Lawyers usually communicate with counsel and other stakeholders in legal matters through email rather than communicating matters over the phone due to the convenience of typing out a message. Sure, sometimes lawyers will strategically convey certain things over the phone, especially if they want to relate something unofficially, but the vast majority of communications between counsel are conducted by email. Most lawyers understand the emails between counsel are routinely filed as exhibits to discovery motions and other applications of the parties since emails can provide insight into the happenings of a case. However, lawyers sometimes file emails between counsel that an attorney might not think will ever relate to a matter requiring filing, so lawyers should just assume all of their emails will be made public at some point.

Earlier in my career, I worked with an adversary on a variety of litigation and transactional matters for a client. I tried to build a relationship with this adversary through phone calls and emails since we both had a portfolio of work involving common clients, and I figured that it would be easier to obtain a favorable result for my client if I was on good terms with opposing counsel. One time, the lawyer emailed me about a new litigation matter filed against my client. I responded that I did not know if I would be representing the client in the matter, and I made a joke in my email just to try to build some rapport with my adversary.

Later on, my email with the joke ended up being filed in connection with the case. I am very happy that the joke was not offensive and would not really impugn me if someone read the filed email, but I was super perplexed as to why the email was relevant to the application of my adversary such that the email would be filed. It was a real stretch to believe that the communication between counsel warranted being put on the court’s radar, but the situation made me really careful about what I decided to put in emails from then on.

I am not in favor of the practice of gratuitously filing communications with counsel in connections with motions or other applications in litigation. Sure, sometimes this is unavoidable. When making discovery motions, litigants often need to show that a party had notice of a particular issue and actively decided not do anything about it. In some jurisdictions, courts require litigants to attempt in good faith to resolve discovery disputes before filing motions, and this often can only be accomplished if communications with counsel are filed. In motions to enforce settlements, the terms of communications between counsel can be extremely important in determining the terms negotiated between litigants.

However, if attorneys think that their emailed communications will be filed gratuitously, this can lead to bad outcomes. For instance, some attorneys have the courtesy of telling the sender of a notice that the document has been received so that further efforts at providing notice do not need to be taken. However, if communications with counsel are filed, and can be used against attorneys, lawyers might be less likely to provide basic courtesies like this since this can foreclose arguments that the lawyer can make on behalf of a client.

Also, the prospect of having emails with counsel filed with the court can lead to rigid and polished communications between lawyers that make it difficult for counsel to build a closer relationship. I am sure all of us have rolled our eyes at a formal and polished email we have received from counsel, and this is not the way to form a working relationship. The best way to build a connection with adversaries is through jokes, discussions of family and hobbies, and other communications not just about the matter at hand but about the personal lives of the lawyers. If counsel thinks that these disclosures could be made public, and might be read by courts, they will be less likely to share this information, which can have a negative impact on a representation.

All told, lawyers should act as if all emails between counsel will be made public since attorneys cannot control what their adversaries do with attorney communications. However, attorneys would be better served if lawyers only file communications between counsel that absolutely need to be reviewed by a court in connection with a motion.

As our friends at Litera roll out this year’s edition of their Changing Lawyer report, its findings have never been more relevant.

The report comes amid a well-documented boom in the adoption of legal technology, and lawyers are now working more efficiently than ever before, while savvy firms are gaining a competitive edge.

But how does this improve legal services from the client’s perspective?

Please join us on October 21 at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT for this webinar hosted by legal tech expert and journalist Bob Ambrogi, with Esther Bowers of Honigman, Sherry Kappel of Litera, and Kate Simpson of Bennett Jones, where we’ll explore opportunities for today’s lawyers to deliver new client value.

You’ll learn:

- How law firms are applying data analytics to deliver tailored, relevant advice.
- How technology enables client collaboration that improves revenue and results
- How your firm can overcome cultural challenges to implementing new systems

# More Law Firms Slowly Realizing That They Probably Won't Be Reopening This Year
## With 2021 on the outs, perhaps 2022 will be more realistic for reopening.

It was just last week that one of America’s top law firms introduced its [standby program](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/top-biglaw-firm-will-keep-associates-staff-on-call-instead-of-naming-third-potential-reopening-date/) — opting to keep attorneys and staff “on call” as opposed to yet again announcing (and later rescheduling) a reopening date for its U.S. offices — and several firms have already adopted a similar approach.

Ropes & Gray, which is still within the first phase of its reopening plan (i.e., permissive office use), had [already delayed](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/top-biglaw-firm-delays-next-phase-of-its-reopening-plan-will-require-vaccines-for-all/) the second phase of its return-to-office plan to October 18. Per a recent report from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/more-law-firms-scrap-october-return-plans-opting-watch-wait-2021-09-20/), the firm is yet again pushing back a broader reopening for all personnel, but no new date has been set. Breakfast and lunch will continue to be provided for those who come to the office voluntarily.

Next up, we’ve got Connecticut-based Am Law 200 firm [Robinson & Cole](https://www.rc.com/), which has also scrapped its previously scheduled reopening date. According to a memo sent out earlier this week, the firm was supposed to reopen its doors on October 4, “with the expectation that everyone be in the office at least three days a week.” Those plans, however, have now been postponed, and while no specific date has been proposed for R&C’s return, the firm will provide 30 days’ notice to all employees should there be a change of plans.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz — which [Vault](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/frankfurt-kurnit-klein-selz-pc) recently named as one of the best midsize firms to work for in New York — is also doing away with its plans for an October reopening. Here’s a relevant excerpt from a memo sent earlier this week:

We’re not going to set a new date for now. However, we will give you at least thirty days’ notice prior to our new reopening date. While we hope that we will be able to open sooner, we think that, realistically, we’ll probably open in early January. …

We so wish that we had more definite guidance to give about when we’ll be reopening. We know how stressful this time is, and how the uncertainty, and the shifting of dates, certainly doesn’t make things any easier.

While some firms seem to be desperately clinging to their October reopening dates (and some even reopened as planned in September), it’s refreshing that others have come to realize that launching a full-scale office reopening during pandemic times can’t possibly be good for associate and staff health or morale.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# On John Calhoun, Mark Esper, And Your Managing Partner Or CEO
## Most people are very reluctant to disagree with the boss...

In 1828, Congress enacted a tariff on European goods, which basically benefited the northern states and hurt the southern ones. To get a sense of how badly the North and South split on this issue, just google “[Tariff of Abominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_Abominations).” President Andrew Jackson supported the tariff, and he believed that federal laws, whether states agreed with them or not, were the law of the land. Vice President John Calhoun (a South Carolinian) disagreed violently about both the wisdom of the tariff and a single state’s ability to nullify federal law. Calhoun thought that it violated local “liberty” to have the federal government enact laws that bound the states against their will.

Thus, at a [dinner in 1830](http://www.pddoc.com/civilwar/003/019.htm) to celebrate an anniversary of Thomas Jefferson’s birth, Jackson proposed a toast: “Our Union: It must be preserved.”

Calhoun followed up with another toast: “The Union — next to our Liberty, the most dear.”

Now that’s a president and a vice president who publicly disagreed with each other.

A couple of weeks ago, when Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had the temerity to [suggest](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/politics/esper-insurrection-act-protests/index.html) that maybe the American military should be used only sparingly against the American people, President Donald Trump was ready to fire him.

In today’s executive branch, that feels like dissent.

But those are the exceptions.

Most people are very reluctant to disagree with the boss: The boss is naturally likely to think that his or her ideas are good ones. The boss hears plenty of complaining about things that are happening within the organization, the boss doesn’t need to hear more. (During a global partners’ meeting many years ago, the managing partner of a major law firm displayed a slide to the group: “No whining.” Do you suppose anyone in the audience read that to mean, “Oh! The managing partner wants to hear important suggestions that disagree with the managing partner’s own opinions”?) Basically, it’s no skin off your teeth not to propose ideas that go against the grain. The muckety-mucks propose stupid stuff. You do it. They pay you. That’s the deal, isn’t it?

I suspect that two institutional factors increase the stifling of dissent. First, the longer the boss serves, the less the boss wants to hear dissent. Over time, the boss has been flattered for a long time and becomes accustomed to flattery. The boss starts to think that the boss’s jokes really are funny and that the boss’s ideas are uniformly good. The boss doesn’t need to hear dissenting views.

Second, the larger the size of the organization, the bigger the problem.  Suppose the boss really does like to hear dissent. The boss encourages those in the inner circle to challenge the boss. That may encourage the expression of dissent within the inner circle, but it does nothing for those in the outer circle, the seventh circle, or no circle at all. Mere plebeians naturally think:  “That’s the boss. I should agree.”

How can you fix this?

You can’t, but you can hedge against it. You can assign people the role of dissident. Thus, when the company is considering an acquisition, assign a group of people to oppose the acquisition, making all of the arguments as to why the deal would be a bad idea. Those folks may get voted down, of course, but the institution has at least guaranteed that the dissenting view is presented. Those who express a strong dissenting view are doing their job well and are likely to be credited for it.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
It may, sadly, take those sorts of formal assignments to overcome the tendency to agree with the boss. It won’t work for the boss simply to say, at the end of the meeting, “Of course you should let me know if you disagree with this.” That’s a call for crickets.

I’m not calling for crickets.

I’m calling for John Calhoun.

(Wait! Wait! That’s just a rhetorical flourish. I’m not really calling for John Calhoun. States’ rights Southerners before the Civil War held beliefs that any sentient person today rejects, as do I. Or am I perhaps more sensitive about this than I should be?)

The newly minted firm of Selendy & Gay is making a splash with its inaugural bonus announcement, offering bonuses 50 percent above market. Quite the way to send a message for a firm that’s thrown itself headlong into the quest to garner the top talent on the market.

While the firm hasn’t existed for a whole year yet, they aren’t prorating these bonus amounts and leaving the laterals who joined mid-year in the lurch. All associates who joined from another firm will receive the full year’s bonus amount to reward them for taking the risk and leaving a potential bonus at their old firm on the table to join the new firm. Associates coming from clerkships or law school will see prorated bonuses.

That means Selendy & Gay associates will be receiving:

Class of 2012: $135,000

Bonuses will be paid on December 21st too.

Though as they say in the infomercials, “But wait! There’s more!” As a token of appreciation for all the associates who came to the firm in its infancy to get it off and running, Selendy & Gay is offering an additional one-off bonus based on seniority and start date.

What a way to kick off a firm! Congrats.

# Biglaw Racial Discrimination Lawsuit: Legal Assistant Claims Attorney Called Her 'Our Slave'
## The allegations are jaw-dropping.

The Biglaw firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath has been hit with a racial discrimination case. Syneetra Hill, an African-American legal assistant in their Princeton office, alleges she was paid less than her colleagues due to her race and was subjected to a hostile work environment and retaliation. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/njlawjournal/2018/07/27/legal-assistant-sues-drinker-biddle-claiming-race-discrimination/) the New Jersey Law Journal, Hill’s case was brought under New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination and the state’s equal pay act.

The allegations in the lawsuit are jaw-dropping. Hill alleges the firm “has maintained a corporate culture that is hostile to African-Americans,” and details the following alleged examples to make that point:

- A former, unnamed supervising attorney was allegedly allowed to keep a collection of Confederate memorabilia throughout their office.
- The lawsuit claims [Marsha Beidler,](https://www.drinkerbiddle.com/people/b/beidler-marsha-w) of counsel in the firm’s trusts and estates practice for whom Hill worked, referred to Hill as “our slave” in front of a client. The complaint says Beidler tried to save face by saying Hilled worked like a slave.
- Beidler allegedly told Hill to “read a good book” about how segregation was “good for blacks because at least they could go to their own colleges.”
- After seeing a picture of Hill’s infant son, Beidler allegedly said “he should be ready to get a basketball in his hands.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
When Hill complained about the alleged inappropriate behavior, the lawsuit alleges that while the firm’s investigation corroborated her statements, they also found Beidler didn’t mean any harm by her statements. According to the lawsuit, Hill was told by Drinker Biddle that Beidler’s office would be moved and she would undergo sensitivity training. However, the complaint also alleges Hill, not Beidler, was forced to move locations and Beidler never completed any sensitivity training.

Hill also claims that after she complained to the firm about the alleged discriminatory behavior, she received smaller raises and bonuses.

The firm has not made a statement about the case.

# Davis Polk Asia Chair Speaking At Event Commemorating Hong Kong Crackdown Is... Not The BEST Look
## The event's theme is 'Thrive with Security,' which must violate at least some George Orwell IP.

Solving the problem of brutal authoritarian regimes is not a simple subject. There are folks out there that feel nothing but consistent and thorough shunning of a government is the only way to stand up to its abuses. These are the folks who wanted the boycott the Olympics in China. There are others who see cautious engagement as the long-term best hope as economic interdependence and cultural soft power combine to embolden reformers. These are the folks who wanted to go forward with the Olympics in China. It’s [the old Vulcan proverb](https://clip.cafe/star-trek-vi-the-undiscovered-country-1991/there-an-old-vulcan-proverb/): only Nixon could go to China.

The relative merits of these competing approaches requires a lot more time and nuance than we have on a Friday afternoon, but I think everyone can agree that — to the extent business engagement is truly a positive — showing up at an event to commemorate A SPECIFIC CRACKDOWN is over whatever line you’re personally choosing to draw.

Davis Polk’s Asia Chair, Martin Rogers, recently announced that he’s planning to speak at an event next week called the “National Security Law Legal Forum.” That’s the Hong Kong law designed to give the government greater power to crackdown on even the whiff of protest. It runs hand in hand with a law that makes it easier to extradite Hong Kong dissidents to the mainland where Western eyes have a harder time monitoring the justice system.

For the record, the “Department of Justice” in this post is the Hong Kong Department of Justice headed by Teresa Cheng, who is — *checks notes* — [under U.S. sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1088). Hanging out with foreign officials under official sanctions is not generally considered a positive public relations move for a business.

Unless it’s FIFA or something.

Glad this is getting some media attention. “There is one reason and one reason alone that Davis Polk and Martin Rogers were invited: because the presence of a prestigious US law firm gives the event a false cover of legitimacy .” [https://t.co/vOscCbhYDG](https://t.co/vOscCbhYDG)

This mirrors the argument people made against U.S. participation in the Olympics: does it provide legitimacy? Which of course it does, but some degree of legitimizing is inevitable barring complete isolation. Davis Polk — and other firms — continuing to do business in China affords the regime legitimacy too, but a general sense of legitimacy tempered by faith that deeper ties will be rewarded with reform over time.

But showing up an event ABOUT the government’s crackdown legislation conveys a very specific sense of legitimacy about that crackdown. That’s when we cross the line into participating in propagandizing.

Law firms are, to some extent, fiefdoms and Davis Polk is a big one, so Rogers doesn’t necessarily carry the imprimatur of the firm here. On the other hand…

This is apparently not the first time Mr Rogers from [@DavisPolkReg](https://twitter.com/DavisPolkReg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) appears at a DOJ NSL forum: [https://t.co/rXe36fdwQZ](https://t.co/rXe36fdwQZ)

Rogers spoke of how important the NSL is to the “rule of law” & HK’s status as a financial centre & how good the gov is at “developing transparency” of the NSL [https://t.co/3vSyLdDBOj](https://t.co/3vSyLdDBOj) [pic.twitter.com/Y0fCgTX24G](https://t.co/Y0fCgTX24G)

So maybe the firm should’ve seen this coming.

# Biglaw Partner Gets Brutally Honest About Donald Trump's Latest Legal Woes
## A target letter is no joke.

When former president Donald Trump announced to the world he was the recipient of a [target letter](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/target-letter/story?id=101413270) courtesy of special prosecutor Jack Smith, he almost gleefully said this “almost always means an Arrest and Indictment.” However, Trump hasn’t always demonstrated the most acute legal acumen (in addition to his wild stance on capitalization). So, the public might want to take this information with a grain of salt, but a Biglaw partner is here to back up Trump’s take.

Former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and current Dechert partner [David Kelley](https://www.dechert.com/people/k/david-kelley.html) went on Ari Melber’s MSNBC show to discuss Smith’s investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and what getting a target letter means for Trump. Kelley did not pull his punches, revealing, “It means to you you’re done. It means you’re going to get indicted.” Now that Kelley works on the defense side of the white collar world, he knows that, “From the perspective of a defense lawyer, the last thing you ever want in the world is to get a target letter.”

# Financial Trouble (And Potential Layoffs) Ahead For Biglaw Firms? Wall Street Bankers Think So.
## Finance insiders think big bank layoffs are a sure thing. But will law firms follow in their footsteps?

The days of firms having someone to get junior associates their dry-cleaning is over. Firms are greedy and they’re super sensitive to maximizing profits.

— A finance industry insider, in comments given to the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2022/07/17/massive-wall-street-layoffs-feared-as-banking-profits-tank/) on the likelihood that Biglaw firms that service Wall Street banks will experience financial trouble given the dealmaking slowdown in the market. These remarks were given following a high-profile luncheon where executives from some of the biggest banks were present, with much “chatter” having to do with [future layoffs](https://nypost.com/2022/07/17/massive-wall-street-layoffs-feared-as-banking-profits-tank/). “The conversation was all about when people think hiring freezes will happen and when the layoffs are coming,” said one source. “It’s the worst-kept secret that layoffs will happen,” said another. “There is an entire generation that has never been through an economic downturn. It’s going to be new and painful for a lot of people.”

Certainly, managing partners and firm leaders are pretty anxious to get back. That’s not true up and down the line, but there is a desire to get on with it and establish what the new norms are going to be. There are different expectations across firms, but I’m guessing the Kirkland model, with some variation, will become the norm.

— Lisa Smith, a law firm consultant with Fairfax Associates, commenting on law firm return-to-office plans in an interview with [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/omicron-fades-kirkland-office-return-plan-could-help-set-legal-industry-trend-2022-02-09/). Under the “Kirkland model,” which the [firm announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/kirkland-sends-announcement-to-salary-hungry-associates-about-office-return-date/) earlier this week, associates are expected to work from the office three days each week.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hint: It’s not surprising considering the #1 firm by gross revenue, Kirkland & Ellis, became the first U.S. law firm to top $4 billion in revenue last year, with $4.154 billion.

There are some benefits to a Biglaw firm that moves nimbly and quickly matches whatever salary raises market leaders announce. You get a bunch of publicity, associates are happy, and you prove your willingness to stay at the front of the Biglaw pack.

But there’s also a downside — that is, if another firm (cough, Davis Polk, cough) decides to come over the top and change up the new market standard riiiiiiight after you made your big announcement.

As [Cadwalader is learning.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cwt-match/?rf=1)

Managing partner Patrick Quinn circulated this note today:

We thank you again for your outstanding work on behalf of our clients during what has been an extremely busy year to date for our Firm. I’m proud of what we are accomplishing together.

As a follow-up to my note last week regarding announced base salary increases for our attorneys, we are committed to continuing to pay top of market, and we intend to match Friday’s increased base salary levels.

So yay for CWT associates. Though we expected the re-raise. [That’s what happened in 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/?rf=1) when Cravath came over the top of Milbank’s raises. There will almost certainly be more of the $200K scale firms moving to the $205K scale.

# The So-Called Lawyer Monopoly
## Those who want to say that lawyers have a monopoly should first know how a monopoly operates.

Whenever there is a discussion on deregulating the legal profession, those favoring deregulation claim that lawyers have a monopoly. This monopoly supposedly makes lawyers prohibitively expensive for most people. Whether lawyers’ fees are too damn high is subjective and will be discussed another time. But today, let’s determine if lawyers are really engaging in monopolistic behavior.

A monopoly has only one supplier of a good or service. This allows the supplier to charge the consumer whatever it can get away with. This is obviously not the case in the legal profession. I looked at the number of lawyers in randomly selected states:

Vermont:             3,612
Connecticut:       21,036
Virginia:               24,230
Tennessee:          18,702
New York:            182,296
Kentucky:            13,570
Illinois:                 62,720
Indiana:                15,845
North Carolina:   24,253
Pennsylvania:      50,039
Ohio:                     38,189

I get that not all lawyers are competing against each other. Some are working in government and get their salaries from the taxpayer community chest. Others are working in one of those quirky JD-advantage jobs. Despite that, there is a good chance you’ll find at least three law offices in a boardwalk of any major city. Because of this, fewer attorneys are in general practice in order to avoid competing against each other. Most specialize to differentiate themselves. For example, in my practice area, some specialize in minimizing income taxes, some specialize in estate taxes, and a rare few specialize in avoiding luxury taxes.

Some might argue that lawyers as a group have a monopoly on giving legal advice. Assuming that is the case, the large number of lawyers makes it impossible for them to control prices by operating like a cartel. No state bar or other organization tells lawyers how much to charge a client. In fact, some lawyer message boards and listservs forbid recommending minimum fees or discussing fee structures.

If there is an unspoken minimum floor on legal fees, it is due to the costs of running a law office, not because every lawyer is living on Park Avenue. My criminal defense colleagues tell me there is no free parking when they are just visiting their clients in jail. This is why I am skeptical that legal technicians or paralegals will charge significantly less even though they can take the short line into law practice without the three years of reading and writing in law school.

Another aspect of monopolistic behavior is very high barriers to entry resulting in little to no competition. Electric and water companies are good examples due to the high infrastructure costs to start one and the compliance costs to operate one. In the legal profession, the two significant requirements for entry are getting a law degree and passing the bar exam. Thanks to student loans and businesses like Infilaw, there are pretty much no barriers to getting a law degree (although paying back the loans may be a barrier to a positive net worth). Despite the current criticism about the bar exam, most pass the first time, and almost everyone passes after a few years.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
The business of law practice does not have the usual negative consumer effects associated with monopolistic behavior. Due to the oversupply of lawyers, no lawyer — either individually or collectively — will reduce output. Also, the consumer has a choice. If someone needs legal advice, they can get one. And most of the time, they can get basic answers through the internet. Some lawyers offer limited scope services or self-help consultations to limit the costs. And for the truly indigent, there is legal aid.

The legal profession does not engage in monopolistic behavior. There are too many competitors, minimal barriers to entry, and as a result, consumers have a choice and so legal fees and service quality must adjust to market forces. So those who want to say that lawyers have a monopoly should first know how a monopoly operates. Otherwise, they should stick to the board game.

# Summer Associate Says This Is A 'Goldilocks' Biglaw Firm

This is a Goldilocks firm. You’re not going to be working with the most competitive gunners from law school, but you will still be working on high-stakes matters with big name clients. People here take the work very seriously, but don’t take themselves too seriously. I cannot imagine the quality of life is significantly better anywhere else in [Biglaw].

— A Winston & Strawn summer associate, in responses given for the [American Lawyer’s Summer Associate Satisfaction Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/27/where-do-i-sign/), about the Top 50 firm based on their experiences during its 2022 summer program. We’ll have additional analysis on the summer satisfaction survey sometime soon.

Jeh Johnson (Paul, Weiss)

The well-worn path between Biglaw and big government is a two-way street. We’ve been closely following the news of attorneys [leaving law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/jones-day-in-the-white-house-the-biglaw-firm-fills-top-jobs-in-the-trump-administration/) for [top spots](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/d-day-at-doj-the-trump-administrations-beachhead-team-for-the-justice-department/) in the Trump Administration. At the same time, leading lawyers from the Obama Administration are finding new homes in private practice.

Or, in some cases, not-so-new homes. As we noted [this morning](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/morning-docket-01-23-17/), today marks the official return of former Homeland Security Secretary [Jeh Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeh_Johnson) to his longtime professional home at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. This is his fourth return to the firm in three decades.

I had the pleasure of [profiling Jeh Johnson](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/07/an-afternoon-with-jeh-johnson-general-counsel-of-the-defense-department/?rf=1) back in 2011, when he served as general counsel of the Department of Defense. He left that role at the end of 2012 and returned to Paul, Weiss, but less than a year later he left again to become our nation’s fourth Secretary of Homeland Security. In case you missed it, check out the [wonderful and inspiring departure memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/departure-memo-of-the-day-jeh-johnson-parting-with-paul-weiss/) that he issued when he left the firm to take the helm of the federal government’s third-largest department.

But don’t expect another departure memo from Jeh Johnson, 59, anytime soon. I chatted with him by phone this afternoon, and he said that he expects his service as DHS secretary to be his last tour of duty in government.

I reminded him that he [said something similar](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/07/an-afternoon-with-jeh-johnson-general-counsel-of-the-defense-department/) about his service as GC of the Defense Department, before going on to become Secretary of Homeland Security. But the opportunity to lead DHS was, he said, a very special situation: “When the president asked me in August 2013 if I would return to government and join his Cabinet, I thought about it a little bit, but I was never really going to say no.”

Of course, with the Trump Administration now in power, it’s less likely that Johnson would be tapped for another position in federal government. He is a veteran of multiple Democratic administrations, having served as general counsel of the Air Force in the Clinton Administration before his time in the Obama Administration, and he strongly supported and campaigned for Barack Obama. I asked Johnson: do you have any thoughts on the incoming president and his administration?

“Yes,” Johnson replied, diplomatically — like a deponent who has been instructed by his lawyers to just answer the question posed, nothing more — before going on to offer enthusiastic praise for the new DHS Secretary, General [John F. Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kelly).

“I have a lot of faith in my successor, John Kelly,” Johnson said. “He is a retired four-star general from the Marines. I came to know him when he was the military aide to the secretary of defense and I was the general counsel. He is a man of character and integrity, and I believe he will be received well by the DHS workforce. I have a great deal of confidence in him.”

Johnson shared with me this fun fact (previously noted by [Am Law](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202777359594/Homeland-Security-Chief-Jeh-Johnson-Returns-Again-to-Paul-Weiss?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=0&slreturn=20170023085510) and [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/315274-jeh-johnson-is-designated-survivor-for-inauguration)): he was expecting to resign on Friday at noon with the rest of the political appointees of the Obama Administration, but at the last minute he was asked to serve as [“designated survivor,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_survivor) the Cabinet member who would take the reins of leadership in the event that some catastrophe resulted in the deaths of the president and other top leaders gathered at the inauguration.

So Johnson had to spend Friday afternoon in a secure, undisclosed location. As a result of serving in this role, Johnson was therefore the first and only member of the Trump Cabinet for a little over seven hours — after the swearing-in of President Trump around noon, but before the swearing-in of General Kelly as Johnson’s successor at 7:32 on Friday evening.

That was Friday, and Jeh Johnson wasted no time in returning to New York and to private practice. As of this Monday morning, he was happily back at Paul, Weiss (although mainly for administrative purposes and saying hello to people; he will go on a well-earned vacation for a few weeks before starting up at the firm full-time in late February).

I pointed out to Johnson that, given his successful tenure as DHS Secretary — keeping our nation safe from another major terrorist attack, while overseeing an agency with [more than 240,000 employees](https://www.dhs.gov/about-dhs) — he could have done any number of things after leaving the administration. Did he consider any other role besides law firm partner, such as heading up a major foundation, becoming a university president, or taking a C-suite role at a top corporation?

Johnson demurred. “I like the law firm environment,” he explained. “This is where I was trained, and this is what I grew up to do. The job of DHS secretary was incredibly exciting, but part of me still enjoys advocacy, representing clients, advising clients, and being around lawyers. That’s fundamentally who I am, and I look forward to being a contributor to Paul, Weiss. I love this firm, and its culture, and its practice.”

I pointed out to Johnson that senior administration officials don’t always go back to their former firms after government. For example, Greg Craig [went to Skadden Arps](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/musical-chairs-gregory-craig-from-williams-connolly-to-skadden-via-the-white-house/) instead of returning to Williams & Connolly, and one of his predecessors as White House counsel, Fred Fielding, [joined Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/bios/ffielding) instead of returning to Wiley Rein (formerly Wiley Rein & Fielding). I asked Johnson: did he talk to any other law firms besides Paul, Weiss?

“No, I did not,” he said. “There was not even an internal debate in my mind about that. When you leave a firm and rejoin it four times over 32 years, you have a unique perspective on the firm. And each time I’ve come back, the firm has been even better, bigger, and stronger, to the point where we are one of the top three or firms, if not the top law firm, in the country. I consider this to be my private-practice home.”

“A lot of the partners here have been colleagues of mine for 30 or more years,” he continued. “And after an incredibly demanding experience as DHS secretary, I was not looking to go someplace new, where I’d have to prove myself all over again.”

Jeh Johnson is returning to a familiar place. Some things will be the same, and some will be different.

In terms of the differences, Johnson returns to private practice with a new and unique perspective: “the benefit of my experience as the member of the Cabinet in charge of national security and especially cyber security, a large and growing area. Because security issues and their legal aspects are more and more a part of the daily lives of our business clients, I hope and expect to be very busy.”

What will remain unchanged: Johnson’s commitment to working with and mentoring young lawyers. “I hope to share with them the benefits of my experiences in public service, and to encourage them to think about doing the same.”

As Johnson discussed at length in my [last interview with him](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/07/an-afternoon-with-jeh-johnson-general-counsel-of-the-defense-department/?rf=1), a rich tradition of public service exists at Paul, Weiss. The firm’s lawyers move back and forth between the public and private sectors with ease. When he returns next month, Johnson will move into the office formerly occupied by [Ted Sorensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sorensen), White House counsel under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.

“Ted was a mentor of mine,” Johnson said, “and his office is in the immediate neighborhood where I used to sit. I stood in that office on 9/11 and watched the towers collapse. When I return, I will be able to see the new World Trade Center, where my DHS office was when I was in New York City.”

I concluded our conversation with this question to Jeh Johnson: what advice would he give to law students and young lawyers who aspire to the kind of legal career that he has enjoyed?

“As you progress, avoid [‘golden handcuffs,’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_handcuffs) which make it impossible to radically change careers and to do something involving a huge pay cut,” he said. “You will find that if you go into public service, it is the most exciting thing you can possibly do. I did things — as an AUSA, as GC of the Air Force, as GC of DoD, as a Cabinet officer — that were simply beyond my imagination as a young associate.”

“There are so many interesting opportunities in law and public service — as long as you are prepared to accept them.”

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Hands Out Associate Bonuses, Adds Even More Cash On Top For High Billers

Day by day and one by one, Biglaw firm after Biglaw firm has been matching the prevailing market standard for year-end and special bonuses, and in some cases, adding supplemental bonuses on top for associates who have been very busy with their billing. Winston & Strawn — a firm that brought in $981,223,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it at No. 45 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — is one of the firms that’s rewarding its highest billers with extra cash.

Here are the year-end and special bonus scales that associates are quite familiar with by now. At Winston & Strawn, associates must be in good standing and meet their minimum hours requirements to be eligible for year-end bonuses, while special bonuses will be given to all associates in good standing, regardless of their hours.

For those associates who have “substantially exceed[ed]” the firm’s productivity goals, there are handsome rewards. Here’s what the supplemental bonus scale looks like for the firm’s high billers:
