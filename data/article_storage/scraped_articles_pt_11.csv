# Want A Market-Sized Bonus? Better Be Ready To Bill Your Butt Off At This Biglaw Firm
## That's a lot of hours.

Billing 2,400 hours over the course of a year is a lot. Indeed, [at Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/quinn-emanuel-announces-bonus-scale-with-bigger-bonuses-for-big-billers/), hitting that billing threshold qualifies you for some extra money on top of the market bonuses. So if a firm introduces a new bonus structure and you need to bill 2,400 hours to get the same money that Cravath gives out without any billable requirement at all, well, Above the Law is going to have something to say about it.

Tipsters inform us that Venable recently announced an updated bonus structure. The scale is available in full below, and, as you can see, it isn’t until the 2,400 mark that associates at the firm finally match the Cravath scale.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Venable [has a history](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/venerable-firm-offers-bonuses-waaaaaaaay-below-market/?rf=1) of dinging the bonuses of associates who don’t bill at the top of the market. At least this new scale provides some measure of transparency for associates. But that’s cold comfort as you’re billing like crazy to only make what your peers at other firms get as a matter of course.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# How Clients Can Get The Most Out Of Their Lawyers
## It can be difficult for a lawyer to provide good service to a client after the lawyer has been disrespected by something a client has done or said.

Remember … courtesy costs nothing.

Most articles on this website are geared toward legal professionals and all of the people who work in the legal industry. Indeed, almost all of the pieces in this column are about my experiences practicing at different law firms and are directed mostly toward lawyers and staff who work in the legal profession. However, over the years, I have received numerous emails from clients who have read my articles and other pieces on Above the Law and have questions about their own situations. Lawyers, like other types of professionals, may provide different kinds of service to different clients based on a variety of factors. In a first for this column, I’d like to direct an article toward clients and convey how clients can obtain the best service possible from their legal counsel if they keep a few things in mind.

Assist With Administrative Work

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Probably the primary way that clients can get the best representation from a lawyer is to help them as much as possible with the administrative tasks of a representation. There are certain facts that a client will know much better than a lawyer, and it might be a waste of time and energy for a client to explain matters to a lawyer rather than have a client perform some work themselves. For instance, I once had to file a lawsuit based on dozens of unpaid invoices. It was difficult for me to read all of the invoices and understand the shorthand scribbled on them, and it took me hours to figure out the exact amount of money that was owed and sort other things out. If my client had helped me in sorting the numbers out and translating some notations, not only would I have saved time and resources, but I could have presented a clearer picture of things for the client in litigation papers.

In addition, clients often need to give lawyers documents during discovery or information that is necessary to answer interrogatories or complete other phases of litigation. Sometimes, clients are quick in providing this information and materials, but other times, it can take a great deal of effort to provide such details and documents. Failing to respond to discovery demands in a timely fashion can have a number of bad outcomes for a case and can make it more difficult for a lawyer to provide solid representation to a client. As a result, clients can get the best results if they furnish information and documents to lawyers as soon as possible.

Pay Bills On Time

Anyone who runs their own practice or is involved in bill collections can tell you how stressful it is to chase down bills and ensure that invoices are paid on time. It is not uncommon for lawyers to have some clients who pay their bills almost immediately every month and do not make too much of a fuss about entries on invoices. However, numerous lawyers have clients who can go months without paying bills and who object to entries on invoices. Of course, clients may have legitimate concerns over line items on bills, and there may be reasons why clients are unable to pay bills on time. However, it is harder for lawyers to feel good about doing work for clients if clients do not pay their bills on time or the lawyer thinks a client might object to work that a lawyer has performed. As a result, to the extent possible, clients should ensure that they pay their bills within a reasonable amount of time so that they can preserve the best relationship possible between client and lawyer.

Be Respectful

Numerous clients are respectful to their lawyers and don’t do anything to damage the attorney-client relationship. However, sometimes clients do not treat lawyers with the most respect, either because they are dissatisfied with a result or perhaps because they feel that they can treat someone they pay poorly. In any event, it can be difficult for a lawyer to provide good service to a client after the lawyer has been disrespected by something a client has done or said.

For instance, I was once representing a client in a matter, and was asking questions to ascertain the client’s position on a variety of issues. The client used some foul language to describe my legal acuity and the need to ask such questions, and this made it difficult to continue the representation. In addition, one time, I was once told that a client did not want me to continue a negotiation so that the client could negotiate himself, and it was hard for me to return to the negotiation at the client’s request after the client had thrown me under the bus to the other side. If clients are respectful and do not do anything to fray the attorney-client connection, they can get better results.

In the end, lawyers are human, and the services they provide are impacted by a number of factors. Clients can keep a few things in mind to ensure they receive the best representation possible from their counsel.

# Biglaw Firm To Welcome New Associates After Deferring Their Start Dates Due To Work Slowdown
## This has to be a good sign for the firm -- or at least we hope so.

It may be [layoff season](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/biglaw-layoff-season-first-quarter-2023/) among Biglaw firms, but one of them finally has some good news to report in the wake of [two rounds of stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/) and the [deferral of its incoming associate class](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/gunderson-deferred-associate-start-dates/).

Back in September, Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer became the first (and only) major firm that we know of to defer its incoming associates’ start dates into the new year due to a slowdown in demand. New associates were originally supposed to start work on October 31, 2022, but that date was pushed to January 17, 2023.

Seeing as that’s just one week away, will Gunderson associates finally be welcomed by the firm? [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/gundersons-newest-associates-set-to-start-next-week-after-delay) has an update on that.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A crop of new associates who had their start dates delayed two-and-a-half months are set to begin at the Silicon Valley-based firm Jan. 17, according to a spokesperson for Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian. They’ll begin their careers as at least two other firms with deep tech roots—Cooley LLP and Goodwin Procter—recently trimmed headcounts.

It may be a little nerve wracking to begin your career with a firm that’s fresh off a series of layoffs, but for better or worse, Gunderson’s incoming associates have already survived one phase of the firm’s austerity measures — and gotten paid for it (reduced pay, of course). Yes, the fear of additional layoffs is still palpable, what with other top firms outright [laying off](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) associates [en masse](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/), but it may be a good sign that Gunderson has decided to onboard its new associates rather than delay their start dates even further. The firm wouldn’t dare lay off its most junior lawyers after already preventing them from starting their jobs on time, right? *gulp* … Right?

We wish the best of luck to Gunderson Dettmer’s new associates. Stay positive, but if things seem like they’re headed south, you know where to reach us.

How will your firm handle the turmoil of sluggish demand? If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Heather Heyer

Unless you completely unplugged and took up residence in a cave, you’ve probably heard about the alt-right protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, this weekend and the corresponding counter-protests that turned deadly. Horrific [video footage](http://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/08/12/charlottesville-crash-protesters-video-orig-vstop-dlewis.cnn) shows a Dodge Challenger running into a group of protesters and then fleeing the scene, leaving 19 injured and one person dead. Police have already arrested an alleged [Nazi sympathizer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/one-dead-as-car-strikes-crowds-amid-protests-of-white-nationalist-gathering-in-charlottesville-two-police-die-in-helicopter-crash/2017/08/13/3590b3ce-8021-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html?utm_term=.fb2c48624c4b), James Alex Fields, in connection with the crime and charged him with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and failing to stop at the scene of a crash that resulted in a death.

Authorities have now identified the sole fatality in the incident as Heather Heyer, a paralegal in the bankruptcy division of the [Miller Law Group.](https://www.millerlawgrouppc.com/) It seems Heyer’s personality, rather than an extensive background in the legal industry, is what made her a valued asset to the team, as [reported by](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/us/heather-heyer-charlottesville-victim.html) the New York Times:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Manager of the bankruptcy division, Alfred A.] Wilson hired Ms. Heyer at the recommendation of a friend. She had a high school diploma but did not have a background in law. Instead, she was working as a bartender and waitress, but he said she had an eye for detail and was “a people person.”

“If you can get people to open up to you, that’s what I need,” he told her. “I’ll teach you everything about the law you need to know.”

Heyer’s[ bio](https://www.millerlawgrouppc.com/firmbios/support-staff/heather-heyer/) on the firm’s website — usually a dry recitation of qualifications — describes a professional that went out of her way to make connections with clients:

For over four years Heather has played an essential role in our bankruptcy department and office as a whole. Heather works closely with clients to assist and ensure that although the bankruptcy filing process may seem confusing and cumbersome, our office and staff are here to help them every step of the way. Heather possesses a wealth of knowledge and experience in the bankruptcy field and works closely with our clients to guarantee a positive experience in what is sometimes a stressful situation.

Since news of her death has spread, Heyer’s mother has come out and said she is [proud of her daughter](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mother-of-charlottesville-victim-heather-heyer-im-proud-of-what-she-did_us_59907c45e4b09071f69a796c), and that taking a stand against racism and hatred was a defining characteristic of her daughter. In a social media post that has become poetic after Heyer’s tragic death, her [final words on Facebook ](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/896715335776251905)were, “If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention.”

# Biglaw Firm Announces Year-End Bonuses With Lots Of Extra Cash For High Billers

Biglaw is knee deep in bonus season. Firms are pumping out memos letting folks know exactly how much extra money they’ll be seeing this yeah.

Katten Muchin Rosenman, a firm that made $646,601,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 67th on the Am Law 100, has announced their own year-end bonuses to thank associates for all their hard work — and most importantly, their billable hours.

The firm announced they are matching the Cravath year-end bonus scale for associates that hit the 2,000-hour threshold. But for busy associates who bill even more, they note, “As we have in previous years, we will give additional bonus amounts for each 100-hour increment over our hours target to reward those associates whose hours have exceeded expectation this year.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Let’s take a peek at the bonus scale at Katten:



The memo also goes on to note that, “Any additional discretionary (e.g., “superstar bonuses”) or billing bonuses would be given in addition to the amounts listed above.” That’s very nice, but no word — as of yet — whether the firm will match the latest round of special bonuses[ introduced yesterday by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/). Though, it should be noted, Katten does[ have a history ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/katten-special-bonus-2021/)of matching Biglaw’s special bonus trend.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

In-house attorney Anita Nicholson was vacationing with her husband Ben Nicholson, a partner at the British law firm Kennedys, with their two young children, Alex and Annabel, at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo, Sri Lanka, when the coordinated terrorist attacks hit eight location across the city. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/22/kennedys-partner-injured-his-wife-and-children-killed-in-sri-lanka-bombing-396-13350/) Law.com, Ben Nicholson was injured, and Anita and their children died in the attack.

Ben Nicholson works out of the Singapore office of Kennedys. Anita Nicholson was managing counsel at the mining company Anglo-America, having previously worked in-house at BHP Billiton and BP. She also spent time in Biglaw, working at DLA Piper from 2001 to 2003.

Kennedys made the following statement about the tragedy:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“It is with great sadness that we confirm Anita Nicholson, wife of our partner Ben, and their two children, Alex and Annabel were tragically killed in the Colombo bombings on Sunday,” Kennedys said in a statement. “We are in contact with Ben and supporting him in every way we can. Ben is now surrounded by the loving support of his family. This is devastating news and our thoughts are very much with Ben at this difficult time.”

The death toll in the attacks has risen to 321 people, with more than 500 injured. Our thoughts go out to the family and colleagues of the Nicholsons during this difficult time.

# A Biglaw Firm With Even Bigger Money For Associates
## Another match is in the books for the prevailing Cravath salary scale.

It’s been an absolutely action-packed day when it comes to Biglaw compensation. Firms are raising salaries left and right, as if Cravath cash is going to go out of style. Newsflash: It won’t, but don’t let that stop you from announcing your raises ASAP.

Earlier today, Winston & Strawn — a firm that brought in $981,223,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 45 on the most recent Am Law 100 — announced that it would be matching Cravath. Here’s the salary scale that should look quite familiar to associates by now:



Because the firm’s fiscal year begins on February 1, base salaries for U.S. associates in good standing are retroactive to that date, and will be reflected in their paychecks on March 15.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Winston & Strawn.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# No Really, Everyone In Biglaw Is Raising Associate Salaries
## Another Biglaw firm shares its PPP with associates.

Well, when it rains, it pours. And it seems everyone is getting in on the salary wars. This morning, Schulte Roth & Zabel has decided to share some of [its profits per partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/profits-per-partner-at-am-law-100-firms-that-have-not-raised-salaries-for-associates/2/) — which clock in at $2,330,000 — with the associates that make the firm run.

Schulte is adopting the full Cravath scale for associate compensation, which gives the lawyers a raise of between $20,000 and $35,000, depending on class year. The raise applies to the incoming class of 2016 and summer associates, as well as the rank-and-file attorneys.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The raises are for associates in the New York and Washington DC offices — those are all of the firm’s U.S. offices, and are effective July 1. All of which put Schulte square with the MoneyLaw market.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# Red Light, Green Light?
## What this country is now enduring in terms of divisions is worse than the nastiest litigation imaginable.

Is anyone else tired? Fatigued? Exhausted physically, mentally, or both? I’d ask you to raise your hand, but you are too tired to raise it. Regardless of whether you are red, blue, purple, male, female, trans, or nonbinary, you have had so many roller coaster rides during the past few years, that you can’t even think about getting on another ride, but we are. The January 6 hearings are an amazing tour of how close this country came to a coup, courtesy of Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn, Rudy Giuliani, and others who thought that what this country needed was a good old-fashioned civil war to keep a whack-job president in power.

We’re pooped. We’re not talking with each other, but over, around, and through each other. We don’t listen; we yell. We are tired, worn out, suffering from fatigues of many different varieties: outrage, burnout, sadness, and so many other kinds that it’s even hard to describe them all. What do I know? Not much, as some readers will readily agree, but I do know that what this country is now enduring in terms of divisions is worse than the nastiest litigation imaginable. Think of your absolute worst opposing counsel that you have ever encountered and multiply it by some exponential number, and that’s what a lot of us are feeling right now. Wait, there’s the brand-new Twitter v. Elon Musk litigation, which may give “[scorched-earth tactics](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/)” new meaning. And whatever happened to Musk’s idea for his very [own in-house firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/elon-musk-takes-time-out-from-failing-to-buy-twitter-to-fail-to-build-his-own-law-firm/)? Any lawyer still interested in that?

I feel for those sitting for the bar exam later this month. The legal world that they hoped to enter — and will enter upon passing — feels different now. At least it is to this old lady lawyer. The examinees can at least take some comfort that this term’s SCOTUS decisions [won’t be tested](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/taking-the-bar-exam-dont-worry-this-disastrous-scotus-term-wont-be-tested/), as if they aren’t already going to be tested in myriad ways to come. Case law … precedent… statutory interpretation, that’s how we learned the law in olden days. So, what should law schools teach now? On bar exams going forward, would an examinee be dinged for not discussing precedent (as if that really matters anymore)?  What and how do law professors teach going forward? Should anyone flunk the written portion of the bar exam if they argue that precedent doesn’t matter anymore post-Dobbs? I don’t know the answers; I just ask the questions, which is what we lawyers do.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And if anyone has any doubt about the negative effect of Dobbs on the ability of women to reach their professional goals, achieve their professional desires, and the like, the dearth of affordable childcare and elder care is going to hammer yet another nail in women’s abilities to move forward and up in the workplace. [No one should be surprised](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/07/business/economy/women-labor-caregiving.html?campaign_id=12&emc=edit_my_20220711&instance_id=66343&nl=your-money&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=98213&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c). The new SCOTUS majority, which is male except for one, doesn’t seem to think there’s a problem with that. How many of those men have been responsible for childcare? For elder care? I thought so. And doesn’t Amy Coney Barrett have help with wifely and motherly duties?

Remember what Justice Sonia Sotomayor said at the Dobbs oral argument: “Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?” Asked and answered, Your Honor.

Someone, and more than just one someone, will write books about the Tom Girardi mess here in California. Movie, TV (other than the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” now showing on a cable channel near you) to follow. I know that some of you are sick of reading about him, but the story to me is a train wreck. I can’t avoid looking at it as a morality play for all of us. Any casting suggestions? Who should play Tom Girardi? His wife, Erika Jayne?

There’s now the filing of a RICO lawsuit (along with other claims, including conspiracy) against Erika Girardi aka Erika Jayne, two lawyers from the defunct Girardi firm, the Girardi firm accountant, a litigation financing company, and others. The complaint, which runs more than 60 pages, is fascinating reading, like a John Grisham novel. Among the allegations is that Girardi’s defunct law firm, Girardi Keese, was [a criminal enterprise](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/edelson-sues-girardi-law-firm-alleging-100-million-fraud-plot?context=search&amp%3Bindex=14&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).

And tangentially related to Girardi, the State Bar of California has filed charges of moral turpitude against its former executive director, Joe Dunn. While ED, Dunn was cozy with Tom Girardi, (not the basis of the charges), but these disciplinary allegations arise because he lied to the bar’s board of trustees about certain expenses he billed to the bar for a trip to Mongolia (I am not making this up) and that he misrepresented the position of the chief justice of the California Supreme Court on a piece of legislation (definitely not a good thing). There are other allegations as well, having to do with alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. This may well be the first time that an executive director of the California State Bar faces disciplinary charges. The [bar fired Dunn some years back](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-08/in-wake-of-failed-handling-of-tom-girardi-state-bar-moves-against-license-of-former-executive-director), Dunn claimed wrongful termination, but he lost in arbitration.

No wonder we’re all pooped. Do we have any energy left to play a game? Why not participate in “[Squid Games](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919420/)?” Would you be willing to compete? As a lawyer, you may well lose in litigation, be sued for malpractice, lose your license, lose your sense of self. You could screw up a transaction with inartful drafting or, even worse, [overlook a typo](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/07/a-very-expensive-typo/) that changes the meaning of a critical fact. Is practicing law now a game of red light, green light? Are we playing “Squid Games”?

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to the latest Savills U.S. Law Firm Activity Report, in the fourth quarter of 2022, leasing activity declined compared with the fourth quarter of 2021 and with the third quarter of 2022. By how much did leasing activity drop?

Hint: Savills noted in the report that “[l]aw firms have begun pulling back in a number of ways ahead of a potential economic downturn, so it’s possible that real estate may be one of those.”

One by one, the Biglaw dominos on special bonuses continue to fall. Ever since Davis Polk pulled their trademark move of coming in over the top, it’s become patently obvious that other firms should get in on the bonus matching game. In case it isn’t clear yet, the latest firm offer special bonuses to associates is a leading intellectual property firm.

This afternoon, Fish & Richardson announced to associates that they’d be showering them with extra cash. This is great news, considering the firm skipped out on the first round of COVID appreciation bonuses. These is what the bonuses look like at the firm (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/fish-richardson-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

Associates will receive payments in April and in October, and will receive more details on eligibility at a meeting to be held next week. At this point, all we know is that it will be awarded to associates in good standing, and that the money comes in addition to regular year-end bonuses. Congratulations to everyone at Fish!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/fish-richardson-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Fish & Richardson.)

# Can Your Firm Afford To Raise Associate Salaries? Probably!
## Whether your firm will actually raise salaries even though it may be able to afford the costs is another story entirely.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s really not that large when you actually dive into it. You have to remember, it’s also not an automatic pass-through from a salary increase to a bill. Every bill is a negotiation these days. Can most firms afford it? Yes.

— Law firm consultant Brad Hildebrandt, of Hildebrandt Consulting, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/12/12/how-some-big-law-firms-can-afford-associate-salary-raises/) on whether Biglaw firms will be able to afford the long-term costs of raising associate salaries, and why pay raises won’t necessarily equal larger bills for clients.

# Luxury Fashion Resale: Legal Considerations And Challenges
## The impact of counterfeits on the luxury fashion resale industry.

The dramatic growth of the secondhand apparel market in the past few years has captivated fashion enthusiasts and investors. The big brands are also paying attention, some even finding their own opportunities in this surging playing field.  But whenever a business model depends on the use of others’ branded goods, there’s a balance between the first sale doctrine and the material modifications that can spell lawsuit. Resellers must also pay careful attention to determining the authenticity of secondhand apparel before advertising it as such, to avoid inadvertently selling counterfeit merchandise.

This surge in the resale market has been fueled by increasing awareness and concern for sustainability, coupled with consumer’s increasing desire for affordable yet quality apparel and classic fashion. In response to consumer demands, more retailers and brands are entering into the resale market, contributing to its estimated global market value of $119 billion in 2022. Online reselling platforms such as Poshmark, the The RealReal, and Vestiaire Collective, have played a significant role in this rise, offering authentication services and making it convenient for consumers to find high street and luxury apparel of their choice at attractive prices.

Many luxury brands such as Gucci, Rolex, and Burberry have been eager to embrace the trend and capitalize on the success of the resale industry, leading them to partner with existing resale platforms and even create their own curated platforms dedicated to their brand. However, other brands, such as Chanel, have taken a different approach. Some of these giants have sued to enjoin what they perceive as a threat to their brand. Suits have claimed trademark infringement and dilution, false advertising, unfair competition, and false advertising.

As a general practice, the reselling of authentic, legally acquired goods is allowed under the common law first sale doctrine. The first sale doctrine provides that a once a trademark owner sells or distributes his or her product, the owner no longer has the right to control further distribution or resale of that specific item. However, the first sale doctrine may not provide a safe harbor if the reseller “materially” alters the branded goods of another.  While there’s no bright-line definition of material alteration that places a reseller in the danger zone, the courts consider whether use of the plaintiff’s trademark on the resold goods is likely to cause consumers to be confused and perceive a relationship between the plaintiff and the reseller.  

In March 2018, Chanel filed suit against luxury reseller What Goes Around Comes Around (“WGACA”) claiming that WGACA “has attempted to deceive consumers into falsely believing that Defendant WGACA has some kind of approval of or relationship or affiliation with Chanel or that Chanel has authenticated WGACA’s goods in order to trade off of Chanel’s brand and good will.” The court granted partial summary judgment as to Chanel’s claims involving non-genuine counterfeited bags or genuine bags that were never authorized for sale but were instead loaned to retailers for display only. The court held that because “Chanel has established that it did not authorize the initial sale of these goods, they ‘cannot be considered genuine as a matter of law and infringement is established,’” even though the goods have been authorized for manufacture and meet Chanel’s quality requirements. The case between Chanel and WGACA is still ongoing.

In November 2018, Chanel filed a similar lawsuit against luxury reseller The RealReal where it argued that The RealReal engaged in infringement, counterfeiting, false advertisement, and unfair competition by “claim[ing] to be offering for sale of ‘100% authentic’ Chanel-branded products, when, in fact, some of the goods are counterfeit Chanel products” and “deceiv[ing] consumers that there is an affiliation, sponsorship and/or association between Chanel and The RealReal when there is not.” Chanel pointed to “at least seven (7) counterfeit Chanel handbags” sold by The RealReal. The RealReal filed counterclaims arguing, among other things, that Chanel has engaged in “anticompetitive conduct” under the Sherman Act. Specifically, The RealReal claimed that “Chanel has attempted to monopolize the Relevant Market,” and “use[] its power to inhibit the growth of or eliminate entirely other competitors in the Relevant Market.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

In support of its anticompetitive counterclaims against Chanel, The RealReal points to Chanel’s failure to bring similar claims against Farfetch, a luxury resale platform comparable to The RealReal and WGACA. Chanel asserts that its dispute with The RealReal and WGACA centers around their insufficient authentication processeses. In contrast, Chanel has an ownership interest in Farfetch and exerts control over Farfetch’s authentication of Chanel goods.

While the dispute between Chanel and The RealReal is ongoing, The RealReal has removed its “100% Authentic” warranty from its website and instead provides customers with a more nuanced assurance of product authenticity by describing its “rigorous, brand-specific authentication process.” However, as The RealReal scaled inventory and laid off employees in an attempt to boost profitability following its IPO, there have been increasing concerns from consumers regarding The RealReal’s ability to authenticate items.

In addition to engaging solely in the resale of pre-owned apparel, there is a growing emergence of companies that specialize in upcycling and repurposing vintage apparel. One such company, Shiver + Duke, sources Chanel buttons and transforms them into unique pieces of jewelry. Chanel filed suit against Shiver + Duke claiming that the upcycling of Chanel items is likely to “cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive Defendants’ customers or potential consumers and the public as to the source or sponsorship of Defendants’ goods,” and “is likely to dilute Chanel’s famous marks by impairing their distinctiveness.” The two parties reached a settlement in November 2022. While the terms of the settlement remain undisclosed, the removal of all Chanel branded jewelry from Shiver + Duke’s website indicates that Chanel had the upper hand.

The cases discussed above raise numerous questions for resale platforms: How do resellers ensure that counterfeit or unauthorized products do not make their way onto their platforms? Should resale platforms have the brands themselves authenticate products? Or should they provide disclaimers to ensure that customers are aware that the platforms are not affiliated, endorsed, or sponsored by the brands? What are the parameters for resellers who want to upcycle secondhand apparel? It is imperative for resale platforms to take substantial measures to ensure authenticity while remaining transparent and providing clear disclaimers of affiliations with brands.

# Welcome To The Biglaw Holiday Party, Law Students

With final exams in full swing here at Vanderbilt, the minds of many law students, both in Nashville and elsewhere around the country, have likely started to wander into thoughts of how they will be spending their winter break.  Indeed, as front lawns and shopping malls are increasingly festooned with all manner of decorations, it is hard to ignore the fact that the holiday season is upon us.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While many law students are eager to spend the holiday break engaging in some of their favorite activities which might have recently fallen by the wayside, such as eating a homecooked meal or sleeping, this extended period of time off also presents a prime opportunity for students to engage in the vital task of [networking](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/you-gotta-network-to-get-work-baby/).  This networking can take the form of continuing already established outreach, but winter break also provides a unique networking opportunity, the holiday party.



Aimed mainly at 1Ls, but occasionally open to all law students, these holiday parties serve as an opportunity for students to familiarize themselves with a particular legal employer (note that these parties are thrown almost exclusively by law firms) while providing the employer with a chance to put faces, and perhaps, more importantly, behavior — more on that in a moment — with the names on the job applications that they have received or will soon receive.  Yet despite the seemingly straightforward rationale for all parties involved, these holiday soirées can occasionally flummox students.

The most frequent question I have fielded on the subject is, perhaps, the most straightforward one: “Should I go”?  The short answer is, sure, why not.  An opportunity to consume some free food and drinks while learning about a place you might spend the next 30 years of your life sounds like a decent way to spend a late December evening.  At the very least, it will be more productive than your eighth viewing of [A Christmas Story](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085334/).  Plus, the budgets for these receptions tend not to be on the low side.  While you likely will not be served a homecooked meal, unless your family has a few Michelin chefs among its ranks, odds are it will be some of the better food you will come across during the holiday season.  But while I advise students to go to these receptions, I always add on, or at least imply, the phrase “if you can.”  While these receptions can be valuable for both students and employers, they are not mandatory.  If a student is very interested in a California firm but is heading home to Indiana for the holidays, they should not feel compelled to add a costly (both financially and in terms of time) California leg to their winter vacation.  A half-hour drive is a worthwhile investment, but not a cross-country trek.  Similarly, if a reception is scheduled for a time when you will already be back on campus for the Spring semester, do not feel like you need to choose between attending a party or class.  If you cannot attend a holiday reception, but still want to show an employer the extent of your interest, send them a note apologizing for not being able to attend while iterating just how much you would like to work there.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Once the decision is made to attend an employer holiday reception, the follow-up question I receive is along the lines of “What should I do when I get there?”  This can occasionally prompt an internal, or possibly external, response in the form of a question, “Have you been to a party before?”  No, this is not an opportunity to recreate your greatest partying moments from college, or even from the previous semester of law school, but it is still a celebration.  Students do not need to bring notes or be prepared to speak eloquently on the Erie Doctrine.  Do not come armed with handouts illustrating the [breathtaking attempts at a legislative coup being undertaken by Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/midwestern-republicans-try-to-kneecap-new-democratic-governors_us_5c05acebe4b0cd916faefc3e?37).  Instead, just talk to participants.  Try to mingle with as many different attorneys in the room as possible.  If you want to know more about a particular practice area at that firm, strike up a conversation with someone in that group.  Observe the attorneys in attendance.  Are they coming down from their offices, seemingly rushed, and checking the time every few minutes before scurrying back upstairs with some food in hand?  That is a pretty good sign of an office with a lot of work.  Conversely, if attorneys seemingly have all day to eat and drink at 4 p.m., that might be a sign of slow times at the firm.

Take advantage of free food and drink, but also be mindful of your personal limits.  If you are not sure you can be your most coherent self with a glass of wine, then abstain.  Conversely, while there are some students who are quite confident that they can be at their best after eight scotches, the likelihood of that being true are minimal at best.  Employer holiday parties are also not the best time to try and set a personal best for most hot wings consumed in a single sitting.  After the reception is concluded, the recruiting office will likely solicit feedback on the student attendees from the participating attorneys and “guy who ate 50 wings” is likely not going to be perceived as a positive.

Finally, students are occasionally flummoxed by multiple parties happening at the same time.  They might have a genuine interest in both employers and are unsure how to pick which party to attend.  The good news is that students can do both.  When RSVPing, tell Employer A that you are happy to attend but have to leave early due to a prior commitment and then tell Employer B that you will be arriving a bit late due to a prior commitment.  While on the subject of RSVPs, students should make sure they actually do RSVP and that once committed to attending, they actually show up.  While there are obviously issues that can arise which would prohibit a student’s attendance, make sure you relay that to the reception organizers BEFORE the event takes place.  Employers take note when students fail to show up for an event.

Winter break is a well-deserved opportunity for students to relax after a stressful semester.  While full advantage should be taken of the opportunity to sleep in and not have to pore over casebooks, that does not mean the job search process needs to be put on hold.  Holiday parties offer a perfect opportunity for both students and employers to get a sense of each other over a glass of wine and some cheese.

# More Mergers Shifting The Biglaw Landscape
## Four new mergers announced.

We’re barely into February and it [already looks](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/hogan-lovells-and-shearman-sterling-potential-merger-on-the-horizon/) like[ 2023 is going to be](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/top-biglaw-firm-starts-new-year-off-on-right-foot-with-merger-announcement/) one [for the law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/maynard-nexsen-law-firm-merger-southeast/) mergers[ record book.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/law-firm-merger-mania-is-on-the-upswing/) With the industry worrying about a downturn lurking in the shadows, increasing your revenue numbers via merger seems like a strategy many are on board with.

Now comes word of even more more law firm mergers — four in a 24-hour window — that are sure to mix things up. We have the large international firm of Clyde & Co., with 1800+ attorneys and ranking[ 71st on the Global 200 list](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=63&name=Clyde-%26-Co), expanding in the United States. They [announced](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/02/clyde-co-joins-big-law-boutique-merger-mania-405-116685/) a merger with Boston-based Hermes, Netburn, O’Connor & Spearing, an insurance and civil litigation boutique.

Eileen King Bower, Chair of Clyde & Co.’s North American Board, said of the tie up, “This team of litigators provides us with the opportunity to establish an office in Boston, which is a key insurance market, while further enhancing our defense and insurance coverage nationwide, in line with our strategy.”

Also looking to get bigger through mergers is Clark Hill, a firm currently ranked 110th on the Am Law 200. They’re [focusing on Philadelphia expansion](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2023/02/01/clark-hill-expands-philly-presence-via-conrad-obrien-merger/), taking on the Conrad O’Brien boutique.

“In combining with top-notch firms like Conrad O’Brien that share our commitment to client service, diversity and professional development, Clark Hill has strategically grown to meet our clients’ evolving needs,” John Hensien, chief executive officer of Clark Hill, said in a statement announcing the combination Wednesday morning.

“Our expansion in recent years enables us to attract and retain outstanding talent and broaden our depth of service offerings internationally,” Hensien added.

Additionally, two Chicago-based firms are merging: Croke Fairchild Duarte & Beres and Prendergast Layden. Drew Beres, one of the founding partners of Croke Fairchild,[ said](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/01/chicago-law-firms-combine-as-boutique-consolidation-accelerates-in-2023/) the merger is “part of the plan of making sure we were truly full-service. And quite frankly, with the economy not as strong as it was a year ago, litigation becomes even more important.”

Plus, Braverman Greenspun, a New York boutique representing condo and co-op boards, will be merging with Finder Novick Kerrigan.

Remember, it’s only February, so there are bound to be even more mergers announced this year.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The market is out of control, and it feels like all firms, no matter how strong or profitable, are at risk of other elite firms willing to offer lavish, extravagant, irrational amounts of money to lift partners in strategic practice groups. No one is immune. The world has just become this lateral playpen.

— A managing partner at a Top 25 law firm, in conversation with [Roy Strom of Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-laws-era-of-the-storm-gives-powerful-a-chance-to-strike), discussing a time of upheaval in Biglaw, where a disruption in demand has caused firms to lash out, be it through large layoffs, lateral binges, partner poaching, and even megamergers. Jim Jones, senior fellow at the Center for the Study of the Legal Profession at the Georgetown University Law Center, has referred to this time period as Biglaw’s “era of the storm.”

# Minding The Gap: The Pandemic’s Impact On Women In The Workforce
## Economists project that it will take more than 10 years for the wage gap to close to what it was before the pandemic.

Working mothers have always had a full, let’s be honest, overflowing plate of responsibilities balancing work and family. Even before the pandemic, the U.S. did very little to support working parents with a lack of resources and infrastructure to level the playing field. But moms, being the superheroes they are, made it work by cobbling together childcare and working late hours to keep up. But then the pandemic unexpectedly rips through everyone’s lives and the world of working mothers begins to crumble. What starts as a few weeks turns into months and months turns into nearly a year of remote schooling, scarcity in childcare, illness, shutdowns, business closures, and loss for so many Americans. All these factors coupled with the lopsided division of labor in heterosexual couples has resulted in an exodus of women leaving the U.S. workforce.

The Problem

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In September, an eye-popping [865,000 women dropped out of the U.S. workforce](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea08b.htm) — more than four times the number of men. Working mothers in heterosexual relationships are three times as likely to be responsible for the majority of the housework and childcare during the pandemic, one source [reports.](https://wiw-report.s3.amazonaws.com/Women_in_the_Workplace_2020.pdf) Studies find that [full-time working mothers](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eae15c77242c61f9ccae073/t/5ebf3f3685a8111dc38b4a1c/1589650897012/Invest+in+Parents+Report.pdf) in two-parent households are on average doing around 22 hours of childcare a week during the pandemic, in addition to maintaining their jobs. This loss has set women’s progress in the labor force back to levels not seen since 1988. Shockingly, the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t21.htm) reported that in December alone women lost 156,000 jobs while men gained 16,000. Every job lost in December was one held by a woman.

Women of color are even more adversely affected and of the 865,000 more than 324,000 were Latinas and 58,000 were Black women. Women of color are disproportionately represented in low-wage and high-contact service sectors such as restaurants, travel, and hospitality, which have seen the most closures and economic damage. The share of workers earning low wages is higher among Black and Latina women, reflecting the structural racism that has limited options in education, housing, and employment for people of color.

The Long-Term Impact To The Gender Gap

This trend coined the “[shecession](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/unemployment-coronavirus-women.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)” has the threat of a long-term economic impact, the risk of losing women in leadership positions, future women leaders, and unwinding years of painstaking progress toward gender equality. The impacts could sideline an entire generation of women. Economists worry that if women decide to stay on the sidelines post-pandemic the dynamism of the U.S. economy is at risk with [an estimated $64.5 billion per year](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023120947997) lost in wages and economic activity. The U.S. economy simply cannot rebound without women in the workforce. The consequence from the pandemic could deadlock women’s earnings potential and career progression, and for women who leave the workforce during this time, re-entry could prove even harder than usual. Indeed, the loss for women continues long after the economy has bounced back with an atrophy of their skills, experience, and job prospects.

Pre-pandemic, the average U.S. female employee earned only 81 cents for every dollar the average male employee made. The pandemic’s disproportionate economic toll on women could create an even larger gender wage gap during and following the economic downturn. Historically, recessions moderately decrease the gender wage disparity since they tend to have a greater impact on men. While normal recessions close the gap by 2 percentage points, the pandemic’s recession is projected to widen the gap by 5 percentage points. [Economists project](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27660?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20200817&utm_term=4756833&utm_campaign=money&utm_id=984457&orgid=353) that the average female worker will earn about 76 cents for every dollar the average male worker makes, and it will take more than 10 years for the wage gap to close to what it was before the pandemic.

Curbing The Negative Impact

We are a year into this pandemic, the consequences are palpable, and the future is uncertain. Now is the time for the legal businesses to plan for and act to curb the long-term damage to gender equality and the economy.

- Normalize Flexibility. Make a shift toward more progressive work policies. Even beyond the pandemic, normalize remote work and flexible work arrangements. Who says you must work a 9-5? Consider parent-friendly scheduling policies such as a compressed workweek, shorter workday, job sharing or part-time for positions where those options do not exist.  Flexible scheduling supports juggling childcare and work and ultimately improves employee job satisfaction. Further, with a virtual workplace, the talent pool is limitless and enables legal businesses to recruit a higher caliber workforce.
- Continue Empathy. Leaders should communicate empathy and flexibility to workers. Train managers on how to support teams who are balancing childcare, isolation, and virtual schooling on top of their demanding workload. Ask employees what they need, how they feel, and if they are comfortable with the current work situation. Normalize talking about these feelings. One way is to start all meetings with a check-in with the group or share successes. Another example is to celebrate working mothers’ efforts. Compassion can go a long way.
- Communicate Openly and Frequently. Listen to the needs of working mothers and communicate openly and often. Working mothers are facing anxiety about the pandemic, childcare, and job security. Share regular updates on the state of the firm and any key decisions that impact employees’ lives such as pay and benefits.
- Empower Women Leaders. It is important for female leaders and other employees to connect with one another; help empower women in your law firm by organizing a forum for women leaders to come together to share ideas and connect. Implement programs and policies empowering women to achieve leadership roles such as equity partnership. Establish programs where female partners or leaders mentor women beginning their career or returning to work after the pandemic.
- Invest in Diversity and Inclusion Efforts. Studies have found that gender and racial diversity improve the quality of decision making, increase innovation, and improve reputation. In uncertain times and in an environment where many companies are pivoting their business model, a focus on recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce will lead to a richer talent pool and improved business efforts. Now is the time to sharpen your DEI agenda. Do not take your foot off the pedal!
- Commit to Pay Equity. Federal pay equity legislation is high on President Joe Biden’s priority list, and it should be high on legal businesses’ list as well. Companies should develop formal process to remediate pay inequities. To achieve pay equity, it is vital to track outcomes for promotions and raises by gender to ensure that women and men are being treated fairly and consistently. Perform an annual pay equity analysis to rectify any wage gaps.
- Act Now. Seize the moment. To rebuild our economies, we must start now to implement efforts to support women in the workforce and recruit those who have left during the pandemic. McKinsey forecasts that taking action now to advance gender equality means [an additional  $13 trillion to the global GDP in 2030](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/covid-19-and-gender-equality-countering-the-regressive-effects) when compared with the gender-regressive scenario.
In a year marked by uncertainty and panic, legal businesses have an opportunity to make significant investments in building a more flexible and empathic workplace. The efforts, or lack of effort, will have consequences on gender equality and the entire economy for years to come.

Our clients expect us to be leaders in diversity and inclusion and make sure these values are reflected not only in their matters but in all levels of the firm generally. I will always focus on amplifying all voices of our lawyers, spanning geography and practice groups. I think diversity is a cultural differentiator for us and want to capitalize on past successes and be a leader in this space.

— [Barbara Becker](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/becker-barbara-l/), the first woman to serve as chair of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, commenting on the firm’s recent [diversification of office and practice group leadership](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2021/05/20/under-new-chair-gibson-dunn-moves-to-diversify-practice-office-leadership/) under her watch. With Becker, the firm’s former diversity chair, at the helm, more than half of office leaders are diverse and more than three-quarters of practice groups have at least one diverse leader.

# COVID-19 Could Catalyze The Legal Industry Renaissance
## In the face of the COVID-19 crisis, there are things that the legal industry can do not just to survive, but to adapt, evolve, and thrive.

As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, the focus unsurprisingly has been on the exigent and obvious.  No matter which industry you’re in, this pandemic threatens not only your life but your financial health.  Though much has been written about industries in peril, far less has been written about industries—like law—that are poised to enjoy a Renaissance.

During times of crisis, experts reflexively draw comparisons between seemingly similar events. Legal industry pundits are busily comparing the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial ruin created by the Great Recession of 2008.  Such comparisons are, at best, shaky.  Those pessimistic pundits are conflating both events and forecasting only doom and gloom.

COVID-19 Pandemic Economics vs The Great Recession – A Flawed Comparison

We’ll leave to actual economists a more thorough discussion of the two economic crises, but there are significant differences.

- First, the Great Recession of 2008 can be traced to sustained periods of unsound economic practices that coalesced into a systemic unraveling of a precarious U.S. economy. The economic turmoil battering the world today is directly tied to an abrupt, discrete cause: COVID-19. Nearly every component of the global economy has morphed from functioning in the ordinary course to a complete lock-down almost overnight.
- Second, the pain of what we call “Pandemic Economics” is nearly universal. Unlike the 2008 Great Recession, which hit the financial, building and construction materials, and real estate industries disproportionately hard, no industry segment has been left unscathed by today’s crisis—nor has any nation or region been spared.

The 2008 Great Recession and COVID-19 economic crisis bear little in common when it comes to speed, scope, and severity. Against this backdrop, we’re left scratching our heads as to why the legal industry pundits are pulling out the post-2008 playbook and relying on outmoded strategies.

COVID-19 Offers the Legal Industry a “DO OVER”

History has shown that catastrophe also creates opportunity for those savvy enough to innovate. The legal industry, which was tone deaf to market demands after the 2008 crisis and failed to proactively innovate, is getting a rare second chance.  In the face of the COVID-19 crisis, there are things that the legal industry can do not just to survive, but to adapt, evolve, and thrive.

Until the dust settles, most would agree that the near-term demand for legal services will be only in “essential” areas, such as healthcare, employment, bankruptcy, and criminal law. The dust will eventually settle, though. Then there will be an UNPRECEDENTED level of demand for legal services. Unlike the aftermath of the 2008 Great Recession, where the legal industry was unable to drive any aspects of a recovery, the U.S. legal industry can be a critical force in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Legal industry professionals will pore over mounds of insurance policies, contracts, and other documents to assess the legal rights of the afflicted, to be followed by years of lawsuits.  These lawsuits will be complex and multi-jurisdictional (or multi-national) and, quite literally, without precedent. Demand will skyrocket, giving the entire legal industry a serendipitous “do-over” to re-imagine new ways to deliver legal services.

Below are a few key takeaways on how to best position legal professionals and their organizations for success as the world re-engages:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Embrace “Surge” Lawyering. The business model around associates (mostly junior associates) has been broken for years. Does it really make sense to hire classes of associates out of law school, train them, pay them outsized fixed salaries, and then mercilessly cut these associates (and their related fixed salary cost) during downturns to avoid cutting into partner profits? This makes little sense from a business perspective and even less from a human development perspective. We don’t offer a magic bullet, but we do encourage out-of-the-box thinking around personnel who could be affected by an economic downturn. Today’s newly minted lawyers understand and embrace the gig economy. Perhaps, it’s time to take a page out of Uber’s playbook and consider “surge” staffing—to use and allocate “flex” legal professionals in a given area based on client demand and to share them across practice groups, moving them from one practice area to another within the firm, maybe back and forth between a firm and its clients, or perhaps even between law firms under a strategic alliance. Creative staffing can reduce fixed costs, provide staffing flexibility, treat junior legal professionals humanely, and allow savings to be passed onto clients.
- Promote “Tele-lawyering.” The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated that working from home is a viable way for many industries to conduct business. Tele-working requires self-discipline, good technology, flexibility, and patience, but it’s kept large segments of our economy afloat. As we emerge from lock-down mode, some form of “tele-lawyering” should continue. A new generation of legal industry leaders could forego unneeded physical office locations, which often come with a tony address, fancy artwork, posh furniture, and a high price-per-square-foot price tag. More “tele-lawyering” means reduced fixed real estate costs, driving savings for cost-conscious clients. In fact, other tele-working measures can become permanent as well, such as increased use of telephonic and video conferencing for court hearings and other in-person meetings requiring travel or downtime. Save in-person interactions for instances when in-person delivers greater benefits.
- Really innovate—don’t just talk about it.  Smart growth investors study trends and invest in innovative companies that address those trends. Think about the transition from “retail-to-e-commerce” businesses or “on-premises software-to-cloud” solutions. Over the next decade, many in the legal industry will do well just from anticipated demand. The real legal industry winners, who outperform the market, will invest in innovative talent, cutting-edge technology, and smart data analytics solutions.
People retain lawyers in good times and really pay them in bad times. As we move into an uncharted future, the legal industry is entering a Renaissance period where it can truly lead the recovery from the COVID-19 financial crisis.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I think our story is essentially over. We were able to look at the data over the course of the year and the overwhelming majority of our colleagues are complying. Sitting here in December, I know not everyone loves it, but from the institution’s perspective, we are in a good spot. The way the business is running, this is what I had hoped would happen.

— [Neil Barr](https://www.davispolk.com/lawyers/neil-barr), chair and managing partner of Davis Polk, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/12/20/big-laws-return-to-office-journey-still-not-complete-but-more-settled-now/) on the firm’s return-to-office policies. This past spring, the firm announced a mandatory attendance policy that would require attorneys to be present in the office [four days each week](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/). Barr reiterated that “most” employees are complying with the firm’s in-office attendance mandate.

# There Will Be Blood
## What will Trump's social media posts advocate after it sinks in that he's facing jail time?

The Manhattan District Attorney may indict Donald Trump some time this week.
The indictment will be sealed, so the public won’t know its contents until either Trump is arraigned or someone leaks information.

Then, all hell will break loose.

Trump’s started chiseling around the corners of hell already, asking on social media that his supporters “protest” on his behalf. If Trump were asking for peaceful protests, that would be fine. But January 6 should make any sentient person question if that’s what he’s doing. Now Trump’s expected to hold a rally in Waco, Texas, on March 25, a time that marks the 30th anniversary of the siege at the [Branch Davidian compound](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/1753989362194951155#).

That’s just the start. What will Trump say in Waco? What will he say at the rallies after that? What will his social media posts advocate after it sinks in that he’s facing jail time?

Folks who used to work in the Manhattan DA’s office claim to be calm: The Manhattan DA has handled high-profile cases before. All of the people involved are professionals. The security personnel know how to handle these things. We routinely handle gang-murder cases. Don’t worry.

Nonsense.

This case is different.

[You heard it here a year and a half ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/on-trumps-indictment-an-open-letter-to-the-fbi/), and I’m saying it again today: There will be blood.

Maybe the Manhattan DA’s office has handled gang-murder cases before. I wouldn’t know. I never heard the names of the gang members, or the murderers, or the victims, or the witnesses, or the judges in those cases.

Isn’t the Trump situation a little different?

I know the name Trump. And Michael Cohen. And Stormy Daniels. And Allen Weisselberg (the Trump Organization’s CFO). And I could learn in a heartbeat all the other players and witnesses. The Manhattan DA himself, Alvin Bragg, has been speaking about this publicly, and Trump has been dragging Bragg’s name through the mud.

We’ll soon know the names of the prosecutors, and the name of the judge. We’ll know the names of the investigators. We’ll know the dates and times of hearings.

Who are the police and FBI going to protect? The judge, around the clock, for months? The prosecutors, around the clock, for months? Michael Cohen, and the other key witnesses, around the clock, for months? The grand jurors, if their names leak? The petit jurors, when the time comes, and if their names leak?

Moreover, when the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, someone attacked an FBI office in Cincinnati, which had nothing to do with the raid but simply housed part of the FBI. Who knows what attacks in unexpected places will be triggered by calls for “protests”?

And this is a case that will last for months, at a minimum, in the pretrial stages, as Trump raises statute of limitation issues, and challenges to legal theories, and the rest. The filing of every brief, and the ruling on every motion, will be covered by MSNBC and Fox. Trump will either rage or appeal, or both, depending on the available options.

Trump will repeatedly be telling his supporters that the prosecutors are coming after him first and his supporters next. We know that some fraction of those supporters can be motivated to violence, as January 6 demonstrated.

There will be blood.

This raises two related questions:

First, should America be intimidated?

You may or may not think that this indictment is a good idea. Maybe a former president shouldn’t be prosecuted for allegedly cooking his company’s books and committing campaign finance violations. Maybe it’s a dangerous precedent to let one of hundreds of elected state prosecutors decide whether to pursue a prominent person in an opposing political party. Maybe there are other, more important crimes to prosecute in New York.

But once a prosecutor announces a case, should the former president’s likely attempts to incite violence cause the country to lose its nerve? Or should we stand firm once the indictment is announced and Trump intensifies his campaign of intimidation?

Second, what the heck is about to happen to the Republican Party? All the pundits seem to think that the indictment will help Trump politically, even if it hurts him personally. Maybe so. But what about people other than Trump? I assume those who have been standing by Trump to date will hold the line, saying that the indictment is a politically motivated witch hunt. But Trump’s case may reach trial before the election; Trump may well be convicted; it’s hard to see a convicted felon winning a race for the presidency.

What will Republicans do then?

Will enough of the Republican Party abandon Trump to permit the emergence of a new conservative party, dedicated to principles instead of a person?

Maybe some good will ultimately come from this.

But first, there will be blood.

White House (by Cezary p via Wikimedia)

Years ago, I sat over lunch with a bunch of appellate law clerks.

One of the clerks worked for an average judge. (Frankly, most clerks work for average judges. The average judge is, after all, average. That may not be too flattering, but it’s a simple arithmetic truth.)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The clerk bemoaned how hard the clerk’s job was: “It’s so hard to know what all the cases say. For any one case that I’m working on, I read the relevant cases, suggest a result, and then sprint on to start learning some new field of law that will apply in the next case. And I’m only here for a year; that’s not enough time to learn everything. The court really needs a long-term employee who can just slow down, read all of the cases, and think about them. The court should hire someone whose job is to read and understand the cases.”

Another clerk sitting at the table grinned: “The court has hired those people. They’re call ‘judges.'”

The first clerk, sheepishly, and embarrassed by what the clerk had just implicitly disclosed: “Oh. Right.”

I flashed back to that lunch when I was listening to one of the recent January 6 Committee hearings.

It struck me that what we really need in the White House is someone whose job is to think only about the good of the country. If the White House hired that person, then the country would be far better served.

And then it struck me: The White House does employ a person whose job is to think only about the good of the country. That person is called the president.

Me, sheepishly, and embarrassed by what I had just implicitly acknowledged:  “Oh. Right.”

# Biden Granddaughter To Join D.C. Biglaw Firm

After graduating from Columbia Law School earlier this year, Naomi Biden, the daughter of Hunter Biden and his first wife Kathleen, is [poised to join the Biglaw ranks in January](https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/12/10/naomi-biden-will-join-a-dc-law-firm-in-january/). The Washingtonian reports that the newly minted JD will be joining [Arnold & Porter’s](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/) 55-member incoming class.

In relocating her legal career to the District, she follows in the footsteps of Tiffany Trump, who chose to attend Georgetown Law when her dad moved into the White House. Thus, the transition from Tiffany to Naomi as the new “First Lawyer” will complete the peaceful transfer of power in the Above the Law universe. And as it turns out, Naomi and Tiffany are friends in the way elites are, and [snapping pictures together while partying in the Hamptons](https://people.com/politics/tiffany-trump-naomi-biden-hamptons-photo/). See, we can all cross the aisle and get along over mimosas at the beach house!

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In any event, while [we’re waiting on Tiffany’s next career move](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/tiffany-trump-graduated-from-a-t14-law-school-but-may-need-a-job/), her buddy will move into the largest law firm lobbying shop in the country right as her grandpa becomes president. Hopefully, she’ll be joining literally any other practice area within the firm.

But before she starts billing up a storm to get those [suspiciously light](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/ap-bonuses/) bonuses, she’s offering some pro bono legal analysis for Donald Trump:

The case of Trump v. Reality

Cause of action: “he was winning” but the “numbers started miraculously getting whittled away in secret”

Legal claims: “writing down things, the workers, and doing a lot of bad things”

— Naomi Biden (@NaomiBiden) [November 6, 2020](https://twitter.com/NaomiBiden/status/1324567730184474624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

That was funny on November 9, but as I flip through the Texas v. Pennsylvania papers, we’ve moved well beyond parody.

# Biglaw Firm Offers 30 Percent Premium Over Scale For Top Billers!
## A nice little cherry on top.

From a compensation perspective, this has been a banner year for Biglaw associates. Milbank forced the top firms to issue what was basically a cost of living increase over the summer. Cravath upped that scale for some older associates and Simpson made everyone hand out summer bonuses. So when Cravath set the scale yesterday with a precise match of last year’s numbers, it only seemed anticlimactic if you’ve not been paying attention.

Still, it could get just a little bit better, and that’s where Fried Frank steps in.

The firm just announced its annual bonus numbers and they are, on the surface, a Cravath match:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class of 2018 – $15,000 (prorated) Class of 2017 – $15,000
Class of 2016 – $25,000
Class of 2015 – $50,000
Class of 2014 – $65,000
Class of 2013 – $80,000
Class of 2012 – $90,000
Class of 2011 – $100,000
Class of 2010 and above – $100,000

But those figures don’t tell the whole story. Last October, the firm laid out a bonus eligibility policy that offers some serious incentives. For those billing 2000-2199 hours, what you see is what you get: a proper Cravath-scale bonus. But for those billing 2200-2449 hours, the firm is offering a 15 percent premium over the bonus scale. The firm capped that premium at 15 percent of last year’s scale — just in case Cravath took firms higher this year — but since the scale is unchanged, these associates are getting the full 15 percent.

But those go-getters with 2450+ hours under their belt — including, it’s worth mentioning, up to 300 hours of pro bono and up to 125 hours of “qualified non-billable hours” — they’ll be taking home an additional 30 percent on top of their bonus! Do you know the price of being a hard worker and someone who has shunned all those who love them? Well, you do now and it’s $4500 for the Class of 2017!

On the flipside, anyone who misses the 2000 hour threshold really feels the hurt. They’re capped at 25 percent of the Fried Frank scale. Oof. Never have a couple of missing hours stung so hard. I guess it’s better than nothing.

# What Can You Learn About A Law Firm From Glassdoor?
## Firms are ignoring this website at their peril.

[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) can tell you a lot about an employer and a lot of what it can tell you is borderline believable gossip from disgruntled employees. But is there anything valuable to be gleaned from the venerable workplace rating site?

The folks at [Legal Evolution](https://www.legalevolution.org) decided to [dig into Glassdoor’s data and highlight some lessons from the website](https://www.legalevolution.org/2019/05/workplace-transparency-part-i-is-it-time-to-take-glassdoor-seriously-095/). Recognizing the ever-accelerating trend toward transparency — or, frankly, “TMI” — the Legal Evolution report begins by making the case that Glassdoor is a labor market reality and there’s not really any use in continuing to complain about it. People clearly use it, and firms need to accept it. Satisfied employees translate to a better organization according to study after study and Glassdoor seems to provide decent indicia of employee satisfaction.

So what can we gather? Taking ratings from the Am Law 200, as well as the Fortune 1000, the top 100 accounting firms (there’s more than 4!) and the top 50 consulting firms, we can see that the categorical scores that make up a firm’s overall Glassdoor rating vary quite a bit. Employees are generally happier with their compensation than they are with senior management or their actual career prospects:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


Congratulations, you’ve achieved late-stage capitalism!

But where the Legal Evolution report adds to firm management is by breaking down the correlations between these ratings and working out where improvements would provide the biggest impact to the overall score. In other words, if a company is looking to improve its street cred, what factor would it want to focus on first.

As it turns out, money doesn’t buy everything. By leaps and bounds, figuring out what improves the “culture and values” score adds the most to the law firm’s overall rep. And, bad news for attorneys, improving the “work/life balance” provides the least oomph to the final tally.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Too bad law firms aren’t using Glassdoor as much as they should. Over 60 percent of the Am Law 200 isn’t an “engaged” Glassdoor company. No other segment they studied tops 40 percent on that score.

And that’s a missed opportunity because the firms that do the most to earn high overall Glassdoor scores [also happen to be the most profitable](https://www.legalevolution.org/2019/05/workplace-transparency-part-ii-a-roadmap-for-law-firms-095/).



For firm leadership, there’s a temptation to put the cart in front of the horse and assume that “firms that perform well will yield satisfied workers,” but with a hopping lateral market and growing transparency, it’s very much the other way around. As Legal Evolution put it:

Here’s our conclusion: The legal market circa 2019 is in the early days of lawyers discovering, learning, and mastering principles of professional management, including sophisticated notions of leadership and employee/team development. This is going to happen because we are far along the pathway of several hundred high-quality regional law firms converging into a single national and global market. See [Post 082](https://www.legalevolution.org/2019/02/pay-hours-tradeoff-london-law-firms-related-existential-issues-082/)(discussing progression over a period of decades).  If Firm A resists the principles of professional management, it will be vanquished by Firm B.

The old saw is that lawyers are terrible at business, but if that was ever true, the era of firms that fail to grasp the lessons of business management is over.

Check out the whole series of observations over at Legal Evolution — it’s really a treasure trove of what firms can learn from Glassdoor. Even if the report doesn’t touch on how much you can learn about brewing sex scandals from the comments!

# Plaintiff Backs Out Of Gender Discrimination Lawsuit Against Jones Day Rather Than Reveal Her Name

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

It looks like Jones Day has one fewer (named) plaintiff to deal with. As you may recall, the firm is facing a purported class-action gender discrimination [lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) alleging a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system. There had been seven named plaintiffs in the case, but now Jane Doe 4 has withdrawn.

Jane Doe 4 was the last [remaining anonymous](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/jones-day-wants-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-to-reveal-themselves-to-the-public/) plaintiff in the case. Although three additional women filed the case anonymously, they[ disclosed their names in June](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/), saying they were bolstered by others coming forward. Sanford Heisler Sharp, the firm representing the plaintiffs, fought for the plaintiff’s right to remain anonymous, saying there was a well-founded fear of retaliation and analogizing the situation to that of a whistleblower. However, a ruling by U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss of the District of Columbia meant that all named plaintiffs had to be identified by Monday, August 12th, or withdraw from their role as class representative. Facing disclosure of her identity, Jane Doe 4 opted to withdraw from the case.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/08/13/denied-anonymity-ex-jones-day-associate-retreats-as-gender-bias-representative/) Law.com, Jane Doe will remain a class member as it is currently defined in the Second Amended Complaint:

“As the class is defined in the Second Amended Complaint filed last night, Jane Doe 4 remains a class member, though she is not among the named plaintiffs and proposed class representatives,” Sanford Heisler partner Deborah Marcuse said in an emailed statement.

In [their response](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/jones-day-to-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-you-dont-deserve-to-be-paid-on-the-cravath-scale/?rf=1) to the First Amended Complaint, Jones Day denied the plaintiffs’ allegations, going after the notion the plaintiffs should be paid on the market scale set by Cravath, and highlighting the professional failings of the plaintiffs.

# Latham Built Itself A Badass Robot

When Biglaw firms send out their press releases announcing a hotshot lateral hire, we take notice. Especially when it’s a [game-changing acquisition of talent](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/kirkland-ellis-hires-paul-clement-viet-dinh-and-all-of-bancrofts-lawyers/). So we’re somewhat embarrassed that we missed when Latham & Watkins hired a f**king Autobot.



According to [Instagram user robertmasek](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKV10KiDiws/), this was outside the TechCrunch Disrupt show in San Francisco yesterday. Megabots is a giant robot fighting challenge for people who lost interest in Battlebots but incorrectly diagnosed the problem as “because the robots weren’t big enough,” as opposed to “because fighting robots are boring.” And apparently Latham sees this as an opportunity to capture the critical interdimensional Kaiju demographic.

[UPDATE: [Additional tips suggest the firings might be particularly harsh](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/just-how-ruthless-were-these-reed-smith-firings/)]

Imagine being told to pull out all the stops to deliver for the client on an office-spanning discovery project. Then imagine, months later, being unceremoniously fired “for cause” while a disembodied teleconferencing head characterizes all that brute force effort as a “billing error.”

That’s what tipsters claim happened at Reed Smith earlier this month.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
On January 4, Reed Smith allegedly fired numerous associates across multiple offices over a Zoom call, informing the impacted attorneys that the decision could not be contested and that they would receive no severance. The calls reportedly based the move on “billing errors” on a document review project that ended in October. These firings arrived, by all accounts we’ve seen, without warning and without any consultation with the managing partners of the offices or groups involved.

When asked about this mass firing, a firm spokesperson responded, “We do not comment on personnel matters.”

Billing shenanigans aren’t unheard of on a massive discovery project. A Dentons associate [billed 277 hours to review 20 documents](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/biglaw-associate-bills-277-hours-to-review-20-documents-and-im-fascinated-to-know-how-this-happened/) once. The idea that attorneys across numerous offices acting independently all screwed up their bills in the same way pushes the envelope of credulity, but let’s assume for the sake of argument that there was some sort of systemic billing problem.

This response still seems wildly suspect.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Why was there no intervention beforehand? According to one tipster, not only were the fired associates never approached about their billing beforehand, partners had encouraged the attorneys to “allocate as much time as possible on the project” in order to complete it quickly. This detail makes the claim that the firm axed associates without consulting the intermediary partners more troubling because it raises the prospect that attorneys lost their jobs for following their local marching orders.

If management contributed to the problem, then management needs an opportunity to take responsibility. A chance to say, “you can’t fire this person… we told them to come in every Saturday” or whatever. And while consulting the managers before pulling out the termination stick amounts to the bare minimum of prudent leadership, the firm needn’t have waited all the way until January to reach out. The project began in August and ended in October! Modern law firms don’t wait months at a time to check time entries — if there are entries egregious enough to warrant firing someone, the firm had ample time to address that through its management structure before January.

One tip suggests that this move stems from a client mandate to audit the billing and the project. That would explain the firm’s lack of action from August to January to the extent the firm itself didn’t have a problem with the billing until the client complained.

But the proper remedy under those circumstances would seem to be writing off some of the time, a thorough review of how massive projects are managed when they span multiple offices and management structures, and reevaluating how bills went out the door in the first place that might jeopardize a client relationship.

Not firing a bunch of associates “for cause” and putting a stain on careers that, by all accounts we’ve read, had only received positive reviews up until that point.

And, again, this all assumes the associates actually DID commit some egregious category of billing error. If instead they really just dutifully followed direction from management for several months without any contrary guidance… then this stinks way worse.

# More Raises Makes For Some Pretty Happy Associates
## Biglaw firm knows how to make associates smile.

If Biglaw firms are looking for a way to chase away a case of the Mondays, one surefire option is showering associates with big money.

The latest firm to announce a round of associate raises is Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, which took in $2,039,811,000 in gross revenue in 2020 — so they have lots of cash to share with hardworking associates. The firm previously [announced a DPW match](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/freshfields-raise-2022/), but now that [Cravath has come over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) of those numbers (for midlevel and senior associates), Freshfields has re-upped associate salaries.

The new scale at the firm is as follows:

Like the last round of raises, these are retroactive to January 1. You can read the full memo [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/freshfields-re-raise-22/2/).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# How To Protect Yourself From The Attack Of Spam Email Bot-Recruiters
## In an industry that’s built on trust, leave it to the real-life recruiters to help you make your next move and advance your career.

In the age of bots (short for “internet robots”), and a ton of them at that, it’s getting harder to distinguish person from program. These systems are designed to simulate human activity and they work – to a point.

Lately, some enterprising “legal recruiters” have begun using bots to lure candidates into permitting them to submit those candidates to potential employers. While the line between an exchange with a real person and a robot is getting fuzzier, one thing is clear – candidates allowing themselves to be represented by bots are NOT doing themselves any favors.

We’ve been in the industry long enough to know that a good recruiter can’t be lazy and that the most important value-add we bring is often the personal feel for matchmaking. Some things need to be left to the experts. From sage advice and industry insight to finding a firm that’s a good fit, working with a reputable and respected (living, breathing) recruiter is irreplaceable.

Not only that, but working with an agency using bots to replace its recruiters might hinder your chances of being placed as opposed to helping them. While you may be one of a few thousand midlevel corporate associates, you are a unique candidate with unique skills and experiences. Why should you let a bot recruiter treat your search just like everyone else’s?

Here’s how you can protect yourself from recruiters and agencies that use automated systems and ensure that you are working with a legitimate, real-life recruiter:

1. Do your research

Our recruiters are our not-so-secret weapon. That’s why we share their posts, publish [their profiles](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/whos-who-of-kinney-recruiting/) and highlight them on our website. When you reach out to [Kinney Recruiting](http://bit.ly/2JrNyE4), a person is going to see your email or take your call. We can’t work formally with every person who seeks us out, but we aim to help EVERYONE in any way we can. When looking for a legal recruiting agency, make sure to do your research before signing up, handing over your resume or approving firms. Explore their website and look at their team. If you can’t find your “recruiter” on LinkedIn or they don’t check out online, they’re probably not actually a person. [Aside: In addition to bots, there are also recruiters who are real people, but their reputations are so tarnished that they operate under pseudonyms – you won’t find much about them either.]

2. Speak to your recruiter on the phone

Sure, automated systems can be handy and bots can answer general questions about a job position, but do you know what they can’t do? They can’t share a funny anecdote or build real relationships. We suggest that before you approve of any submissions to firms, you talk to your recruiter over the phone. That will confirm that you are in fact interacting with a person and opens the door to creating a rewarding connection.

3. Trust your gut

Jessica Chin Somers, a Managing Director at Kinney Recruiting, recently received an email from a candidate saying: “This may sound strange, but this is a real email and you are a real person? I signed up for a few other recruiting firms and I get plenty of automated emails. It can be a bit confusing.” Jessica reassured the candidate that yes, she is a real person with a real law degree (two!), a real phone number and a real email address. On top of that, Jessica also eats real food and has real feelings. All of our recruiters do. There is nothing wrong with asking a recruiter that you have only corresponded with via email if they are real, especially if you are uncertain about something or are considering approving firms online. Our advice? Always trust your gut. If you have a feeling that they aren’t authentic or you just want to make sure you’re not entering a system you might struggle to get out of, don’t hesitate to ask. Better yet, give them a call and have a conversation. If that’s impossible or even difficult, run!

Every candidate’s worst nightmare is (or should be) that their resume lands up spamming firms and that they become unhireable. We take steps to ensure that you never land up in that position. Our recruiters personally write submissions, help you prepare for interviews and personally negotiate your offer. Finding the right candidate for a job or the right firm for a candidate can be labor intensive and isn’t always easy.

However, in an industry that’s built on trust, leave it to the real-life recruiters to help you make your next move and advance your career.

# Judge Finds Kasowitz Benson Really Does Need To Comply With Deadlines
## And that's not even the most interesting part of the case.

Biglaw firm Kasowitz Benson has some sanctions headed their way, thanks to Florida Circuit Court Judge G. Joseph Curley. Well, to be more fair, the firm’s failure to meet the deadline to answer a lawsuit filed by Laura Perlmutter — wife of Marvel chair Isaac Perlmutter — is behind the sanction.

Kasowitz didn’t answer the complaint until 38 days after the deadline had passed — and only after Perlmutter filed a motion for default judgment and the firm’s appeal was rejected by an appellate court. And the judge was not pleased with the Biglaw firm’s tactics:

“Defendants’ dilatory tactics required plaintiff to initiate unnecessary motion practice and return to court for another hearing,” the judge said. “Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees and costs that she incurred as a result of defendants’ bad faith behavior.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As [reported by ](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1538396/kasowitz-hit-with-sanctions-in-fla-hate-mail-framing-spat)Law360, the court took umbrage at the delays:

“Defendants are not free to ignore a court-imposed deadline in favor of their preferred schedule,” he said. “The law is clear that an extension request is no substitute for a responsible pleading.”

Judge Curley added that the firm didn’t file its answer immediately after the appellate court rejected its petition, even though that was Kasowitz’s “self-prescribed basis to delay.”

“Instead, defendants continued their delay despite the denial of their petition, which left no justification (self-prescribed as it was) for further delay,” he said.

In the underlying lawsuit, Perlmutter accuses the firm of using tainted DNA results to try to paint her as sending hate mail to her neighbor — and Kasowitz client — Canadian businessman Harold Peerenboom. The incident occurred almost 10 years ago. But really, the details of the complaint read like a soap opera:

According to the suit, the Perlmutters moved to Sloan’s Curve, a residential community in Palm Beach, in 1991. There, the couple became friends with the community’s tennis center operator. Peerenboom moved into the neighborhood in 2007 and eventually tried to push out the tennis center operator, Perlmutter said. That dispute led to the underlying litigation.

Peerenboom began receiving anonymous hate mail in late 2012, a year after firing one of his attorneys, Perlmutter says.

In early 2013, Peerenboom retained named partner Marc Kasowitz along with [then-partner Michael Paul Bowen], Perlmutter said. The firm, Kasowitz and Bowen represented the businessman until December 2020, she says.

Although Peerenboom immediately suspected the terminated employee of being behind the mail, a plan was concocted to steal the Perlmutters’ DNA, per the suit. Later, a falsified DNA report was taken to the police, Perlmutter claims.

# Ty Cobb's Hilarious Emails And What They Say About Biglaw
## Cobb may be an ""adult,"" but he doesn't understand email basics.

Ty Cobb

OMG — you guys… Ty Cobb, the former Hogan and Lovells partner who [left the firm to join Donald Trump’s legal defense team](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-incredible-growing-presidential-legal-team/?rf=1), is embroiled in an hilarious email scandal. As first reported by[ Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-lawyer-ty-cobb-email-russia-2017-9), Cobb decided to engage in an email exchange with [noted troll and ramen shop owner](http://www.thedailybeast.com/a-hidden-hand-in-the-trump-russia-drama-owns-a-ramen-shop-no-seriously) Jeff Jetton.

Jetton emailed Cobb at his White House email address to express his… displeasure at the lawyers representing Trump. To be fair, Jetton’s emails are vulgar and crude,[ including tidbits](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/09/06/trump_lawyer_s_leaked_email_is_funny.html) like, “Have fun choking Trump’s nutsack.” And, “I wish you nothing but joy when his hairy testicles get caught up in your throat.”  A delight, really. But Cobb decided to respond, at least to the non-dick sucking parts.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Included in the exchange are real concerns about the current political landscape:

“I’m probably going to lose access to affordable healthcare, Ty,” Jetton wrote, adding that Trump is “screwing everyday Americans” and that “I don’t have to tell you that, it’s right there slapping you across the face.”

To which Cobb responded:

Dude U have no idea! I walked away from $4 million annually to do this, had to sell my entire retirement account for major capital losses and lost a s—load to try to protect the third pillar of democracy. Your hate I will never understand as an American. Hope you get help!

Suuuuuure. Losing access to affordable life saving medical care is basically the same as voluntarily leaving a job making millions of dollars (especially when you know you can likely come back to that job or another similar one whenever you want). Yup, those two things are exactly equivalent. Trump has made it a habit to hire millionaires, but the [out of touch aura](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/which-law-school-would-marie-antoinette-go-to-if-she-married-the-treasury-secretary/) they bring to the table is a slap in the face to the populist vibe Trump has worked so hard to cultivate. Words like this should be (even though they probably won’t be) a wake-up call to working-class voters who ignored the racism of Trump’s campaign because he understood their plight.

Jetton’s emails also pressed Cobb on how he can justify working for such a flawed politician. Cobb’s responses to that are revealing:

Can say assertively the more adults in the room will be better. Me and Kelly among others. Over and out

I’m sure that will go over real well in the viper pit that is the West Wing.

Cobb also made an appeal to a foundation of the legal profession — that everyone deserves a defense:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
All deserve a defense. Particularly with phony allegations and fake news. I am on’t be here for long but will be I my piece against bullshit Russian bullshit that hurts us now and is totally political limiting Russian cooperation against NK. This shit is real and real time. Got to go: Best, Ty

At its root this is just a platitude, one used as a defense when the details are too overwhelming. And given that said client has [promised to defund](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/jim-harbaugh-is-going-after-donald-tump-over-legal-aid-funding-yes-thats-a-real-sentence/) Legal Aid, the government program that is designed to ensure that everyone actually does have adequate access to legal counsel, it isn’t as much a steadfast guiding principle for Cobb as much as a convenient excuse.

All of this translates into a proper scandal, and as such, Cobb sent a statement about the incident to [Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/trumps-russia-scandal-lawyer-says-hes-one-of-the-adults-in-the-white-house/):

I was trying to turn someone who appeared angry into a friend. And privately. My bad. This was what I believed to be a private conversation. There are many pros and talented people in the White House. I am proud to be there. It was not for public consumption but it appears I was catfished.

Um. No, you were not catfished. This is clearly some old guy trying to use a term they heard on the TVs without understanding what it means. Key to the [catfish](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=catfish) conceit is there is some false, fictional persona used to draw an unsuspecting person into a relationship. This is not that. From the emails Jetton sent to Cobb he is clearly a pissed-off American eager to share his displeasure at the Trump administration — hell, Cobb’s own statement about the incident references Jetton’s anger at politics. So Cobb knew exactly who he was emailing.

Also, “This was what I believed to be a private conversation.” …. Why exactly did you think that? Because you wished it so? COME ON DUDE. You were using your official White House email address!  AND you’re a litigator. Surely you’ve seen cases turn on something imprudently said over email. Maybe Cobb is too old to have reviewed thousands of emails himself in cases, but he must have seen “hot doc” binders filled with emails the sender wished in retrospect had been kept private. Plus, the [exact same thing happened](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-writes-angry-emails-and-everyone-completely-overreacts/) to Marc Kasowitz, another Biglaw partner pulled into Trump’s defense team, when he responded to random haters over email and his responses went public.

Cobb should have known better. Biglaw should have taught him that. But I’m sure the president’s reaction when he learns of the publicity Cobb is getting for calling himself and Kelly the “adults in the room” will be punishment enough.

# Alex Acosta Resigns To Probably Go Make Millions Because There Are No More Consequences
## Accountability just doesn't apply to some people.

Earlier this week, Donald Trump expressed his confidence in Labor Secretary Alex Acosta. This declaration mirrored his [expressions of confidence in FBI Director James Comey or attorney Marc Kasowitz](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/spicer-confirms-president-stands-with-kasowitz-start-the-countdown-to-his-firing/) and ended the same way: with Acosta tossed to the curb. The embattled cabinet official resigned today after the world finally caught up with the Miami Herald in reporting on Acosta’s handling of billionaire admitted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s case.

The dreaded “vote of confidence” doesn’t necessarily exile someone from Trump’s good graces. In Acosta’s case, he was given an opportunity to appear before the press and put on the sort of combative, no apologies performance that salvaged Slimy McBrewsky’s Supreme Court nomination. But ([unlike Alan Dershowitz, another other public figure locked into Epstein’s downfall](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/alan-dershowitz-says-he-thinks-he-shouldve-gotten-epstein-a-better-deal-in-wild-doubling-down-interview/)), Acosta [royally bombed his opportunity to impress Trump.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/alex-acosta-just-delivered-a-dumpster-fire-of-a-press-conference/) Minutes after his press conference, we predicted, “If this was his pitch, expect to see him gone within the week.”

And now he is.

With this, the administration’s brutal labor policy isn’t going to change. Some unconfirmed “acting Secretary” will take over and continue the assault on workers. At this point, it’s not likely that Trump would even try to nominate someone and invite a Senate hearing that might cast some light on administration policy. Opacity is part of the strategy at this point.

And with a mounting scandal that toppled a federal cabinet job, Acosta isn’t likely to feel much of a pinch either. While the SDNY U.S. Attorney’s Office is pursuing the Epstein case through the Public Corruption Unit — a move that could signal pending charges against Acosta — let’s embrace the cynicism and assume that assignment was more an effort to shield the case from being quietly killed and will ultimately pass on trying to charge a former federal prosecutor.

So what happens to Acosta? A double Harvard grad who clerked for Sam Alito, worked for Kirkland & Ellis, taught classes at ostensible law school George Mason, led a law school, and served on the NLRB, as a U.S. Attorney, and, obviously, a cabinet secretary isn’t going to stay unemployed for long. Someone is going to wait 10 minutes for this hubbub to die down and then hand Acosta a few million to hop on the letterhead and bolster their “star” partnership ranks. Whether it’s a return trip to Kirkland & Ellis or a jump to unapologetic Trump firm Jones Day, it doesn’t really matter.

Alex Acosta is, pending prosecution, is going to get a raise out of all this deal. There’s just a point where failure, even the sort of gross failure that spurs a federal judge to call out your serious “material omissions,” don’t lead to any consequences. Some people just get to fail upward. That’s where we are.

Back in July, the board of directors relieved Dentons U.S. CEO Mike McNamara of his position, mid-term. There was no successor waiting in the wings. He was out of the room when the decision was made, and, as [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/dentons-mum-on-sudden-ceo-ouster-while-defending-his-success) Bloomberg Law, McNamara didn’t see it coming.

The firm hasn’t commented on the ouster, but did praise McNamara’s growth strategy. Dentons’s growth strategy under McNamara was dubbed Project Golden Spike and focused on markets traditionally overlooked by Biglaw:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

In January 2020 the firm announced its initial combinations—the 175-lawyer Bingham Greenebaum, based in Louisville, Kentucky, and the 140-lawyer Cohen & Grigsby out of Pittsburgh. McNamara heralded the tie-ups as “an exceptional moment for our firm and the business and profession of law.” Dentons went on in 2020 to add firms in Salt Lake City, Des Moines, Iowa; and Birmingham, Alabama.

Despite the headcount growth, there were reports of missed revenue targets and dissatisfaction — some reportedly believe the firm should focus on adding lawyers in bigger markets where they can command a higher rate. And there was a lawsuit filed by a former partner Jinshu “John” Zhang over the distribution of a contingency fee. The ongoing litigation was cited by global Chair Joe Andrew for the reason the firm was so quiet about the leadership change:

“Part of the reason there is a story here to the extent there is one, is that the law firm that’s so transparent hasn’t been able to explain itself because of the pending litigation,” Andrew said. “That is the conflict. And if there is a story, that’s it.”

McNamara continued at the firm as a partner after his removal from leadership.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now following a months-long review by a search committee, Sonia Martin has been named the latest U.S. CEO at Dentons. Martin has been at Dentons since 1996 as a summer associate. She’s the first woman in the U.S. CEO role, and has previously served as an office managing partner and on the global and U.S. boards at the firm.

The[ Bay Area litigator said](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/dentons-names-martin-u-s-ceo-doubles-down-on-growth-plans) the firm is committed to Project Golden Spike, saying the recent combinations led to an additional $30 million in revenue that otherwise would have been referred outside of the firm:

“It’s been a success, and it’s been a success under remarkable circumstances,” Martin said, referring to the pandemic limiting the new partners’ ability to meet each other. “In terms of strategy, it will continue. And if anything, we’ll double down and we’ll have more announcements in the future with new opportunities.”

Congratulations to Martin, and best of luck managing the firm’s bold growth strategy.

# Firm's Collage Of New Partners Highlights Law's Enduring Diversity Problem

Not so much this image.

Before we go much further, let’s be clear that while this is an article about Biglaw diversity, it’s much more about Biglaw’s self-awareness. Because diversity shortcomings plague Biglaw generally and efforts to encourage genuine change tend to [lose their fizzle quickly](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/coca-cola-shook-up-diversity-efforts-racist-shareholders-gushed-out/).

Law firms promote partnership classes every year that fall short of the lofty diversity and inclusive rhetoric those same firms toss around in marketing materials. Usually this disconnect goes unnoticed because promotions are relegated to short blurbs in a press release.

But when firms feel fancy, they publish headshots to congratulate the new class. That’s when it’s really clear just how far firms are from fulfilling the promise of elevating more diverse leadership.

Which is what brings us to the announcement of DLA Piper’s recent promotions, which came with a nice collage of everyone. And that image… said its own thousand words:



Using grayscale certainly diminishes the impact, but that’s not a very diverse image. There are multiple new partners of Asian descent, but a review of [the rest of the announcement](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/news/2022/05/dla-piper-announces-partnership-promotions-for-2022/) suggests that all of these partners work overseas and mostly in DLA’s Asian offices.

In addition, a tipster noted:

– 0 black people. That is, none, zero, zilch.
– 0 Latino or Hispanic-origin people, outside of the promotions in Latin America and Portugal.

Not that these are the only vectors of diversity and there may be stories represented on this image that aren’t immediately obvious. But that’s the thing with images: they speak for themselves. If they don’t broadcast the whole story, that’s not the fault of the audience.

And the audience is seeing mostly white people getting promotions.

But here’s the thing — DLA Piper is actually better than a lot of Biglaw when it comes to diversity efforts! The firm is [Mansfield 4.0 certified](https://www.diversitylab.com/mansfield-rule-4-0/). That can’t be undersold, because there’s a whole lot of Biglaw that isn’t going out of its way to meet and exceed the Mansfield Rule. In a lot of ways, the takeaway from this incident shouldn’t be to vilify DLA Piper as much as to acknowledge that even firms doing a lot of work are still far behind where the profession needs to be.

[Paul Weiss put out a similarly monochromatic image a few years ago](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/paul-weiss-press-release-captures-everything-broken-about-biglaw-in-one-image/) and at the time I pointed out that it’s not that Paul Weiss is different than the rest of Biglaw — indeed, [it’s also better than a lot of Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/after-taking-heat-last-year-paul-weiss-spent-2019-providing-firms-a-blueprint-for-improving-diversity/) — it’s that somewhere along the process an image got created and folks were so normalized to the idea that the class would look a certain way that it wasn’t questioned before it got posted.

That’s why these promotion press release stories are more about self-awareness than diversity per se. Because firms need to be able to see the problem when they look at these images before they can ever get a handle on how to approach solving it.

Whenever an image like this comes out, I’m always hesitant to point it out because I fear firms will just take it as a reason to junk the images and go back to strictly text announcements — driving the problem underground again. That’s not helpful for anybody.

Because it’s actually good that we get to see what’s happening. Firms just need to reorient themselves to understand these images as a continuing call to action.

# Abracadabra! Magic Circle Firm Enchants Associates With Bonus Bucks

Last week, [Milbank set the scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/) for 2019 year-end bonuses, and once [Cravath decided](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/) to hop on board, the rest of Biglaw was essentially granted permission to join in the fun and make their announcements as well.

One Magic Circle firm has already announced its bonus news, and now another is ready to enchant its associates with bonus bucks. Hocus pocus! Which Magic Circle firm just pulled money out of its hat?

It’s Freshfields, and the firm has adopted the Milbank scale for its U.S. associates:

# Biglaw Summer Programs Phasing Out 'Boozefests' To Create All-New, Worse Sexual Harassment Opportunities
## These firms mean well, but sometimes good intentions aren't enough.

For decades, the summer associate experience existed hand-in-hand with alcohol. Go to a Yankees game… grab beers on a partner’s tab. Hit up a Broadway show… go grab drinks on the firm’s dime. Go to happy hour… get even more drinks after. It’s the social lubrication that bound the summer together. It’s always possible for the sober out there to [strike a balance and join the fun](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/striking-a-sober-balance-in-your-holiday-party/) without drinking, but the opportunity was always there.

But in the post-#MeToo world, some Biglaw firms are trying to phase out the boozy party. It’s a noble idea. It’s also incredibly stupid and will only make things worse.

American Lawyer looks at some firms, specifically Goodwin and Orrick, struggling to respond to the atmosphere of sexual impropriety that’s been allowed to reign in the American workplace for far too long and coming up with [some problematic cosmetic changes](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/04/goodbye-boozefests-hello-spinning-classes-summer-associates-after-metoo/):

Some, including Goodwin Procter and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, are taking the opportunity to modify their programs, partly by moving away from alcohol-fueled events to activities focused on the wellness and wellbeing of their summer associates.

“Since it is the first class since the #MeToo movement, I would hope and expect that most law firms do have a heightened level of awareness around potential liability that could come out of their summer associate programs,” said Patrick Krill, a legal industry behavioral health consultant.

Make no mistake, alcohol has the potential to erode barriers and promote bad behavior. But it’s also a cop out to blame booze for sexual misconduct. The overwhelming majority of us have managed to make a habit out of getting drunk and never groped someone without their consent. People who want to harass others will do it. Don’t let them pawn off their culpability on alcohol.

But perhaps there’s some benefit to cutting back at the extremes. It doesn’t have to be a frat party, obviously. And Krill has explained before that he thinks the [legal industry as a whole has an alcohol problem](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/task_force_report.html) — which is undoubtedly true — and that an out-of-control atmosphere for the summers just inculcates them with that culture — which may also be true. So some limited drawdown on the alcohol front probably isn’t the worst thing in the world. Now, let’s at least hear them out on this wellness push:

Goodwin’s calendar of events for its summer associates includes cooking classes, spinning classes, and cultural events like museum tours and theater outings.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

Spin classes? Yes, the answer to sexual harassment in the workplace is to ask women to wear compression pants and sports bras to events. How is this considered remotely acceptable? Add to the pronounced risk of unwanted ogling the general body shaming being dropped on associates of all stripes unwilling to make their physical fitness a subject of recruitment. Will overweight associates really want to work out with their supervisors? If they opt to spend their whole summer hitting up the museum, will they be on the outside of the “cool” fitness clique?

“Wellness” sounds all well and good, but it’s just another club, and one that — whether it means to or not — hypersexualizes people based on appearance. It’s a lot more fair and inclusive to evaluate people based on their ability to destroy their bodies than improve them.

How about we just let the kids drink and exercise some basic judgment to keep them from going too far? You know, the discretion that adults and professionals are supposed to exhibit? Coupled, perhaps, with the vigilance to spot and address warning signs of bad behavior before they reach fruition.

And to their credit, both firms are taking the critically important step toward promoting this vigilance, with both firms announcing training programs for summers to highlight this problem:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“Teamwork in the #MeToo Era” is a firmwide training being offered by the San Francisco-based firm that educates its employees on various firm policies, but also looks to promote discussions about proper workplace conduct in the #MeToo era.

“We also felt like it was important to roll out some training to make sure people really understood the policies in light of #MeToo,” said Siobhan Handley, chief talent officer at Orrick. “[And] we thought it was really important that we do this when the summer associates were a part of the firm.”

Still, the more cynical part of me wonders if this isn’t a well-meaning effort that inappropriately takes our eyes off the ball. Because, frankly, when I think of the #MeToo problem, it’s not a pair of drunk summers that worry me, it’s partners exercising the asymmetrical power relationship they enjoy with associates.

It would be a shame if a fun summer party is being sacrificed to keep us from questioning shady behavior going on the whole year round.

# Biglaw Firm Cuts Associate Salaries As It Continues Soldiering On With Merger
## Attorneys are seeing a 20 percent pay cut.

Even though folks are getting increasingly desensitized to the general sense of upheaval and uncertainty thanks to COVID-19, the actual conditions are changing — and pretty rapidly. The ever-growing list of Biglaw firms taking austerity measures to cut costs and maintain cash flow is a good reminder of the scope of how the legal profession is being altered by the novel coronavirus.

Yesterday in a call with managing partner [Thomas Cole](https://www.pepperlaw.com/people/thomas-j-cole-jr/), associates at Pepper Hamilton learned they’d be taking a whopping 20 percent pay cut, while partners are taking an unspecified reduction in distributions. And these salary reductions are likely to last through the end of the year. As one tipster noted, “It’s rough!”

But while all this is going on, the firm is still planning its merger with Troutman Sanders. The combination was originally scheduled to be completed by April 1, but due to the coronavirus, that was postponed to July 1. But tipsters at the firm tell Above the Law that even this extended timeframe sticks in the craw of many now asked to deal with such a substantial pay cut:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What I cannot understand, and what is baffling just about every Pepper attorney I talk to, is that we are proceeding with the Pepper / Troutman merger to be effective on July 1st! Mergers are being cancelled left and right in this market because they are incredibly expensive, mainly from an integration perspective (integrating technology systems, accounting departments, marketing departments, practice groups, etc., etc.). Many attorneys are confused as to why we are spending many millions of dollars on merger integration costs, when partners, counsels, associates and staff are taking 20% pay cuts! Why not put that integration money towards employees at a time during which we are all so vulnerable, and hold off on the merger until the times improve? All energy should now be on taking care of our clients and employees, and bringing in whatever new business is out there – not wasting millions of precious dollars on an unnecessary expense during the most critical time in our history. I think the vast majority of Peppers feel this way.

A spokesperson for the firm provided the following comment:

As a result of the disruption caused by COVID-19, Pepper Hamilton – like many law firms around the world – is undertaking a number of measures to ensure the financial stability of the Firm as we look toward our combined future with Troutman Sanders.

Because the extent of the pandemic’s impact on our clients and the firm is impossible to predict, the firm has reduced distributions to our partners. We are reducing salaries for all other attorneys, which would amount to an annualized reduction of under 12%.

All staff with salaries at or above $60,000 will have salaries reduced on a graduated scale with annualized cuts for the majority of those employees ranging between 3% and 9%.

As we continue to navigate this unprecedented situation, our priorities remain keeping our attorneys and employees safe and healthy, continuing to serve our clients at the highest level possible, taking proactive steps to keep firm financially strong, avoiding layoffs, doing our part to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and continuing to work with our counterparts at Troutman Sanders to bring our two firms together on July 1.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Partner Who Brought Biglaw Discrimination Suit Moves Firms
## With the ink on her settlement not yet fully dry, Connie Bertram is moving on.

Connie Bertram’s [$50 million lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/inside-the-50-million-gender-discrimination-case-a-partner-filed-against-proskauer-rose/) against Proskauer alleging specific acts of harassment from male partners and a systematic gender disparity in compensation shook Biglaw, much as Kerrie Campbell’s suit against Chadbourne did. While Proskauer [contested the suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/proskauer-hits-back-at-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/), arguing that Bertram had cherry-picked numbers to make her claim for being undercompensated, the firm ultimately [settled the claims](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/proskauer-settles-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-but-details-remain-shrouded-in-secrecy/) in a confidential agreement.

Throughout all of this, Bertram remained on at Proskauer, but now that the suit is in the past, she’s moving on and joining Polsinelli. From [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/09/17/proskauer-partner-behind-50m-gender-bias-suit-jumps-to-polsinelli/):

In a statement explaining her decision to change firms, Bertram cited the “tremendous teaming opportunities” presented by Polsinelli’s government contracts, government investigations, and corporate practices. ”Polsinelli offers a terrific combination of substantive expertise and talented attorneys with a great collaborative culture,” she said.

Nancy Rafuse, chair of Polsinelli’s labor and employment department, said she was eager to welcome Bertram to the firm, adding that she has known her for many years and worked for some of the same clients.

It’s hard not to see this as a consequence of the settlement — a “we’ll clear this up, but then you have to go” sort of deal. Certainly no one would blame Bertram for wanting a change of scenery after dueling with the firm for a year. But Bertram’s also the sort of big gun in this field that other firms are doubtless always courting. It shouldn’t surprise anyone if this had little to do with the settlement and everything to do with Polsinelli swooping in on a key lateral move.

The one thing we can say for sure: Polsinelli’s deal with Bertram is probably exceedingly transparent and fair.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Am Law 100 Firm Announces Associate Layoffs And Other Cost-Cutting Measures
## The first Biglaw associate layoffs as a result of coronavirus.

COVID-19 continues its devastation — both medical and financial — across the United States. We’ve heard about smaller or regional firms conducting [staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/law-firm-layoffs-amid-covid-19/) or [cutting salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/law-firms-conduct-layoffs-slash-salaries-in-response-to-pandemic/) in response to economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. But the latest impact the coronavirus has had on the legal industry is hitting Biglaw, and hard.

According to multiple sources at the firm, Womble Bond Dickinson announced on Friday afternoon a series of cost-cutting measures. That includes associate layoffs, employee furloughs, and cuts to lawyer compensation for those left at the firm. As a tipster reports:

FYI Womble Bind Dickinson made an announcement this afternoon about layoffs and furloughs to associates and staff. They also announced a 10 percent pay reduction for anyone making over $100k and a lower percentage reduction in the $50k to $100k range and the below $50k range. Announcement was made via conference call. No memo sent out to anyone yet

It’s starting to feel a lot like 2009 up in here.

We reached out to Womble, and they confirmed the measures. According to their statement, the move is mean to “curb the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic” and allow the firm to continue serving clients:

In response to the tremendous uncertainty brought on by this virus, Womble Bond Dickinson (US) has reluctantly had to make some adjustments to its business during this difficult time. We made the hard decision to furlough some selected salaried employees for a while and also had to let go another small group. In addition, we are temporarily instituting a 10 percent or less pay reduction (with lower levels of compensation reduced by smaller percentages) for our remaining staff and attorneys in this group. Decisions like these are never easy, but we hope by taking these steps now, we will curb the negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to build a strong firm that is positioned to serve our clients well.

There’s a lot of upheaval in Biglaw (and the rest of society) right now. Other Biglaw firms are still struggling with what to do about[ summer associate programs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firms-cant-seem-to-decide-what-theyre-going-to-do-with-summer-associate-programs/) and others are [doubling down on pro bono hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/paul-weisss-bold-leadership-on-coronavirus-pro-bono-efforts/) in response to the pandemic. But with no end to the global health crisis in sight, we have to wonder if other Biglaw firms will make similar moves that will leave more lawyers out of work.

# From Jail To Yale -- And Hopefully The Bar

If the law is focused on justice, and justice includes the concepts of forgiveness and rehabilitation, then criminal convictions should not automatically preclude a person from being a lawyer. The inquiry into whether someone should be admitted to the bar despite a criminal history will be a case-by-case determination based on many factors, but here’s my personal leaning in these matters: when in doubt, give the person a second chance.

One of the most well-known cases, mentioned many times in these pages, is that of [Shon Hopwood](http://www.shonhopwood.com/). Hopwood committed several bank robberies and went to federal prison. While in prison, he became a successful [“jailhouse lawyer,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/02/jailhouse-lawyer-of-the-day-shon-hopwood/) filing two certiorari petitions that got granted by the Supreme Court. After serving his time, he wrote a well-received memoir about his experiences; got married, and became a father; graduated from the University of Washington School of Law; and, thanks to a vote of the Supreme Court of Washington, became a member of that state’s bar. He now serves as a [professor of law at Georgetown](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/hopwood-shon.cfm#), proof positive that people can achieve great things when given another shot.

Hopwood’s case came to mind when I read about Reginald Dwayne Betts, whose story shares many similarities with Hopwood’s. Betts served a long prison sentence for a carjacking. After his release, Betts also became an author, writing two books of critically acclaimed poetry and a memoir; got married, and had children; and went to law school — specifically, Yale Law School, from which he graduated last year.

What’s next for this convicted criminal turned upstanding citizen? That’s up to the Connecticut Bar, as Bari Weiss explains in the [New York Times](http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/080917.html#072432) (via How Appealing):

In February, Mr. Betts passed the Connecticut state bar exam and has been working as a public defender in New Haven, trying, as he put it in a [recent essay](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwynqw/what-i-think-about-when-im-going-back-to-prison), “to do something to halt the herding of young black people behind bars.” As his lawyer, William Dow III, has said, “He personifies what people talk about when they speak of second chances.” ….

Last week, Mr. Betts got a letter… [referring him](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/nothing-will-ever-be-enough) to Article VI of the Bar Examining Committee’s regulations, which states that “a record manifesting a significant deficiency in the honesty, trustworthiness, diligence or reliability of an applicant may constitute a basis for denial of admission.” A committee composed of judges and lawyers is now reviewing whether Mr. Betts is of “good moral character.” Because he is a former felon, there isn’t a presumption of fitness to practice law. He has to prove it with “clear and convincing evidence.”

Can he satisfy that standard? Bari Weiss makes an excellent case:

Here’s a piece of advice for the committee: Type “Dwayne Betts” into Google.

His incredible life is proof that a person can truly rehabilitate himself. But the Connecticut bar is sending the opposite message: that a felony is a life sentence.

[James Forman Jr.](https://law.yale.edu/james-forman-jr), who taught Mr. Betts at Yale, told me that he was “thrilled” to be able to serve as a reference for his application to the bar and that he is “outraged” that his former student wasn’t admitted in the first instance.

“We’re saying to somebody who, 20 years after committing a crime, who has compiled this incredible record, that they still carry with them a stigma and a label saying ‘We are always going to judge you differently.’”

In the words of another YLS faculty member, [Noah Messing](https://law.yale.edu/noah-messing), Reginald Betts is “a one-man wrecking ball for prejudice against people who often get written off.” And now Betts wants to devote his career to helping similarly situated individuals turn their lives around. The Connecticut Bar should give him that chance.

I’d also add, setting aside the specifics of Betts’s case, that the legal profession should be more welcoming of criminals who want to leave their pasts behind and go forward to do good. Perhaps we’re reacting defensively to all the [lawyer jokes](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/lawyer-jokes/) and stereotypes about unethical attorneys, but no good is served by barring qualified people who have fully rehabilitated themselves from practicing law (often in ways aimed at helping others avoid their fates).

Let’s be honest: the reputation of the legal profession won’t be jeopardized (or made any worse) by admitting the likes of Shon Hopwood and Reginald Dwayne Betts to practice. If anything, keeping them out just reinforces the stereotypes of lawyers as small-minded, judgmental, and inflexible. Admitting them, in contrast, puts our profession in its best light — as an enterprise deeply committed to justice.

As we get deeper into the thick of the economic upheaval that’s been caused by the coronavirus outbreak, Biglaw firms have been faced with a cruel sort of choose your own (mis)adventure game. From cuts to partner draws and distributions, associate and staff salary cuts, benefits cuts, employee furloughs, and employee layoffs, everything is on the table.

Which will your law firm choose?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
We recently heard about an Am Law 200 firm that seems to have taken a bit of a smorgasbord approach to its pandemic reductions. We’ve been told that equity partners at Hodgson Russ almost immediately reduced their draws by more than 30 percent as soon as they had to leave the office environment to do work. Sources say that the following cost-cutting measures at the firm will take effect next week:

- Compensation for all employed attorneys will be reduced by 15 percent;
- Compensation for all executives/director positions will be reduced by 15 percent;
- Compensation for all other employees will be reduced by 15 percent;
- Employees with little/no work who cannot work remotely will be furloughed; and
- All 401(k) matching for employees are indefinitely suspended.
Managing partner [Rick Kennedy](https://www.hodgsonruss.com/professionals-Rick-Kennedy.html) confirmed these measures, noting the following:

While partner compensation was immediately reduced by more than 30% at the outset of the pandemic, we have, until April 13, kept our entire work force in place at full compensation. We view today’s steps as measured, prudent, and necessary to remain resilient for our clients and colleagues. We hope the pandemic subsides and the world returns to some sense of normalcy very soon. In the meantime, all of our attorneys are fully operational and working remotely. Our clients remain of paramount importance, and clients should expect the same excellent service they are accustomed to despite the current challenges.

# Biglaw Firm Offers NFTs To Lawyers Completing Its Metaverse Course In Experiment To Shove As Many Buzzwords In A Title

At the recent ILTACON show, the opening keynote speaker advised the collected law firm tech talent that the most important thing their firms should be doing is investing in developing NFTs. At that point I signaled the rest of the legal tech press the drinking game rules for that mention: “NFTs! Everyone chug bleach.”

It’s not that NFTs are dumb, it’s that they’re incredibly dumb.

If you make a NFT of a real diamond, and the diamond itself gets destroyed in a fire tomorrow, you still have the same asset.

Because the token still exists and is in limited supply just as before. Nothing has changed.

What NFT is doing to the concept of asset, few understand.

This is fair. Very few people understand it. But not in the “very few people understand it like quantum physics” way. More in the “very few people understand it like Logan Paul being famous” way.

For the record, the most important thing law firms should be doing right now is not developing NFTs.

But lawyers will have to understand them, if only to weather the next few years of twits filing 10K lawsuits over fake diamond NFTs or [thinking that they own Dune](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a38815538/dune-crypto-nft-sale-mistake-explained/) because they happen to be gullible marks with big bank accounts.

[Herbert Smith Freehills](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/) offers a number of free workshops for aspiring attorneys on cutting-edge tech subjects, including NFTs.

[Per LegalCheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/09/hsf-embraces-the-metaverse-with-new-digital-law-course-for-students/):

HSF says one of the sessions will be streamed live from the metaverse (a virtual 3D world in which individuals can interact with one another) in a bid to bring these topical issues to life. If that wasn’t enough, course completion certificates will be transferred to participants as NFTs after they have been shown how to “mint” them (the process of converting a digital file into a digital asset stored on the blockchain).

The NFT certificate is a fun little souvenir. I assume it’s a bored monkey reading the Bluebook.

In all seriousness, just because a piece of emerging tech seems impractical (like the current iteration of the metaverse) or stupid (NFTs), that doesn’t mean those technologies won’t spawn a lot of legal work. And over a long enough timeline, some tech will have a broad cultural impact. The metaverse may be the chat room of the damned so far, but I suspect it’s like a penny farthing bicycle and we’ll look back on it and wonder what possessed anyone to build it that way.

There’s a lot of money to be made by digital lawyers who understand this stuff.

# Being A Human Being, Or: Millennials Expect More

How did we do it way back when?

“You want me to thank an associate?  Are you kidding me?  It’s their job to do the work.  We pay them; we don’t have to thank them.

“Clients don’t thank you.  Judges don’t thank you.  No one thanks you.  You do what you’re supposed to do, and you get on with it.  Are you kidding me?”

What do millennials expect today?

“I know that I work at a big institution.  But people can still relate to people.  If I stayed up all night working on a project, the partner could say ‘thank you.’  It’s not such a big deal, and it would encourage me to stay at the firm.”

The millennials are right.

(Twice in my life, clients said thank you.  Once with [a case of wine (in 1985)](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/05/inside-straight-on-robin-williams-and-saying-thank-you/); once with a fancy watch (in 1997).  Now, decades later, I remember both occasions.  Doesn’t that tell you something?)

It’s not so hard to have a heart.

First, you can do it personally.  Just remember to say “thank you.”  Be couth.  When the bounceback message says that the associate is out of the office for a wedding and a honeymoon, pause to be a human being.  It doesn’t take so long to type back, “I’ll talk to you when you’re back in the office.  Congratulations on your wedding, and enjoy your time away!”

You just have to remember this. You can do it.

Second, you can also create institutional heart.

At my joint, we have a person in each department who tracks birthdays and work anniversaries.  One day before the event, that person sends around an email:  “Tomorrow is Fred’s birthday.”  Or:  “Tomorrow is the tenth anniversary of Susan starting to work here.”  That gives everyone the chance to say (or write) something to mark the occasion.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That’s really not very personal.  It doesn’t take much time to set up the system.  And everyone knows that it’s a system:  After all, for every birthday other than your own, you’re receiving the reminder email.  But it still causes us to mark special occasions.

You can think about this in one of three ways.

First, this is just being polite.  I don’t care how big and bad your law firm (or law department) is; you can still recognize special days in your employees’ lives.

Second, this is responding to the desires of today’s workforce.  More now than in the past, people think that big institutions can maintain a personal touch.  Do this to retain millennials.

Finally, this increases your employees’ job satisfaction.  Happy employees will work harder, and stay at their jobs for longer, than unhappy employees.  Even if you’re just thinking about costs and benefits, the cost of sending around “Happy Birthday!” notes is negligible, and the benefit can be that a few employees will stick around for an extra year or two, reducing employee turnover.

Being polite is the right thing to do.  Your mother told you so.

Not only that:  It’s not very hard, and it gives you a good return on investment.

So do it.

Thank you.

[[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lawyers-claim-infants-children-are-dangerous-situation-border-detention-site-n1020016)] * Disgraced former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore, a ""polarizing [] Republican,"" has decided to launch yet another Senate bid after losing during his first go round. This time, even President Trump warned him against trying again. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/roy-moore-running-again.html)] * Puff, puff, pass this vote: New York may not have been able to legalize marijuana, but lawmakers are trying to do the next best thing by decriminalizing it. Fines for “violations” will be no higher than $200 and last convictions can be expunged upon request. [[New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2019/06/20/lawmakers-plan-passage-of-bill-decriminalizing-marijuana-in-new-york/)] * In case you missed it, Slack had its IPO yesterday, opening at $38.50 a share.

[[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/goodwin-procter-bags-2-5-million-in-legal-fees-for-slack-ipo)] * Shaakirrah Sanders, a black female professor at Idaho Law, has filed suit against the school the university, and a former dean, alleging race and gender discrimination and retaliation.

# Discussing Experiences At Law Firms That No Longer Exist
## Such discussions can be valuable when securing future opportunities.

Just like companies in other industries, it is common for law firms to go out of business or to change their names due to a merger or other circumstances. Legal professionals usually rely on their work experiences at name-brand law firms in order to seek jobs and other opportunities within the legal industry. As such, it can be difficult for attorneys to have work experience at law firms that no longer exist since lawyers may have trouble judging such experiences against work at law firms that are still operating. However, with some practice, discussing experiences at firms that no longer exist can feel more natural, and such experiences can still be valuable when securing future opportunities.

I used to think that only older attorneys needed to deal with discussing experiences working at firms that no longer exist. Indeed, the first time I remember someone reflecting on working at a long-gone law firm was when I interviewed for my first job after Biglaw, and the partner talked about working at an elite Wall Street firm decades earlier. I had never heard of the shop, but my research indicated that this firm was a premier shop in its day, and I was impressed that this partner had experiences there. Moreover, I remember another lawyer (now judge) discussing her experiences at a predecessor firm that merged into a large Biglaw shop which eventually went under. Both of these individuals had been practicing law for several decades, so it made sense that they had experiences at firms that no longer exist.

However, I have only been practicing law for around a decade, and I worked at a large firm that went bankrupt and no longer exists in any form. Additionally, I worked at another shop that merged with another firm and now goes by a different name. I also worked at another shop that changed its name due to partnership changes at the firm. Sometimes, it can be exhausting to recount my work experiences since many of the law firms at which I worked no longer exist in the same form as when they employed me. However, I usually employ a few methods to accurately discuss my work experience.

In conversations or in writing, I primarily use “now known as” or “n/k/a” whenever discussing the firms at which I worked. Usually, I will state the name of the firm as it existed when I worked there and then state the name of the shop as it exists today. Fortunately, the names of the firms at which I worked that changed their names still incorporate substantial elements of the names of the shops I worked at in the past, so it is not too difficult for people to make connections between the firms at which I worked and the shops that exists today. More information is usually key when discussing experiences at firms that no longer exist, and this provides a lot of information with a small amount of effort.

With the one firm that no longer exists in any form, I usually just relate that the firm declared bankruptcy and completely shut down. When people ask me what happened to the firm that it went out of business, I usually just refer them to one of the many articles on the subject (including some amazing pieces published on this website) so I can avoid making opinions about what caused the demise of that shop. I am also quick to relate that I left the firm almost a year before the lights were turned off, which helps explain why I do not know too much information about why the firm was shuttered or the last months of the firm’s existence.

I also usually provide objective information about these firms so that people can make their own judgments about the shops and my experiences there. Lawyers usually evaluate a number of objective factors in order to compare firms and the experience of the people who worked there. This includes the number of offices a firm maintains, how many attorneys work at a firm, the profits per partner, and other metrics. By providing these details, people are usually able to stack those prior firms against similar firms with consistent statistics and make accurate judgments.

Moreover, I also discuss the types of work that were handled by the shops so that individuals can make an assessment on how the firms operated. In addition, it is often helpful to discuss some major cases that were handled by prior firms, especially if these matters were high-profile and generally known throughout the legal industry. All of these details ensure that individuals within the legal profession can get a sense of these past shops even if they do not have firsthand familiarity with the firms.

All told, discussing experiences at a firm that no longer exists can be a confusing process, and both younger and older attorneys may face these challenges. However, by conveying objective metrics and other details about prior shops, attorneys can more seamlessly discuss their work experiences at long-gone firms.

# Am Law 200 Firm To Merge With IP Boutique As Part Of 'Aggressive' Growth Model
## The Am Law 200 firm is coming off a few successful financial years and wants to grow, so this merger is just the first step in its plans.

Although 2023 is quickly coming to a close, many law firms still have the urge to merge. What better way to begin the new year than with a post-merger integration? That’s what Am Law 200 firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney is hoping to achieve with its recently announced merger with IP boutique RatnerPrestia, which will be effective on January 1, 2024.

As noted by the [Legal Intelligencer](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2023/11/14/buchanan-announces-merger-with-ip-boutique-ratnerprestia/), Buchanan and RatnerPrestia started their merger talks in March, and now that a deal has been struck, 22 attorneys and two patent agents from the mid-Atlantic IP boutique will be joining the larger firm’s IP department. Jonathan Spadt, RatnerPrestia’s CEO and President, will serve as a co-chair of Buchanan’s IP group.

In joining Buchanan, RatnerPrestia’s lawyers will be spread across the firm’s offices in Philadelphia, Wilmington, Delaware, and Washington, D.C. Here are some additional details:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
According to Spadt, 15 of Ratner’s attorneys will be stationed in King of Prussia as part of Buchanan’s Philadelphia area presence, with both leaders considering moving the attorneys to Buchanan’s Philadelphia office once that suburban lease expires. Four of the remaining Ratner attorneys will be working out of Buchanan’s Wilmington office, and the remaining three will be at the firm’s Washington location.

Buchanan chairman Joseph Dougherty told the Intelligencer that the merger with RatnerPrestia is part of the firm’s “aggressive” plans for growth, saying, “We’ve had a strong number of financial years, and we think we’re in a really good position to grow.”

Congratulations to Buchanan Ingersoll and RatnerPrestia on what we’re sure will be a successful merger and integration.

The high heat indexes across the southeast this year may seem like fall is definitely not in the air yet, but as we move into mid-August, school is back in session, summer travel is ending, and Q3 is in full swing. You might have also realized there are only four remaining calendar months in the year, and thus, it’s time to start thinking about the fall job search. Before you start applying for roles, or tapping into your recruiter network, there are some things you’ll want to do to get all of your ducks in a row.

Think About Your Next Move And Chart Your Goals

I term this step as [taking inventory of your current growth](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/planning-a-fall-job-search-here-are-3-ways-to-get-ready/) and determining where you want to go next. One area where you might want to start is reflecting on is performance evaluations from the last year to three years. Here are also a few questions to ask yourself:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- Have you grown exponentially in the oversight and responsibilities portion of your work?
- Are you feeling stagnant in your current role? What’s making you feel stagnant?
- Is there opportunity for you to grow more, or have you reached the ceiling at the company?
- Is there another rung on your career ladder you want to hit before you exit the company or your career as a whole?
- What’s your five-year plan? 10-year plan? What’s your career exit strategy? Is a [board seat](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/targeting-a-board-seat-heres-how-to-improve-your-linkedin-profile/) in your future?
As a legal resume writer and coach, lawyers and in-house counsel come to me in search of their next executive career opportunity, but some might be unsure what that next move looks like. If so, I strongly suggest (and have emphasized repeatedly) obtaining executive coaching to help you get unstuck or unclear before you begin updating your resume and firing it off. It will also elevate your confidence level as you begin to interview and engage with legal recruiters because you’ll know exactly what type of role you’re looking to undertake and what type of company you’re looking to work at.

Make Sure Your Legal Resume And LinkedIn Are Optimized And Align

As I’ve written previously, your [legal resume](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/quick-ways-to-refresh-optimize-and-modernize-your-legal-resume/) and [LinkedIn profile need to be optimized](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/quick-ways-to-refresh-and-optimize-your-linkedin-profile/) for maximum visibility and traction. Additionally, each need to align with the other. Your legal resume and LinkedIn will be a snapshot of your legal career, and a reader will quickly skim the information to grab important data, recognize your specialty practice areas, and understand the scope of experience. Dates, job titles, and company names need to align and synchronize between the resume and LinkedIn profile.

While your legal resume will be more formal, your LinkedIn will want to also showcase the common themes within your brand. To ensure proper optimization and alignment between your resume and LinkedIn profile, you’ll want to do the following:

- Ensure your brand positioning is clear and targeted. Do a brand audit and focus your attention on [brand clarity](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-three-cs-of-building-a-personal-brand-in-the-digital-age). If you’re applying to roles that focus on niche areas of the law (e.g., cybersecurity, data privacy, labor and employment, etc.), a reader at first glance should know those are your areas of expertise. Include them in your [LinkedIn headline](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/about-to-job-search-dont-overlook-these-areas-of-your-linkedin-profile/) and at the top of your legal resume.
- Don’t send the reader on a fishing expedition. It shouldn’t take the reader finding out at the bottom of page two that you worked at an Am Law 100 firm. Front-load important details and key differentiators. Legal recruiters are looking for these when hiring for a specific role. If you’ve got public company experience, use the ticker symbol in the descriptor about the company and let the reader know in the top third of the resume and first few lines of your LinkedIn profile that you bring experience working for multiple public companies.
- Understand and communicate your unique value. If you’re looking for a new general counsel role, or you’re [seeking your first-ever general counsel role](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/are-you-general-counsel-ready-strategies-to-land-your-first-general-counsel-role/), study job postings and see the patterns of keywords within those roles. It’s then time to apply those keywords and show actions you’ve undertaken that make you a good fit. For extra advice on writing a general counsel resume, read my article, [How To Write A General Counsel Resume (And Market Yourself Strategically)](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/how-to-write-a-general-counsel-resume-and-market-yourself-strategically/), which provides step-by-step advice on how to approach the process of the general counsel resume.
- Focus on the key areas of LinkedIn that push you higher in search results. Your headline, about/summary section, job titles (experience section), education, and skills sections will matter. Pin your top three relevant and high-level skills (note: they should not include Microsoft Word!).
Target Your Job Search

Job search strategies have changed dramatically in the digital age. It’s no longer a situation where you can apply via a job board site and wait for a response, or apply to only a few positions and wait. If you’re an experienced general counsel, or senior-level corporate counsel, you’ll want to tap into recruiter searches, commonly referred to as accessing the hidden job market. For reference and deeper insights, read my article: [How General Counsels Can Activate The Hidden Job Market (And Connect With Executive Recruiters)](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/how-general-counsels-can-activate-the-hidden-job-market-and-connect-with-executive-recruiters/).

I recommend creating an Excel spreadsheet and organizing all aspects of who you’re reaching out to, what company they’re at, when you reached out, and detailed notes about your outreach and follow-ups. You’ll want to continuously update this spreadsheet as you move further into the job search process. It’s imperative to have outreach to multiple recruiters as each recruiter works with different client companies. Don’t be afraid to ask a trusted colleague, peer, or mentor which recruiters they’ve worked with in the past. It’s all about building the relationships and networking.

Speaking of networking, nourishing your LinkedIn network should be a routine part of your relationship building — connect with lawyers who are in your niche practice area, industry, at and above your career level, and in other locations. You never know who may hold the key to the door for your next role. Set a schedule for your job search — this will include time set aside for researching companies and specific roles, networking with recruiters and other lawyers, applying to roles as well as outreach and follow-ups, and practicing for interviews. For additional job search strategy tips, read my article, [How To Create A Job Search Strategy That Actually Works](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/how-to-create-a-job-search-strategy-that-actually-works/).

Create E-Notes And Networking Letters

As you begin targeting your job search, you’ll come to realize that templates and frameworks for creating cover letters, e-notes, and other variations of outreach will be imperative for moving forward with ease. While other professions are naysayers when it comes to cover letters, the legal profession still holds true to the statement that the [cover letter isn’t dead](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/the-cover-letter-isnt-dead-and-heres-why/).

Create a master cover letter template that you can use as the main framework and simply tweak as you go along. Have different variations of templates for quick e-notes that you can easily utilize when reaching out to a recruiter for the first time. These may include an e-note for a follow-up, an e-note for a post-resume application follow-up, and a follow-up e-note when you’re waiting for an answer back about the next round of interviews. The key is to be prepared, professional, and proactive.

# Top 20 Am Law Firm Cuts Pay For All Due To COVID Crisis
## The firm is also postponing the start date for incoming first-year associates to January 2021.

As we noted earlier today, not [even the Biglaw firms with the most impressive financial performance](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/holove-cuts/) are immune from the economic ravages of COVID-19. We’ve learned that Mayer Brown — a firm that came in 17th place in the latest Am Law 100 rankings, with $1,484,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — will be implementing extensive austerity measures firmwide.

We’ve been told that not only have partners been taking reduced monthly draws, but they’ve also suspended their distributions for the first half of the year. Today, Mayer Brown announced that effective May 18, salaries for all non-equity lawyers and staff (who make more than $200,000) will be reduced by 15 percent, and this will most likely last until the end of 2020. All other staff will have salaries reduced on a graduated scale, with no reduction for those making less than $30,000.  The firm has also created a voluntary leave program, where those who take advantage of it will receive 25 percent of salary and benefits for up to 12 weeks leave, plus 10 percent more if they complete a certain number of pro bono hours. Last, but not least, the firm will be postponing the start date for their incoming associates to January 2021.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s a statement we received from a Mayer Brown spokesperson on the firm’s plans:

Mayer Brown is in a very strong financial position, with excellent capitalization and record financial performance in recent years, including the first quarter of 2020. We have always managed the firm conservatively, and the extent of the pandemic’s impact on our clients, and therefore on our business, remains impossible to predict. Accordingly, we have adopted a series of cost-saving and cash-management measures that will enable us to prepare for the remainder of 2020. In designing and adopting these measures, job preservation and providing seamless service to our clients are our top priorities.

In March, our equity partners agreed to a 20 percent reduction in monthly draws and the suspension of their distributions for the first half of 2020. Today, the firm announced a 15 percent reduction in salaries for our other lawyers, as well as business services staff who earn more than $200,000. Salaries for business services staff who earn less will be reduced according to a graduated scale. Because these reductions are for just over seven months of the year at most, the 15 percent cuts calculate to an annualized reduction of just under ten percent.

In order to protect the health and safety of our people, as well as uncertainty in the cities in which we operate, we are postponing the arrival of our fall associate class in the US to January 2021. We will provide a $5,000 monthly payment to our new colleagues for three months, starting in October 2020, and we are paying now our usual summer stipend of $10,000. In addition, we will cover the cost of premiums for medical and related insurance programs during the postponement period.

Finally, in acknowledgement of these challenging times, we are also offering more flexibility to our lawyers and staff with a program that will enable individuals to request up to 12 weeks of voluntary leave / sabbatical. Program participants will be paid 25 percent of their salary during this leave period, rising to 35 percent for those who handle pro bono matters during their leave.

We are grateful for the collective contributions of our great lawyers and business services staff, which will ensure we navigate this period and emerge from this crisis an even stronger global law firm.

On the bright side, Mayer Brown has established a firm-funded Mayer Brown COVID-19 Relief Fund to help employees who have suffered “undue economic hardship” as the result of the pandemic. Plus, sources say the firm is strongly committed to rewarding high billables during these tough times through 2021 bonuses.

# Lawyering Has Changed A Lot In The Past Decade

Recently, I was speaking to an attorney, who started practicing law this year, about my legal experiences and my career so far as a lawyer. I graduated law school in 2012, so I do not feel like an old timer by any stretch of the imagination, but I started telling this person about how things have changed in the legal profession even in my short time as a practicing attorney. The whole experience really made me feel like I was from a different generation from this person, which I hope at 33 isn’t true! In any case, I first started working as a summer associate at a Biglaw firm in 2011, so I only have firsthand knowledge of how lawyering has evolved over the past decade. However, the legal profession has progressed far in the past 10 years, and this makes one circumspect about how the legal profession will change in the next decade.

Perhaps the biggest change I have seen in the legal profession recently as a litigator is the widespread institution of electronic filing. When I first worked as a summer associate in 2011, only the federal courts in my area had mandatory e-filing for almost all litigation papers. New Jersey did not have e-filing for most cases, and New York also only had e-filing for some matters. In my early days as a practicing lawyer, much time and effort was spent printing and preparing documents for filing. At one of the firms at which I worked, someone would even come to our office every day around 3 p.m. to pick up items that needed to be filed. In addition, attorneys needed to be careful about recording when papers were received and needed to properly file papers so that they could be used and reviewed later.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Now, pretty much every court in which I practice has adopted e-filing systems, and dealing with COVID-19 has made e-filing more widely used in the legal profession. Unless judges require courtesy copies (which happens less and less), papers do not need to be carefully printed and prepared for submission to a court. Moreover, all of the parties are notified the instant papers are filed so there is little chance they will miss seeing documents. It is also far easier to find filed documents and use them for motions and other purposes. I remember earlier in my career, a litigant asked each of the codefendants in a case for copies of their answers so he could include this in his motion for summary judgment. This request would be unnecessary in the current environment because most papers can be accessed instantaneously and are available to all through e-filing.

Another huge shift in the legal profession is the movement toward unlimited use of legal research platforms. When I first started as a summer associate, individuals were either billed for the time they used on a legal research platform or for the searches they made on such platforms. This made legal research cost-prohibitive in certain instances, and a few of my earlier firms even had libraries so that attorneys could do book research and save money on expensive online legal research. Also, you had to be super careful and efficient in your research to avoid running up the bill on legal research platforms.

At some point in the past decade, legal research platforms switched to unlimited use from per minute or per transaction pay systems. This is kind of like when AOL stopped charging by how long you were on the system but on a monthly basis — but now I’m really aging myself! Now, legal research projects are rarely cost-prohibitive because people usually just pay one flat rate per month to use the resources, and attorneys do not need to worry about running up the cost. In addition, lawyers have a lot more freedom to search around and find the right authority for their issue. This change has also democratized the practice of law because law firms of all kinds can afford to have access to quality legal research.

Another major difference in the way that many firms operate is how they charge expenses to their clients. When I first started practicing law, we charged out clients for legal research, which was pretty standard. However, we also charged our clients 10 cent a page for copying, for telephone charges, and pretty much everything else under the sun. This made practicing law inefficient because every time I wanted to use the phone or copier, I had to enter the appropriate client code. Since this was often a long number, I usually had to drop what I was doing, access the code, and type in the code, all so the client could be charged pennies in some instances.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Someone correct me if I am wrong, but there seems to be a movement away from charging for de minimis items in the current environment. Although some firms still charge by the page for copying, telephone expenses, and other costs, the later firms I worked at did not pass along small expenses to clients. This makes practicing law a lot more efficient, and clients probably appreciate that they are literally not being nickel and dimed by their attorneys.

Obviously, the practice of law has changed over a great period of time, but as I look back on my own experience, it’s wild to think how the practice of law has changed substantially in the past decade. Feel free to email me your own experiences about how lawyering has changed over the past 10 years, and it is crazy to think where the legal profession will be in the not-too-distant future.

# Numbers Are Up For Women In Biglaw, But Certain Minorities Continue To Fall Behind
## As usual, we're forced to celebrate fractional progress for diversity and inclusion within Biglaw firms.

By all accounts, it sure seemed like Biglaw firms were making an effort to focus on diversity and inclusion in 2018, but according to the latest law firm diversity report from the National Association of Law Placement (NALP), it looks like things didn’t exactly go as planned for a portion of the attorney population that law firms were trying so hard to accommodate and boost.

According to NALP Executive Director James Leipold, this year’s diversity report was a “good news/bad news story.” It’s easy to see what he means. First, the “good news”:

- The number of women associates working in Biglaw firms has finally returned to — and surpassed — its pre-recession levels. From the report: “[R]epresentation of women finally saw a net increase in 2018. In 2018, the percentage of women stood at 45.91%, compared with 45.48% in 2017, and higher than the 2009 figure, but by just 0.25 percentage points.”
- The percentage increase of minority Biglaw partners is the largest its ever been in the history of NALP recordkeeping. From the report: “In 2018 … minorities account[ed] for 9.13% of partners in the nation’s major firms, and women account[ed] for 23.36% of the partners in these firms, up from 8.42% and 22.70%, respectively, in 2017. An increase of about seven-tenths of a percentage point in representation of minorities among partners is noted as the largest over the entire span of NALP’s compilation of these figures.”
- The number and percentage of LGBT lawyers (and summer associates) is the highest it’s ever been. From the report: “The overall percentage of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) lawyers reported in 2018 increased to 2.86% compared with 2.64% in 2017. … The overall count in 2018 of 2,827 LGBT lawyers is up by just over 6% from 2017. … The overall figure for summer associates was 5.73%, compared with 4.66% in 2017.”

As usual, we’re forced to celebrate fractional progress for diversity and inclusion within Biglaw firms. Hooray? We get it: the Biglaw system wasn’t built in a day, and it’s going to take a while to fix all of its problems, but it’s about time that we try a little harder to to speed up the process. This brings us to the NALP report’s “bad news”:

- Minority women remain the most poorly represented group in Biglaw partnerships. From the report: “[A]t just 3.19% of partners in 2018, minority women continue to be the most dramatically underrepresented group at the partnership level, a pattern that holds across all firm sizes and most jurisdictions.”
- The number of black associates remains below pre-recession levels. From the report: “Despite small increases in the past three years, representation of Black/African-American associates remains just below its 2009 level of 4.66% and is now 4.48%.”
Biglaw firms continue to look monochromatic at the associate and partnership level, and there’s no real good reason for it. On the bright side, according to the report, minority representation among the ranks of summer associates is about 35 percent, up by nearly 3 percentage points since 2017. If law schools continue to enroll a diverse student body and these law students remain with their Biglaw firms, the number of black associates will someday rise and the number of minority women who attain join the partnerships at those firms will rise as well.

This may be the best we can hope for, but at least this presents some level of hope. Until that time comes, we’ll just continue to cheer for tiny year-over-year gains and pray that things get better. After all these years, it’s what we’ve been conditioned to do, and it’s really the only thing we can do. It’s depressing that it has to be this way.

# Biglaw Associate Bills 277 Hours To Review 20 Documents And I'm Fascinated To Know How This Happened
## Seriously, how?

Dentons tasked a former associate with a document review project. Over the course of around three months, the associate marked 425 documents while billing 277 hours. Except, in reality, he only ever opened 20 of the files. This got him fired and made him the subject of [an ethics complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/09/Billable.pdf).

I have some questions.

Reviewing 20 documents over 277 hours works out to almost 14 hours per document. Assuming the documents involved were not, in fact, manuscripts of Moby Dick, let’s operate from the premise that most of that time wasn’t spent reading. How did he pass the three months?

Document review isn’t necessarily fun, but you’d think a lawyer would open the review platform for an hour or two every day just out of curiosity.

How did he break up this work? Did he read 20 the first day and just call it quits? Because 14 hours per document works out to opening a document in the morning, staring at it all day, closing up bleary-eyed for the night, and then promising to finish up that one document in the morning. And billing for all of it.

But I’m even more fascinated by Dentons. It’s not like the firm had to conduct an elaborate cloak and dagger sting to figure out that their associate never opened 420 of the documents — it’s right there on the dashboard of every modern eDiscovery tool! Did they not look as the bills came in? Was there no sense of urgency in this matter? How did it take three months to notice?

And even if the firm dropped the ball on checking the status of these documents, if he’d actually reviewed all 425 documents over the course of 277 hours, that’s still roughly 40 minutes per document. How would that not be enough to trigger some sort of intervention?

The ABA Journal learned from Dentons that the firm discovered this before the client was billed. How? Is the firm not preparing monthly bills? Firms routinely [dock people’s pay and bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/yes-biglaw-firms-will-absolutely-take-your-money-if-you-dont-put-your-timesheets-in/) for being mere days late with time entry. But these weren’t sent out for months?

So many questions.

# Good Morning, Biglaw! Sorry The Snowstorm Sucked.
## The massive snowfall fizzled and it's time to go to work.

While it’s rare to compare Biglaw with elementary school, associates in New York — and, I assume, D.C. — awoke this morning and ran to their window full of the same childlike wonder that inspires children on a wintry morning. Even battle-hardened Biglaw hearts understand that a storm can get so bad that no reasonable person can expect an attorney to make it into the office. At some point it’s actually dangerous to get around in the snow, and no one — [except, perhaps, David Boies](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/your-craziest-travel-tales-the-finalists/) — can make it into the office.

And just like those kids, those New York and D.C. associates experienced the crushing disappointment of looking out upon a fizzled storm and realizing there’s not a single good reason to be in later than 10 a.m. this morning.

Last night, the final National Weather Service forecast predicted 12 to 24 inches of accumulation, falling faster than the plows could keep up. Instead, there’s 4 inches in Central Park and partners making mental notes of every darkened office.

Perhaps they’ll believe you live in Westchester? No, that won’t fly — you still possess too much will to live for anyone to believe you have kids.

But at least the wind is whipping sleet against your face as you trudge to the subway! All the unpleasantness of winter with none of the perks.

There’s a metaphor in there somewhere.

# When Your Firm Is This Profitable, You Really Have To Raise Associate Salaries
## Congratulations to the associates benefiting from the firm's profitability.

There are so many fun aspects of the great associate salary hike of 2018. The warring and coming over the top that led to the market coalescing around the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale was enjoyable to watch over the past 10 days, but now a slower developing — but no less interesting — story is playing out.

There’s been a lot of talk surrounding this year’s salary raise that we’ll see a clear line drawn between the haves and have-nots of the Biglaw world. Though the 2016 salary bump, spearheaded by Cravath, led to near universal adoption of a new market scale, there’s a lot more [financial pressure on the bottom half of the Am Law 200](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-am-law-200-is-out-what-does-it-tell-us-about-the-legal-landscape/) today. For this set of raises, [many are predicting](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-increases-could-lead-to-the-ruin-of-many-law-firms/) firms will be a lot more careful before they get on board, and it may even lead to a bifurcated market.

But as you might imagine, the eighth most profitable law firm in the country, Cahill Gordon & Reindel, counts itself squarely within the “haves.” The firm just announced they were matching the new market base compensation scale as well as the special bonus scale (and yes, [firms ranked 1-7 in profitability](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/the-2018-am-law-100-profitability-index/) according to the most recent Am Law 100 data have already raised salaries).

It may take some time to figure out the break of [firms that refuse to move](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/greenberg-traurig-explains-why-its-too-cheap-to-raise-associate-salaries/) to the new salary scale, but we’ll be watching.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

We have some unfortunate news today to report out of Florida, where a Biglaw partner was found dead in the water near his beachfront home this past weekend.

[Douglas A. Wright](https://www.hklaw.com/en/professionals/w/wright-douglas-a), 60, the operations and finance partner of Holland & Knight’s office in Tampa, Florida, was found floating in the water just off Clearwater Beach on Sunday. While the medical examiner’s office has not yet determined the cause of his death, the firm said it is believed he died of a suspected cardiac event while swimming. The Tampa Bay Times has some additional details:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Police said that a Clearwater Fire and Rescue crew was called to retrieve a body at about 6 p.m. Sunday at the 1000 block of Eldorado Avenue, near a waterfront home listed in county records as Wright’s. Clearwater police spokesperson Rob Shaw said police don’t believe the death was suspicious. The body had no injuries, Shaw said, and there also appeared to be no boat or other vessel nearby. It is unknown how long he was in the water.

Wright, a graduate of the University of Florida Levin College of Law, worked at Holland & Knight for his entire career. An obituary posted on his law firm profile takes note of his dedication:

Mr. Wright’s financial acumen, management skills, and tireless dedication to the firm were critically important to Holland & Knight’s success over the past two decades. Even more important, he was widely admired for his kindness and generosity. He had an engaging personality, an extraordinary intellect, and a big heart. He was a much loved friend, partner, and mentor to many throughout the firm and the Tampa Bay community.

In the early 2000s, Wright was the subject of a sexual harassment inquiry at the firm. At the time, he denied making inappropriate comments or suggested he was joking with or teasing the women in question. The complaints against Wright were found to be “generally credible” by an outside firm’s investigation, and he was reprimanded internally at the firm. “I know that it impacted him,” said Angela Ruth, who worked with Wright for 16 years as executive director of the Holland & Knight Charitable Foundation. “I believe that he just said, ‘I’m going to move forward. I’m going to do a lot of good, and I’m going to move forward.’ And that’s what he did.”

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Wright was heavily involved in community service and pro bono activities, having served on the Council of Advisors for the Bob Graham Center for Public Service at the University of Florida, and as a former board member of United Cerebral Palsy of Tampa Bay, the Salvation Army, Rebuilding Together Tampa Bay, and the Spring of Tampa Bay.

Wright, who “always [had] a big smile on his face when he talked about his kids,” leaves behind three children and one grandchild.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Douglas Wright’s family, friends, and colleagues during this extremely difficult time.

Almost 3,000 votes were cast, so it’s fair to say our 2018 holiday card contest was a great success. Our top contender completely blew away the rest of the competitors — separated from the second-place finisher by more than 300 votes.

Our newest winner joins the company of previous holiday card contest winners:

# The Legacies Of Law Professors
## Have you thought about your death? Or how will you be remembered? It's time.

Death has been on my mind lately.  I’ve had a few friends and family in the hospital. I’ve also seen several notices of prominent law professors across the country who have passed away.

Which makes me wonder: How will you be remembered, law professors?  How do you want to be remembered? Because it won’t be about your scholarly impact or SSRN downloads.

Sure, I and a co-author have [written](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3339527) about the law professor’s search for meaning, but this is not that question. That’s a question of why law professors seek to leave their mark. This blog is about how a law professor will be remembered versus how they wish to be remembered.

I speak from a great deal of experience with death. I’ve been to far more than my fair share of funerals. So much so that I cannot stand them. Each time, I’m angered. Beyond pissed. So many words. All too late.

With law professors, we spend a great deal of our time trying to prove we are clever. We do so by searching for scholarly impact, article placements, and recognition in our discipline. Hell, for those who are tenure track, that’s how we get tenure. Our whole life is designed to be “look at me!”

But you can’t do that when you’re dead.

We encounter others on the same path. And, in the course of this business, there are sometimes battles. More than any other group I’ve encountered, with law professors it gets personal. And that means that over the course of time as one disagrees with colleagues there may be a tendency to value them less. It makes more sense to demonize them. When we realize they are human, it can be too jolting — for that means we are human. Fallible. Mortal.

When a law professor talks about their legacy, they look to that which they leave behind. That could be articles, but I suspect (and I plan on researching this) that the shelf life of a law review article isn’t long. How many articles are still cited from the 1990s? What was the top SSRN download from 2010? In many disciplines, the wheel is being replicated because there is so much out there that no one has ever read. When law professors die, I would hope they are not pinning their legacy on their writing.

So when a law professor dies, articles are not the thing that typically gets remembered. It gets mentioned, but the things that really are remembered are how the professor helped others get jobs; how they mentored people; how their door was always open to students; lovable quirks in the classroom.

When I spoke at my mentor’s service, I spoke of his scholarship legacy. Like an idiot. My mentor was a brilliant man. Because of his discipline, he didn’t have a high scholarly impact score. But he changed laws. He made legislatures fear and hate him. Nonetheless, at his service, the thing that everyone remembered was that his door was always open. He would drop calls with very powerful people if a student walked in. He would say “you pay the overhead for this place,” but that wasn’t it; he realized that to right power imbalances you had to walk the walk. It was his kindness that won out. That was his legacy.

And even if a professor who dies isn’t well-loved, people are not caricatures fixed in time. Prior to his death, I encountered one professor who I could not stand and who in my youth I felt had no redeeming virtue. He had changed. He was happier. Partly due to changes in life circumstance, and partly I think to aging gracefully. It was refreshing to catch up, and I’m glad I did before he passed.

Another colleague of mine and I had been at each other’s throats. (Of course, it was his fault: I’m charming and delightful.) A month later, I was giving him a ride. We were having a good conversation and bonding. In that moment and in moments in between, I realized what made him unique also made him alone and misunderstood, I think. I felt honored he knew he could ask me for help even after we had been arguing viciously.

Academia tends to feed the egos of youth at the expense of the elderly. It is yet another one of the discriminatory hierarchies. A friend of mine is at a school where one colleague who had cranked out numerous great articles for decades didn’t receive nearly the respect of junior folk who had published about the same amount over a shorter span of years. But junior folk get older, and soon will be in that same boat. They will be slighted. Ignored. Forgotten.

So, my proposal is perhaps that we appreciate people while they are with us. Even if we disagree with them. It doesn’t mean we have to like everyone and forgive the unforgivable stalwart Nazi. And it doesn’t mean we have to be doormats for narcissists. But, for the most part, I think it will make academia more humane if we started with some compassion.

# Biglaw Firm Rebrands, And The New Logo Is... Let's Just Say 'Unconventional'

By and large, corporate America runs circles around law firms when it comes to graphic design. You could spot a Nike Swoosh or an Apple… well, Apple from across the room, but law firms largely eschew the logo game. DLA Piper has that [half-eaten circle thing](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/) and Dentons has [that lazy arrow](https://www.dentons.com), but most law firms satisfy themselves with the simplicity of a stylized rendering of their name. There’s a quiet strength in big, block, probably Helvetica-inspired letters announcing your Am Law 50 power.

Shearman and Sterling is definitely bucking that trend. This morning, the firm rolled out its new look with a [website overhaul](http://www.shearman.com) and a new lobby sign.

That is certainly different. And while the firm kept some comforting old standby lettering in the hallway for good measure, the new look dominates the nod to tradition.

On the one hand, Biglaw is always in need of a good shakeup, and firms should be applauded for trying something new. On the other hand, logos are, fundamentally, about tone. It’s why Dora the Explorer uses multiple, bright letters instead of lightning and pentagrams. What does this lettering invoke in the passive observer? Is it a law firm? For one tipster at Shearman it is… not:

We all now work at a steakhouse started by the heir to the Sharpie fortune.

That sound you hear is the [nail being hit on the head](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-knokWcxukzc/UOYhpFg1dMI/AAAAAAAAHOs/tpmhhJfdFM0/s1600/P1090653.JPG). For those unfamiliar with Sharpie branding:

That’s not identical, but it’s certainly not settling any lingering doubts that Shearman is advertising a law firm and not office supplies. Earlier this year, SNL ran one of those rare skits that touch the face of God in its brilliance. A man driven insane by lazy font selection.


Somewhere, right now, the team behind this Shearman logo is basking in their big money fee and drawing up another campaign. Throwing open their notebooks, grabbing a nice, new Sharpie, and waiting for inspiration to strike out of the blue.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Reverses Pay Cuts, But Not Everyone Is Happy
## Biglaw associates are starting to expect retroactive salary payments, but that's not in every firm's plans.

The trend of Biglaw firms ending their COVID-19 austerity measures continues. The latest firm to end their salary cuts is none other than Mayer Brown — a firm that came in 17th place in the latest Am Law 100 rankings, with $1,484,000 in gross revenue in 2019.

[Back in May,](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/top-20-am-law-firm-cuts-pay-for-all-due-to-covid-crisis/) the firm announced a series of graduated salary cuts. Effective May 18, salaries for all non-equity lawyers and staff (who make more than $200,000) were cut by 15 percent, and all other staff had salaries reduced on a graduated scale, with no reduction for those making less than $30,000. Even though at the time it was anticipated the cuts would last through the end of the year, last week they changed course. Starting September 21, salaries at Mayer Brown will be reverted to their pre-pandemic levels.

Moreover, the firm announced that in addition to their usual bonus structure (which remains unchanged by COVID), there will be discretionary bonuses for high-performing associates. Check out the firm’s full announcement at the end of the story.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Several Above the Law tipsters (which admittedly only represent a small segment of Mayer Brown attorneys) expressed disappointment that there were not retroactive salary payments and that the reversal of the cuts were not immediate.

The reactions from sources at the firm:

Associates I’ve talked to (and myself) are pretty pissed. One of the first to cut pay, one of the steepest cuts (15%), and one of the last to reverse it. And it doesn’t even take effect until Sept 21.

Firm is perpetually nickel and diming associates. Even in announcing this policy they’ve botched it by not making it effective immediately. Not to mention peers like Hogan are promptly paying up the difference retroactively.

# Is Billing All Those Hours Really Worth It?

If there’s any example of how excessive hours wreck lives, Exhibit 1 is Elon Musk’s interview in the New York Times, in which he lamented the state of his life due to the number of hours he’s spending at Tesla.

Work until you drop is the mantra of our job culture. This is not a good thing, at least I don’t think so, [and I am not alone in that thinking](https://blog.cake.hr/work-until-you-drop-how-the-long-hours-culture-is-killing-us/).

As Biglaw firms crank up the billable hour requirements to compensate for the salaries and bonuses now being paid to associates, how many more hours can any one human being (e.g. not a robot) bill? There has to be a limit, and how close are we to that limit? Where is the breaking point? Is there a magic number beyond which one cannot stretch? Is this a form of indentured servitude in the service of paying off those student loans?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Should there be an award (other than whatever monetary awards accrue) for billing the most hours in a year? Should there be something akin to an Oscar, an Emmy, a Tony, and/or a Grammy for most hours billed? (Remember that I live in Tinseltown, award central and ground zero for patting oneself on the back, a major physical activity here.) Should there be an Olympics for lawyer billings? Gold for X hours, silver for Y hours, bronze for Z hours. [Is billing all those hours something to be praised or pitied?](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/14/racking-up-those-billable-hours-this-michigan-lawyer-has-you-beat/) Do these hours deserve a medal? You tell me.

Of course, anyone who can’t match those hours feels pretty crummy right now, suffering billing hours envy. And, since we regularly beat ourselves up for what we did do, didn’t do, should have done, should never have done, it’s easy to think that we don’t measure up to that standard and that we should all strive to attain that goal. Not.

[In that New York Times interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/business/elon-musk-interview-tesla.html), Musk talked about working 120 hours per week. He said that he hadn’t taken more than a week off since 2001 (not a typo). “There were times when I didn’t leave the factory for three or four days — days when I didn’t go outside,” he said. “This has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.” No surprise there.

Let’s do the math here. A week has 168 hours, so subtracting the 120 hours from the 168 leaves only 48 hours a week for every other activity and function that humans have. (I’m not going into detail here between what has to be done and what one wants to do.) So, for those lawyers who routinely bill 3000 hours or more a year (approximately 60 hours a week), either by fiat or desire, there is not a lot of time left for everything else, family, friends, health, and whatever else needs to be done in a normal week. Of course, it all depends on how you define a normal work week. If you work 5 days a week, it’s 12 billable hours a day. If you work more than 5 days a week, does the billable hours requirement become any more palatable? At what cost?

Don’t forget about sleep and not the sleeping at your desk variety. Pulling all-nighters gets old, the older you get. Couple a lack of sleep with the stress that the profession generates on a daily basis and it’s no wonder that burnout and substance abuse problems plague us.

What’s the goal here? Is it to bill the most hours humanly and even inhumanly possible in the desire to get the most money? Does billing all those hours truly serve the needs of the client? Perhaps clients should weigh in on whether all those hours reflected in the billings are value added. All those hours billing clients are hours not spent elsewhere.

As Mark Herrmann [pointed out in one of his ATL posts](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/why-billable-hours-are-like-clickbait/), numbers are seductive, and the higher the numbers, the more seductive. But Mark notes that numbers don’t have anything to do with quality.

Not everyone can bill 3000 or more hours a year or wants to approach anything close to that. Being a workaholic is, I think, no longer a badge of honor in our profession, no longer something to brag about, especially for millennial lawyers. It’s not a matter of not having a work ethic, as some dinosaurs claim. It’s having a different work ethic, one that tries to strike a balance between work and the rest of one’s life. Dinosaurs see how the profession has changed from when we entered it, and yet it’s often hard to wrap dinosaur heads around those changes and the differences in attitudes toward practice.

Technology has made a lot of the drudge work of lawyering (and I’ll get no argument that there is indeed a lot of drudgery, mind-numbing work) so that lawyers are released from that to spend time in other ways. That’s why I think the billable hour, except in big high stakes cases, will eventually go the way of the….dinosaur.

I’m exhausted just reading about those lawyers who summit the Mt. Everest of billable hours. I’m not sure I’m even impressed with the Iron Man triathlon approach to hours.

From a t-shirt some years ago: “He who dies with the most toys still dies.” Unless you’re going to be buried in that awesome car, on your yacht that never leaves the marina because you’re too busy or in that McMansion that you only sleep in, you are still going to go out the same way you came in—with nothing.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I almost wonder whether performance reviews can be productive because people hear the words ‘you’re safe’ and turn off their ears because they are so relieved.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), a partner in the associate practice group of legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/12/anxiety-inducing-reviews-may-hinder-law-firms-training-efforts/) on Biglaw’s performance review process, and why they may actually be counterproductive for associates when it comes to training and professional development purposes.

It’s not you. It’s me.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

[We] identified a need for those [business services] functions to more efficiently meet the requirements of the firm. As a result we had a small number of redundancies in Australia. These were difficult decisions to make and those individuals were closely supported through the process.

They have now left the firm, received their full entitlements, and were offered outplacement services, support and counseling.

— A spokesperson for Norton Rose Fulbright, in comments given to [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/2023/08/21/norton-rose-fulbright-makes-back-office-redundancies-in-australia-292-162265/), on the firm’s recent round of redundancies among its business services staff in Australia. Lawyers were not affected by the layoffs at the firm. Clyde & Co, however, cut a number of lawyers [just last week](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2023/08/14/clyde-co-cuts-10-lawyers-in-australia-as-economy-slows/) following performance reviews.

(If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

There are many different and exciting ways to rank law firms. How prestigious are they? How much money are they making? How much take-home cash do partners earn? How big are they?

Yes, size matters, and because the legal profession is obsessed with every single measurable and quantifiable factor law firms have to offer, there’s obviously a ranking for that.

Today, the National Law Journal unleashed its annual [NLJ 500](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/06/23/the-nlj-500-our-2020-survey-of-the-nations-largest-law-firms/), a ranking of largest law firms in the United States covering the previous calendar year. If you’ve ever wondered about precise law firm headcounts, this is the ranking for you.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
- Baker McKenzie: 4,809
- DLA Piper: 3,894
- Norton Rose Fulbright: 3,266
- Latham & Watkins: 2,720
- Hogan Lovells: 2,642
- Kirkland & Ellis: 2,598
- Jones Day: 2,514
- White & Case: 2,204
- Greenberg Traurig: 2,070
- Morgan Lewis & Bockius: 2,063
Congratulations go out to Baker McKenzie for employing more lawyers than any other firm. Once again, this firm wins the award for putting the “big” in Biglaw.

Head to the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/06/23/the-nlj-500-main-chart-2/) if you’re curious about the firms ranked 11-500.

## The numbers are startling.

Something is going on at Sedgwick. The Biglaw firm has lost about a fifth of its partners in 2017. Before we get to the speculation part of the this post, let review exactly what’s been going on. Hold onto your hat — there’s [a lot](http://www.litigationdaily.com/id=1202799731930/Sedgwick-Departures-Continue-As-Chicago-Managing-Partner-Leaves-For-UK-Rival) to [get through](https://www.law360.com/articles/951003/sedgwick-rocked-by-multiple-departures-in-2017).

In the words of Dragnet here are the facts, nothing but the facts:

- January: In the New Jersey office of Sedgwick, 6 partners and 12 associates (one joined later in the year), including former firm Chair Michael Tanenbaum, left to form litigation boutique Tanenbaum Keale LLP.
- January: In the Dallas office, 9 partners and 14 associates left for Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP.
- January to June: The San Francisco office lost three partners, each for separate firms.
- April: The Los Angeles office lost two insurance partners to Cozen O’Connor.
- June: Richard E. Wallace Jr., the former managing partner of the D.C. office, and Peter C. Condron left for Crowell & Moring LLP.
- June: In the Los Angeles office, two partners and two associates in the product liabilities group left for Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo PC.
- August: 4 partners and 8 associates left the New York and Miami offices for Robinson & Cole.
- September: Partner Traci Ribeiro left the firm after settling a gender discrimination case, joining Foran Glennon Palandech Ponzi & Rudloff.
- September: The New York office lost three partners, including office head John Blancett, to U.K. firm Kennedys.
- October: Chicago office managing partner Eric Scheiner, along with two other partners, left for Kennedys.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Also this year: the D.C. and Austin offices closed (in 2016 the Fort Lauderdale office shut its doors, merging with Sedgwick’s Miami office).

Besides the sheer number of departures, another noteworthy takeaway is how many current and former members of the firm’s leadership are taking their ball and leaving. It’s startling.

Sedgwick can [spin all of these departures](https://www.law360.com/articles/951003/sedgwick-rocked-by-multiple-departures-in-2017) any way they want (“We are actively pursuing a number of parallel strategies, all of which are geared toward strengthening and solidifying our brand, while managing the shifting landscape of the legal marketplace. We continue to focus our efforts on serving our clients at the highest level”) but… something is going on there. Now the real question is: what could it be?

Given the merger mania sweeping through Biglaw, that is definitely an option. [Industry experts say](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202800685613/More-Mergersand-Merger-WhispersKeep-Firms-on-Their-Toes) though the parties aren’t always able to discuss the early stages of merger talks, keeping an eye out for departing partners is an indicator that big moves could be on the way:

Given that firms work so hard to keep early-stage talks quiet, [Janet Stanton of Adam Smith, Esq.] noted that partner defections can be one predictor of ongoing or imminent merger talks.
“That is a really obvious thing to look at, because the people who are left behind are less and less mobile,” said Stanton.

If a merger is on the horizon for Sedgwick, then mazel tov. But… there are other less positive options. Before [Dewey & LeBoeuf](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/05/dewey-know-what-led-to-the-collapse-and-what-lessons-can-be-learned/) imploded, well, a lot of partners left the firm first. Ditto with[ Kenyon & Kenyon](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/is-a-merger-in-the-cards-for-this-troubled-law-firm/?rf=1). So, yeah. We don’t know what’s really going on but we’d love to find out.

# For All The Layoff Talk, Most Law Firms Are Holding Steady And Banking On Swift Recovery
## New financial report shows cause for optimism.

Despite what the Federal Reserve keeps saying, the looming recession is [more hypothetical than real](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2023/2/3/23584939/jobs-report-economy-federal-reserve-inflation-recession-jay-powell). Tech companies are taking a hit as Facebook’s foray into janky VR chatrooms and Tesla’s… [every stupid thing that guy does](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/) have brought down the high-flying sector like a Chinese spy balloon. But outside of that, the economy is pretty solid actually. GDP is growing at around 3 percent per quarter, unemployment is down, inflation — again, despite the fever dreams of the Fed — remains under control, and [even eggs are cheaper](https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1625317685277106178?s=20&t=NOpxc6srsK2I0l5E1Net0g) again [thanks to the Swifties](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/10/high-egg-prices-taylor-swift-says-fans-will-reduce-cost.html).

So why are law firms laying people off? Well… they aren’t really. At least most of them.

The Thomson Reuters Institute just put out the [Q4 2022 Thomson Reuters Law Firm Financial Index](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/lffi-q4-2022-demand-lows/), reporting that firms took an unsurprising hit to demand in the fourth quarter. Law firms experience lagged economic impacts. As the economy suffered [two consecutive quarters of negative growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188185/percent-change-from-preceding-period-in-real-gdp-in-the-us/) in the first half of 2022, law firms continued to enjoy cautiously good times. The reckoning comes due now, but with the economy already springing back, most firms refuse to overreact:

“Law firms are at a bit of a crossroads as they face weaker demand and inflationary pressures,” said Paul Fischer, president, Legal Professionals, Thomson Reuters. “Our Financial Insights data notes that firms are moderating their expense growth and generally maintaining their headcount, so they could be well positioned for improved profitability if demand picks up later this year.”

Firms with a [heavy tech sector portfolio](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) or [preparing for a merger and resulting redundancies](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) will cut back, but most firms see this as a temporary setback. Transactional work took a hit as the year went on and non-transactional work hasn’t recovered from the pandemic yet, leaving firms with a sense of weightlessness last quarter. But that should work itself out by mid-year.

That’s not to say things will return to the heady days of 2021. The era of clearing almost $350K in profit per lawyer during the post-pandemic deal boom is unlikely to return, but can the profession settle into a nice $300K or so? Sure.



Of course, the Fed could introduce real chaos if it keeps up with its obsessive chase of a wage-price spiral that doesn’t yet exist. If interest rate hikes make significant transactional work untenable, law firms could be mired in a demand slump for an extended period.

But for now, we’ll bask in the optimism.

# Biglaw Firm Overworked Attorney According To New Lawsuit
## Attorney alleges she suffered a meltdown as a result.

Ropes & Gray is facing allegations that the firm’s working conditions are “horrific” and “chaotic, stressful and pressurized.” The allegations come from barrister [Joanna Torode](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/biographies/t/joanna-torode) who has sued the firm over an “unrelenting” workload in the High Court in London.

As [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/ropes-gray-is-accused-of-unrelenting-workload-that-caused-uk-barristers-meltdown-at-work) ABA Journal, court documents allege there was an exodus of members of her financial crimes team from the firm,  and so, Torode’s work as the only English-qualified lawyer left increased:

“Not only would she frequently be the last lawyer on her floor to leave in the evening, as well as frequently working over weekends, but the intensity and pressure of her work was significantly intensified given the absence of any effective support at junior and senior level and the absence of any effective teamworking,” her barrister wrote.

This caused Torode to experience a meltdown:

Torode was showing “incipient signs” of major depression by late November, according to the allegations summarized by the U.K. media. When Torode was told at Christmas 2017 that two colleagues had received promotions, but she had not, she became visibly upset and started “sobbing,” the writ alleges.

Torode was hospitalized in April 2018 after she was told that she would face a disciplinary hearing for a media interview that could have been interpreted as criticizing her client. She participated in the interview when she was struggling to cope with the “overwhelming demands” of her work, according to the allegations.

Torode [reportedly](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/barrister-sues-firm-intolerable-workload-career-ropes-and-gray-london-b977316.html) now suffers from a major depressive disorder and is “unlikely to be able to return to work as a lawyer.”

For its part, Ropes & Gray says well, long hours is why they pay their attorneys so much money, saying plaintiff’s workload was “neither out of the norm nor excessive.”

Daniel Roark, Managing Director, Kinney Recruiting

As Managing Director of the Texas offices of [Kinney Recruiting](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/), Daniel Roark has placed scores of attorneys in major markets across the globe. He’s also done it from various places, including at home in Austin, Texas, and Guanajuato, Mexico, walking along Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City, and recently on a bicycle in Burgundy, France. “I’ve been in this industry for 15 years and I’ve taken calls in just about every setting and at all hours possible. I once prepped a candidate for an interview while shivering in a tent in Iceland. Once I had to hike up to the peak of a remote village in Mexico to get cell reception. This freedom of location is one of the great parts of our job. If I’m not traveling for work, it usually accompanies me on the road or at one of my races.”

Daniel grew up in Houston, Texas, in a family of lawyers, doctors, and teachers. His grandfather, Alfred Roark, was incredibly influential in his life and first introduced him to law when he was a teenager. “Some friends and I started a business DJ’ing school dances. My grandfather drafted a one-page contract that I could use to formalize our engagements. This simple document felt really important to me because it leveled the communication between young teenagers and the adults who would hire us.” Daniel’s grandfather helmed legal operations for a successful Houston energy company, but he didn’t get there through law school. “In my grandfather’s day, one could sit for the Texas Bar and become a licensed attorney without going to law school. That has since changed but my grandfather was a very diligent, studious individual. He was serving a term as a representative in the Texas Legislature, and he used the time to also study for the Bar and become a practicing lawyer. It was ingrained in me from an early age that a legal education is something worth pursuing.” Daniel set his sights on the University of Texas, where he received his BA in English Literature with a minor in Business. Following his undergraduate studies, he spent two years with Teach For America in the Rio Grande Valley teaching fifth grade just a few miles from the US-Mexico border. From there, he continued his educational endeavors abroad, teaching English in the accounting department of the University of Guanajuato in Guanajuato, Mexico. With his love for communications, reading and analysis, law school was a natural fit, and he returned to the University of Texas School of Law where he obtained his JD and spent a semester abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He went on to join the Houston office of the international law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld as an associate in the Global Projects Group.

A few years later, Daniel decided to return to Austin (before it was cool) and he contacted a recruiter to help him do it. He lateraled to Clark, Thomas and Winters, formerly the largest law firm in Austin. “I had very positive experiences at two fantastic law firms, but I understood being a successful corporate lawyer requires a time and intellectual investment that is all-encompassing. I had other interests outside of my legal practice that I was interested in pursuing, including finding a career that allowed me to apply some of the skills I had acquired but in a more flexible way. Before I was a practicing attorney, I was entirely unaware the legal recruiting industry existed. After working with a professional recruiter, I wanted to learn more about it.” Daniel called his contacts to inquire about legal recruiting and kept hearing Robert Kinney’s name. “I chased Robert down, joined the company two months later, and now after 15 years I still feel like we have so much more to do. At Kinney Recruiting, I’ve had the chance to work with the highest caliber of legal professionals and travel the world. Our work has taken us to markets including London, Brazil, Moscow, Hong Kong, Mexico, Singapore, Germany – the list goes on. We’ve really invested time and resources into many legal and financial centers in the world and worked to develop relationships in those markets. Robert’s always had a global vision for the company, but our company success is also contingent upon us owning our backyard, which is Texas and the US.”

The biggest change Daniel has seen since joining the industry has been what technology has allowed legal recruiters to do, both nationally and internationally. “We were forebears to remote work, digital nomad realities, and now our clients and candidates are operating in more of the same manner. Our proprietary database, network, and research and analytical arms stem from a forward-thinking technological approach that makes us unlike any other recruiting firm. But ultimately, effective communication is our trade. We interact with people at the forefront of legal practice, and we learn a tremendous amount substantively. And it’s remarkable to have access to professionals who are industry leaders. But these exchanges are only valuable if we, in turn, offer market knowledge and expertise, which we have invested a considerable amount of time, resources, and old fashioned legwork to accrue and develop.”

It wouldn’t be Daniel if his favorite placement to date didn’t include some excitement, a little travel, and a lesson behind it. “My favorite placements have very little to do with fee size or prestige. Perhaps my favorite was representing a major US corporation eager to hire a regional counsel in Mexico City to oversee the company’s Latin America operations. The client and I had arranged a day for executives to fly down to Mexico City to interview several qualified candidates. But on the morning of the interviews, I felt like I’d missed something (or someone). So I kept working to make sure I had uncovered every stone. I ended up reaching a candidate who didn’t exactly fit our job profile, but who had tremendous promise. By this time it was already afternoon in Mexico City and my clients were leaving for the airport later that evening. I called the client in their meetings and they agreed to see the new candidate if he could arrive immediately. I notified the candidate and the race was on. His fiancée fetched him from his office with a sport coat in tow, sprayed him with a dash of cologne, and drove him across Mexico City in rush hour traffic to get him to the interview. The candidate made it in time and was soon offered the job which significantly changed his life and that of his fiancée. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: our job isn’t finished until it’s fully finished. And you have to see it through to the very end.”

When he isn’t stamping his passport and racing across the world, Daniel is in Austin helping oversee legal operations for Guitars for Africa, an organization dear to his heart that he co-founded in 2013. Partnering with several accomplished music industry professionals and a former US Ambassador, they created a charity that provides musical instruments and instruction to underprivileged children in Eswatini (formerly, Swaziland), Africa. “Our mission is to simply get instruments into the hands of those who don’t have access to them. We’ve since expanded our efforts to other areas including Nairobi, Kenya and Mauritania.”

While teaching elementary school with Teach for America, Daniel experienced what it was like to become truly invested in other’s lives. “With teaching, you start to see the potential in others, namely your students, and it becomes as clear as day how much they are capable of. You also realize how much others have invested in you and become grateful for all those opportunities, big and small, that you have been gifted along the way. Obviously in legal recruiting, our candidates are extremely motivated and most have accomplished more in their legal careers than I ever did. And some candidates already know what they want and we can be efficient in helping them achieve their defined goals. But others have less clarity and it’s gratifying to see the potential in a candidate and guide them towards something better for them. One would think younger attorneys at the beginning of their careers might require the most guidance, but often our greatest advocacy efforts are working with highly successful law firm partners who need a push or an expert perspective outside of their own.”

As he divides his time between representing candidates in their career moves and prepping himself for his next big race, it’s clear that Daniel isn’t slowing down any time soon. “Our industry is so dynamic that I am constantly challenged and learning. And the further I am removed from practice, the more respect I have for attorneys because the commitment required by the legal profession is more demanding than ever. I feel tremendous responsibility in representing the interests of these professionals. But I also know that my colleagues and I have worked extremely hard over many years to become the very best at what we do.”

After overcoming his initial difficulties in the Atacama Desert, Daniel has gone on to run ultramarathon races in Nepal, Patagonia, Iceland, the Republic of Georgia, and across Europe and the US. Some to better results than others, but that’s not really his motivation. “I just want to see as much of the world as I can, preferably on my two feet. And I now know there are going to be some good days and bad whether on the trail, in business or in life. Sometimes you face troubles and all you can do in that moment is sit behind a rock and regroup. But at some point you have to get back up and keep moving. And after a few steps (or a push from another), everything gets easier and eventually you’ll reach a place you could have never anticipated.”

# 5 Steps Every Law Firm Leader Should Take Now To Prepare For 2019
## Law firm leaders: it’s time for New Year’s resolutions. Here’s where to start.

The champagne bottles have all been popped and the party hats are back in the box at the top of the closet. Earth has started one more revolution around the sun. But if you’ve been following this column, you know that Times Square isn’t the only place that’s dropping the ball. Law firm leaders everywhere are due for a long look at themselves in the mirror, and some New Year’s Resolutions aimed toward a stronger, more profitable 2019. My humble recommendations are as follows.

Prepare For A Potential Downturn

It’s not if, it’s when. The U.S. has been on a 115-month-long trend of economic expansion, the second-longest it’s ever experienced. If it continues into June, we’ll have set a new record. But the fundamentals of economics remain in play. Every economic expansion in history has been followed by a downturn, and we have no reason to suspect the laws of financial nature have changed overnight. Any student of economics could tell you a recession is likely on the horizon, and that’s without even considering the looming macro issues of cold trade wars, Brexit, and all the other instabilities primed to drag on the world economy.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Whether it arrives in the next two years or the next two weeks, the market is in for a makeover, and that means the kinds of legal services we need to stand ready to provide will be changing substantially. Boom-period practices like real estate and finance will likely get quieter, while counter-cyclical practices like bankruptcy and litigation will probably heat up. Smart practice managers will adjust their staffing accordingly, to hopefully attract future superstars before their practices explode, or to help attorneys with vulnerable books prepare and adapt for the slowdown. And if it hasn’t been done recently, now is the time to evaluate and cut ongoing expenses, avoid new debt, and sock cash away for a rainy day.

Build Up Your Non-Legal Network And Knowledge

We lawyers have a bad habit of spending way too much time in our own company. It’s fun and easy to talk shop, and it makes sense that fellow attorneys would be the prime hubs on our business and social networks. But if you want to take your book, your practice, and your firm to the next level in the coming year, a focus on non-legal networking is a great start.

Many, if not most, law firm leaders have little to no business training. We see plenty of business deals go through, and the litigators amongst us may see them go wrong, but we rarely have any experience in the trenches of running a non-legal business. We do our clients a disservice if we can only see their business through our Biglaw lens. Getting outside the legal bubble means exposing ourselves to new ideas, new ways of getting things done.

Take a free business course online through a resource like EdX.org. Join a non-attorney networking group like Vistage or Toastmasters. Find mentors who don’t have “J.D.” at the end of their nameplate. If nothing else, it’s a more efficient way to generate clients than grabbing drinks with your law school buddies for the millionth time. Who’s more likely to send work your way, the CFO of a major regional business, or one of the 50 attorneys you know who directly compete in your area of practice? Let’s bust out of our social comfort zones and make some new connections.

Stop Wasting People’s Time

We all likely attend plenty of meetings that didn’t need to happen, or that took hours to successfully address 15 minutes of content. We only have so many hours in the day, and Biglaw bureaucracy bloat tends to suck those hours up. Firm gatherings are vital to maintaining culture and connectedness, but it’s equally important for those gatherings to have purpose and focus.

If the purpose of a meeting is to go over important firm business, have an agenda, stick to it, and table any issues not on that agenda. If the meeting is intended to be a chance for the team to hang out and bond, keep work out of the conversation and let everyone focus on the team-building they’re supposed to be working on. If the standing monthly meeting doesn’t need to happen, scratch it for this month and let everyone stay focused on productivity. We bill our clients hundreds of dollars for an hour of our time; why not treat it with that same value ourselves?

Listen More, Listen Better

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Communication between management and staff is a constant source of tension across every sector of the business world, but we have less excuse for it now than ever. We have so many ways to communicate amongst ourselves, and we need to be taking advantage of it.

Fifty years ago, if firm management wanted to gauge job satisfaction, it would have to visit every attorney in the firm, one at a time, and engage them in a conversation. Today, firm management can send out an email blast in a few seconds, either with in-house listservs or dedicated web tools, that enable firm members to provide fast, candid feedback in seconds. Try taking the pulse of the firm by sending out a one-line question to all hands: what could we be doing better? Ideas for improvement may come across your radar that never would have gotten there otherwise.

Watch Your Head

Finally, the job isn’t getting any easier. Market competition is going up and clients want more for less every month. The weight of the world will crush you if you let it. So don’t let it.

Engage in self-care. Take a break every once in a while. Hit the gym. Sneak off for an afternoon and go see a movie with friends or family. Delegate or farm out everything that isn’t your core business. Talk openly and honestly about the stresses of your work with someone you trust. Take care of the people around you, because we’re all in this together.

It’s gonna be a good year if we make it that way. Let’s have some fun.

Jones Day definitely[ bet on the right horse](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/). There may have been some [controversy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/will-jones-day-drop-donald-trump-as-a-client/) surrounding the blue-chip firm’s [work for the Donald Trump campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/jones-day-doubles-down-on-donald-trump/), but now that the election results are in, they seem to have made the smart decision. There are the [huge legal bills](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/03/the-trump-campaign-s-legal-bills-are-yuge.html) they’ve sent to the Donald, there’s partner Gregory Katsas and associate James Burnham serving on the [Department of Justice transition team](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/the-biglaw-attorneys-on-trumps-doj-transition-team/), and now, over the long weekend, it was announced that partner [Don McGahn ](http://www.jonesday.com/dmcgahn/)has been [tapped](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202773221242/Jones-Day-Partner-Tapped-as-Trumps-White-House-Counsel) as White House counsel for the incoming administration.

McGahn’s appointment isn’t much of a surprise. His area of expertise is government regulation and politics law, he served on the Federal Election Commission from 2008 to 2013, and he was chief counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee before that. He’s led Jones Day’s work for the campaign and his uncle, Patrick McGahn, [was also one of Donald Trump’s attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-closer-look-at-don-mcgahn-and-jones-days-work-for-donald-trump/?rf=1) — one with a reputation for “getting things done” in Trump’s previous Atlantic City stomping grounds.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Trump has boasted of this pick, citing McGahn’s “brilliant legal mind, excellent character, and deep understanding of constitutional law” in announcing the appointment. According to the [National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202773221242/Jones-Day-Partner-Tapped-as-Trumps-White-House-Counsel), the pick has also been praised by mainstream conservative legal minds:

Friday’s announcement from the Trump camp included statements of approval from former White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, now at Boyden Gray & Associates, and former U.S. attorney general Edwin Meese III.

“The counsel to the president needs solid Washington experience, but also a serious prior relationship with the president that allows for candor, and a practical understanding of how government agencies function,” Gray said. “Donald McGahn possesses all these attributes and can serve President-elect Trump well.”

But not everyone is super-excited about the pick. [Charles Tiefer](http://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/) at Forbes expressed concern that given the mounting conflict of interest issues, McGahn [could end up being](http://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2016/11/25/new-trump-white-house-counsel-donald-mcgahn-is-a-partisan-politico-consiglieri/#41aebb8a3774) “more like a consiglieri to the Godfather than a source of sound ethical counsel.”

Still, credit where credit is due. In steering Donald Trump to his surprise victory, McGahn accomplished what many thought could not be done.

“Nobody with any authority over anything wanted Donald Trump to be president,” said one ATL source, a lawyer who knows McGahn. “Yet Don McGahn was nonetheless able to get Trump through the primary, nominated at the convention, and elected president of the United States without a single criminal investigation or even a fine. That is an extraordinary feat that is alone sufficient basis to get him into the Hall of Fame for lawyers with difficult clients. He is the only choice for White House Counsel in the Trump White House that makes any sense.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Leverage Your Online Presence
## It is all about the quality of your impact and the trust you build.

The benefits of establishing trust and building influence should be of paramount importance for any in-house lawyer. It is not just important for your overall success and resilience within your own organization, it is also important for your reputation outside of your organization.

Leveraging your online presence is one way you can build trust and create influence in and out of your organization. Leveraging your online presence begins with building a strong and authentic personal brand, engaging with your audience, and strategically using various platforms to reach and impact that target audience. For many in-house lawyers, LinkedIn has become the platform of choice. So what exactly are the benefits, and how can you get started? I do not profess to be an expert, but I can share what benefits I see as well as what I did to get started.

Personal Branding: Building influence outside your organization contributes to your personal brand. It helps establish you as an expert or thought leader in your field which can enhance your reputation and credibility. A strong personal brand can also boost your visibility and attractiveness to potential employers or collaborators.

Personal Risk Mitigation: In the event of downsizing, restructuring, or other challenges within your organization, you will be more prepared to explore alternative job opportunities because you will have an external network that you may consult for guidance or that may provide a safety net.

Career Advancement: Building influence beyond your organization can open up new career opportunities. When you are known and respected in your industry or field, you may be considered for leadership roles, speaking engagements, or advisory positions that can enhance your career prospects.

Knowledge and Learning: Networking and engaging with individuals outside your organization can expose you to fresh ideas, different perspectives, and industry trends that you might not encounter within your organization. The knowledge you gain can help you stay current in your field and adapt to changes more effectively.

Problem-Solving: When you face challenges or need to find solutions to complex problems within your organization, having a network of influential contacts can be invaluable. Your influential contacts can provide advice, share their experiences, and connect you with experts who can help you address your issues more effectively.

Innovation: Interacting with a diverse group of people from various industries and backgrounds can spark creativity and innovation. You may come across novel ideas, technologies, or approaches that you can apply within your organization to drive positive change and growth.

Professional Development: Influence often comes from continuous learning and skill development. Engaging with industry associations, attending conferences, and participating in online forums or communities can help you acquire new skills and knowledge that benefit your career.

Diverse Perspectives: Collaborating with people from different backgrounds and industries can lead to more well-rounded decision-making. It can help you to avoid “groupthink” and encourages fresh, innovative approaches to problem-solving.

Giving Back: As you build influence, you can also use your position to give back to your community or industry. You may mentor others, participate in volunteer work, or advocate for positive changes that benefit your field as a whole.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
How Did I Get Started?

I started by defining my goals and establishing a niche:

- I identified my area of expertise or passion.
- I defined my target audience and decided what I wanted to do to achieve an online presence.
I worked on building a consistent personal brand:

- I developed a personal brand that I felt reflected my values and expertise.
- I used the same profile picture, username, and bio across all social media platforms for recognition.
I worked on preparing meaningful content:

- I wrote pieces that I hoped would address the needs and interests of my target audience.
- I focused on content formats that included blog posts, podcasts, and LinkedIn posts. You can also produce videos and infographics.
- Most importantly, I focused on being consistent by maintaining a regular posting schedule.
I engaged with my audience:

- When posting on LinkedIn, I took the time to respond to all comments, promptly and genuinely.
- I also took the opportunity when possible to collaborate with other content creators by sharing their pieces or sharing a byline with them.
Through my social media posts, I strive to provide value through problem solving and sharing knowledge:

- I shared possible solutions to common problems or challenges within my area.
- I worked to share my knowledge generously and have tried to position myself as an authority in my field.
I prioritized networking and collaboration especially with other influencers, experts, and thought leaders in my area.

Lastly, I worked to stay authentic:

- I found that authenticity was crucial for building trust and influence. The key for me was to be myself and share from my personal experiences.
- I also learned that part of being authentic was admitting mistakes when necessary and learning from them.
My final takeaway for any in-house lawyer is simply this. Building influence online takes time and consistent effort. It’s not about the number of followers you have.

It is all about the quality of your impact and the trust you build. Keep refining your approach and adjusting your strategy as you learn more about what resonates with your audience.

On October 17, I’ll be joining legal industry personal branding greats [Brittany Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittany-johnson-09a2443/) and [Heather Stevenson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherlstevenson/) on the [IHC Roundtable Series](https://inhouseconnect.org/product/ihc-roundtable-series-social-media-and-personal-branding-for-in-house-counsel/) for a discussion on personal branding for in-house lawyers, including lessons learned and actionable tips on how to start.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Good News (And Bad) From A Texas Powerhouse
## Hopefully these robust bonuses will help associates deal with their high health-care costs.

In the latest [Vault 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2018/), the honors for [top Texas firm](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/?sRankID=14&pg=2) went to [Vinson & Elkins](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/vinson-elkins/). This came as no surprise to observers of the Lone Star legal market, given V&E’s historically strong reputation and last year’s [generous bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-to-play-in-the-big-leagues-pay-like-the-big-leagues/?rf=1) (to both lawyers and staff).

How about the firm’s 2017 bonuses, announced last week? Once again, people are pleased:

V&E’s bonus structure stayed the same as last year – Cravath match at 2,000 hours (likely lower hours requirements for the NYC and DC offices), with supplemental bonuses of 1.10x – 1.35x for high billers (2,150+). All first years (class of 2016) again received the standard $15,000 bonus regardless of hitting hours.

Everyone seems very happy with this bonus structure. It gives associates the opportunity to earn just as much — and likely more — than associates at many of the other firms that have entered the Texas market in recent years. 2017 was another record year for V&E, so it’s nice of the firm to share the wealth.

In addition, V&E also gave a special bonus to all administrative and paralegal staff.

Said a second source:

[B]onuses were generally very well received. Standard bonuses for 2000+ billers were at market, and it appears that there were undisclosed bumps at 2150, 2300 and 2500+ of 10%, 25% and 35%, respectively. Class of 2016 all got at least the minimum bonus.

And a third:

I was pleased with my bonus. I received a substantial supplemental bonus on top of my class bonus for close to 2400 hours. They also did bonuses to all staff.

For the full memo, which includes a gracious shout-out to the V&E staff who worked so hard to keep the firm running smoothly during Hurricane Harvey, turn to the next page.

And now, a bit of bad news out of Vinson & Elkins. Back in November, after we covered some unpopular changes to [Simpson Thacher’s health insurance for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaw-firm-matches-cravath-but-are-they-cutting-associate-compensation-while-no-ones-looking/), we received similar complaints about V&E. For example:

When I read your article about Simpson Thacher’s health insurance increases, I couldn’t help but laugh. Obviously, I feel for those attorneys, but they have no idea how lucky they are. I’ve attached below a screenshot of V&E’s “health insurance” plan (a term I use very loosely, as there really isn’t much here by way of insurance). While the single attorney numbers are comparable to ST’s, note the discrepancy when you move to the couple and family scenarios.

Specifically, I am an attorney with a family, so I will be paying $1,115 a month in premiums for health insurance. You read that right. To compare, a similarly situated ST attorney would be paying less than half ($499.06). And of course, that doesn’t mean my deductible is any lower – in fact, my deductible is higher, at $4,000, with a max out of pocket of $7,350 (compared to ST’s $3,500 and $7,000). Also keep in mind that these are “high deductible” plans, so there is almost no coverage to speak of until you hit your deductible (in other words, no copays for doctor’s visits or prescriptions – you pay the full amount). For a firm that claims to be “family friendly,” they sure know how to stick it to associates with dependents.

So in sum, I pay $13,380 a year in premiums for the privilege of paying $4,000 for health care before any kind of “insurance” kicks in. Simpson Thacher associates can cry me a river.

Note that the below numbers represent (1) a “streamlining of V&E’s health plan, which eliminated the lower deductible option that was available in 2017,” and (2) increased premiums all around.

Here’s the chart of premiums for 2018:

Yikes. And this is admittedly speculative on my part, but I’m guessing that more Texas-based Vinson associates have families compared to NYC-based Simpson associates. So the painful premiums for family coverage probably affect a higher percentage of V&E associates compared to their counterparts at STB.

UPDATE (11:25 p.m.): A correction from an observant reader: “The V&E associate complained that he pays more than double the Simpson Thatcher health insurance. In the Simpson Thatcher article, the numbers quoted were for semimonthly contributions, so really, the numbers would be pretty close.”

Will Vinson & Elkins make any changes to its health insurance plans to lighten the burden on associates? To its credit, the firm has been responsive to associate concerns and complaints in the past. For example, the past few years of well-received bonuses were preceded by years when [responses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/associate-bonus-watch-new-york-bonuses-go-a-long-way-in-texas/) were more [mixed](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/associate-bonus-watch-very-elated-at-vinson-elkins/). And if you go back even further in time, after carping about the [complexity](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/associate-bonus-watch-vinson-elkins-gives-me-a-headache/) of its bonus scheme, which at the time involved a deferred-compensation component, V&E [simplified its system](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/12/associate-bonus-watch-vinson-elkins-ditches-deferred-compensation-in-part/).

So it’s quite possible that Vinson & Elkins will make adjustments to its medical plan; time will tell. In the meantime, congratulations once again to V&E associates on the robust bonuses, which go a long way toward ameliorating those high health-care costs.

(Flip to the next page to read the V&E bonus memo, sent out by chairman [Mark Kelly](http://www.velaw.com/lawyers/markkelly.aspx) and managing partner [Scott Wulfe](https://www.velaw.com/lawyers/ScottWulfe.aspx).)

Tears. The appropriate response to working in Biglaw. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)

After stepping down as Speaker of the House about a year ago, John Boehner is finally getting around to being gainfully employed again. And he’s taking his talents to Biglaw.

Squire Patton Boggs [announced today](http://www.squirepattonboggs.com/news/2016/09/former-us-house-speaker-john-boehner-to-join-squire-patton-boggs) that Boehner will be joining the firm’s public-policy practice as a strategic adviser, where he will work on global business development. It makes sense that the former politico landed at Squire Patton Boggs, with its noted lobbying practice that is a huge revenue generator — though the firm insists Boehner will not be a lobbyist in his new role. As per the[ Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/09/20/back-inside-the-beltway-john-boehner-lands-adviser-job/):

“With his reputation and combined experience in both business and government, there are few people better equipped than Speaker Boehner to help us take things to the next level and bring our services to clients around the world,” Steve Mahon, Squire Patton Boggs’s global managing partner, said in a statement. He won’t lobby in his new role, the firm said.

And Boehner won’t be [lonely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St9AoQZr3-k) in the halls of Biglaw. Squire Patton Boggs has a stable of political types on its payroll:

[Boehner] joined former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, and John Breaux, the former Louisiana senator, whose lobbying practice Patton Boggs acquired in 2010 as part of a strategy to bolster the firm’s sway in Washington. Also on Tuesday, the firm announced that longtime Boehner aides John Criscuolo and Amy Lozupone will join the team. Former Boehner deputy chief of staff Dave Schnittger and policy adviser Natasha Hammond already work at the firm.

Best of luck as the former Speaker embarks on the Biglaw phase of life.

# Woman Abandons Law Degree To Become Porn Star
## When ""attorney"" is a worse job than ""porn star,"" the industry should take pause.

When considering law school, students must weigh whatever pie-in-the-sky dreams of fat paychecks they may harbor against the grim realities of the process. There’s the student loan debt, the widening bi-modal salary distribution, and the ever-declining top-notch job prospects. Even with an elite degree in your pocket, long-term success is no guarantee anymore.

That’s why, sometimes, it’s just a better career move to blow people on camera.

And while most people are reading this far because of the words “porn star,” this woman’s story actually says something serious about the future of the legal profession.

Ella Hughes — who, according to Twitter, [won Female Performer of the Year](https://twitter.com/ukadultawards/status/911807349093994498) — spent a year pursuing her law degree in England while also taking her first steps into the world of pornographic acting:

I always thought I’d be a lawyer, but when I was in my first year of studying law at university, things changed. I was working so hard – in lectures from 9am to 7pm every day – that I couldn’t find a way to earn money. I didn’t really need the money – I had a student loan – but I hate depending on people and always wanted my own money.

That’s where you know this story is about Britain. Over there a transition from school to porn story reads, “I didn’t really need the money — I had a student loan.” In America, that line would read “I had a student loan, so I was already forced to jerk off guys in a back alley just to buy groceries — porn seemed like a natural next step.”

That Hughes is British deserves some consideration. In a country with a much more sane system of higher education costs than the U.S. — one that trains attorneys faster than the warrantless three-year law school program — a woman still walked out on joining the profession for a job offering better pay and more secure short-term employment prospects. As long as law is pitched as, “sacrifice years worth of earnings in your prime, go into debt, struggle with an uncertain job market, then maybe you can make ends meet by the time you’re 40,” it’s going to struggle to entice promising talent to take on the legal tasks that desperately need doing while leaving disillusioned law grads unable to pay their loans with legal work in its tragic wake.

Eventually, Hughes realized that her burgeoning fan base — her first video netted over 4 million hits — and the steady cash flow made porn a better career option. She says she earns earns “between £500 to £1,000 for a shoot.” Since shoots last around 20 minutes according to Hughes, that’s a billable hour between $2000-$4000. And it involves fewer moral compromises than working at Jones Day.

Not that there aren’t downsides. Hughes has had to deal with insults, threats, and a stalker. It’s a sad testament to the strictures of the paradox women face. Try to make some money on your own terms — face threats as a slut. Finish your degree and be a good little solicitor — face a lifetime of career-hobbling discrimination and disdain for being “the argumentative type.” In the end, she has no regrets:

Even so, I can’t imagine myself ever going back to my law degree. I think my life would have been really boring if I’d become a lawyer. Instead I’ve travelled the world and I’ve met so many unique people I never would have met outside the industry.

True, but she’s also missed out on taking a deposition at 8 a.m. in a stock room in Wichita and there’s really no way getting f**ked in a rented McMansion can ever top that high.

Here’s the gloating fresh from Bloomberg:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Affirmative-action foe Edward Blum said a group he started that files lawsuits challenging diversity programs has no new plans to sue any more law firms.

“There’s nothing left for us to do in that space,” he said in an interview.

Law firms are no longer raising red flags with their diversity, equity and inclusion programs, he said. However, a researcher for his group still combs websites of hundreds of firms looking for any evidence of programs he views as illegal, he said.

Just to be clear, the “nothing left to do in that space” coupled with the “I still have a couple lackeys on the books” is just Blum’s version of boxer trash talk. Don’t believe me? Please find the difference:


In short, the wounds from [SFFA v. Harvard ](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/the-slippery-slope-of-ending-affirmative-action-has-moved-on-to-its-next-target-women-and-proxies-for-diversity/)are still fresh. Despite the expected outcome of that case, Asian students [are still worried](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-11-26/post-affirmative-action-asian-american-students-stress-college-admissions) about how their applications will stand up.

And even though Blum is taking a hiatus from his shenanigans, goofies like Stephen Miller are [still finding the time to sue Pop-Tarts for being gay at NYU’s law review](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stephen-miller-nyu-law-review-suit/) or something.

# More Law Firms Should Participate In Sports Leagues
## Not only can such teams increase connections between coworkers, they can forge connections with colleagues within the legal community as well.

Most lawyers do not get too many opportunities to bond with their coworkers outside of the office. Sure, many law firms host annual holiday parties and other similar gatherings outside of the four walls of an office, but such events can be stressful, and it might be difficult for attorneys and staff to unwind at such functions and connect on a deeper level. Some law firms participate in softball leagues, and perhaps other sports leagues, so attorneys and staff have the chance to bond while participating in a nonlegal activity. Participating in such leagues is difficult in the COVID-19 era, and it seems like such participation has been on the decline in recent years. Nevertheless, more law firms should participate in such leagues for a variety of reasons.

The first time I ever heard about a law firm softball league was when my older brother (and law partner) played for a law firm softball league when he was a summer law clerk at a law firm. I remember him saying that this was a good way to connect with management at the firm, and I distinctly recall him wearing his dirt-stained softball shirt and baseball cap when he got home from work at night that summer. I kept this in the back of my mind when I was a summer associate, and I made sure that I would participate in my firm’s softball league if the firm at which I worked had a team.

I am not at all good at softball. Some vision issues make it almost impossible for me to reliably catch or hit a ball. As a result, I was a little hesitant to join the firm’s softball team. However, summer associates are usually rewarded if they go above and beyond to connect with people at the law firm, so I cast any fears aside and wholeheartedly participated in the firm’s softball team.

Going to the softball games was an enriching and unique experience. I got to know the members of the firm’s softball team better than people I just knew around the office since it is much easier to open up to people when you are outside of a workplace. In addition, it is much easier to make memories and forge a deeper connection with people while participating in softball than while working on any of the legal tasks we needed to complete in the office. Moreover, many law firms participate in softball leagues against other law firms and such participation is a great way to connect with colleagues who may work at another law firm.

After each softball game, the firm would pay for us to have an after-game dinner at a local sports bar. This was another chance for all of us to unwind and discuss what happened during the game. Also, this was a way for me to score free dinner, which was a plus since I was still a poor law student at the time!

When attorneys and staff participate in sports leagues like softball, it is easy for people to forget about their roles at an office and just focus on the task at hand. It doesn’t matter if someone is a partner, associate, or staff, everyone was there to have fun. Fortunately, most of the time, the softball games that my firm participated in were rather chill, and when I went up to bat, people cheered like hell for me even though I almost always invariably struck out.

Of course, it is important to keep considerations in mind when law firms field a softball team. For one, it is important to recognize that people of different genders and ability levels should be able to participate in games. This is usually fairly easy to accommodate, especially if people are participating in a noncompetitive softball league. Of course, some of the softball leagues I hear law firms participate in are super competitive, and it is unfortunate if people are excluded from participating because of their ability. In addition, it is important to ensure that even if the team performs poorly, everyone still has a positive experience (which is usually easier to do when there is an after-game dinner from my personal experience).

The only time I ever worked at a firm that had a softball team was when I was in Biglaw. Of course, a firm needs to have a large number of employees and resources to field a team, and this might be a reason why Biglaw shops are more likely to have softball teams. However, it seems from my anecdotal experience that even before COVID-19, softball and other similar leagues among law firms were on the decline.

Nevertheless, more law firms should consider fielding softball or other sports teams for all of the benefits shops can realize from this participation. Not only can such teams increase connections between coworkers, they can forge connections with colleagues within the legal community as well.

# Harvard Joins Columbia In Moving Recruiting To Next Year
## A big domino just fell.

Columbia already saw the writing on the wall and moved its on-campus interview process to January 2021. No one knows for sure when this whole thing will be over, half of the transcripts students will have to show employers will be a bunch of “Pass” grades, and by the end of the summer, a lot of firms are just going to be taking stock of where their layoffs and furloughs have left them, so why persist in the delusion that firms will be hiring in August? And from what we’ve been hearing, other schools have also gone the Columbia route with at least Duke and Georgetown postponing early interview time as well (UPDATE: Yale and Stanford have announced delays as well, but they haven’t yet settled on 2021 like Columbia and Harvard have).

Apparently, Harvard will become the first “HYS” school to put off early interviews. EIP, the Early Interview Program, will move to January 2021 according to a message sent to Above the Law:

Today, we write with an important update on EIP and the upcoming law firm recruiting season. After numerous discussions with students and employers, we have decided to move EIP Week to January 2021 and to suspend EIP Preview for this recruiting season. We will provide additional information about EIP in the coming weeks as we flesh out the details of our program.

While other schools moved first, Harvard’s decision likely opens the floodgates on recruiting changes. Biglaw firms aren’t going to fill their future classes without talking Harvard students, so there’s not going to be any appetite to gather everyone from Chicago in August only to tell them to expect a callback in February. By Friday, the rest of the T14 will almost certainly have pushed on-campus recruiting to match whatever Harvard’s doing.

I guess our on-campus interview shopping guide is going to have to be a lot more winter weather-centric…

# Elite Biglaw Firm Goes Out Of Its Way To Reassure First-Year Associates Their Jobs Are Safe
## Working for Milbank? You don't have to worry.

Soon-to-be first-year associates have some reasons to be nervous. With graduation in May, student loans start coming due by November so making sure they start their lucrative Biglaw jobs before then is incredibly important. And some firms — [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) and [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/gunderson-deferred-associates-start-work/), so far — have pushed back the expected start date of their incoming classes. So, it might be nerve-racking if you haven’t heard from your perspective employer.

The folks at Milbank understand that anxiety. So they’ve sent an email, available in full [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/milbank-start-date/2/), assuring their incoming class that Milbank will *not* be delaying its start date. As initially set, first years will start at the firm on September 18th.

It might seem like non-news, since the status quo remains in place, but it reflects an understanding of what folks are going through. Doom and gloom is being forecast across the industry with legal commentators speculating which other firms [will follow Cooley](https://www.law.com/2023/04/11/cooley-deferred-its-incoming-class-will-others-jump-on-the-bandwagon-or-hold-the-line/) with their own delays. Milbank knows that, and wants to make sure their people know they don’t have to worry. Classy move, all the way around

Jim Gilliland

The murder that has shocked the small Northern California city of El Cerrito and the Biglaw community continues to stump investigators. Calling the killing of [Kilpatrick Townsend partner](http://www.kilpatricktownsend.com/en/Who_We_Are/Professionals/G/GillilandJrJamesG14932.aspx) James Gilliland a “mystery,” police have not revealed any leads in the case.

Police have said they do not believe robbery or his work at the Biglaw firm are motives behind the murder, as [reported by](http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/No-evidence-slain-SF-attorney-was-robbed-in-El-10534761.php) SF Gate:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Detectives have uncovered no evidence thus far that James Gilliland Jr., 62, was robbed during the Thursday night shooting or that his slaying was connected to his work as an intellectual property attorney, said Lt. Robert De La Campa of the El Cerrito Police Department.

De La Campa said Gilliland’s wallet and cell phone were still on his body when he was found shot to death.

Police are asking anyone with information about this tragic killing to contact them at (510) 215-4400 or email [investigations@ci.el-cerrito.ca.us](mailto:investigations@ci.el-cerrito.ca.us).

# The Biglaw Firms Potentially Caught In The Cohen Raid

Michael Cohen (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

Discovery nerds — and political junkies — are having a field day with the materials seized by the FBI’s raid of Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen. S.D.N.Y.’s Judge Kimba Wood [has ruled over the proceedings](https://www.law.com/2018/04/16/fox-host-hannity-revealed-as-cohens-third-client-as-wood-expresses-confidence-in-feds-filter-team/) with aplomb — revealing Sean Hannity as a client of Michael Cohen and bringing the term “taint team” to living rooms across the nation. But there’s some Biglaw news buried in the details of porn stars, “taint” and payoffs.

Cohen’s legal team, led by McDermott Will & Emery partner Stephen Ryan, wanted, in order of preference, their team or a third party special master to review the seized material for privilege. It was ultimately an unsuccessful attempt to stop the Department of Justice’s filter team (I really can’t say “taint” anymore) from getting the first look at the materials seized in the raid, but the legal team did tell Judge Wood that Biglaw privileged materials may be in the FBI’s haul.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The first Biglaw firm caught up in the mess is Squire Patton Boggs. Last year the firm announced a [strategic alliance](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202782865269/Squire-Patton-Boggs-Strikes-Alliance-With-Trumps-Lawyer/) with Cohen, but as the heat’s been turned up, they’ve sought to [distance themselves](http://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/04/09/after-fbi-raid-squire-says-it-severed-ties-to-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen/). Despite that, Ryan said there was a possibility Squire Patton Boggs’s privileged materials got caught up in the raid, as[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/04/16/cohen-claims-morgan-lewis-squire-patton-boggs-records-in-seized-materials/) Law.com:

Ryan’s letter on Monday left open the possibility that Squire Patton Boggs client matters referred by Cohen could have been seized by law enforcement. He claimed that Cohen referred five clients to Squire Patton Boggs and “likely participated in communications with attorneys and clients” of the firm related to these client referrals.

“We are not listing them today and defer to [Squire Patton Boggs] and its clients to assert a privilege claim,” Ryan said.

The prosecution, however, said the chance Squire Patton Boggs’s materials were seized are small. And the firm seems to agree:

A Squire Patton Boggs spokesman said Monday that since Cohen was “never an employee or partner of our firm, and since neither our firm nor any of our clients are involved in the government’s investigation, there is nothing to add to what is already stated” by prosecutors in a [brief last week](http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437375-Cohen-Memo.html).

There were other firms’ materials the defense asserted could have been caught in the raid — including Morgan Lewis partner Sheri Dillon, who [rocketed to infamy](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/snls-savage-portrayal-of-a-biglaw-partner/) taking the bullet for the Trump administration’s interpretation of the emoluments clause:

Other law firms and lawyers who have advised Cohen and whose documents may be contained in the seized records, said Ryan, include Morgan Lewis tax attorney Sheri Dillon, whose work on behalf of Trump took center stage last year with regard to the president’s family business and his ethical duties and obligations; David Schwartz of New York’s Gerstman Schwartz Malito, Cohen’s attorney in a libel suit against news website BuzzFeed; Brent Blakely, who is representing Cohen in a California suit brought by Stephanie Clifford, the porn star better known as Stormy Daniels; and Michael Sirota and David Bass of Cole Schotz, for trusts and estates and corporate advisory issues. (Cole Schotz has previously advised on Trump business matters.)

In addition to having long range implication for the fate of the American democracy, [the Cohen investigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/clown-lawyer-michael-cohen-gonna-learn-today/) is also providing lawyers with lots to gossip about.

For some attorneys, one of the worst parts of their job is speaking in public. That isn’t too surprising — while the data supports death as being a primary fear, public speaking is still in the running. Despite that, some lawyers still find a way to thrive in the public eye. So much in fact, they may make take on a side hustle that involves even more public speaking. From Deadline:

[Camille Vasquez](https://deadline.com/tag/camille-vasquez/), who gained notoriety as one of [Johnny Depp](https://deadline.com/tag/johnny-depp/)’s lawyers in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard, has joined [NBC News](https://deadline.com/tag/nbc-news/) as a legal analyst.

Vasquez made her first appearance in the role on [Today](https://deadline.com/tag/today/) on Monday to offer analysis on Bryan Kohberger’s arrest on charges of stabbing four University of Idaho students.

Talk about taking a stab at TV!

Vasquez remains a partner at Brown Rudnick. Here is her NBC News debut:

# Biglaw's Summer Associate Recruitment Cycle Is The Worst Since The Great Recession
## With a mismatch between talent and legal needs, things are getting a little tricky for law students hoping to work in Biglaw.

‘Please let me get this job!’

With Biglaw firms pulling back in the race for new talent, student recruitment for summer associate programs has hit a bit of a slump. In fact, according to the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), this was the most underwhelming recruiting cycle since the Great Recession. Yikes.

According to the latest [recruiting figures from NALP](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/PressReleases/NALP_Perspectiveson2023Recruiting_PressRelease.pdf), offer rates for Biglaw summer programs decreased by 19% compared to the last summer’s hiring program. On top of that, just 46% of callback interviews resulted in offers for summer 2024 positions (down six percentage points from last year), which is the lowest offer rate since 2012. With fewer offers on the table, desperation was thick in the air, and it translated to an acceptance rate to those offers of 47% (up six percentage points from last year) — the highest acceptance rate NALP has ever recorded.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
None of this is good news for law students looking for a job in the face of a job market that’s likely to be “challenging.” As noted by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/law-firm-summer-associate-recruiting-hits-11-year-low-2023-2024-03-12/), Nikia L. Gray, NALP’s executive director, wrote in the report that “[f]irms may have growing concerns about absorbing additional new talent if client demand does not increase to keep pace and they continue to carry excess capacity through 2024.”

Enough of the doom and gloom, let’s talk about what happened with 2023’s summer associates. According to NALP, offer rates for Biglaw summer programs remained close to historic highs, with 96% of second-year law students receiving offers for full-time employment as associates after graduation (though it should be noted that his is the lowest offer rate since 2017). Acceptances of those offers matched last year’s all-time high of 89%. That’s all great news, but we can’t help but to wonder if these incoming associates aren’t a little bit worried about their futures given the measures firms took to rightsize recruitment due to excess capacity.

Nevertheless, congratulations to all law students who went through the entry-level recruitment cycle in 2023. We hope that everything works out.

Expert witnesses play a key role in  litigation practice, and they’ve been garnering press everywhere you look these days — from murder trials and celebrity defamation cases, to the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules’ recently [proposed rule amendments](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/judicial-panel-advances-expert-witness-rule-opposed-by-plaintiffs-bar-2022-05-06/) aimed at curbing the admission of “junk” expert scientific testimony.

Searching for, retaining, using, and examining expert witnesses doesn’t have to be a daunting experience. Mastering the use of these experts can offer critical benefits, particularly in complex litigation.

For its half-day [Expert Witness 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/expert-witness?t=live) program, PLI is assembling a panel of experienced litigators and expert witnesses to demystify some of the most common challenges that arise in selecting, preparing, and using experts. Discussion topics will include:

- How to select the right expert for your specific case
- What a Daubert hearing is and how to prepare for and conduct one
- How to defend against a Daubert challenge
- Strategies for deposing an opposing party’s expert
- How to prepare your expert witness to testify at a deposition or a trial
- Tips for mastering direct and cross examination of expert witnesses at trial
Whether you’re new to litigation or a seasoned trial professional, in private practice or part of an in-house team involved in litigation, this program will provide useful insights and practical tools for handling the myriad issues that commonly arise during expert witness preparation and testimony.

[Register today](https://www.pli.edu/programs/expert-witness?t=live) to gain the knowledge you need to master expert witness practice.

On the latest episode of Thinking Like A Lawyer, Kathryn and Chris ponder the need for a rule [against Confederate flags](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/the-aba-decides-that-courtrooms-shouldnt-still-have-confederate-flags-in-them-also-there-are-courtrooms-with-confederate-flags-still-in-them/) in courtrooms in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in the year of our Lord 2023. Speaking of bold stances on things that should be obvious, the American Bar Association would really like [a Supreme Court ethics rule](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/the-aba-has-had-enough-of-the-supreme-court-being-held-unaccountable/), but we know that’s not happening. Plus if you want your full bonus this year[ at Perkins Coie](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/perkins-coie-billable-hours-change/), you’re going to have to bill more hours. Which is a crappy move, but still better [than the layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) slow-moving through Biglaw.

# Referring Work To Lawyers At Your Law Firm Might Be Difficult
## Lawyers at a law firm may not want to assist another attorney who works at the same shop for numerous reasons.

Lawyers often say that among the benefits of working at a larger law firm are the additional resources and practice areas a larger shop might have to better serve clients. Indeed, larger firms can help clients who might have legal needs across different locations and which may involve various areas of the law. However, just because a lawyer works at a law firm that has different practice areas and geographic footprints does not mean that an attorney will be able to marshal those resources well to serve a client.

I first realized this when I was working at a regional law firm around a decade ago. I originated a client that had a legal need in a jurisdiction in which I did not have much experience. However, our law firm had an office in the jurisdiction with attorneys who exclusively practice law in that jurisdiction. I was certain that these lawyers would be able to assist me with any questions I had or possibly even handle the work themselves given that they had more experience in that jurisdiction.

When I called attorneys in our law firm’s office in that jurisdiction, they were not very helpful, and they seemed upset that I was asking them for help. In some instances, they were even outright rude to me. I ended up having to do all of the work on the matter myself, and since I did not have form documents from prior matters in that jurisdiction, I had to reinvent the wheel in some instances even though the other lawyers at my law firm might have had a much easier time performing the work.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Lawyers at a law firm may not want to assist another attorney who works at the same shop for numerous reasons. Perhaps most importantly, the lawyer referred the work might not have any incentive to assist the other attorney. The lawyer who originated the business might receive credit for that client when it is time for promotions or during bonus determinations, but the lawyer performing the work might not receive a similar benefit. Lawyers might not want to go out of their way to help a colleague receive a benefit that they themselves will not realize, especially if they do not know this other attorney well.

In addition, helping another lawyer at a law firm might slow down another attorney and might make it difficult for the other attorney to meet billable hour expectations. Many lawyers work on large accounts, and it is much easier to bill time to larger clients since the lawyer does not need to relearn billing habits, make new client contacts, or spend administrative time on other tasks. When a lawyer needs to spend time on a smaller, new matter, this can take the lawyer away from easier tasks that the lawyers can handle for their typical clients.

Office politics might also make it difficult for a lawyer to help out another lawyer at their law firm with a new matter. Partners are often very territorial about their teams, and they may not want attorneys to work on a given matter rather than other assigned tasks. Moreover, attorneys may not wish to work on a new matter originated by a lawyer because attorneys may be jockeying for a promotion and one lawyer may not want to help support another lawyer in originating new business. In other instances, simple jealously may interfere with a lawyer at a law firm working on a new matter originated by another lawyer, especially if the lawyer doing the work has not originated new business on their own.

All told, there are some benefits of working at larger law firms, and if a lawyer at a shop has significant standing, they can likely refer a new and different matter to a lawyer without too many issues. However, lawyers should keep in mind that just because their firm can handle a matter does not mean that other attorneys at their shop will work on the matter to the best of their abilities.

# Say 'No' To The Tyranny Of 'Yes'

No. Uh-uh. Definitely not.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Eileen Lawrence to our pages. Click [here](https://www.mothersesquire.com/donate-1) if you’d like to donate to MothersEsquire.

Are you letting your life be ruled by the tyranny of “yes”? The pressure on lawyer moms to say “yes” has been with us from the beginning of our careers. Say “yes” to internships and clerkships and law review to maximize your career options. Say “yes” to billing more hours, taking clients to dinner, spending late nights at the office, and agreeing to tight deadlines so you can make partner and make more money. Say “yes” to your clients’ demands and requests whenever possible. But also, say “yes” to making healthy lunches for your kids, volunteering as a room mom for your kid’s class, keeping your children off of their screens, planning playdates and summer camps and after school activities so you don’t screw up your kids or look like a bad parent.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It can be hard to say “no” — you don’t want to disappoint people, or lose out on opportunities, or feel judged for not doing enough. But if you don’t say “no” every once in a while, you’re letting other people’s invitations, requests, and demands dictate how you live your life.

Listen, mama: now is the time to be intentional about how you spend your time and your energy. Now is the time to choose your own adventure instead of letting everyone else choose it for you.

So how do you say “no” to the tyranny of yes?

First, realize that you are fully capable of saying “no.” We moms don’t hesitate to say “no” to protect our children from hot stoves, dangerous traffic, and cyberbullying. We do hesitate to say “no” to protect ourselves — our time, our peace, our health, our sanity — not because we can’t say “no” but because we don’t prioritize ourselves. It’s not that you can’t say “no,” it’s that you need to get comfortable with putting yourself first every once in a while.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Second, you must start listening to yourself. If you’ve spent years ignoring your own wants and needs, this will not be easy. You’ll need to block out time on your calendar for this — no, I’m not kidding. Block off 30 minutes a week to write down your goals, dreams, wants, and needs. (Be sure to turn off and step away from any distractions during this time. I promise the world will survive without your immediate attention for 30 minutes a week.) And start asking yourself what you want and what you need as a regular practice: at the grocery store, at the bookstore, when you’re choosing how to spend your weekend, when you’re deciding what to do for dinner, when you’re planning vacations.

Third, once you start listening to yourself, you can begin the process of aligning where you spend your time and your energy with your goals, dreams, wants, and needs. That way you’re not saying “no” to other people just to say “no” — you’re saying “no” to other people so you can say “yes” to yourself.

Fourth, be patient with yourself when you screw up. You can’t reverse decades of programming and practice in a few weeks or a few months. Start small, keep at it, and you’ll get better at it.

Fifth, be prepared for pushback. You and your partner, you and your kids, you and your parents, and you and your co-workers have been dancing together for a while (and you’ve probably been dancing backwards and in heels, because you’re a woman). When you start to change this dance by making your own moves and being less accommodating to your dance partner’s moves, he or she will feel unbalanced and uncomfortable. Your dance partner probably won’t be happy for you, at least not at first. They may get angry. They may turn up the guilt. But you have to stay strong. Remember that although giving in and going back to your old dance will feel easy and natural in the short-term, it is unsustainable in the long-term and will only lead to more resentment and bitterness.

Lastly, keep checking in with yourself. Keep listening to yourself. Keep saying “yes” to yourself.

Once you start learning to say “no” to the demands of other people, you will find more joy. You will become more true to yourself. You will be a better mother, a better partner, and a better attorney because you won’t be resentful, and you won’t be stretched beyond your limits. And you’ll discover that the people who truly love you don’t love you just because you’re always trying to make them happy; they love you because of who you are: a person who knows herself and knows her worth.

# Am Law 100 Firm Furloughs Staff, No Other Cost-Cutting Measures For Now
## The firm hasn't made a decision on pay cuts.

The question of how, exactly, law firms should deal with the economic uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 remains an active one. While we’ve seen a range of responses from Biglaw, from [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), to [furloughs, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/)and [associate salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-100-firm-turns-to-furloughs-and-salary-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/), one of the more vexing question remains what to do with staff who are [dependent on physical locations to do their job](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/associates-take-a-20-percent-pay-cut-and-some-staff-gets-furloughed-at-this-am-law-100-firm/) and cannot work from home.

Sheppard Mullin, currently clocking in at [56th in the Am Law 200](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=272&name=Sheppard-Mullin) ranking, just announced furloughs for a small amount of their staff. Those impacted are those that cannot work from home, and, in a statement from the firm, they’ve revealed staff members will continue to have medical benefits and will receive a bridge fund grant (funded by partners’ personal funds):

Sheppard Mullin today furloughed 33 of our 823 staff. We furloughed these team members because they cannot perform their jobs (such as receptionists, support services and file center employees) from home. These personnel have been on payroll through the four weeks of our Work From Home program. They have been told to expect to return to work in 60-90 days. Given the levels of unemployment insurance available, none of those furloughed will experience reduced compensation. During the furlough, Sheppard Mullin will pay for full medical benefits and will not require the furloughed employees to contribute to the insurance costs. In addition, because of the lag time between when an employee is furloughed and when unemployment benefits are received, partners and senior management have contributed personal funds to create a Bridge Fund to provide full equivalent take-home pay during the wait. These bridge funds are a grant, not a loan, and will not be paid back.

And that’s it for austerity measures, at least for now. The firm says while layoffs are off the table, pay cuts or other measures haven’t been decided. The firm statement goes on:

Aside from the furlough of these staff members, we have made no other decisions regarding additional furloughs or a reduction in hours or compensation. We have no intention of doing any layoffs. Our goal is to treat all of the Sheppard Mullin family fairly and with consideration, while making sure we remain a strong firm.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# What You Need To Know About Compliance And Ethics In 2022
## Whether you’re in-house counsel, a compliance and ethics officer, a human resources executive, outside counsel, or a risk management consultant, ethics and compliance should be playing a critical role in your job responsibilities.

Many things go into the success of an organization, but staying on top of ethics and compliance is one of the most critical factors to remaining in business. Whether you’re in-house counsel, a compliance and ethics officer, a human resources executive, outside counsel, or a risk management consultant, ethics and compliance should be a priority.

In an increasingly tough regulatory environment, it’s important to implement an effective compliance program now. Among other things, your program should focus on increased accountability and transparency.

PLI’s intensive, two-day program, [Compliance & Ethics Essentials 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/compliance--ethics-essentials?t=live&p=331967?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), brings together experts from major corporations, academia, law firms, and the government to review and discuss the  most critical issues in compliance and ethics this year, including:

- How to design and conduct effective compliance risk assessments for your organization
- How to structure your compliance and ethics program in order to achieve the right level of independence and authority
- The evolving role of your board
- The role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in your compliance program
- How you can use data analytics to improve your program
- Encouraging the reporting and investigation of allegations of wrongdoing at your organization
- The current best practices in compliance codes, communications, training, and tools
- Key ethics issues for compliance professionals
Regardless of your experience with compliance and ethics, the PLI’s faculty will share the knowledge you need to improve your program, increase employee awareness and decrease legal risk. Experts will share critical insights on  best practices and real-life experience with compliance in today’s corporate environment in order to help you identify and mitigate legal risks.

An effective compliance program is no longer just “nice-to-have” – it’s a necessity. [Register today](https://www.pli.edu/programs/compliance--ethics-essentials?t=live&p=331967?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) to learn more.

On the list of professions that love lists, lawyers take the top spot.

From networking at trade shows to having fun outside of work, this volume details what you *really* need to know about the legal tech world.

We hope this eBook will help you meet all of your business goals — while providing a few laughs along the way.
