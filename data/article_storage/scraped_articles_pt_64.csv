# The COVID Law Firm Reopening Tracker: How Is Your Firm Going Back To Work?

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted virtually every facet of life. The times we live in are now uncertain, and nothing will ever be the same as it was before. Lawyers and legal professionals have been cloistered inside their homes for months, and states across the country are now slowly but surely reopening their economies and lifting their shelter-in-place guidance.

With all this taking place, major law firms — many fresh off managing their expenses by using cost-cutting maneuvers like salary cuts, benefits reductions, furloughs, and layoffs — have been weighing their plans to get their employees back into the office.

Just as we’ve done in the past when it comes to raises, bonuses, and austerity measures, we are compiling a table of all the firms that have announced reopening guidelines in these strange times. We want you to see exactly how the legal profession is dealing with this new phase of the coronavirus crisis.

Help us help you. Let us know what your firm is doing to protect employees and adjust to the new normal during this unprecedented moment in time.

As a little reminder, we love covering law firm news, but we need your help. As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20COVID%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] COVID Reopening”). We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

# Jones Day Files For Sanctions In Ongoing Gender Discrimination Lawsuit
## Jones Day says the plaintiffs' theory of the case is ‘deeply flawed logic.’

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

No one ever said suing a Biglaw firm was going to be pretty. That’s a lesson the six named plaintiffs taking on Jones Day found out pretty quickly. The latest development has the Biglaw firm seeking sanction against the plaintiffs and their lawyers.

For those who need the primer on the case, [the purported class-action](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/plaintiffs-in-jones-day-gender-discrimination-case-want-it-to-be-a-class-action/?rf=1) gender discrimination [case](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) alleges a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system. There are currently six named plaintiffs in the case (there had been seven, but [one anonymous plaintiff dropped out](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/plaintiff-backs-out-of-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-rather-than-reveal-her-name/?rf=1) rather than reveal her name). The plaintiffs are spread throughout the country — Nilab Rahyar Tolton, Andrea Mazingo, Meredith Williams, and Jaclyn Stahl worked in California offices of the firm, while Saira Draper was an associate in Atlanta, and Katrina Henderson was in the firm’s New York office — and a core allegation is that the same black box compensation systems kept their pay below that of men working at the firm.

But the firm takes issue with the way the plaintiffs have, thus far, attempted to show the unequal pay. [In filings](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) they’ve pointed to Jones Day’s statement about paying market salaries, which they define as being in line with the Cravath scale, and the theory is that female associates who make below that mark are being unfairly compensated, as discussed in the deposition of plaintiff Meredith Williams:

“So just sort of combining Jones Day’s representation that top performing candidates are making market, neither myself nor any of the women I know are making market, I have to assume that Jones Day’s representation was truthful and someone is making market, and I would understand that that would be the male associates,” Williams testified.

But, [as reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/12/06/jones-day-wants-sanctions-in-gender-bias-case-says-lawyers-bungled-cravath-scale-claims/) Law.com, Jones Days takes issue with this theory, calling it “deeply flawed logic” and “pure speculation,” and alleging plaintiffs are aware of facts that contradict that theory:

“Their principal theory of the case—that the proof of discrimination is the fact that plaintiffs did not earn “Cravath scale”—was sophistry on its own terms,” the Jones Day attorneys said. ”And, to make matters worse, plaintiffs knew facts that contradicted their theory and knew no facts that supported it.”

The firm also says the plaintiffs’ theory does not take into account productivity and performance reviews, and [how plaintiffs’ performance,](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/jones-day-to-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-you-dont-deserve-to-be-paid-on-the-cravath-scale/) not their gender, allegedly impacted their compensation.

In their request for sanctions, Jones Day also takes aim at what they deem a lack of research about the claims and, allegedly, not speaking with similarly situated men at the firm:

“No policy could have precluded plaintiffs’ counsel from contacting the alleged comparators, for example, to determine whether there was a good-faith basis for claiming that they were paid more than plaintiffs for equal work,” the Jones Day attorneys said. “Instead, counsel ‘fire[d] shots into the proverbial dark,’ making a host of baseless allegations which plaintiffs then touted in the media in a (largely unsuccessful) effort to drum up new plaintiffs.”

Attached to the sanctions motion is correspondence that reveals the plaintiffs’ position on the matter. They point to the “wealth of circumstantial evidence” about life at the firm including “gendered comments, gendered criticism, discriminatory allocation of work, discriminatory performance evaluations, and, as a result, severely limited advancement opportunities for women.” They also say Jones Day’s lack of compensation data to back up their point is damning:

“You are in possession of all of the relevant evidence and have known of Plaintiffs’ allegations for more than a year. We expect that you have long since analyzed the firm’s pay data and evaluated the degree to which men and women are paid comparably. We are confident that if you had a basis to deny plaintiffs’ allegations of firmwide pay discrimination you would do so, and that if you had evidence to disprove those allegations, you would produce it.”

Russell Kornblith, partner at Sanford Heisler Sharp LLP representing the plaintiffs had this comment on the motion:

Jones Day’s sanctions motion is a groundless procedural ploy designed to distract from its facially unlawful “black box” pay secrecy policy. We look forward to responding in our papers with the Court.

We’ll be waiting — with popcorn — for the next development in the highly contested litigation.

# The 'Reference Manual Of Legal Tech Lists': 5 Times Legal Tech Went To Hollywood
## Conan O'Brien, Ally McBeal, Margaret Atwood, and more!

In our continuing effort to explore the various [nooks & crannies](https://www.factsnfiguresinc.com/post/do-you-know-how-thomas-the-english-muffins-slogan-nooks-crannies-came-to-life) of the legal tech world, we’re turning our attention to the West Coast.

Each entry of our brand-new “Reference Manual of Lists” will explore a new category lurking in the dark recesses of legal tech — you know, [the kind that are buried deep down, of the sort you don’t talk about at parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk).

For this segment of our series, we’ll explore times that legal tech went Hollywood.

Margaret Atwood invents a legal tech tool. Most people know [Margaret Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood) as a prolific writer. Her most famous book, “[The Handmaid’s Tale,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale) has been turned into a [popular Hulu television series](https://press.hulu.com/shows/the-handmaids-tale/). But, did you know that Atwood also invented an early version of an e-signature platform, so she wouldn’t have to go to book signings? It’s called “the long pen.” As Atwood [discussed on Legal Talk Network](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/legal-toolkit/2022/05/margaret-atwood-and-matthew-gibson-discuss-the-longpen-originalism-and-more/), she helps run a company that sells digital signature solutions, including to law firms.

Conan O’Brien lends his endorsement. [Luke O’Brien](https://twitter.com/lukegobrien?lang=en), Conan’s brother, is an attorney who runs a law firm in Westwood, Massachusetts, and has also worked with legal tech startups. Back in the early 2010s, he was an executive for a document automation company called BrightLeaf, and his brother Conan starred in an ad for the product. That content still lives on at the BrightLeaf YouTube channel. [Check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNaZ2H_FFBQ) — as this ad may just feature the most famous legal tech spokesperson ever.

Ally McBeal is in legal tech commercials, too. Not to be outdone by late-night host Conan O’Brien, [Ally McBeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWhABsnbgbA), the [television lawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_McBeal) played by Calista Flockhart, appeared in [ads for Smokeball in the 2010s](https://vimeo.com/333781426). In any event, props to [my guy, Chad Sands](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/legal-toolkit/2021/02/the-cat-lawyer-buzzkill-unusual-legal-marketing-and-the-rump-roast-game-of-life/), who conceived of this marketing campaign — which may be the most inventive in legal tech history.

Saul Goodman sells flips phones. Saul Goodman may be the best “[criminal lawyer”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvlEqAjg8aU) in television history, active in the “[Breaking Bad”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad) universe and spinoff, “[Better Call Saul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul).” Now, when Saul (née [Jimmy McGill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9MMVZU1sOM)) isn’t covering up for his drug-involved clients, he’s [out there selling “burner” flip phones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89wXeYOls7o) (that can be easily disposed of) to elements of the criminal underworld. And, if you don’t think that flip phones are part of the legal tech world, let me just [correct that misconception](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/phoning-it-in-why-i-wont-have-smartphone/).

Then there was that time when Avvo made a television commercial. In the mid-2010s, [Avvo](https://www.avvo.com/) – the trailblazing legal directory that had the audacity to rank lawyer on a 1-10 scale – came out with some commercials. [They’re actually pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQH76PRdHTg) — especially when the guy gets dusted by the concrete bags — and, they can serve as a model for how lawyers can advertise: focus on the client’s problem, with subtle branding.

# Kim Kardashian Explains Her Law School Dream With New Details
## The reality star is working on the bar... and selling a dishonest lifestyle.

Ever since we learned that Kim Kardashian is trying to become an attorney — first [from an off-the-cuff Kanye statement](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/wait-kim-kardashian-is-in-law-school-or-is-kanye-just-mouthing-off-about-stuff-he-doesnt-understand/) and later [from Kardashian herself in an interview](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/kim-kardashian-plans-to-become-lawyer-will-take-bar-exam-in-2022/) — there’s been a healthy outpouring of skepticism.

There are still states that allow apprenticeships? Yes. Can a college dropout even be a lawyer? As it turns out, in California they can if they got themselves 60 credits toward a degree. Is there any way she can really pass a bar exam so notoriously difficult that it tripped up the dean of Stanford Law School? Well… that remains to be seen.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

The criticism [just kept on coming](https://pagesix.com/2019/04/15/kim-kardashian-defends-law-school-studies-after-facing-criticism/):

The reality star never graduated from college, but in California, it’s legal to study the law privately. While Kim has faced her fair share of critics for studying law —many have compared her to Elle Woods in “Legally Blonde” — Kim said that’s not the case.

Indeed it’s not. Elle Woods went to Harvard.

All of these questions and snarky takes spurred Kardashian to post an Instagram photo of herself studying. It’s not a selfie meaning, I guess, someone stood in the room and took a picture of her looking at a book in a totally not artificial way.

Sure. Very natural. Frankly, I didn’t even doubt that she was working hard on her studies but staged images like this don’t do wonders for her credibility.

Perhaps more importantly, the image answers the question many had raised: who are the lawyers taking Kardashian under their wing? As one might suspect given that Kardashian is pursuing the law based on her brush with criminal justice reform, these attorneys are deeply involved in the movement. From the left of the image, we have [Erin Haney](https://www.cut50.org/erin_haney), National Policy Director, and  [Jessica Jackson](https://www.cut50.org/jessica_jackson_bio), National Director and co-founder, of the Cut50 initiative to end mass incarceration.

Kardashian used her social media to lay out some more details, explaining that she’s coming up on the baby bar and explaining that the work takes its toll on her family time:

I work all day, put my kids to bed and spend my nights studying. I changed my number last year and disconnected from everyone because I have made this strict commitment to follow a dream of mine – It’s never too late to follow your dreams.

Put the definition of “work” to one side and her point resonates with any non-traditional student trying to get through the messy business of legal education while — ugh — keeping up with their family.

I’ve seen some comments from people who are saying it’s my privilege or money that got me here, but that’s not the case,” she wrote. “The state bar doesn’t care who you are.

The state bar may not care, but it is absolutely your privilege and money that got you here. The law school night student doesn’t get to hand their kids off to nannies and servants while they go study. They don’t get to put their “work” on hold so they can go apprentice in a legal office for years. And that’s fine, just admit it. Don’t try to sell this as some bullshit lifestyle promotion fantasy that every 38-year-old mother of three without a college education can just hop into lawyerin’ at the drop of a hat.

Overcoming those blindspots and recognizing her position relative to the rest of the world will be a critical step in maturing as an advocate. She’s clearly not there yet. But, she still has time.

The venture capital market is enjoying its biggest moment since the dot-com days of the late ’90s. Globally, VC dealmaking shattered records in 2021. 

But certain pockets of the market are driving the current VC ecosystem, and not every aspect of the global startup scene is increasing at the same pace. 

Join us on March 29 for a webinar sponsored by our friends at Litera, where an expert panel led by Bob Ambrogi will analyze the findings of a new report titled “Betting on the Post-COVID Future.” 

You’ll learn: 

- The dealmaking trends revealed by the data
- How a wave of nontraditional investors has affected dealmaking activity
- How lawyers can meet the demands of unprecedented VC activity

# Biglaw Partner Files $20 Million Lawsuit Over Alleged Rape
## The plaintiff is described as a partner in the Houston office of a large international law firm who has practiced for 12 years.

A $20 million lawsuit has been filed against Texas restaurant Brennan’s of Houston, alleging that a bartender spiked a customers drink with a drug and over-served her alcohol before raping her. [The lawsuit has been filed](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5719267-83609947.html) as a Jane Doe case to protect the petitioner’s privacy, but the plaintiff is described as a partner in the Houston office of a large international law firm who has practiced for 12 years.

The lawsuit seeks damages for pain and suffering, physical impairment, medical expenses and loss of earnings and earning capacity. According to the complaint, Jane Doe has been forced to leave her firm due to the stress and PTSD caused by the sexual assault:

“On Aug. 17, 2018, the distress reached a point where she has had to take medical leave from her firm, and she is currently undergoing treatment for PTSD. Her distress has cost her a tremendous amount in lost earnings, along with medical and counseling expenses,” the partner’s petition said. “At this point, she does not know when she will be able to return to work in any capacity, and she will undoubtedly continue to struggle with the emotional ramifications of this rape for the rest of her life.”

As[ reported ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/02/05/big-law-partner-seeks-20m-from-houston-restaurant-after-alleged-rape/)by Law.com, the alleged assault happened in 2015 when plaintiff alleges a Brennan’s bartender, Sean Kerrigan, spiked her drink, took advantage of her incapacitation and raped her with aid of a manager of the restaurant:

“Almost immediately upon the colleague’s departure, Kerrigan ‘spilled’ plaintiff’s drink and replaced it with a bourbon-based drink ‘on the house.’ Kerrigan drugged plaintiff with this drink,” her petition alleges.

The plaintiff has no memory of finishing that drink, the petition said, and little memory of the rest of the evening. She alleges that she later learned Kerrigan and another man, who was then a manager of the restaurant, took her from Brennan’s to another bar, and then took to her house, where she lived alone.

She alleges that Kerrigan raped her an unknown number of times at her house that night, and the manager at a minimum aided and abetted the rape and the continued assault.

The petition alleges the restaurant is responsible for the assault and breached its duty of care in failing to properly supervise its employees and was negligent.

Jane Doe pressed charges against Kerrigan, and in July 2018, he was indicted for felony aggravated sexual assault. Kerrigan died in November 2018, and the charges were subsequently dismissed.

In a statement Alex Brennan-Martin, proprietor of Brennan’s of Houston, denied the restaurant was liable for the alleged actions of its former employees:

“While we condemn what she states happened to her in the strongest terms, we strenuously dispute any allegation that Brennan’s or Mr. Brennan-Martin (proprietor) is somehow responsible for the actions of individuals off work and off premises,” the written statement continued.

# Morning Docket: 03.18.16
## * ""In 2 to 4 years, a University administration will shut down a top law school and we may never see it coming."" Uh-oh! Is a top law school really going to close? This law professor seems to think so, and she's pointing the finger at Minnesota Law, which has been experiencing a slew of financial troubles due to its enrollment issues. [[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/schoolboard/2016/03/17/which-top-law-school-will-close-follow-the-money/#749305533457)] * ""The employment numbers were very high in a huge economic downturn and it just felt suspicious. I decided to stand up for myself and others."" Anna Alaburda, who sued Thomas Jefferson School of Law over its allegedly deceptive job statistics, took the stand this week, where she spoke about her failed legal career. [[Courthouse News Service](http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/03/17/eight-years-no-job-socal-law-school-grad-says.htm)] * “The record number of deals in 2015 is a reflection of the intense competition among law firms for new work, and we expect the market to remain hot in 2016.” Oh boy! If you think 2015 set a merger record, you ain't seen nothing yet. We should apparently be expecting even more law firm merger mania this year. [[Chicago Daily Law Bulletin](http://www.chicagolawbulletin.com/mergers-03-17-16.aspx)] * Why on earth would a partner leave a firm like Munger Tolles, with profits per partner of $1.9 million, to go to a firm like Dentons, with profits per partner of $680,000, a considerably lesser amount? What's in that Biglaw behemoth's special sauce that's so amazing? It's the ""irresistible"" opportunities. [[Big Law Business / Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/why-lawyer-left-1-9m-ppp-law-firm-to-join-dentons/)] * As many of our readers have had the displeasure of experiencing firsthand, law school tuition can be absurdly expensive. If you're wondering which school took home the prize of being the most expensive for the 2015-2016 school year, it's Columbia Law, with a shocking sticker price of $62,700. Ouch, that's painful.

# More Cuts Could Be Coming As Biglaw Firms Brace For Recession
## Things could, in fact, get even worse....

The slowdown is forecasted to go into next year, and the first six months of next year are looking jagged. It’s not good for anybody to have these people that are underutilized. Like with anything, what goes up must come down. The economy couldn’t keep roaring the way it was.

— Larry Watanabe, a California-based partner recruiter, commenting in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/10/cooleys-performance-based-layoffs-also-hit-high-achievers/) on the fact that because Biglaw firms are likely budgeting for a recession in early 2023, cuts are to be expected in the year’s final quarters. This fall, a few firms have [made cuts to headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-junior-associates-top-20-biglaw-firm-cooley/) in their [corporate practices](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/). “There’s a lot more due diligence in hiring corporate lawyers” now than compared to corporate hiring in 2021, he said.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm To Launch Partial Reopening In November, Full Reopening In January 2022
## Attorneys will be able to work remotely two days each week, starting in 2022.

Thanks to the ongoing pandemic, law firms of all sizes have been forced to create, recreate, postpone, and delay their reopening plans to get attorneys and staff members back into their offices. Many firms had hoped to reopen en masse in September. Thanks to the Delta variant, those plans got pushed to October. When things looked like they wouldn’t improve any time soon, October plans were canceled, with many firms waiting before announcing any further plans to avoid additional rescheduling issues, while others decided to forgo a 2021 reopening altogether.

Some firms, however, have opted to bring employees back to the office in November. One of those firms is Weil Gotshal & Manges.

On Friday, all personnel received a memo from partner [Mindy J. Spector](https://www.weil.com/people/mindy-spector), the firm’s general counsel, where she notified them that a return to the office, at least in part, will be happening next month. Here’s a relevant excerpt from that memo:

As everyone has likely followed in the news, we have seen, in recent weeks, the stabilization of case counts following the surge of the Delta variant that had occurred this summer. This development, coupled with the Firm’s vaccination requirement for all Weil employees, gives us optimism in moving forward with the next phase of our plan to return to the office in the US.

Accordingly, we are planning to transition to a partial return to the office on Monday, November 1st. As of that time, all members of the Weil family will be expected to work in the office for a minimum of two days each week.

Spending two days in the office doesn’t seem too terrible, but keep in mind that two days is the minimum. All Weil employees must be fully vaccinated by November 1 (barring approved medical or religious exemptions).

The firm plans to reopen in full on January 10, and at that time, all attorneys and staff will be permitted to work remotely on Fridays, and attorneys will be able to take one additional remote day each week (i.e., that’s two remote days per attorney and one remote day per staff member). Weil will work on a pilot of this remote work program for 12 months, beginning in January 2022.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# A Brand New Email Screw-Up For Abbe Lowell
## Email address auto-fill is a real bitch to master, y'all.

Abbe Lowell

Shut off your email address auto-fill. I know you don’t want to. I know, it’s a real time saver. At a prior job there was an incident with an attorney emailing documents to opposing counsel instead of co-counsel because of email auto-fill, and everyone in the entire company had to attend mandatory training to teach us all to shut off auto-fill, and still, I resisted. The chance that I’d be the one to make such a snafu seemed remote. But really, the risks are huge, as this week in legal news proves beyond all doubt.

[First there was the WilmerHale associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/wilmerhale-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-of-leaking-client-whistleblower-docs-to-the-wsj/) who inadvertently emailed the Wall Street Journal privileged — and embarrassing — documents detailing a whistleblower investigation. Not a good look for the Biglaw giant.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now CNN is [reporting](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/politics/jared-kushner-personal-email-account-senate-intelligence/index.html) that Jared Kushner’s personal attorney, Abbe Lowell — who so recently [aced the email etiquette pop quiz](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/abbe-lowell-falls-for-internet-prank-still-gives-good-advice/?rf=1) thrown at him by an internet prankster — has been felled by email address auto-fill. D’oh.

The Senate Judiciary Committee sent to Kushner — via his attorney, Lowell — a request seeking relevant documents from any “personal” email accounts. (Apparently they were a little perturbed they discovered Kushner discussed White House business through personal email accounts via media reports.) Lowell, as is his duty, forwarded the formal request to Kushner. Only one problem — he still had the email prankster’s fake Kushner email address. Wouldn’t you know it, that was the address that auto-filled when he tried to forward the request to Kushner. From there it was only a short step to the media:

Earlier this week, the prankster pretended to be Kushner and wrote to Kushner’s real attorney, Lowell, about the (fictitious) adult content of emails he had shared with White House officials, [as covered by Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/jared-kushner-lawyer-email-prankster-private-2017-9). Apparently, earlier Thursday, when Lowell attempted to forward the very real letter from the very legitimate Senate intelligence committee leaders, his email auto-fill supplied the address of the very fake Kushner account run by the prankster. A person familiar with the email transmission told CNN it was inadvertently forwarded to the prankster’s address.

In a statement to CNN, the prankster explained why he does this: “The original prank’s intention was to meet hypocrisy and cronyism with levity and a soupçon of embarrassment, instead of giving into the well worn grooves of anger and frustration. There’s a dash of modern-day surrealism creeping in at times, and this is evolving the more friends I make in the US.”

Jeff Sessions has[ made it a priority](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/05/sessions-leaks-media-attack-worse-thank-you-think-215465) to suss out administration leaks. Looks like we’ve found one source — Microsoft Outlook.

# Ropes & Gray Bonus Contains A Fun Punishment

Since I took a passing and wholly unnecessary swipe at Ropes & Gray [while explaining that Boston is still racist](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/we-needed-a-whole-spotlight-investigation-to-figure-out-boston-is-still-racist/), it feels good to be able to report on Ropes & Gray’s 2017 associate bonuses.

It’s a standard match of [the Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/), albeit with a 1,900 billable hours requirement. Ropes counts qualified pro-bono hours towards the requirement. The bonuses are being paid this Friday in case you have any last minute Christmas shopping to do. Yada, yada, ho-hum.

Let’s get to the fun part. From the bonus memo:

Timely diaries are critical to our business. They enable us to bill clients promptly at the end of each month, and are essential to monitoring and managing alternative fee arrangements. For these reasons, adhering to our diary standards is absolutely crucial. As previously announced, lawyers violating our diary standards have received an automatic bonus reduction.

Ooh, I like this. Putting in your time may seem like a pain-in-the-ass, clerical duty that is beneath your average associate. It’s also how the firm MAKES MONEY. Small and solo practitioners know how important it is to bill timely and accurately. They do not have this problem. It’s only in Biglaw where associates feel like time keeping is an administrative task as opposed to THE REASON THEY’RE ALL THERE.

Docking people a bit off their bonus seems like an excellent way to make this point. Sometimes it’s pretty hard to judge whether your 1,900 hours were more important to the firm than her 1,900 hours. But if her hours were in on time and yours were put in months in arrears, guess what, her hours were more valuable to the firm.

I hope more firms do this. And I say that as a person who would absolutely have been docked because doing routine clerical work is something I always fail at. Docking the bonus is an appropriate punishment for the crime.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please email it to us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Don’t get me wrong, I no longer give a wet s**t about the bonuses. In fact, I’m pretty sure nobody is even reading this bit anymore. But you all keep clicking on every freaking bonus story, so we keep reporting. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

As the days move closer and closer to July 1, the effective date of the series of raises sweeping through Biglaw, we are seeing more and more firms step up to the plate to join the ranks of MoneyLaw firms. Congratulations to the hardworking associates at Fish & Richardson; the firm has announced that all offices will be getting a raise, effective, you guessed it, July 1.

The firm’s email lists out the now familiar levels of compensation, though they list the raises only up to seventh-year associates, while other firms have noted amounts for eighth- or even ninth-years. The class of 2016, entering the firm this fall, and the summer associates will also be seeing a pay raise.

# Inappropriate Compensation For First-Year Law Firm Associates?
## How much is too much when it comes to salary and bonuses?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

Bloomberg Law’s most recent State of Practice survey asked nearly 300 attorneys to estimate the starting salaries for first-year associates at their firms, and comment on whether they believe the first-years are being overcompensated, undercompensated, or appropriately compensated, based on their salaries and bonuses. What percentage of respondents believe that first-years are inappropriately compensated?

Hint: Attorneys from across the country estimated that the average starting salary for first-years at their firms is $139,945. There’s a difference of more than $75,000 between this figure and Biglaw’s new starting salary.

See the answer on the next page.

# Partner Leaves Prestigious Biglaw Firm To Become Division III Football Coach
## His salary may have decreased, but he loves his new career.

I did step off the treadmill. I did step off that treadmill to do what I wanted to do, and that’s a head-scratcher for some people in D.C. So one day you come in and you say, ‘What’s Bill doing? Is he at Williams & Connolly?’ ‘No, he’s the defensive coordinator at Catholic.’ That’s how my friends in the neighborhood found out. And they were like, ‘You son of a [gun], you’ve been talking about this for five years, and you did it. You really did it.’

— [Bill Bachman](http://www.cuacardinals.com/sports/fball/coaches/Bachman-_Bill?view=bio), a former partner at Williams & Connolly, offering some wry comments about [the way he left his firm](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2016/09/29/he-left-a-big-time-law-firm-to-become-a-division-iii-football-coach/). Last year, Bachman left the firm to become the defensive coordinator for Catholic University’s Division III football team, and in May, he was promoted to interim head coach. “[T]o leave [Williams & Connolly](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/williams-and-connolly-llp/) to come over here and try to win football games would be such a shallow existence,” he said. Instead, Bachman wants to teach his players valuable lessons and make differences in their lives.

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Wanna know what an email can be worth? Thousands of dollars.

Don’t believe me? Check out this bonus breakdown circulated by Fried Frank, a Biglaw firm with $951,300,000 gross revenue in 2021 according to [Law.com](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=112&name=Fried-Frank).

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
Now that is an email chain I would have been happy to be apart of. Of course, the next best thing is being able to share that information with our readers.

Congrats on making the big bucks!

# Your Mission (Should You Choose To Accept It)
## How do Biglaw firms expect therapists to help them deal with death and diversity?

Ed. note: This post is by [Will Meyerhofer](http://www.aquietroom.com/), a former [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/sullivan-cromwell/) attorney [turned psychotherapist](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/02/biglaw-attorney-turned-psychotherapist-analyzes-the-legal-profession/). He holds degrees from Harvard, NYU Law, and The Hunter College School of Social Work, and he blogs at [The People’s Therapist](http://thepeoplestherapist.com/). His new book, [Still Way Worse Than Being A Dentist](http://amzn.to/2bfN82j), is available [on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2bfN82j), as are his previous books, [Bad Therapist: A Romance](http://amzn.to/2bfX54N), [Way Worse Than Being A Dentist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193760022X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=193760022X&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=3SNNCUMQINDUQ7MP), and [Life is a Brief Opportunity for Joy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936400782/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1936400782) (affiliate links).

I just turned 50, so I can tell you about old. Old isn’t merely the words “Mission: Impossible” conjuring memories of a show you watched as a kid in 1973 on a “color console TV set” the size of a freezer chest. Old transcends. Old abides. Old pushes through to not caring if everyone else’s memories zip directly to a movie with Tom Cruise hanging off a cliff. Old concedes Jean-Luc Picard a place in the pantheon beside Kirk and Spock, but remains firm in its belief Peter Graves and the miniature reel-to-reel tape player that self-destructed after five seconds were the height of awesome, Tom Cruise or no Tom Cruise. Old is about “values.” Old doesn’t haggle over this stuff.

What made the original Mission: Impossible show so much fun (other than its co-starring Martin Landau, which already made it fun) was the bizarrely improbable nature of the missions. They were supposed to be “impossible” to carry out, but in reality that was the least of the issues. The “mission” generally took place in some made-up Eastern European country with a name like “Vladistan” with a grey, oppressive capital city (“Vodkagrad” sounds good) and there was always an evil dictator holding a good, democratic leader guy captive in Vodkagrad (not that I remember details — I was seven years old, chomping a peanut butter and jelly sandwich during much of the action). I mostly recall that a couple of the IMF (“Impossible Mission Force”) agents hung out in equipment rooms tapping phone lines and fiddling with electronic gadgets, glancing nervously at their watches, while the others (including Martin Landau!) wore disguises so convincing you only realized who they were when they peeled off plastic masks. How cool was that?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But my point — and I do (despite advancing age) have a point — is that I’ve recently, in my role of psychotherapist to the lawyers, been assigned “missions” by Biglaw firms, requests for my services, that leave me feeling like Mr. Phelps watching wisps of smoke rise from the little reel-to-reel. I’m a publicity whore, like any author who ever sold a book (or tried to) and yes, I might be termed a whore-whore as well, in some respects, like any public speaker who ever pocketed a fee. Points conceded. But on those occasions when I’ve managed to get hired to speak at conferences and panels and industry events and even at law schools, everything has come off if not without a hitch, then at least without a major conflagration. Invite me over, serve me lunch, treat me nice, and I’m a total pro, no trouble at all.

Yet, somehow, when it’s a Biglaw firm that comes calling for my services, everything goes all pear-shaped. If you don’t believe me, go ahead and be your own Mr. Phelps — check out a couple “impossible missions” that came my way recently, and decide for yourself whether you’d “choose to accept” them. I’m still scratching my head, long after the tape self-destructed. To wit:

Impossible Mission #1: Death

# The Largest Law Firms With The Most Women Lawyers (2021)
## An important ranking to show which firms are helping women achieve successful careers in the law.

Earlier today, thanks to the recently released National Law Journal 500 ranking, we found out which U.S.-centric Biglaw firms were the [biggest of them all in terms of headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/the-500-largest-law-firms-in-america-and-the-gigantic-salaries-some-are-paying-2021/). As a companion piece to the NLJ 500, we’ll now delve into the NLJ Women’s Scorecard, a ranking of the percentage of female attorneys and percentage of female partners at the largest 350 firms in the country.

For this ranking, equity and nonequity partners were counted as partners, while nonpartner or “other” figures include special counsel, of counsel, and staff attorneys. Temporary and contract attorneys aren’t included in the count. For a tie, the higher rank is awarded to the firm with more female equity partners.

The COVID-19 pandemic may have brought about bad news for work-life balance but despite these challenges, it seems that women thrived at law firms in 2020, and were actively recruited and retained through it all. From the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/24/more-firms-are-measuring-gender-diversity-and-some-have-a-great-story-to-tell/):

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Corporate legal departments are calling for more diversity in the legal industry—not just requesting it but actually requiring law firms to measure and monitor their diversity and inclusion of women and minorities. Clients want to know that the firms who serve them are inclusive—or they will not engage them. As a result, firms are increasingly measuring and reporting these important statistics, and paying attention to their performance.

The result: This year’s Women in Law Scorecard rankings includes 28 law firms that did not participate in last year’s ranking. And three firms new to the survey entered straight into the top 10.

Without further ado, here is the [NLJ Women’s Scorecard](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/06/24/the-nlj-500-the-women-in-law-scorecard-2021/) Top 10 for 2021:

- Berry Appleman & Leiden
- Fragomen
- Kubicki Draper
- Kaufman Borgeest & Ryan
- Littler Mendelson
- Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete
- Hanson Bridgett
- Shipman & Goodwin
- Manning Gross + Massenburg
- FordHarrison
You may be wondering where the largest, namebrand Biglaw firms appear on this list. While the majority of the top 30 firms on the scorecard have a headcount of about 300 or less, there were some exceptions, with Fragomen, Littler, Jackson Lewis, Ogletree, Ropes & Gray, Lewis Brisbois, Gordon Rees, Davis Wright Tremaine, Shook Hardy, Wilson Elser, and Baker McKenzie all making an appearance in the top 30.

# Lawyers Called Out For Casual Sexism That You Mistakenly Thought We'd Handled By 2019
## This shouldn't be so difficult.

No one had any illusions that sexism was cured. While high-profile abusers are finally facing repercussions for their actions and companies have stepped up efforts to construct policies that head off problems at the source, that’s all pretty cosmetic when it comes to ripping out patriarchy at the root. But still, one would have thought society had advanced a bit further than this.

In defense of the Law Society of New Zealand, its [recent adventures in casual sexism](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/nz-law-society-under-fire-sexist-dress-code-recommendations) contain the seed of its own redemption.

[According LawFuel](https://www.lawfuel.com/blog/law-society-goes-off-uncocked-the-cocktail-dress-brouhaha/), the Law Society’s 150th Anniversary Commemoration dinner invitation proved a teachable moment for those trying to explain casual sexism. When giving the details of the event, the Law Society gave potential attendees some helpful advice on dress:

Dress: Men: Business attire, Women: Cocktail wear.

Swing and a miss.

It’s unfortunate for the organization too because the invitation also notes that “partners/spouses also welcome” managing to avoid saying, “WAGs welcome” which the invite undoubtedly said in days gone by. But this isn’t the sort of place where someone drops a ball — a human had to type in these words and had to process on some level that all the men are businesspeople coming to network and the women are party guests.

In a game attempt to square this, LawFuel spoke with a woman who offered that the whole thing was “less biased around gender than it may appear if the fashion context is taken into account.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“To suggest business attire is appropriate for men and cocktail wear for women is two different standards. With that said, however, we also need to bear in mind that the spectrum of fashion for men is much narrower than for women. The mens’ version of “cocktail wear” could very well be said to be a business suit. It could be seen as the male equivalent of cocktail wear. In that context, the invitation seems much less biased around gender.”

In other words, “You see, the fashion world grew up around sexist assumptions about the workplace so parroting that lingo isn’t biased because… reasons.” No, it’s not fine to accept that because the fashion world couldn’t be bothered to change its vocabulary to assume women might be working too that this isn’t a slap in the face of the women who are partners in their firms and have to find some cocktail wear while the rest of the firm gets to come in business attire. If the issue is that the range of options for women is more expansive than for men, then just say everyone should come in cocktail attire and men will be in the same suits.

But, in fact, fashion does have a term for this and it’s “semi-formal” which may mean gaudy Sweet 16 garb for kids, but for adults means exactly what the Law Society is going for.

Do you want people dressed up but not in tuxedos and gowns? Then it’s semi-formal. Done. This shouldn’t be so difficult.

# Tomorrow Is Here (Again)
## Can your firm handle the monumental changes coming its way?

It’s 2023, and the fundamentals of running a law firm are suddenly up for debate. What does practicing law look like? How are law firms organized? Can technology replace some or all of what we do? Three years ago, I think most of us would have had confident answers to all of those questions, yet today the answers aren’t so clear. Against this backdrop, law firms need to make some of the most critical strategic decisions they’ve ever faced. Are you and your firm ready?

AI Esq.?

Let’s start with the most existential question: How essential to the law are lawyers? The answer used to be self-evident. As a profession that gets to make and enforce the rules governing the practice of law, attorneys have traditionally been well-insulated from outside pressures. The bar’s monopoly on practicing has shown a few cracks over the past years, with some states piloting programs such as Arizona’s Alternative Business Structures and Legal Paraprofessional certification, but, overall, lawyers have kept a tight grip on the ability to actually practice law. No one gets into the party without passing our rigorous bar examination process.

And then GPT-4 [passed the bar](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bar-exam-score-shows-ai-can-keep-up-with-human-lawyers-researchers-say-2023-03-15/) with a higher score than most of the humans taking it.

The age of the robot lawyer is upon us, whether we want it to be the case or not. Generative AI models like ChatGPT aren’t going anywhere and will only get better over the coming years. The legal industry, which is based on digesting a large corpus of written law and finding ways to use those past examples to predict future results, is squarely in ChatGPT’s wheelhouse. Potential clients won’t need to dial up an attorney for a preliminary review of how the law might apply to the facts of their case. And sophisticated clients may seek to keep more work in-house using Generative AI tools, or may demand their human counsel avail themselves of the efficiencies large language model AI promises to offer to keep their billing rates down.

If you think ChatGPT remains too clunky and unreliable for most legal purposes today, please recall that it wasn’t that long ago that cellphones were too bulky and expensive to be of any real use, and even less time has passed since modems were too slow and cumbersome for the internet to bring significant value to the table. Major players in the legal field have already begun moving toward integrating AI into their practices. Firms like Skadden, DLA Piper, and Orrick are all playing in the space, and Lexis is releasing its own Chat-GPT-powered product shortly.

AI is here and it’s not going away. Law firms that want to still be here in 20 years need to start understanding large language model AI and finding ways to fold those tools into their own offerings today.

The Phantom Office Space

Now that the pandemic has reached its end (at least from the bureaucratic standpoint), many management teams in the legal and broader business worlds have been pushing for a return to physical presences in office. The only thing standing in the way of that return to the classic model of busy workers filling the office with the hum of productivity is, well, everything else that happened over the past few years.

We made full-time remote work happen because the pandemic forced it. Now that we know it’s possible, we can’t credibly pretend things have to go back to the way they used to be. Young attorneys especially are placing a massive premium on flexibility to shape their work lives around their personal lives, cut their commute times, and leverage the technology that they grew up steeped in. One consultant I spoke with recently was working with firms that have tried to adopt the three days in, two days at home model, and by and large they’ve seen it fail. [Lawyers just don’t want to come into the office](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/lawyers-are-flouting-the-return-to-office-mandate) if they don’t have to.

Spending time in offices together can have real benefits, such as building camaraderie, sparking unexpected conversations and ideas, and generally contributing to the development of a healthy firm culture. But what use is that if people just aren’t going to go back? It doesn’t matter how much I tell my kids broccoli is good for them if I can’t get them to eat it. We need to stop wishing people would do what they won’t, and start looking to other methods of building our firm cultures that are compatible with what our attorneys want and need.

The firms that thrive in the coming years will be the ones that stop complaining about the problems that come with a hybridized, remote-friendly law firm and focus on investing in the infrastructure and systems to make them work. If we can’t count on water cooler chats to build the team, we need to get creative and find other ways of giving our teams unstructured, casual time together without forcing them to constantly be in the physical office. If training is harder over Zoom, then we need to get better at training. We don’t succeed by ignoring change in the world. We succeed by accepting the situation as it is, and making it better every day.

The Permanence Of Change

Either of the issues discussed above could be its own column, or heck, its own book. Each presents a monumental set of issues for the most talented management teams on the planet to grapple with. What’s truly terrifying for law firm managers, though, is that both these issues just popped up in the past couple of years, both demand fundamental rewrites of how to operate a law firm, and neither is likely to be the last major sea change of this decade. The pace of change in the legal and business world seems only to keep increasing, and law firm management will need to move just as swiftly to keep up and stay ahead of the competition.

Change has rarely been the legal profession’s forte. Stare decisis is at the heart of our industry, practically, philosophically, and emotionally. But resisting change just doesn’t work anymore. Law firms today need to either ride the wave or get washed under it.

Law firm management looking to thrive in the coming decade needs to be swift and adaptable, ready to embrace change as an opportunity for growth. But more than that, we need to find ways to teach our colleagues how to do the same. The lawyerly tradition of hunkering down into endless debate and hand-wringing while waiting for another firm to make the first move can’t work anymore. We need to build cultures devoted to identifying problems, reaching consensus quickly, and acting decisively on difficult issues.

Tomorrow is here. The moment of truth is arriving. Where is your firm going to land?

# Kamala Harris Tax Returns Show Husband Doug Emhoff’s Biglaw Haul From DLA Piper
## Less than 10 percent of this power couple’s 2018 income came from Harris’s salary as a sitting United States senator.

On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris made 15 years of her tax returns available for public dissection, just in time for tax day 2019. That is pretty cool, and means that [so far she has released more years of personal tax records](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-tax-returns-release_n_5cb37269e4b098b9a2d54e64) than any other 2020 Democratic candidate.

There is a long and important tradition of releasing your tax returns as a presidential candidate, with one big orange exception. A tax return gives voters and commentators an excellent means of assessing a candidate’s sources of income, and in turn, that candidate’s possible biases and conflicts of interest. Senator Harris, a career public servant, not surprisingly got a lot of her personal income over the years from her salary in government positions: as District Attorney of San Francisco, as Attorney General of California, and most recently as a United States senator.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For 2018, Senator Harris also got a big boost in her income from her bestselling ([though not particularly well-reviewed](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/08/681458730/kamala-harris-the-truths-we-hold-demonstrates-what-s-wrong-with-campaign-books)) memoir, “The Truths We Hold.” She reported approximately $733,000 in income last year from her book, but claimed to have paid $412,000 in “commissions and fees” related to the book, for a net writing income of about $320,000. I wonder what those “commissions and fees” were for. Her literary agent? A ghostwriter? Marketing funded by the author? [Her book is published by Penguin Press](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/591562/the-truths-we-hold-by-kamala-harris/9780525560715/), pretty much the most reputable publisher out there, and they’re sure not going to be tacking extra charges on for their authors.

Beyond her writing and her government salary, Senator Harris does not seem to be reporting particularly interesting income streams. That’s probably a good thing for a presidential candidate. A boring tax return is certainly better than a bunch of shady write-offs and unexplained wire transfers from Moscow.

But in 2014, Kamala Harris got married to DLA Piper litigator [Doug Emhoff](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/e/emhoff-douglas-c/), and DAMN. The happy couple started filing joint returns, and their collective income from 2014 on was through the roof. Last year, Mr. Emhoff’s income as a DLA Piper partner and from his prior law firm, Venable, impressively totaled [approximately $1.5 million](https://apnews.com/7f506fc56d4b48ba8699bb3dccc75606?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP&utm_campaign=SocialFlow).

Together, Ms. Harris and Mr. Emhoff [had an adjusted gross income of $1,889,156 and an effective tax rate of 37 percent in 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/14/us/politics/2020-candidates-tax-returns.html). That is the most income and the highest tax rate out of the entire Democratic field so far.

Mr. Emhoff is certainly doing well for himself and his family, although only moderately well by DLA Piper standards. Profits per equity partner [were $1.87 million in 2018](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/03/05/dla-piper-boosted-revenues-profits-again-in-2018/). I suppose it says something about America that less than 10 percent of this power couple’s 2018 income — [about $157,000](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-harris/democratic-presidential-candidate-kamala-harris-releases-15-years-of-tax-returns-idUSKCN1RQ0BO) — came from Harris’s salary as a sitting United States senator.

The latest available [figures from the U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/09/highest-median-household-income-on-record.html) show median annual income for an American household at around $61,372. Ms. Harris’s household income is more than 30 times the national median. But at least she’s being transparent about where all that cash has been coming from. And come on, [her and her husband are adorable](https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/a25905360/kamala-harris-husband-douglas-emhoff/). There’s something compelling about a lawyer couple with a combined annual income well into the seven figures having a simple courthouse wedding. It’s also nice in a refreshingly uncreepy way that their age difference is only seven days.

At this point in the game, it is entirely possible that the first First Gentleman could be a well-to-do Biglaw attorney. As that plays out, we’ll all be eagerly awaiting the release of tax returns from another candidate, Mayor Pete, the only Millennial thus far in the running for 2020. Perhaps then we’ll get to learn more about the income of [another possible First Gentleman: Pete Buttigieg’s husband Chasten Glezman](https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a26854696/pete-buttigieg-husband-chasten-glezman/). Mr. Glezman is a reportedly beloved junior high teacher who has probably improved the lives of dozens (maybe hundreds) of young Americans. I’m guessing we’re going to be very underwhelmed though when we get a peek at Mr. Glezman’s contribution to his household income compared to Mr. Emhoff’s. I suppose it says even more about America that so many of us have no problem with that.

# The Etymology Of 'Molotov Cocktail' And Related Issues

Three things:

Thing one: Lawyers were arrested in New York last week for throwing a [Molotov cocktail at a police patrol car](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-new-york-molotov-cocktail-attack/). If you had any sense, you’d be asking, “Why do they call those things ‘Molotov cocktails’?”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Good news: You’ve come to the right place.

[Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov) was the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs at the start of World War II. Molotov and the German Foreign Minister, [Joachim von Ribbentrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_von_Ribbentrop), signed the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact — the [Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact) — on August 23, 1939, which permitted World War II to start with the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. A couple of months later, the Soviets invaded Finland. The Soviets insisted that they weren’t bombing Finland, but rather were distributing humanitarian food parcels to help their starving neighbors. The Finns dubbed the bombs “Molotov bread baskets” and created a drink to accompany the food parcels: “[Molotov cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail).”

Thing two: [Joe Alioto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Alioto) was the mayor of San Francisco from 1968 to 1976. I tried a case with Joe in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1992. We were sitting in a hotel room in St. Paul when the Rodney King verdict was announced and the riots started.

Alioto rarely mentioned his time as mayor. Watching the rioting on television, he shook his head and started talking wistfully: “Damn fools. When Martin Luther King was shot in 1968, every mayor in America was saying, ‘Stay calm.  Don’t riot.’ So there were riots all across America. I got into a police car, stuck my head up through the sun roof, and shouted through a megaphone, ‘The murderers can’t win! Come to City Hall tomorrow at noon and protest with me!’ We had no riots and a huge protest the next day. When will they ever learn?”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I flashed back to that moment with the death of George Floyd. Most public officials said, “Stay calm. Don’t riot.” So they got riots. Only a very few said, “This is an outrage! Come protest with me!”

As Joe Alioto (may he rest in peace) said some 30 years ago: Damn fools.  When will they ever learn?

Thing three: Corporations around the world are telling managers to reach out to people of color and offer the support that’s appropriate in times like this. I, at least, find that working from home makes that a more difficult task.  Chatting with people by the water cooler is easy; any topic can come up. But affirmatively raising sensitive issues by telephone or Zoom is far more difficult. In group settings — a meeting of everyone in a small department, for example — one can say during a Zoom call that the Magnificent Mile was filled with shattered glass on Tuesday and boarded up like a war zone on Wednesday; what’s happening near you? That could start an appropriate conversation about how we can’t let the message of racial injustice be lost in the aftermath of looting. But it’s harder in individual calls.

Working from home has many advantages, but it doesn’t encourage meaningful discussions with co-workers.

# Business Development For Women Lawyers: Strategies For Success
## Learn about effective business development approaches for women lawyers from senior legal recruiters at a virtual event organized by the Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles.

The current legal landscape — like the economy as a whole — is uncertain. 2022 was a [moderately down year](https://laterallink.com/2023-am-law-100-rankings-a-comprehensive-breakdown/) for major law firms, as compared to the industry’s [remarkable 2021 boom](https://laterallink.com/a-detailed-breakdown-of-the-2022-am-law-100-rankings%EF%BF%BC/). With firms bracing for what could be a challenging period, adopting effective approaches to business development will be more critical than ever.

This is especially true for women lawyers. Even in smoother economic climates, women confront particular challenges in business development and career advancement in the legal industry. In many practice groups, there remains a lack of female role models for successful business development. Strategies that have traditionally worked well for many male partners don’t always feel authentic and comfortable for women attorneys. More broadly, women often find that they must advocate more actively to receive origination credit and to receive fair consideration for equity partnership and for practice and office leadership positions.

For women associates and counsels, learning how successful women partners approach business development can be eye opening. The transition to being responsible for developing business is a hard one to navigate for any lawyer. After years of focusing on the practice of law and becoming a highly competent attorney, it can be jarring to confront the reality that legal skills are no longer enough. The discomfort can be compounded for associates and counsels whose practice group leadership is heavily male. Mentorship from female leaders in the profession—including those outside your firm—is often invaluable. When it comes to developing business, there is no one-size-fits-all method for success. Exposing yourself to a diversity of styles and strategies can help you identify and pursue an approach that resonates with your personality, practice, and goals.

For women partners, the business development learning curve doesn’t stop. You have already received a vote of confidence in your ability to bring in clients, but delivering on that potential by growing a solid book of business requires targeted strategies. Business development success is key to increasing compensation, making the jump from non-equity to equity partner, or executing a successful lateral move to a more desirable firm.

On May 24, a [virtual event](https://wlala.org/event/strategies-for-success-in-business-development/) organized by the Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles (WLALA) Business Law Section will offer actionable advice for women lawyers interested in successful business development strategies. The program will address strategies for success for every woman lawyer: associate, counsel, junior partner, and senior partners leading groups. The moderated discussion will feature three senior legal recruiters, including [Susan Agopian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanagopian/) and [Gloria Sandrino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gloriasandrino/) of Lateral Link.

Themes that Susan and Gloria will emphasize include the need for women lawyers to be intentional about business development and the fact that “business development” is “client development” — one client at a time. Focusing on individual clients is a must in today’s legal industry.

After decades of working closely with partners and associates at the highest levels of the profession, Susan and Gloria are well-attuned to what it takes to develop business as a lawyer. Business development planning is central to the partner lateral recruiting process, with candidates expected to present a compelling case for how they will bring clients to their new firm. So Susan and Gloria regularly discuss business development strategy in detail with successful partners — including many women — at a wide spectrum of top law firms. In addition, Gloria brings her perspective of a decade spent practicing M&A in NYC and Miami.

If you are interested in joining the conversation on May 24, please get your [tickets here](https://wlala.org/event/strategies-for-success-in-business-development/). Note that the session is free for WLALA members!

Dearest readers, Above the Law is excited to introduce a new “advice” column, entitled “Review and Revert.” Here’s your chance to ask a partner to “review and revert,” for a change, instead of the other way around.

D.W. Randolph, an Am Law 100 law firm partner and practice leader, and author of the acclaimed “tell-all” book and resource guide to all things Biglaw, entitled [Big Law Confidential](https://amzn.to/3Ky6OkT) (affiliate link), will be answering your questions about any and all things Biglaw.

Wondering what it really takes to make partner? Want advice on how to handle a tricky situation with a colleague? Make a mistake and aren’t sure what to do next? Send your questions in to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Review%20and%20Revert) (subject line: Review and Revert) and get answers!

# What Does The Future Hold For Litigation Finance? The 2019 Survey Report
## Will the industry's growth trajectory continue?

Litigation finance is booming. In fact, more than 40 percent of respondents to [our recent survey](http://bit.ly/2Ugp3nq) have firsthand experience with the practice, and 4 out of 5 in that experienced group would recommend it to peers and colleagues. No longer the province of a limited number of innovators and early adopters, litigation finance has undergone momentous growth and is now firmly established as a means of not only funding under-resourced plaintiffs, but for any plaintiff, including large corporates who want to hedge risk, utilize off-balance-sheet financing, or raise capital for other expenses. But what does the future of litigation finance hold?

Our survey, conducted together with our friends at [Lake Whillans](http://bit.ly/2RwCSZG), aimed at capturing the perspective of litigators and in-house counsel regarding the current state and future direction of the litigation finance industry. Nearly 400 practitioners shared their insights, and our findings reveal some surprising and thought-provoking insights into such forward-looking questions as:

- Will litigation finance’s growth trajectory continue?
- Will portfolio financing be the biggest driver of growth for litigation finance?
- Which is the bigger threat to the future of the industry — market saturation or burdensome disclosure requirements?
- And much more…

# MoFo's Attempt To Play Hard Ball With Gender Discrimination Plaintiff Fails
## The judge acted quickly on this motion.

Even if you haven’t been obsessing over the recent spate of gender discrimination lawsuits filed against Biglaw firms like I have, you’ve probably still heard about the $100 million [gender discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/) case against Morrison & Foerster. At [this point](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/more-plaintiffs-added-to-astonishing-pregnancy-and-gender-discrimination-case-against-mofo/), [seven plaintiffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit-against-mofo-spirals-and-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/) have come forward alleging that when they got pregnant and took leave at the firm they were placed on the “mommy track” from which their careers at the firm couldn’t recover.

Last week, Above the Law [reported on MoFo’s latest legal ploy](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/mofo-files-for-sanctions-against-firm-plaintiff-suing-them-for-gender-discrimination/) — they filed a motion for sanctions against one of the plaintiffs, Jane Doe 4, and Sanford Heisler Sharp, the firm representing the plaintiffs alleging the claims brought by that plaintiff were “knowingly baseless.” Doe 4 was terminated by the firm while she was eight months pregnant, and, in order to take her planned leave and benefits, she signed a release of claims against the firm when she left. MoFo argued the fact that Doe 4 negotiated the terms of her exit from the firm should bar her claims, and be the basis of sanctions, while Sanford Heisler argued Doe 4, as the primary breadwinner for her family and planning on taking the leave the firm’s policy provides, was economically coerced into signing the agreement.

The move sure seemed like an… [interesting one from a public relations standpoint](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/biglaw-continues-to-struggle-with-gender-equity/), even if they were ultimately successful on the merits. Yesterday, the magistrate judge overseeing the case, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, dismissed the sanctions motion, finding the plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded Doe 4 signed the agreement under economic duress.

It was a pretty quick victory for plaintiffs, but as [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/18/judge-puts-an-early-end-to-mofos-sanction-request-in-gender-bias-lawsuit/) by Law.com, Judge Scott Corley warned them not to turn around and file their own motion for sanctions based on MoFo’s unsuccessful motion for sanctions:

But U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the Northern District of California, who was hearing arguments on a separate set of motions in the case Thursday, found that the Jane Doe plaintiff could sufficiently allege that she faced economic duress when signing the release about a month before her planned maternity leave. However, at the same time she denied Morrison & Foerster’s sanctions motion, Corley instructed lawyers at Sanford Heisler not to bring their own retaliatory motion against Morrison & Foerster.

“We’re just going to stop and move forward,” said Corley regarding the sanctions motions.

But the legal battle continues. As Judge Scott Corley noted at the hearing, the identities of the seven plaintiffs may well have to be revealed if the case goes forward.

# From Great Recession To Great Resignation To What?
## So why are people quitting? A survey of HR professionals found a number of reasons. Heading the list is, no surprise, compensation.

We all lived through the Great Recession of a decade or so ago, but now there’s the “Great Resignation,” people who have adapted the old Johnny Paycheck tune of “Take This Job and Shove It,” and fashioned it into a more genteel way of saying “I quit.” Fueled by the pandemic that seems to have no end (thanks to all those who refuse vaccinations for whatever the reasons) the working landscape is changing — probably forever.

There are a number of ways in which to part company with your employer. There is “[rage-quitting](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210903-why-rage-quitting-is-all-the-rage-this-year?utm_source=join1440&utm_medium=email).” That may be a good idea, maybe not. I am a believer in not burning any bridges, because even though there are lots and lots of lawyers, we talk, and word gets around, both good and bad. If you have a safe place to land, another job, severance, unemployment insurance, then quitting may be okay. Just be careful when you walk out the door. My client had employees who changed their minds after quitting, and the client’s response was always “too late, resignation accepted, no do-overs.”

So why are people quitting? A survey of HR professionals found a number of reasons. Heading the list is, no surprise, compensation. Close behind is the desire for better work/life balance. Then come better benefits, better advancement opportunities, and what is called “COVID clarity,” that is, deciding [how to spend your life](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-news/pages/deconstructing-the-great-resignation.aspx) and what you really want out of a job. It’s not necessarily easy to figure that last one out, but the past 18 months or so have provided the opportunity to decide who and what are important in your life and how to make the most of what you have and what you want.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
To that end bravo to this firm for reducing billable requirements to [create a semblance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/sanford-heisler-reduced-billables/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=157948897&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8vpr4QcZH7H7sLHAVrCv16IDmH1malP3bIYToYtM9TJg7MQx6i86BJWYfuFHR2AejjWZyJqFFP-sfnVnxd0GsIBn9VNA&utm_content=157948897&utm_source=hs_email) of work/life balance.

Perhaps this will be the start of a trend? Since law firms tend to be like sheep in terms of running together and not breaking out of the pack, once one firm does it and sees the value in retention and satisfaction, maybe others will start to think about it. If fixed expenses such as rent and other items are reduced going forward due to the pandemic and the subsequent need for less space, then maybe there will be an easing of the billable hours requirement elsewhere.

And perhaps another chink in the hours race is Judge Charles Breyer’s order in the McKinsey MDL litigation [telling law firms to give associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/federal-judge-orders-associates-not-to-work-over-the-holidays/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=157948897&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6wCWGEsjNcFHW2qG7DCJmfXzBm7Wq7JIKs-Mm9UZWvqhMIyp3PVicKojMhGH9GQeid2tjJDzQ46mwjKD_MjufpBVwOw&utm_content=157948897&utm_source=hs_email) a break over the Christmas holiday. Bravo!

I’ve heard way too many stories, usually told with pride, about how many hours associates worked, (e.g., into the night and next day). I can’t believe that the work product doesn’t suffer. Working all those hours doesn’t seem like a badge of honor to me. I worked my share of late-night hours, but after a certain number, I knew I wasn’t as sharp after all those hours. (And this was when I was way younger; no comments, please.)

There are many reasons for why peeps participate in the Great Resignation. It’s not just work overload, but it’s also a sense that the work is not meaningful, that what one does at work does not really matter (tell that to an associate working on discovery responses). It’s also [not receiving the emotional support](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/great-resignation-work-meaning-esther-perel.html) that tells any lawyer or staff that what they are doing does indeed matter. It’s hard to think about meaning with student loans, family, and other personal obligations, but it is that meaning that can make the difference between someone staying and someone going. How many managers ask employees what they like or don’t like about their jobs? Do they see jobs, or do they see careers? How many managers ask what the future looks like? How many managers ask about how their families are doing? We forget that attorneys and staff are not robots, but people.

I watched the movie “[Worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worth_(film))” on Netflix. What the value of a life? Based on Kenneth Feinberg’s work as the special master for the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund ([his book is fascinating](https://www.amazon.com/What-Life-Worth-Compensate-September-ebook/dp/B002EF2AI4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2XH8YHGKWCBTS&dchild=1&keywords=kenneth+feinberg+what+is+life+worth)), how do you value a life? What are the considerations? Purely economics or are there other factors to be considered? Is a hedge fund manager’s life worth more in economic terms than a member of FDNY? More than a chef at Windows on the World? More than a custodian? On this Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, a rabbi reminds us that we are [more than our jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/12/opinion/yom-kippur-forgiveness.html?mc_cid=c0e744fc8c&mc_eid=296a2a498e). So, how do you put a value on what and who are meaningful to you? The movie shows that after 9/11 everyone worked together in that tragic time. What a concept.

And lastly, because I love snark, the sports segment of the all-news radio station here in LA used to have a weekday afternoon feature called the “Athlete Arrest of the Day.” I am co-opting the title to call mine the “Judicial Misconduct of the Week.”

The California Commission on Judicial Performance has publicly admonished LA Superior Court Judge Michael O’Gara for his comments on both Facebook and Twitter. The discipline order includes [screen shots](https://cjp.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2021/09/OGara_DO_Pub_Adm-_9-14-2021.pdf) of both sites.

The judge deleted his Twitter account and removed himself from a particular Facebook group. The commission thought a public admonishment would suffice. After reading his social media contained in the commission’s findings, would it be malpractice to not move to disqualify him on any case you now or in the future have in front of him? Just asking.

# Law Firm Associates Don't Know When Their Jobs Will Start, And Some Have Had Offers Rescinded

Do you have a job at a law firm, but you’re unsure of when you’ll be starting — or if you’ll be starting at all?

You’re not the only one.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Half of law firm offices with incoming first-year associates haven’t announced their official start dates. For offices that have announced start dates, 62 percent of them won’t be onboarding their incoming associates until January 2021. On top of that, 49 percent of law schools noted that some of their graduates had employment offers rescinded, with 85 percent of those schools reporting that those reneged job offers came from private practice firms.

This information comes from a [new survey](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/PressReleases/NALP_PULSE2_surveys_PressRel_July2020.pdf) by the National Association for Law Placement (NALP) of 356 law firm offices and 167 law school career services offices, and it means that hundreds upon hundreds of recent law school graduates have been left out in the cold when it comes to the start of their careers in the legal profession. Thanks a bunch, COVID-19.

This time around, Biglaw firms are not wholly to blame for the rescinded offers. Per NALP Executive Director James Leipold, those have been “rare” and have mostly come from smaller law firms. Biglaw firms remember what happened after they decimated the ranks of their younger associate classes during the Great Recession, and don’t want to face another shortgage of midlevels in a few years down the line. Here’s some additional detail from [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/07/15/incoming-law-firm-associates-unsure-when-their-jobs-will-start/):

“There’s a lot of uncertainty right now,” said … Leipold. “The bar exam is a moving target—even jurisdictions that have made decisions [about when to administer the exam] have had to make second and third decisions as the virus surges. So law firms are trying to plan start dates around when they can get licensed lawyers.” …

“The other piece of the puzzle is the uncertainly about the volume of work, and wanting current associates to have the work now,” Leipold said. “It seems that most firms that have deferred start dates have provided some sort of stipend—not a salary obviously—but some monetary compensation to help tide incoming associates over until January.”

To that end, 69 percent of offices that have deferred start dates for first-year associates are offering a stipend or other cash payment as part of the deferral package. As for the other 31 percent of offices that have deferred start dates for first-years without providing some sort of assistance, allowing incoming associates to financially struggle during a pandemic sure is a nice welcome.

NALP will send out another survey to law firms and law schools at the end of July. With layoffs at hand, wonder what the employment scene will look like then…

# Biglaw Firm Matches Cravath... But Are They Cutting Associate Compensation While No One's Looking?

[Simpson Thacher](http://www.stblaw.com) is matching this year’s [Cravath’s bonus structure](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/). That’s not particularly surprising. STB always joins the critical mass. Even the one year they tried to [kick off the bonus season](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/) and [got one-upped](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/), they eventually adjusted bonuses to match the consensus.

The point is no one thought Simpson would short their associates on the bonus front. But when you dig a little deeper — behind what most lawyers bother to notice — the firm is reducing associate compensation elsewhere.

But first, the bonuses. The amounts, as discussed, are standard:

High-deductible plans are always troubling because they bring indirect discrimination into the system. They take away all the advantages of joining a risk pool and shunt responsibility for the downside risk back onto those who actually need the help. A naturally healthy family gets to pocket more money than the one with a poor kid suffering from some nagging childhood disorder. Or, say, a young and healthy associate who develops a rare heart condition suddenly pays a hefty chunk more because they lost the lottery of fate.

But high-deductible plans are generally cheaper, so younger associates tend to like them without thinking through the implications. However, there’s more here than meets the eye. From a tipster:

Next year, we will shift from a zero-deductible plan to a high-dedictable plan, but associates will still need to pay a slightly increased premium. The firm will be saving tons on it’s contribution to the premium (several hundred per person per month)

That’s a rare combination — higher deductible and a higher premium! Obviously the premium overall is reduced under a higher-deductible plan, but it looks like Simpson is shifting more of the contribution onto associates — reportedly to the tune of roughly halving the firm contribution — resulting in higher out-of-pocket payments for the employees. Fantastic!

In 2017, the semi-monthly employee contributions for the basic health plan — that did not sport the high deductible — were $172.62 for singles, $379.76 for couples, $310.71 for the employee and a child, and $474.70 for a family. Next year it will be $181.48, $399.24, $326.66, and $499.06. That’s not a tremendous increase, but that’s a couple hundred bucks out of pocket every year for decidedly less coverage than the employees got in 2017. And, obviously, without considering that everyone now has to save for the possibility of paying a big deductible.

One of my editorial colleagues brushed off this concern by reminding me that Simpson associates are still making healthy salaries and can afford this modest dig into their semi-monthly paychecks. There’s some truth to that, of course. But lawyers don’t have as much disposable income after servicing their law school debt as their advertised salary might suggest.

And the point remains that reducing associate compensation, by whatever amount, matters in the fiercely competitive world of Biglaw recruiting. The firms have taken such pains to be able to advertise to recruits that “we’re all the same” when it comes to compensation. But underneath the sticker price of a $180K salary, the firms do have distinctions.

Law students and associates should be cognizant of the role health insurance pays in their compensation. Because that’s exactly where a savvy firm will try to futz with comp.

# Earth's Highest-Grossing Law Firm Increases Associate Salaries
## Congratulations to associates on this firm's planet-wide success!

It’s official! Latham & Watkins, the [highest-grossing law firm in the country](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) — which also happens to be the [highest-grossing law firm in the world](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-global-100-the-worlds-top-law-firms-ranked-by-revenue-profit-and-headcount/) — has matched Cravath’s new salary scale. This isn’t your standard match, however. This worldwide powerhouse is Lathaming the competition, if you will, by matching Cravath’s new salary scale on a nearly worldwide basis.

Latham is increasing salaries for associates in America (Boston, Century City, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, New York, Orange County, San Diego, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Washington, D.C.), England (London), the Middle East (Riyadh, Dubai), and China (Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong), as well as in Japan (Tokyo) for U.S.- and U.K.-qualified associates. Unfortunately, it seems as though associates in Latham’s other European and Asian outposts (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Singapore, and Spain) have been left out of the celebration. If this is incorrect, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Latham%20Worldwide%20Match) and let us know.

Salary bumps will hit paychecks across the globe on July 15 for those who are paid on a bi-weekly basis, and at the end of July for those who are paid monthly. If your firm is hesitant to announce nationwide salary increases, you may want to let the know that Latham just announced global salary increases. That ought to give the partners in charge of compensation a polite nudge in the right direction.

UPDATE (5:30 p.m.): The firm has announced that all summer associates will receive Latham’s salary bump. The announcement was made at the firm’s summer academy. Congrats!

Congratulations to all Latham associates who will see extra cash in their accounts!

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

You’ve been practicing law for almost 25 years. You’ve worked at a prestigious Biglaw firm for more than a decade, and for many of those years, you’ve served as a partner. You’re tired of what you’re doing, and you’ve had enough. You’ve decided to retire, and you want to go out with a bang. For most lawyers, fine wines are but a momentary escape from the drudgery of Biglaw, but for you, fine wines sound like an absolutely fabulous new career move.

Meet [David S. Wolin](https://web.archive.org/web/20151116162902/http://www.skadden.com/professionals/david-s-wolin), who until very recently was a partner at Skadden Arps. Last Thursday, he sent out a firmwide email with his new contact information, noting:

After 12 years at Skadden and almost 25 years of practicing the CMBS and real estate finance, I am moving on. For a glimpse of my post–Skadden life, click on the following [link](https://youtu.be/66s1f5jmd1I). Feel free to like and share the video.

For anyone under 40, you may want to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umS3XM3xAPk) first for context.

Wolin’s leaving Manhattan for life in the countryside. Watch his fantastic departure video here, which is set to the theme song from [Green Acres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Acres), a sitcom that aired from 1965 to 1971 and featured a couple who moved from New York City to a country farm:


If you’re interested, Wolin would love to see you at [Old York Cellars](http://www.oldyorkcellars.com/). It’s open seven days a week, all year long. Call 908-284-WINE to set up an appointment for a tasting today.

# No, You Are Not Matching The Market: 1st Years To $180K Doesn't Tell The Whole Story
## Just because first year associates are making $180,000 doesn't mean everyone is happy.

The legal industry is having a moment. Firms across the country are rushing to raise associate salaries — the first raise in nearly a decade — leaving a perceived prestige gap between those firms that have matched the so-called Cravath or MoneyLaw scale. So if you are a partner in a firm that doesn’t have the financials, or the will of the partnership, to meet the new market scale, what are you to do?

A lot of firms are gaming the perception folks have by raising first-year associate salaries to the much ballyhooed $180,000 but putting the screws to the more senior folks. Take, for example, Reed Smith. Though they are not the first, nor will they be the last to employ this tactic, we sure have heard a lot of complaints from their associates. Last week they [announced raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-does-right-by-junior-associates-mid-levels-and-senior-associates-not-so-much/) to first- and second-year associates to $180,000 and $190,000 respectively in major markets, but left the rest of the associates twisting in the “merit-based raises” wind. The reaction was immediate from the associates given the cold shoulder, and they were confident, consistent with past practices, they would be victims of compression, meaning their base salaries wouldn’t match the announced Cravath scale.

As one tipster noted:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I would suggest putting significant pressure on Reed Smith to address the issues of only guaranteeing first and second year increases and not addressing comp for third years and above. By only addressing first and second year comp, the mid level and seniors view the move as the firm obviously only being concerned with recruiting efforts and not retaining the quality level of experience of skill throughout the mid level and senior associates.

Salary compression is a very real issue, and firm management needs to address the issue. Firm associates are highly frustrated.

This tipster is very right — throwing out the $180,000 number seems to end the compensation inquiry for a lot of people. Take this [law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/06/23/reed-smith-raises-salaries-matching-180k-in-some-markets/) article which discusses the firm’s raise of first year salaries as part of the general trend of increasing associate compensation, without any mention of mid-level and senior associates’ compensation. The firm is even quoted in the piece, claiming the raises will “attract[] and retain[]” quality associates:

“These changes are aimed at attracting and retaining the strongest talent to provide the highest level of service to our clients,” the statement said. “As always, we look forward to providing the highest and best level of talent and service to our clients and believe that these changes will continue to enable us to do so.”

As we approach recruiting season, certainly the move will attract attention from rising 2Ls, but a word of caution. Make sure you thoroughly investigate the compensation structure of any firm you decide to summer at. There is a lot of data out there about every possible firm, and it is important you really understand whether you’ll be making market compensation as a third- or fourth- year. You don’t want to wind up bitterly calculating all the money you left on the table for turning down an offer from a rival firm that pays market salary for all associates just because you thought the managing partner had stinky breath during your interview. And a special warning for laterals, just because you make market salary when you lateral over, it isn’t a guarantee that will last forever, or even another year.

A lot of the stock imagery we employ here at Above the Law is hackneyed on purpose. We put gavels and scales and federal reporters everywhere because we know they’re cliché. But some law firms just don’t get it and keep advertising themselves with the same boring imagery.

And that’s a shame, because sticking with the old standbys robs firms of an opportunity to strengthen their own brand. This fun video from Fishman Marketing runs through some of the laziest firm website designs out there and contrasts them with some of the best, most innovative examples of law firm marketing.

# ATL’s Innovation Interrogatory: Dean Boeschen Of Husch Blackwell
## ‘The only thing innovation really requires is the courage to look at things a different way.’

Ed. note: This is the latest installment of [The Innovation Interrogatories](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-atl-interrogatories/) series, brought to you by Lake Whillans Capital Partners. This recurring feature will highlight insights and experiences around ongoing innovation efforts at law firms.

What is driving law firms to create the CINO position, or positions like it?  

The business model of a law firm is not hard to understand. There are relatively few levers available to drive organic growth, especially during the downturn that was dominated by lower demand and extreme sensitivity around fees. While the current outlook has improved in that regard, being able to provide clients with the highest levels of service while remaining profitable remains a challenge, particularly for those firms outside of the 20 or 30 most profitable.

Innovation is one way to give the clients a different look. Allowing us to drive efficiencies and deploy our talent on higher-end complex work, while providing clients with measurable value; however, left on its own, innovation rarely happens at the time and place of our choosing. In order for innovation to be directed toward real-world business objectives, you have to take a more intentional approach, and that requires an administration structure that can harness and focus a firm’s efforts.

What objectives you are trying to meet?  What is the biggest problem you are trying to solve?

The objectives for innovation must align with the mission of the law firm, which is to say, innovation needs to be part of the client experience, satisfaction and value. So for us at Husch Blackwell, we frame the question by looking at it from the client’s perspective — how does the client benefit from the technology and tools that we create and implement? If you get that part right — if the answer to that question is easy to get your head around — then you can pivot to all those challenges that come from developing new services or products and making them profitable.

Can you identify an under-hyped (or at least relatively overlooked) technology or trend that will eventually have a significant impact on the delivery of legal services?

One area that I would not have thought, even a few months ago, would be trending is chatbots.  While they’re great for certain functions (I’m thinking troubleshooting on a bank’s website), I thought they would be of limited use inside a firm.  Maybe I am still recovering from Clippy (Word’s paperclip chatbot). Or, I still think of that SNL skit with the older folks trying to get information out of Alexa “Silver,” created for the “greatest generation.”  Its main feature was it was super loud and responded to any name remotely close to Alexa (Alaina, Allegra, Aretha, Alisha, Alfonzo, Aldis, Arashel, Excederin… you get the idea).

However, with the new AI functionality available now and the ability to connect all of our systems and provide staff and attorneys with a one stop shop for information and automation, I see this area taking off quickly. I expect this trend will continue to grow and find new avenues in the delivery of legal services.

Innovation and technology are often conflated. To what degree does the “innovation” imperative at law firms extend beyond technological solutions?

Technology is often necessary to innovation, but hardly sufficient, and there is a lot of innovation that we can drive in the legal industry today that has very little to do with the development or application of new technology. The only thing innovation really requires is the courage to look at things a different way. Take for instance Legal Project Management — while technology is clearly involved, it is more about planning the work, working the plan, communicating regularly with stakeholders, and doing a postmortem review. We have also developed an internal vetting protocol to attack our innovative ideas, draft initial business plans, and test prototypes with clients. A certain amount of courage is required to break away from old ways of doing things and not being afraid to fail, but if you have the right talent in place and ask the right questions, that courage is a little easier to come by.

Is litigation finance an innovation that you’ve considered?  If no, why not? If yes, in what ways do you think it will help meet your innovation goals?

We are very creative when it comes to alternative fee arrangements and work to partner with our clients to help share risks but have not found the right opportunity to venture into litigation financing.

One of the biggest law firms in the world, Dentons, will have to defends its compliance with money laundering regulations in the United Kingdom in front of a Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) [announced ](https://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/solicitor-check/447523/)they are pursuing allegations against the Biglaw firm.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/dentons-accused-anti-money-laundering-failures) Roll on Friday:

The tribunal confirmed that “there is a case to answer in respect of allegations” which include the “failure” by Dentons “while acting for a politically exposed person or his associated entities between approximately May 2013 and June 2017, to take adequate measures to establish the client’s source of wealth and/or funds”.

The regulators allege violations of “failing to comply with its legal and regulatory obligations, run the business effectively in accordance with proper governance and sound financial and risk management principles and failed to comply with anti-money laundering legislation.”

A spokesperson for Dentons said, “Dentons has co-operated fully with the SRA throughout this investigation, which relates to a former client, and we will continue to do so. As a Firm we are committed to strict compliance with all laws, regulations and professional standards of the jurisdictions we operate in.”

# Paralegals And Confidentiality: Interactive Program Covers The Fundamentals
## PLI is offering a one-hour interactive program to help paralegals meet their legal obligations and build trust with attorneys and clients.

Paralegals play a critical role in the ecosystem of most law firms and legal organizations, often handling some of the most crucial aspects of any case or matter, even if they’re far from the spotlight. 

Like other members of legal teams, paralegals must follow principles of confidentiality. Too often, though, the paralegal’s role and attendant obligations are overlooked in legal training and professional development.

To address this dynamic, PLI is offering a one-hour interactive program, [Confidentiality for Paralegals](https://www.pli.edu/programs/confidentiality-for-paralegals?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), designed to give paralegals a solid introduction to the fundamentals of confidentiality that will help them meet their legal obligations and build trust with attorneys and clients. 

Offered in webinar format, this program will present a real-time, online discussion among paralegals and PLI faculty that will explore best practices for communicating important issues in client privacy, confidentiality, and privilege. These discussions will be enhanced by a multimedia presentation illustrating key concepts in areas including: 

- The difference between client confidentiality, privilege, and privacy
- The major types of client confidentiality challenges that arise for paralegals and legal assistants in law offices and in-house legal departments
- Methods and tools to prevent paralegals from breaching client confidentiality, waiving client privilege, or violating client privacy
- How to avoid unintentional disclosure
- How to identify client confidentiality policies and procedures
- How privacy concerns inform client choices 
- Who the client is when you represent an organization
- Exceptions to disclosure rules
Developed by the learning design experts with PLI’s [Interactive Learning Center](https://www.pli.edu/link/101e6d5b8e454b23902aef541596996b.aspx), the program features a high level of engagement and attendee participation. The program is ideal for paralegals, legal assistants, and other legal professionals at any level. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/confidentiality-for-paralegals?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

# Millennial Lawyers: What You Need To Know To Succeed
## You don't have to lose sight of what makes you and your generation different in order to thrive in the law firm setting.

Millennial lawyers: what are we going to do about you? You’re a new breed, and your differing values and priorities have law firm leaders alternating between scratching their heads in confusion and wringing their hands in frustration.

In [my last column](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/what-in-the-world-can-be-done-about-millennial-lawyers/), I had a long talk with managing partners about you and helped them sort out their mixed feelings about — and hopefully gain an appreciation of — your generation. Now it’s your turn. It’s time for some arguably uncomfortable navel-gazing on your part.

Like it or not, the onus doesn’t rest solely with the managing partners; you’ve got to meet them halfway. For now, it’s the only way you’re going to find success within the law firm structure they helped create and that they continue to perpetuate now that they’re members of the ruling class.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Good news! You’ve got someone on your side. It’s Susan Smith Blakely, the author of the recently published book, “[What Millennial Lawyers Want](https://smile.amazon.com/What-Millennial-Lawyers-Want-Practice/dp/1543805310?sa-no-redirect=1).” She’s got lots of ideas to help managing partners understand millennial lawyers — and to help you understand them. So without further ado, here’s what you need to know.

First and foremost, you need to be a team player, even when it’s inconvenient. Partners often complain that you’re not committed and fail to come through when an important deadline is fast approaching. According to Blakely, it’s at times like those when you need to stop making excuses, push up your sleeves, and get to work:

Millennial lawyers…cannot be the team players they claim to be and fail the team. They must understand that when the team needs them, they have to put their shoulders to the wheel and push hard along with everyone else. If they do not become team players, they will not be taken seriously, and they will damage their opportunities for upward mobility.

Next, enough with the need for instant gratification! Sure you grew up online, where instantaneous feedback was the norm, but that’s not how it works in law firms. Similarly, while you may be the most comfortable networking  electronically, there’s something to be said about face-to-face interaction. It’s what your superiors — and most potential clients — are used to. So you need to embrace both online and offline networking. Here’s what Blakely has to say about that:

To gain a healthy perspective, millennial lawyers need to laugh with people and laugh at themselves. They need to get out of their offices, engage in conversation, smile, laugh, and let others get to know them and enjoy their company. If it means escaping their comfort zones, they just need to do it. It will pay premiums in both their personal and professional lives.

And last but not least, take responsibility for seeking out and maintaining relationships with mentors. While mentorship is a two-way street, it benefits you far more than your mentor, so you should take ownership of the relationship. In the book, a millennial lawyer explained why it’s so important for you to take this step:

(W)hen you’re assigned a mentor…(you have to take it upon yourself) to seek out (your) mentor…Because lawyers are so busy, your mentor – unless you have an amazing mentor – is not going to chase after you. So you really have to put effort into maintaining the relationship. (I)t’s really up to the mentee to drive that and seek that out.

In other words, the ball’s in your court. If you want to succeed within the structure of a traditional law firm, then you’re going to have to conform, at least in some ways, to the expectations of your managing partners.

That being said, you bring a lot of valuable resources to the table and the many positive attributes of you and your generation should not be overlooked. Your unique perspective is what sets you apart, but don’t let it drag you down. Instead, use it to your benefit, and use it to change the profession for the better.

You don’t have to lose sight of what makes you and your generation different in order to thrive in the law firm setting. You can undoubtedly succeed on your own terms, within reason. But sometimes you have to play by the rules — at least until you’re in a position to change them.

# Morning Docket: 04.19.17
## * Did anyone really expect Biglaw associates to jump ship so quickly for in-house jobs after the huge raises they got this past summer? According to Michelle Fivel of Major Lindsey & Africa, these days, associates ""have increased standards for what they’re willing to throw their hat into the ring for, mostly based around compensation."" [[Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/913987/associate-pay-hikes-stem-flow-of-lawyers-going-in-house) (sub. req.)] * ""This is so important to us from an income point of view."" Thanks to President Donald Trump's ""America First"" immigration policies, law schools are worrying about whether their cash-cow LL.M. programs will suffer. These programs typically bring in about $350 million each year, so this is definitely something worthy of concern. [[Legal Intelligencer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202783988095/Will-Law-Schools-LLM-Programs-Suffer-from-Trumps-America-First-Stance?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=3&curpage=ALL)] * Texas law school graduates from the class of 2016 performed better in the job market than their classmates who graduated just one year prior. This data comes from the latest employment information gathered by the American Bar Association, which we imagine will be made public soon. How do you think your law school did? [[Houston Chronicle](http://www.chron.com/business/article/Recent-law-grads-doing-better-on-getting-lawyer-11078988.php)] * ""I was honored to be the chair, but there is no requirement for one in the partnership agreement."" Tony Valukas has stepped down as the chair of Jenner & Block, and he doubts anyone will replace him since his title was honorary in nature. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/tony-valukas-steps-down-as-chair-of-jenner-block/)] * Pedro Hernandez, the man who murdered Etan Patz -- the first child to appear on the side of a milk carton -- has been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

Hint: More than three dozen Am Law 200 firms received between $5 and $10 million loans from the government during the coronavirus crisis, and a few are well-known as some of highest-grossing firms in the country.

# Biglaw Probably Won't Be Hemorrhaging Lawyers Via Layoffs Anytime Soon

I think that the last round of layoffs probably reminded them that it’s really hard to bounce back. If the work picks up, it’s really hard to get those associates back quickly and up to speed.

— John Cashman, president of legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, commenting during an interview with [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/number-us-legal-jobs-now-exceeds-pre-great-recession-record-high-2022-07-08/) on whether he thinks Biglaw firms will engage in mass layoffs like they did during the Great Recession if the U.S. goes through another economic downturn. Cashman said that while job growth in the legal sector may slow down, he doesn’t “see the sky falling anytime soon.” According to the U.S. Labor Department, the legal services sector now has more jobs than it did in 2007 when it reached its peak before the Great Recession.

# Only A Handful Of Lawyers At This Firm Support Donald Trump -- And One Of Them Is Rudy Giuliani

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may have thought that having a Biglaw partner serve as one of his top campaign surrogates would have been an ace up his sleeve. Alas, it doesn’t seem like many people at this firm subscribe to the same conservative beliefs — and even if they do, it very well may be Trump who they don’t believe in.

Rudy Giuliani, who left Bracewell & Giuliani this past January to join Greenberg Traurig, where he serves as global chair of the firm’s cybersecurity, privacy, and crisis management practice, isn’t finding himself in good political company at his new firm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/10/03/not-even-rudy-giulianis-partners-at-greenberg-traurig-support-trump/) has the scoop on political donations made by Greenberg lawyers:

According to [campaign contribution data from Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/), individuals employed by Greenberg Traurig have made 186 donations to Hillary Clinton this election cycle. By contrast, five have given to Donald Trump.

Among the top-dollar Clinton supporters: global practice chair James Bacchus, senior chairman Matthew Gorson, technology practice head Alan Sutin and litigation superstar Lori Cohen, who all maxed out at $2,700 apiece in direct contributions. So did 42 other Greenberg lawyers.

It’s not as if the donors are all knee-jerk liberals. Partner Barry Richard, who in 2000 represented George W. Bush in the Florida litigation that determined the presidency, gave Clinton $2,700 on April 27.

In all, Clinton has collected more than $180,000 in direct donations from people at Greenberg Traurig.

Compare that to Trump’s biggest donation from anyone at the firm: $80 from litigation partner Roger Kaplan and another $80 from tax of counsel John Prusiecki. In total, Trump has collected $212 from five Greenberg Traurig employees, according to the most recent reports available.

Greenberg Traurig Executive Chairman Richard Rosenbaum had this to say when asked about Giuliani’s fit as a partner, considering his staunch support for Trump: “We are a law firm and a business delivering excellence and value to our clients, not a political organization. Our family includes strong supporters on both sides of the political aisle and we protect the rights of every individual to live their lives, support candidates and express their views outside the office within all applicable legal and ethical guidelines.”

Right now, Giuliani’s stump speeches for Trump seem like they’re at odds with the firm’s values. After all, Greenberg Traurig says it’s firmly committed to the advancement of women lawyers, and as recently as this week, Giuliani said Trump would be “a lot better for the United States than a woman.” If Trump wins the election, the firm would be positioned quite closely to the White House, but attorneys who work there may find themselves wondering if it’s truly worth it.

# Are Higher Associate Salaries A Death Blow For 'Lifestyle' Law Firms?
## Hopefully their emphasis on work-life balance won't be forced to go the way of the dodo.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Oftentimes small and midsize firms sell themselves to talent as more of a lifestyle option, and they try to recruit on the notion that they’re not Big Law.

Associates come in believing they’re going to have to work less and not hit as high of a number of billable hours. In order for these firms to keep up, they’re going to have to increase billable hour expectations and rates.

— [Kristin Stark](https://fairfaxassociates.com/our-people/kristin-stark/), principal at Fairfax Associates, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/10/did-the-talent-wars-doom-the-lifestyle-firm/), on the fact that salaries at so-called “lifestyle” firms increased so much during the associate talent wars that their work-life balance perks may fade away as they become more like Biglaw in order to remain profitable. As we noted [previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/the-biglaw-salary-wars-increased-first-year-associate-salaries-across-the-legal-profession/), according to NALP, the greatest percentage salary growth from 2021 to 2023 was seen at firms of 100 lawyers or fewer, where median first-year salaries increased by 29.2% ($35,000), from $120,000 to $155,000. At firms of 501-700 lawyers, base salaries for first-years grew by 29% ($45,000), from $155,000 to $200,000.

# The Brain Drain Hasn't Destroyed Biglaw... Yet (NALP 2016)

It’s fun when you go to a panel and somebody says “the media has overstated [something, something],” and [you know that they’re talking about you](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/law-school-brain-drain/). I attended the “Fewer Law School Applications, More Adjustments” panel at NALP 2016, and the subtitle could have been “Convincing Firms Your Grads Aren’t Dumber.”

Unlike a lot of these discussions, firm-side people were there too, and their experience hiring in the market was instructive. The panelists included:

- Susan Krinsky: Associate Dean at Maryland Law and Chair of LSAC
- Don Smith: Director of Attorney Development at Fried Frank
- Sarah Zearfoss: Admissions Dean at Michigan School of Law
- Ann Rainhart: Executive Director at Briggs and Morgan

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It was [Zearfoss](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/sarah-zearfoss/), well known to regular readers of ATL, who said that the media had overstated the impact of the brain drain on law schools.

Speaking for the firms, Smith and Rainhart said that they had not seen a decline in talent heading into their firms. Granted… what the hell were they supposed to say? “Our current first years are mouth breathers, but we needed bodies. Don’t worry, we keep them inside during bad weather so they don’t drown when it’s raining.” But their overall posture was that there was still enough “top” talent out there to fill their incoming classes.

And that view was backed up by many firm-side people at the conference. If you are a Biglaw firm or a respected regional firm or boutique, there are enough people at the top that you can still fill your class without having to truck with the kinds of students who wouldn’t have gotten into law school 15 years ago. But the school-side people noted that part of the story is that those Biglaw summer classes are so much smaller than they used to be, and firms that used to interview the top 20 percent of a school’s class are now hiring only from the top 10 percent. Even Smith noted that a firm like Fried Frank has the ability to tighten up their summer class size should the talent level ever decrease.

Schools benefit from the brain drain because they are able to fill their seats without having to seriously re-imagine the value of legal education. Firms are protected from the brain drain because they are engaging in a flight to quality by hiring only the best students from the best schools. It shouldn’t surprise anybody that the only people hurt by the brain drain are the students themselves. The kids in the bottom 50 percent of their law school classes. The people in the bottom 90 percent of their classes at very low-ranked law schools. The decline in law school applications hasn’t created new job opportunities for people who score poorly on the LSAT, it’s just created new debt opportunities for those kids.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There were some causes for Biglaw concern. The panel talked about how the percentage of college freshmen who are considering going to law school is way, way down. The issue is not the number of people applying to law schools, it’s the number of people overall who want to be lawyers. The panel also noted that competition for diverse hires is incredibly intense. Smith said “we’ll travel for that,” when talking about schools that produce top diverse students, and that view was echoed throughout the conference. Diverse candidates with the skills and the grades to compete in Biglaw have a lot of options right now.

The panel talked about how the pipeline problem is more of a “marketing” issue with how the legal profession is portrayed. But calling it a marketing issue puts the problem beyond what law schools or law firms can address, and that strikes me as a cop out. It’s a money problem: schools are charging too much, or if you prefer, firms are paying too little to make law school a wise financial risk.

At least, the math isn’t working out for a lot of smart applicants. There will always be a certain number of intelligent, skilled people who just really want to be lawyers. Those people will take the LSAT and go to law school and fill summer classes from Akin Gump to WilmerHale. But for people who could go to law school or business school or get a grad degree or do whatever, law school is simply not an inviting option. It’s too much debt for too uncertain of a payoff that can only be earned by working too many hours.

Pipelines and drains both work because of gravity. Right now, there’s still a mountain of debt that is affecting how people are flowing.

WilmerHale resonated for me not just for its reputation for legal excellence and integrity, track record of success, and dedication to diversity, but equally for its respect for public service, support for meaningful pro bono work, and commitment to the democratic values and principles I have spent my career fighting for. I believe bringing my combination of experiences, skills and knowledge to WilmerHale will give clients facing the most difficult challenges the greatest chance for success. I look forward to collaborating with my new WilmerHale colleagues, among the best in our profession, including some I know well from our days together at the SDNY.

— [Preet Bharara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preet_Bharara), former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, commenting on [his decision to join WilmerHale](https://www.wilmerhale.com/insights/news/20220613-preet-bharara-former-sdny-us-attorney-joins-wilmerhale), a Biglaw firm that currently resides at No. 36 on the Am Law 100. Robert Novick, WilmerHale’s co-managing partner, noted in a [statement](https://www.wilmerhale.com/insights/news/20220613-preet-bharara-former-sdny-us-attorney-joins-wilmerhale) that Bharara is “one of the most public-spirited and dynamic lawyers of his generation,” and that the firm is “thrilled to have Preet on our team.” Bharara will continue his podcast series, [Stay Tuned with Preet](https://cafe.com/stay-tuned-podcast/), and remain in his role as creative director of Cafe at Vox Media.

Maybe this is like “[there’s always money in the banana stand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04SLXwjJvqg)” and associates should try looking for a check sewn into the hat. Or maybe it’s a scavenger hunt! It couldn’t possibly be that an Am Law 100 firm saw its peers giving out tens of thousands in bonuses and decided to make good with a $10 hat and a succulent… right?

Silicon Valley is where technology thrives in the United States, so it only makes sense that law firms with elite intellectual property practices have flocked to the area.

But which IP firm is the largest?

Size matters in the heart of our country’s innovation capitol, especially after a year where lateral movement between firms was fast and furious. Sure, there was a lot of attrition in 2021, but firms were still putting up huge head count numbers thanks to the rapid influx of new associates in the ongoing talent wars.

Without further ado, here are the top five largest IP law firms in Silicon Valley:

- Fenwick & West: 66
- Latham & Watkins: 64
- Morrison & Foerster: 46
- Cooley: 43
- Morgan Lewis & Bockius: 38
Congratulations to Fenwick for once again employing more IP lawyers in Silicon Valley than any other firm.

# Career Advancement In The Legal Profession: Exploring Lateral Moves And Reasons Lawyers Switch Firms
## Discover why career progression motivates attorneys to make lateral moves, switching firms for enhanced partnership opportunities, diversified work, better compensation, and more.

Countless attorneys experience satisfaction with their current law firms. However, a perplexing query often surfaces: “Why shoulder the challenge of starting anew or abandon established relationships?” The primary motivation behind such a decision lies in career progression. Progressive lawyers steering their professional journeys recognize the pitfalls of complacency and strive for career evolution that should be accompanied by amplified satisfaction. Though the present conditions might be conducive, they constantly evaluate – can they improve further elsewhere? Delve into these 12 compelling reasons triggering lateral transitions in law firms and assess whether these circumstances echo your professional situation.

- Aiming for Improved Partnership Opportunities: Often the driving force behind lateral moves in law firms.
- Desiring Less Pressure Towards Partnership: Not everyone aspires to be a partner. An alternate role with reduced up-or-out pressure might be more appealing.
- Craving Substantive Work: Are you prematurely categorized into a specific specialty?
- Seeking Increased Responsibility: Does your firm’s culture overly value hierarchy?
- Yearning for Enhanced Client Interaction and Business Development: Firms have diverse outlooks on associate participation in client development.
- Preference for Diverse Industry Exposure: Are you more inclined towards corporate interaction rather than dealing with financial institutions?
- Choosing Smaller Boutique Law Firms: Particularly among litigators, boutique firms could offer more sustainable hours and smaller, personalized teams.
- Caught in a Demanding Project: Predominantly observed among litigators. Sometimes, a switch to a different firm becomes the only feasible solution!
- Relocating to a New City: Are you contemplating a move to a new market for enriched work exposure or client interaction?
- Incompatibility with Colleagues: The overarching culture of your firm might not align with your personality or career aspirations.
- Eyeing Government or In-House Roles: A lateral transition could pave the way for your dream in-house or government role.
- Striving for Better Compensation: A transition to a firm offering industry-standard or even higher remunerations might be possible.
A skilled legal recruiter can provide valuable insights considering your unique experiences, seniority level, prevailing legal market conditions, and anticipated industry trends. After evaluating your options, you might decide to continue with your present firm. The critical point to remember is: take the reins of your career and professional development. Whether you choose a transition or remain with your present firm, ensure it’s a conscious decision, not a mere default option.

# What Do You Wish You Knew About Biglaw BEFORE You Started?
## The question is: what do associates really think about their firm?

Here at Above the Law we care a lot about increasing transparency at Biglaw firms — that’s why we spend so much time reporting on [bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/associate-bonus-watch-2019/) and [salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) and [benefits](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/). And while reporting on the market standard and leaders will always be a part of our mission, we also want to hear about what it’s like to actually work in the halls of Biglaw.

So, we’re asking our readers to fill out a brief survey about what they wish they knew about their firm before they started working there. We don’t care about the firm’s PR line, but about what associates really feel about the firm. We’ll be integrating the results of the survey into a new transparency project that’ll be launched later this summer.

# This Biglaw Firm Will No Longer Release Its Financial Results To The Media
## Is this a trend in the making?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

As we assess our financial reporting in line with our global peer group, from next year onwards, we will not be releasing financial information to media at this point in the year. … We consider the real sign of the firm’s progress to be based on the quality of business we’ve built and the client mandates we’re winning around the globe.

— [Rick van Aerssen](https://www.freshfields.us/contacts/find-a-lawyer/v/van-aerssen-rick/), managing partner of Freshfields, in a [statement](https://www.freshfields.us/news/2023/07/global-client-demand-drives-further-growth/) given after the global firm announced its latest financial results, which included an 8% increase in revenue to £1.84 billion (~$2.38 billion), as well as a slight increase in its profits per equity partner of 1% to £2.09 million (~$2.7 million). “All financial information which we must release as a matter of law will continue to be available via Companies House in the usual way,” Aerssen said. As noted by the [Global Legal Post](https://www.globallegalpost.com/news/freshfields-to-cease-releasing-financial-data-directly-to-media-1405853057), Freshfields is still likely to submit data to ALM for rankings purposes. International firm Mishcon de Reya [made a similar move](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/this-biglaw-firm-will-no-longer-publish-its-profits-per-equity-partner/) earlier this month, announcing that going forward, the firm will no longer be publishing its profit per equity partner.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

Ed. note: This is the first in a new series on work-life balance. 

For many attorneys, finding “work-life balance” seems about as realistic as catching Bigfoot digging through your trail mix during your next camping trip — and who are we kidding, you don’t have time to go camping.

Thanks to long hours and a demanding culture, finding time for hobbies and family can be a struggle for lawyers, particularly those working within large firms.

Of course, time management has become even harder during the pandemic.

On top of Zoom meetings and increased client demands, your kid might need a snack, the dog might have to go out, and uh, did someone just start a kitchen fire during at-home science class?

Dealing with family and work has “lengthened days and screen time for many,” The American Lawyer [recently reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/12/client-demands-timezones-and-a-corporate-boom-why-attorneys-are-working-longer-and-more-erratic-hours/), with both partners and associates working longer or odder hours.

But even with today’s challenges, there are still ways to reclaim your time.

[At Paragon Legal](https://bit.ly/2RYmczh), we aim to provide both flexibility and high-level legal work, allowing lawyers to finally make work-life balance a reality. And from the client’s perspective, happy lawyers are better positioned to deliver top-quality work than those who are burned out.

In the spirit of helping lawyers of all stripes promote a healthy work-life balance, we bring you some time management tips that busy attorneys can take advantage of.

Do a Time Audit

The first step in understanding where your day is going is to do a time audit.

In her book [Time Smart](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Smart-Reclaim-Your-Happier-ebook/dp/B0842X6L2C), Harvard Business School professor Ashley Whillans recommends keeping a log of how you use your time during a random Tuesday (if you can’t swing Tuesday, pick any other work weekday).

For each activity, Whillans suggests noting how you feel about it, including whether the activity was productive, fun, or purposeful. If an activity made you stressed or unhappy, consider whether you can spend less time on it, Whillans suggests.

If you can’t ditch a task altogether, Whillans asks if you can make it more fun or less stressful. Popping on some music or a podcast can turn dreaded tasks (like logging your time or washing dishes) into something you actually look forward to, for example.

Schedule Focused Time

When you’re constantly reacting to requests and messages, making headway on important projects or goals can feel impossible. You spend all day responding to emails, taking calls, and sitting through meetings, only to look up at 7 p.m. and realize that you didn’t actually get anything done.

To combat this, try scheduling at least an hour every day where you block out distractions and focus on an important, but not urgent, task.

Whillans calls this “proactive time” or “pro-time,” for short. This time period can be used for work projects, personal goals, or even leisure activities that you always put off.

The key is to be disciplined about guarding this time — Whillans recommends blocking off your calendar and shutting out all distractions during pro-time.

Using this period for longer-term projects can also keep deadlines from creeping up on you, allowing you to feel less stressed and more in control.

Use To-Do Lists

Don’t underestimate the power of a simple to-do list: It will help you set priorities for the day and help you stay on track.

Remember to keep your list short and sweet, so you don’t list more tasks than you can actually get done in a day (recommendations for the number of tasks vary, but often run from [three](https://www.fastcompany.com/40521670/these-seven-to-do-list-mistakes-could-be-derailing-your-productivity) to [six](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/02/20/how-to-put-together-a-realistic-to-do-list-every-day/?sh=14a757a819e3)).

Try keeping the list visible, so your priorities stay top-of-mind, even as fresh requests pop up during the day.

You can write your list in a notebook, a planner, a whiteboard, a sticky note, or even a digital app, such as [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) or the Notes app, which has a [checklist feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209365).

An app or notebook also has the benefit of being portable, so no matter where you are, you can write down tasks for future lists.

[Paragon’s mission](https://bit.ly/2RYmczh) is to provide legal professionals with meaningful work outside the traditional path, while delivering the highest quality talent and service to our clients. Stay tuned for more ways to make “work-life” balance more of a reality.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

While the principles for shared governance of the combined firm have been agreed, the specifics will be further developed after the vote as part of the integration process.

— A joint statement from Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/a-o-leaders-will-take-charge-if-shearman-merger-vote-approved), concerning the fact that Allen & Overy’s current leaders, senior partner [Wim Dejonghe](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/people/Wim-Dejonghe) and managing partner [Khalid Garousha](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/people/Khalid-Garousha), will take charge of A&O Shearman if the merger is approved next week. Shearman’s senior partner, [Adam Hakki](https://www.shearman.com/en/people/h/hakki-adam), is expected to play a senior role in the combined firm’s governance, and will sit on its executive committee.

# Law Clerk Mistaken For Attorney, Murdered By Angry Client
## He’d worked for the firm for just under one year’s time, and was considering applying to law school in the future.

Today, we have tragic news out of the Midwest. Last week, in a case of what seems to be mistaken identity, an aspiring lawyer was shot to death while at work. He was the only person in the office at the time, and considering the incredibly brutal nature of the shooting, the death toll may have been even higher had the attorneys he worked for not been at court during the commission of the crime.

Chase Passauer, 23, was a law clerk at [North Star Criminal Defense](http://www.northstarcriminaldefense.com/), a small firm located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Passauer was shot and killed at his desk on Thursday afternoon by Ryan D. Petersen, a disgruntled client of the firm. Passauer was shot six times in the stomach. He’d worked for the firm for just under one year’s time, and noted in his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chase-passauer-129a926) that he was considering applying to law school in the future.

The [Star Tribune](http://www.startribune.com/suspect-in-st-paul-law-office-homicide-arrested-after-chase/375026081/) has some additional details on Passauer’s untimely death:

According to the criminal complaint, Petersen had hired attorney Dan Adkins from the law firm but was “displeased with the way his case was being handled.” He expressed his concerns to Adkins via phone calls and text messages before and on Thursday.

“On the afternoon of April 7, Petersen fired [Adkins] by text message and demanded his money back,” the complaint said. “Petersen expressed a belief that [Adkins] was ignoring his messages.”

Adkins was in court at the time and couldn’t respond to Petersen, according to the complaint.

When Petersen arrived at the law firm, located above St. Paul’s historic W.A. Frost & Company restaurant in the 300 block of Selby Avenue, he apparently found only Passauer. Adkins and colleague James Gempeler arrived at the firm just after the shooting and found Passauer fatally wounded, sitting in his desk chair. He was pronounced dead at 4:30 p.m.

Peterson hired Adkins in late March, and it is unclear if Adkins and Peterson ever met in person. That being the case, police believe that Peterson may have mistaken Passauer for Adkins. Peterson has been charged with one count of second-degree murder.

After fleeing the scene, Peterson, a violent career criminal with a lengthy rap sheet — including convictions for drive-by shooting, second-degree assault, fleeing police in a motor vehicle, drunken driving, and disorderly conduct — allegedly texted the following message to a friend who’d asked him to meet at a bar: “No, I just shot my lawyer.”

Adkins and Gempeler of North Star Criminal Defense released the following statement following Passauer’s death:

Chase Passauer

It is impossible to fathom or understand what happened yesterday at our office. We are working through this difficult time as best as we can. But we are grieving the loss of an incredible young man with such a bright and promising future.

He wasn’t just our employee. He was our friend. Our brother. He will be missed, but never forgotten.

Calling Passauer’s killing a “senseless and horrific act,” Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said his office would “do everything in its power to seek justice in this case.” Choi also commented on the proliferation of gun violence in the area, stating, “I am calling on all of us, as a community, to get serious about preventing tragedies like this by asking how this convicted felon was able to obtain the gun used in this murder.”

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences and sympathies to Chase Passauer’s family, friends, and colleagues. We sincerely hope that this young man’s alleged killer is brought swiftly to justice.

UPDATE (3:45 p.m.): A GoFundMe account has been set up to help Chase Passauer’s family pay for his funeral expenses. Many people in the legal community have already donated to this worthy cause. If you’d like to help the Passauer family during this incredibly difficult time, please [click here](https://www.gofundme.com/jqycxe8c?viewupdates=1&utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_content=cta_button&utm_campaign=upd_n) to make a donation.

— [Sonya Olds Som](https://www.heidrick.com/en/people/s/sonya-olds_som), a corporate counsel recruiter at Heidrick & Struggles, commenting on the [difficulties of finding top talent for in-house positions](https://www.law.com/2021/05/27/amid-associate-bonus-season-gcs-are-finding-talent-from-other-law-departments/) due to the [Biglaw special bonus pool](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/).

# The Bar Exam, Football, And Women’s History Month
## The Mansfield Rule has not yet revolutionized the practice of law for women, but it is gaining traction.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/)  team of expert contributors. [Linda Maria Wayner](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/team/linda-maria-wayner/) is Senior Director of Diversity Initiatives, and she works with law firms and in-house legal departments looking to promote equity and inclusion within their organizations. Linda previously worked as a litigator at Skadden, then as Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s counsel for international affairs, and most recently as a diversity professional with several private and non-profit institutions. She is a graduate of the University of Michigan (JD) and Baylor University (BA and MA).

It’s March, so it is again time to dust off the annual Women’s History Month topics.  Not everyone observes the month-long veneration of female achievement, even if [RBG’s birthday party](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/morning-docket-03-06-19/) is the perfect way to celebrate.  So let’s instead compare two very similar initiatives adopted by two very different professions to illustrate what law firms and football have in common on the diversity front.

In 2016, a group of partners from various Am Law 200 law firms and a Stanford Law School student came up with an idea at the 2016 Women in Law Hackathon, a brainstorming competition to produce innovative plans to promote gender equality in the legal profession. The rule mandates that at least 30 percent of a firm’s candidates for leadership positions (defined as firm governance roles, equity partnerships, practice chair positions, and seats on compensation committees) be women, attorneys of color, or both.

The rule is named after [Arabella Mansfield](http://www.iowawomenattorneys.org/awards.php), the first woman to pass the bar exam and qualify to practice law in the United States.  She and her husband both sat for the Iowa bar exam in 1869 at a time when only men were permitted to become attorneys.  She leaned in and took the test anyway. Not only did Mrs. Mansfield pass, she earned a score high enough to impress Iowa’s bar examiners, who [stated](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arabella-Mansfield) that her brilliant performance was “the very best rebuke to the [idea] that ladies cannot qualify … to practice law.”

The legal think tank and innovation incubator [Diversity Lab](https://www.diversitylab.com) organized the 2016 Hackathon event.  They further developed the concept and then called on Biglaw to publicly commit to the rule, resulting in 44 law firms stepping forward to embrace the challenge.  After launching the initial pilot program (which, among other things, required the firms to submit to diversity audits), Diversity Lab subsequently produced the [Mansfield Rule 2.0](https://www.diversitylab.com/pilot-projects/mansfield-rule/), which added LQBTQ candidates to the equation and required that a team putting together a formal “pitch” consider 30 percent staffing from minority groups and women. The new iteration also requested that participating law firms make appointment and election processes transparent to all lawyers in their firms.  Diversity Lab’s [2018 interim report](https://www.diversitylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mansfield-Rule-Pilot-Mid-Point-Progress-Report-2017-2018.pdf) on participating law firms presented data on how many firms have begun fulfilling the specific Mansfield Rule action items and to what degree.  This is where the fine print gets interesting.

The report reveals that a substantial number of participants had not yet completed the easiest action items, such as formally tracking the diversity of internal leadership pipelines, more than halfway into the pilot. It is troubling that several firms, after committing to the initiative, have struggled to implement its changes.

Perhaps we can look to another profession for some guidance. The Mansfield Rule was inspired by the Rooney Rule, named after Art Rooney, a former owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a public champion for inclusion in professional football.  This rule, officially adopted as NFL policy in 2003, requires every team in the league to interview at least one minority candidate for head coach vacancies.  It’s an attempt to address racial inequities in professional football, which is currently 70 percent African-American among players, but less than 25 percent African-American at the management level.  The Rooney Rule has since been expanded to include NFL general manager jobs, along with a directive to consider at least one woman for every business front-office position that opens in the league.

Sixteen years after the NFL adopted the Rooney Rule, opinions are mixed as to its success thus far. There is general agreement that the Rooney Rule was an important, albeit small, institutional step in the right direction. There are also concerns that the policy has become a [bureaucratic speed bump](https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/patriots/2019/03/02/progress-for-minority-nfl-head-coach-and-candidates-has-stalled/9xhTEvyxKp5CVwmRNhMrFL/story.html), obeyed in practice but ignored in spirit.

Similarly in the legal world, the data confirms what most of us know anecdotally: women working in Biglaw, especially those aiming for partner, [are far more likely to land in niche practice groups](https://www.nawl.org/p/bl/et/blogid=10&blogaid=1170), such as education, family law, health care, immigration, and employment.  Like the NFL shunting black coaches toward defensive jobs, women have gravitated, or have been nudged, toward practice areas that earn less money.  The reasons for selecting the less-profitable specialties are varied and legitimate: higher odds of promotion, better work-life balance, and the desire to have a critical mass of female colleagues. Areas such as banking, M&A, and litigation have comparatively fewer female lawyers and a much smaller percentage of them achieve partnership.

The Mansfield Rule has not yet revolutionized the practice of law for women, but it is gaining traction and has real potential to move the needle toward progress. Thank you, Ms. Mansfield, and happy Women’s History Month.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Continues To Struggle With Gender Equity

Kathryn Rubino joins Joe to discuss the recent lowlights in Biglaw gender equity. From MoFo’s curious strategic response to allegations that it maintains a “mommy track” for female career advancement to Jones Day… doing Jones Day stuff, women are still struggling to get an even shake when it comes to major law firms.

# It’s Time For Lawyers To Have Walk-Up Songs

With both Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part I and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (in theaters now!) occupying much of the cultural zeitgeist, and with Argentinian jazz pianist Lalo Schifrin’s and Boston Pops laureate conductor John Williams’s themes for each, respectively, echoing in our heads, it’s only natural to wonder what litigators’ lives would be like if our own theme songs accompanied us when we we were in action.  

We’re neither Ethan Hunt nor Indiana Jones. But our jobs are just as exciting. 

Some ideas:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Songs That Declare You’re a Minor Badass: For when you want a walk-up song to end a legal proceeding before it even begins and have the confidence and/or braggadocio to make it so but also want to show some deference to the court.

- C+C Music Factory’s “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),” “Pump Up the Jam” by Technotronic, “Push It” by Salt-N-Pepa or “Got to Be Real” by Cheryl Lynn declare this with a Jock Jam vibe.
- Stevie Wonder’s “Higher Ground” says two things in one. 
- The Breeders’ “Cannonball” has that rare melody which is both jaunty and intimidating. 
- “Good as Hell” by Lizzo and “Before He Cheats” by Carrie Underwood and “Go Your Own Way” by Fleetwood Mac would create waves in many domestic proceedings.
Songs That Declare You’re a Major Badass: For when you want a walk-up song to end a legal proceeding before it even begins and have the confidence and/or braggadocio to make it so and care not one iota about deference to the court. 

- Almost any AC/DC but especially “For Those About to Rock….” will do the trick.
- Use DJ Khaled’s “All I Do Is Win (Remix)” sparingly, you don’t want to jinx yourself.
- “I Gotta Feeling” by Black Eyed Peas could go either way.
- “Survivor” by Destiny’s Child and “So What” by Pink and “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor all say “it doesn’t matter what happens here,” which might be good if you have a stinker of a case. 
- “Eye of the Tiger” by Survivor might put you in the zone, but you run the risk of putting opposing counsel in the zone, too.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Songs to Intimidate Opposing Counsel: Again, use with caution. There are some songs that put everyone on edge.  

- “Under Pressure” by Queen and David Bowie. 
- John Williams’s “JAWS” theme. 
- Most any Radiohead song will also do this, especially the last 90 seconds of “Climbing Up The Walls.”
- Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” would make everyone in the courtroom wonder if your walk-up song was about them, the distraction proving to be a tactical advantage.
Songs that Evoke Sympathy to in Turn Foster Generosity:  For when plaintiffs’ attorneys want to put juries in the mood … for awarding large damages awards! 

- The attorney who did that thing of when they mortgaged their house to stay afloat while they investigated the toxic tortfeasor and gave their spouse a clipboard to engage class action plaintiffs can’t go wrong with “Against All Odds” by Phil Collins or “What a Wonderful World” by Louis Armstrong. 
- “Lean on Me” by Bill Withers could generate a good chunk of damages award; same with “Fix You” by Coldplay but also … Coldplay; Rihanna’s “Umbrella” could be highly effective in this regard.
- “You’ve Got a Friend” by Carole King serves the rare dual purpose of inviting the jury to be friendly while also serving as great advertising, as does “That’s What Friends are For” by Dionne Warwick. 
- Use “Everybody Hurts” by R.E.M. cautiously, for while it establishes damages it might also minimize those damages by characterizing them as de rigueur.
- If you really just want to go for it, walk into court to Supertramp’s “Give a Little Bit” or ABBA’s “Gimme Gimme Gimme,” or if you’re hoping for one of those record-breaking awards, “Let’s Go Crazy” by Prince is a walk-up song to consider.   
Songs for Litigators Who Really Just Want to Settle: There are some cases which should just settle. But for whatever reason, to wit, obstinate opposing counsel, the case just hasn’t settled. And as much as you love litigating, you just don’t have the emotional bandwidth for a trial right now. Make one last ditch effort at settlement with these walk-up songs/pleas for reason.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- “We Can Work It Out” by the Beatles.
- “Meet Me Halfway” by Black Eyed Peas sends a nice, hopeful message. 
- “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” by Rolling Stones sends a nice, grounding message.
Songs that Evoke Sympathy to in Turn Foster Leniency: Attorneys eager for a jury to show their client some absolution, financial or otherwise, might walk into court to:

- “Human” by the Human League or “People are People” by Depeche Mode, because who among us hasn’t done something wrong.
- “Rainbow” by Kacey Musgraves or “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” by Judy Garland or “Rainbow Connection” by Kermit the Frog because seriously, there is a rainbow in all of us.
- Same idea with “I’ll Be Your Mirror” by Velvet Underground. 
- “Let it Go” by Elsa from Frozen and “Sorry” by Justin Bieber and “All Apologies” by Nirvana and “I Feel For You” by Chaka Khan each convey a more explicit message.
- Elvis Presley’s rendition of “Amazing Grace” says, “I dare you not to exonerate my client.” 
- Miley Cyrus’s “The Climb” and Pet Shop Boys’ “What Have I Done to Deserve This?” and Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song” could also be used in this regard to great effect.
Songs About the Substance of Your Case:  If the AV person at the courthouse doesn’t mind, why not prepare a panoply of walk-up songs and utilize each when appropriate? Here are some walk-up songs which feel like they were composed for litigation.

- Plaintiffs’ attorneys in cases against alleged toxic tortfeasors could do no better than walking into court to Britney Spears’s “Toxic.” 
- No member of a jury in a medical malpractice case would have a dry eye if the plaintiff’s attorney walked into court to Taylor Swift’s “Epiphany.” 
- Employment attorneys would do well to engage Billy Joel’s “Allentown” or any Bruce Springsteen song ever.
- The prosecutor in the Bernie Madoff trial could have walked into court to Michael Jackson’s “Smooth Criminal” or Sade’s “Smooth Operator.” Putative embezzlers beware/take note.
- Attorneys in cases dealing with supply chain failures must walk into court to “Truckin’” by Grateful Dead or “Life is a Highway” by Tom Cochrane.
- Depending on their position, litigators in auto tort cases have myriad walk-up songs to consider including “Fast Car” by Tracy Chapman, “Little Red Corvette” by Prince, “Shut Up and Drive” by Rihanna, “Get Outta My Dreams Get Into My Car” by Billy Ocean, “Red Barchetta” by Rush, or “Pink Cadillac” by Natalie Cole or Bruce Springsteen. 
- Any litigator practicing equine law must have “A Horse With No Name” by America or “Wild Horses” by Rolling Stones at the ready.
- Echoes of Whitney Houston’s “I Have Nothing” would reverberate nicely in bankruptcy proceedings. 
- And I’d be committing malpractice if I didn’t say that any medical malpractice case with an osteopathic surgeon involved needs one side, any side, to walk in to Shakira’s “Hips Don’t Lie.”     
Songs for Post-Trial Motions and Appellate Practice: You’ve mastered the trial walk-up song. Doesn’t your appellate practice deserve the same care and attention? Appellate judges will surely be moved.  

- The appellant in any post-conviction or post-trial hearing should consider “If I Could Turn Back Time” by Cher as a walk-up song, as well as Sugar’s “If I Can’t Change Your Mind” and “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg” by the Temptations. 
- Appellees on the other hand should consider Queen’s “We Are the Champions” or Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin.’” 
- Lenny Kravitz’s “It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over” also works well here.
- “Bad Blood” by Taylor Swift works well for post-trial motions. Use Taylor sparingly.
- “Sailing” by Christopher Cross or any yacht rock really — for when you’re appearing in front of SCOTUS and you really, really want Alito and Thomas on your side.

# 3 Questions For A Biglaw Challenger (Part II)
## Lawyers at Pierce Bainbridge will tell you that they've never had so much fun practicing law.

Last week, I presented Part I of my written interview with patent attorney and co-head of Pierce Bainbridge’s IP group, David L. Hecht. That column presented his answers to the first two of my three questions and focused on the rapid growth of Pierce Bainbridge and David’s biography. What follows is David’s answer to my remaining question. As usual, I have added some brief commentary to his answer below, but have otherwise presented his answer as he provided it.

3) What makes a firm like yours attractive to Biglaw refugees (especially patent lawyers) looking to grow their practices?

Far fewer conflicts, and much greater upside.  We are lean and mean. We keep the firm’s overhead as low as possible and invest in legal talent and support (both human and AI).

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
We want to promote a collegial — and very fun — environment where people genuinely love to work.  There is respect between lawyers and between lawyers and staff. Partners do not treat associates like inferiors.  We take our associates to pitches; we let them argue motions, take/defend depositions, and even examine witnesses at trial.  We only hire associates who we intend on promoting to partner. In doing so, we have thrown away the pyramid scheme business model pervasive at Biglaw.

It has been a bloodbath for many patent groups out there, both patent prosecutors and litigators.  Many large clients with prosecution needs are simply taking the work in-house. Billable rates have simply gotten out of control and firms refuse to think outside the box or listen to their clients.

In litigation, patent lawyers face a multitude of challenges, including Alice, IPRs, and the risk of appeal.  Faced with this current environment, patent owners are reluctant to enforce their intellectual property.  That uncertainty and the high cost of litigation has led to much less substantive patent litigation in recent years.  There is also very little money in defending against most NPEs, a major source of revenue for many patent groups just a few years ago.  There are far fewer opportunities in patent law than there used to be; very few firms are positioned to prosper in this kind of environment.  That’s where Pierce Bainbridge differs.

Someone once told me that you must find the right platform to succeed as an attorney.  He was right. At Pierce Bainbridge, we have the most flexible platform in the industry.  We have great relationships with litigation funders. We embrace alternative-fee arrangements and even contingency cases.  Our overhead is astonishingly low, so even for straight billable work, we can offer Biglaw talent at a discount.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Unfortunately, most patent lawyers have a lousy platform.  Most firms do not permit lawyers to hit the brakes on their rates and many lawyers are denied the opportunity to bring in business even if conflicts are cleared due to a “perceived” conflict or other nonsense that makes no business sense.  It’s no surprise that so many talented litigators keep emailing us about joining!

I was once told at Biglaw that we were paid a lot of money to put up with a lot of shit, including firm politics and people who are just plain nasty.  That’s not our view at Pierce Bainbridge. Our lawyers are paid to be excellent lawyers — and to win. We don’t want drama at our firm.

Our lawyers will tell you that they’ve never had so much fun practicing law.  I very strongly feel the same way. I’m having the time of my life here. The dynamics of “work” have fundamentally changed for us.  It doesn’t feel like work when you genuinely enjoy what you are doing and are surrounded by great people there to support you at every turn.

GK: It is always nice to hear from lawyers who are proud of their firm and actually enjoy their work and work environment. There is no doubt that the market for patent lawyers is a challenging one, both in terms of sourcing client work and in terms of lateral movement to another firm for those dissatisfied with their current firm. Changing client appetite for both risk and incurring legal costs have helped smaller firms punch above their weight in the patent space — a fact I can attest to from my own practice. At the same time, smaller firms like Pierce Bainbridge with a dedication to smart growth will find ample opportunity to attract talent. We all know that loyalty is a declining value in the legal industry, and patent lawyers will always find themselves looking for opportunities that allow them to craft their practices to suit their talents and ambitions.

My thanks to David for the insights and cooperation, and I wish him continued success and fulfillment with his practice at Pierce Bainbridge. As I have said before, it is always a privilege to hear from an established IP personality, especially one with such a big role to play in growing the IP group at a formidable Biglaw challenger. I am always open to conducting interviews of this type with other IP thought leaders, so feel free to reach out if you have a compelling perspective to offer.

# Associates Don't Deserve Bonuses Argues Woman Who Isn't An Associate
## Don't shed any tears for firms paying associates less than market.

While many firms are following Cravath’s lead and offering a lockstep bonus, there are a few outliers drawing attention for trying to bait and switch their commitment to their associates. Firms like Norton Rose & Fulbright, who proclaimed a Cravath match… only to toss in some fine print [restricting market bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/this-firm-wont-give-you-anywhere-near-a-full-bonus-if-you-dont-meet-your-hours-requirements/) to associates billing 2300 hours or more.

It’s a clumsy public relations effort rooted in the hope that the next batch of talent will only see dollar signs and not the fine print when the time comes.

But Vivia Chen of The Careerist fired up the hot-take machine and argued [associates don’t deserve bonuses if they’re not billing 2300+](https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/12/08/entitled-associates-royal-nuptials-cooleys-coolness-more/):

Not to be a party pooper, but a “bonus” by definition is an extra treat, a gratuity; it’s not an automatic entitlement nor an indispensable component of the compensation package (unlike what I-bankers get).

First of all, in an occupation that has handed out bonuses without fail for decades, it’s no longer an extra treat, it’s absolutely a component of overall compensation. For the same reason, when firms occasionally hand out mid-year bonuses, no one argues that those are anything but a gratuity because there’s no tradition there. The holiday bonus is more akin to a profit share payout — flexible, but guaranteed.

In other words, [Clark Griswold was right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Christmas_Vacation):

I was expecting a check. Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club. Seventeen years with the company. I’ve gotten a Christmas bonus every year but this one. You don’t want to give bonuses, fine. But when people count on them as part of their salary…

Second, this is supposedly an efficient labor market, and where a critical mass of firms signal to the market that total first-year compensation is $195K for all associates in good standing (which often includes a modest hourly target, like 1900 hours) and others, like Cadwalader, signal that compensation may actually exceed the market floor for high performers, a firm that says it will tank rank-and-file associates at sub-market rates unless they hit 2300+ is making a conscious choice to depart the loosely defined boundaries of civil Biglaw society. This isn’t a petty dig at the firm by greedy associates, it’s cold and market-based. If an associate is a rational actor seeking to maximize their earnings, then don’t go to Norton Rose Fulbright.

I know, I know, some firms don’t have explicit billable hour requirements for bonuses, so it seems unfair that some firms impose the burden. But does anyone seriously believe that associates at Cravath or Wachtell Lipton aren’t working their rear-ends off just because there’s no stated billable minimum?

This actually hits on the biggest fallacy of billable-hour requirements. Cravath doesn’t have minimums because if an associate wasn’t really trying, they wouldn’t be at Cravath. When firms stiff associates on bonuses, they’re not saying that the associate didn’t work hard enough, what they’re actually saying is, “we do think your 2200 hours represent good enough work and you’ve contributed enough to lining our partners’ pockets to remain at the firm, but we’ll use this as an excuse to save even more money.” It’s implicit in the hourly regime that billing 2000-2299 hours represents acceptable work; Norton Rose just doesn’t want to pay it, and they’ve found what they think is a socially acceptable reason to withhold money.

Thankfully some firms, like Baker Botts, have [reversed course on onerous hourly requirements](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/bigger-bonuses-lower-hours-requirements-is-this-2017/).

Frankly, I think it’s much more honest and fair to say that those who bill more will take home more moolah. Firms might be reluctant to use phrases like “eat what you kill” in front of their young, but that’s the brutal truth.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Unfortunately, this makes no sense in the associate context because associates aren’t killing anything. Associates rarely get to choose their schedules, with scheduling partners performing a delicate juggling act to keep everyone maximally engaged in the best systems and associates begging partners for work in others. If those latter firms sound like they afford a good deal of associate choice, think again. In these systems, partners often open up fiefdoms and jealously guard the time of their associates, which can be a boon for hours if the partner is handling a number of high-attention matters, but can leave associates high and dry if they’re being walled off from other assignments waiting on a matter to ramp up that never does. Worse, those fiefdoms tend to find partners rewarding “their people” with ample work, often oblivious to the fact that “their people” are often demographic duplicates, reinforcing racial and gender stratification within the firm.

Plus, there’s good reason to believe “eat what you kill” compensation regimes are damaging to firms even amongst partners. Firms with a lockstep culture don’t invite inefficiencies, where partners take on work outside their expertise or beyond their effective bandwidth in order to guarantee a greater share of the prize. Lockstep systems carry with them a collegiality that puts client needs above an attorney’s self-interest. That’s before we get to the risk that attorneys may seek out clients who rack up huge bills in the short-term, exposing the firm as a whole to liability down the stretch. All things considered, firms should be preaching less “eat what you kill” to associates rather than more.

So if a firm is trying to spin a story about sub-market bonuses, don’t let them get away with it. Let us know so we can ensure the next generation know to vote with their feet. Your professional effort is valuable, and if firms aren’t honoring that at least to the bare level set by the market, it’s time to find different firms.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I try to foster a help culture. We have ombudsman roles where people—partners, associates, paralegals, and administrators—are trained in mental health issues. They are the first line. When people have [mental health] issues, it’s not unusual for them to go on leave, which is usually a month or two. There are lots of resources here.

I’m trying to be a hopeful voice. It’s important for people to tell their stories. When I shared my story, I was met with a lot of compassion.

— [Joseph Milowic](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/milowic-iii-joseph/), director of well-being and counsel at Quinn Emanuel, in comments given to Vivia Chen on her Substack, [The Ex-Careerist](https://viviachen.substack.com/p/even-pitbulls-get-the-blues-quinn), on what he does at the hard-charging firm when it comes to mental health and wellness for all employees. In 2018, Milowic made a very [public admission about his depression](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-partner-wants-the-world-to-know-he-suffers-from-depression/) in the [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/03/28/quinn-emanuel-partner-suffers-from-depression-and-he-wants-everyone-to-know/), and he was met with grace from his colleagues, his clients, and even his firm’s founder, [John Quinn](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/quinn-john-b/), a lawyer whom Chen refers to as “the quintessential alpha male.” Milowic is also the founder of the important support organization, the [Lawyers Depression Project](https://www.lawyersdepressionproject.org/). (Thanks again to Joe Milowic for his selflessness and his willingness to be the face of this important issue in the legal profession.)

Which law school should you go to? That’s a great question. What are your goals? For those whose law school dreams carry with them the end goal of working for one of the top firms in the country and receiving one of the top-dollar salaries those firms are famous for, then we’ve got some great news for you. A new ranking came out this week, and it may hold the key to aspiring law students’ wishes for their would-be prestigious careers.

GradReports has analyzed the law school choice versus career conundrum to identify the top 10 schools that place the greatest percentage of graduates at the top 10 Biglaw firms (i.e., the highest-grossing law firms on the Am Law 100).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

So which law schools will help graduates maximize their investment with top jobs?

Before we get to that, take a look at the interesting methodology GradReports used to come up with this law school ranking:

To determine which schools’ alumni find work at the top law firms, we looked at two key sources of information. The first was LinkedIn alumni data, which we used to find employment outcomes for alumni of 50 prominent law schools in the U.S. We limited our study to graduates from 2015 through 2021. Here is a complete list of the [schools we examined](https://d92mrp7hetgfk.cloudfront.net/data/Law_Firm_Research_Outline.pdf).

To find the number of graduates working for the top 10 highest-grossing law firms in the country, we turned to the [2021 Am Law 100 rankings](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/20/the-2021-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/?slreturn=20211002150756), which evaluates law firms by gross revenue. The top 10 highest-grossing firms are:

- Kirkland & Ellis ($4.83 billion)
- Latham & Watkins ($4.33 billion)
- DLA Piper ($3.13 billion)
- Baker McKenzie ($2.9 billion)
- Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom ($2.66 billion)
- Sidley Austin ($2.46 billion)
- Morgan, Lewis, & Bockius ($2.45 billion)
- White & Case ($2.39 billion)
- Hogan Lovells ($2.31 billion)
- Jones Day ($2.22 billion)
This LinkedIn factor strikes us as a bit suspect, but let’s see where it takes us. Here are the [GradReports](https://www.gradreports.com/trends-insights/top-law-shools-for-employment) top law schools for top law firm jobs:

- Northwestern Law: 9.04% of alumni at top law firms
- U. Michigan Law: 7.97% of alumni at top law firms

- U. Texas Law: 6.33% of alumni at top law firms
- Notre Dame Law: 6.12% of alumni at top law firms
- Duke Law: 6.06% of alumni at top law firms
Gasp! Where are T14 law schools Harvard, Yale, and Stanford? Not to worry, because they’re found a little further down the list.

Don’t get discouraged if your law school didn’t make the cut. After all, these are just the schools that are sending the most alumni (per LinkedIn listings) to the top 10 Am Law firms. These schools — and many more — are placing many hundreds of alumni at plenty of other successful Am Law firms.

If your law school did make the list, then congratulations! Get out there and grab one of these highly desired Biglaw jobs while you can.

# Underpaying Associates Can Be Costly For Law Firms
## Underpaying associates means that a firm likely has less-experienced attorneys who are more prone to messing matters up.

This website has covered at length how associates in Biglaw make insane sums of money because of their fat paychecks and crazy bonuses.  Due to this coverage, [and because of flawed assumptions about how much money attorneys are paid](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/becoming-an-attorney-affects-how-people-treat-you/), many might think that the salaries in Biglaw are the norm in the legal profession rather than the exception.  However, most of us understand that few attorneys are paid exorbitant sums, and many attorneys are paid less than individuals who enter a number of non-legal professions.

From my own personal experiences, I can attest that numerous law firm associates are paid relatively low salaries, especially at the beginning of their legal careers.  There are many reasons why some lawyers are underpaid, including the fact that certain insurance carriers pay low hourly rates, and partners need to decrease their expenses as much as possible.  However, underpaying associates can be extremely costly to law firms for a number of reasons.

After leaving Biglaw, [I worked at a law firm that paid me nearly $100,000 a year less than I earned in my prior role](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/introducing-side-hustles/).  Because lawyers were paid lower salaries, attorneys usually only stayed at this firm for 10 to 12 months before seeking more gainful employment elsewhere.  I stayed almost twice as long as others, since I genuinely loved the hands-on experience offered by this smaller shop, [and I was developing a few clients I helped originate](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/).  However, the firm was mostly a revolving door, since many attorneys left for more lucrative opportunities as soon as they could.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The revolving door at this shop had a number of negative effects on the firm.  For one, hiring new associates because attorneys were constantly leaving meant that new attorneys needed to be trained on a regular basis.  Training lawyers was always a time-consuming process, and each new attorney usually couldn’t bill too many hours for a month or two until they got familiar with their files.  In addition, new attorneys at the firm were more likely to make mistakes that would take hours to fix.

For example, many of the new attorneys at the smaller firm at which I worked frequently missed deadlines to serve responses for notices to admit.  As many New York attorneys are aware, practicing law in the state’s courts is like the Wild West.  Judges are infrequently bothered about discovery issues, and deadlines are rarely followed.  However, for some reason, parties must usually respond to deadlines for notices to admit, or the facts in a notice to admit are deemed to have been admitted by the party that fails to timely respond.

Newer attorneys at the small firm at which I worked almost never knew that this one deadline must absolutely be adhered to, and they failed to timely respond to notices to admit frequently.  As a result, the facts were deemed admitted, and we usually spent hours filing motions and reassuring our clients to make up for these mistakes.  There are, of course, other important missteps that newer attorneys were bound to make, and underpaying associates means that a firm likely has less-experienced attorneys who are more prone to messing matters up.

In addition, underpaying associates creates a number of accountability issues.  If people do not think they will stay at a law firm for too long, [they have little incentive to do good work on their files, or meet deadlines](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).  Indeed, I once inherited a file from an attorney who had left the firm, and he never filed a summary judgment motion even though the deadline was less than a week after I started at that firm!  While working in Biglaw, I never learned the nuances of filing motions, so there was a steep learning curve while I reviewed the facts of the case and developed strategies for our summary judgment motion.   My predecessor probably figured that he could just hold off on filing until he left the firm, and people are way more likely to pass the buck along if they are paid little and know they will soon be leaving.

Furthermore, constant transition because attorneys are underpaid can create a number of other issues.  It is harder for clients to deal with new contacts after an attorney departs when they have been communicating with a lawyer on a case for months.  Furthermore, it is difficult to train new associates on internal processes related to billing, client communications, and other issues, and new attorneys can make mistakes until they are properly trained.  In addition, constant transitioning just looks bad.  Colleagues and clients are much less likely to view a firm in high esteem if they see attorneys leaving in regular intervals.

In the end, I understand why many shops underpay their associates.  Numerous firms face a variety of financial pressures, and this makes it more difficult for them to pay associates higher salaries.  However, underpaying associates can be costly for many firms, and law firms can realize a number of benefits by paying associates more reasonable salaries.

# These Partners Desperately Don't Want Us To Know They Aren't Raising Salaries
## Partners hope to hide the ball on their lack of raises.

As raises trickle through the legal industry — [rightly or wrongly](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/crowell-moring-matches-wait-what-in-the-holy-hell-is-going-on-here/) — and boost the living standards of associates in every office — [rightly or wrongly](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/) — some firms really don’t want to be forced to give their associates their first real raise in almost 10 years. A few firms are [willing to grandstand about it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/one-firm-decides-to-pump-the-brakes-on-this-whole-raise-thing/). Others just want to duck their heads in the sand and hope no one notices.

McGuireWoods falls in the latter category. The Richmond-based Biglaw firm with 20 domestic offices has not yet raised salaries. Indeed, they haven’t even raised salaries across the country to the now-bygone $160K standard. Even Richmond rival [Hunton & Williams managed to do that](http://www.law360.com/articles/793622/hunton-williams-1st-years-see-pay-hike-to-160k) — if only recently. But it’s more than just keeping a lid on salaries, there are some unnamed partners at McGuireWoods who really, really don’t want the world to know about it.

From a tipster:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Overheard partners today discussing that they’re not going to put out a firm wide memo about not giving raises because they don’t want to end up in THE MEDIA. We are looking doubly bad because Hunton Williams showed us up in Richmond by raising first years to 160 (we’re at 145), and now all of the associates in major markets are pissed, too.

Well, then let’s make sure this ends up in THE MEDIA.

Now this is just one tipster reporting some hearsay, but earlier this morning I directly asked McGuireWoods if they would be raising salaries or not and received no acknowledgment. Not even a “it’s still being discussed.” So that’s at least consistent with this tip.

Again, I’m on the record that it’s a little ridiculous that associates all across the country are getting the same salary as those in elite NY firms. It just seems gratuitous. But now that $180K is the prevailing scale among the top-tier firms, and certainly among firms maintaining offices in New York, Houston, Chicago, etc. then the firm needs to step up to the plate or admit that they just don’t see themselves as one of the top-tier. And, hey, there’s no shame in being second-best.

But what you can’t do is sit on a salary scale that was already outdated before the salary frenzy and hope no one will notice. We’ll notice. If that was your grand strategy, then you failed.

Maybe it’s time to gather the partners and talk about $160K… at least.

## It's time to count the Cravath cash.

Associates at some Am Law 100 firms are getting anxious when it comes to their compensation. Cravath came out with its [generous new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) more than a month ago, and dozens of Biglaw firms have already matched. Why hasn’t your firm made its move?

Associates at Jenner & Block — a firm that brought in $446,295,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 88th place in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — don’t have to ask themselves that question. If you recall, the firm [announced a Davis Polk match](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/jenner-raise-2022/) juuuuust before Cravath made its grand entrance to the 2022 salary wars. Sources now tell us that the firm actually matched Cravath about a month ago, on March 7.

This is what the salary scale now looks like at Jenner & Block:



These raises were retroactive to January 1. Congratulations!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”).

# What Law Students Need To Know About The Salary Wars Before On-Campus Recruitment

So, this is the year of the great salary increase — well, at least in Biglaw. After nearly a decade of salary stagnation, Cravath set the new MoneyLaw standard in early June, and we’ve been keeping pace with the developments ever since then.

Most of the coverage at Above the Law has been focused on the associates already ensconced in Biglaw’s warm [read: smothering] embrace. They want paper proof their firms respect them as much as Cravath does, otherwise they’ll be on the phone with recruiters. But for law students about to run the on-campus recruitment gauntlet, it can be overwhelming.

But this is information you need to know before you decide where to go for that career-defining summer associateship. The relevant question is: how best to bone up on the facts? ATL has over 300 stories about the changes to associate compensation, and trying to read them all to get a good understanding of the new market realities is a chore. So we decided to make things easy — an easy chart that compares apples to apples to help you make sense of all the noise.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So, let’s define our terms. MoneyLaw means the below scale, through at least 7th-year associates in all the firm’s major markets. Yes, there is some difference in how these firms treat 8th- or 9th-year associates, but, should a rising 2L decide to start their career there, this will give them a good sense of how the firm will treat associates for the majority of their careers. And if you are trying to work outside of the major markets, you’ll have to do some additional research, but my guess is law students who want to start their career in Minneapolis are doing so for reasons outside of money.

1st year – $180,000

2nd year – $190,000

3rd year – $210,000

4th year – $235,000

5th year – $260,000

6th year – $280,000

7th year – $300,000

Next up: Compression Alert. This is when a firm proudly announces $180,000 for first-year associates, but is much more quiet about what’s going on for older associates. Sometimes it is because the firm’s compensation is a black box, other times it’s because they’ve decided to give smaller (or even no) raises to more senior associates, and this way they get to boast about meeting the market and save some money. Be wary and ask a lot of questions about these firms, because even as relatively young associates, the compression can set in, and no one wants to bill 2000+ hours for less money then folks at peer firms. Don’t be short sighted — even if you only expect to spend a year or two in Biglaw, careers have a funny way of taking unexpected turns.

“Ranges within market” means the firm doesn’t use class year as the sole determinant of compensation, often dividing associates into levels or tiers. Despite the somewhat idiosyncratic way of paying people, these firms are still basically paying associates market rates.

Below-market means the firm gave raises (or maybe [decreased salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/am-law-100-firm-raises-salaries-kind-of/)), sometimes just to first years, but compensation for associates, as a whole, is below market. No movement means that despite all the firms that have made changes to their compensation structure, these firms haven’t made a move since June.

This is everything we know about compensation at the Am Law 200 firms, so enjoy the ATL Compensation Guide to On-Campus Recruitment!

# Every Summer Associate Program Change In One Chart

The other day we pointed you to a [list of the grading policy changes](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/every-law-school-grading-policy-change-in-one-chart/) around the country (and Canada) to keep everyone up to date on the updates we’re putting out there as we get them. Information is coming in rapidly, but it’s nice to have a place to go back and look at everything in one place.

Now that updates to firm summer associate programs are coming in fast and furious, we found that Reddit once again has done the good work of gathering this under one roof before we did. We can’t stress how helpful this is, because we here at Above the Law are tracking layoffs, bar cancellations, grading changes, summer programs, SCOTUS arguments, DOJ shenanigans, and terrible law firm advertising all at once, so we’re glad there’s a chart like this out there.

In this case, it’s Redditor Hstrat maintaining the chart with updates to summer programs. To give you a preview of what Hstrat’s got, here are the Vault top 10. The [rest of the list is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/fuf8ki/tracking_summer_program_changes/) (note the Haynes Boone entry currently says the pay is pro-rated… the firm hasn’t made a final call on that as of now):

# Back To Normal: A Reality Check On The Associate Lateral Market
## If you’re an associate entering the lateral market, there's good news and bad news.

If you’re an associate entering the lateral market, I have good news and bad news.  The good news?  Despite all the talk of recession, the lateral market remains open for business.  The bad news?  The days of minimal scrutiny and massive sign-on bonuses are behind us.  For associates whose conception of the lateral market was forged in the chaotic, unprecedented period from late 2020 through mid-2022, a reality check is in order.

Firms have more power now

It’s hard to overstate just how remarkably imbalanced the lateral market was in 2021.  Transactional associates with even average credentials held substantial leverage, often receiving quick offers from multiple firms, complete with sign-on bonuses of $50,000 or more.  Given that the 2021 market was a striking departure from the historical norm, it’s not surprising that the pendulum has swung back to a more typical place.

In 2023, a lateral move requires more strategy and effort.  That starts with the decision about which firms to pursue.  A good recruiter will be honest with you about the firms that are realistic options in light of your credentials.  You can help us help you by being transparent about where you’ve applied and interviewed in the past, and why you’re looking for a change.  If we understand the reasons motivating your search, we can give better advice on which firms are likely to be a match. 

Traditional interviews are back 

Just as offices are beginning to look more like the pre-COVID normal (at least on Tuesdays and Wednesdays!) the lateral interview process is starting to resemble 2019. 

Zoom interviews are no longer the default.  You should expect a “hybrid” process.  Some interviews — especially those with partners — may still be virtual, but you should assume that a visit to the office will be required, even if you don’t live locally.

When interviewing with local firms, you should anticipate at least a half day in person.  If you’re interviewing with a group out of state, be prepared to devote at least a full day to interviews, accounting for travel time.  Try to make yourself as available as possible.  Firms must typically coordinate the schedules of several partners to accommodate your interview, so your flexibility will be appreciated.  Once the interview is confirmed, commit to showing up as promised — only a dire emergency should cause you to ask to reschedule. 

Firms are more selective now than they have been in recent years, with multiple candidates typically interviewing for a single opening.  Given the increased competition, preparation is essential.  Know who you will meet, and have a plan for what you hope to achieve in the conversation.  Based on the available background information, can you anticipate any potential sources of rapport with your interviewer?  On what topics might this person have uniquely valuable insight?  Make sure you arrive with some [thoughtful, well-tailored questions](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/questions-to-ask-your-interviewer-in-a-lateral-interview/).

Remember to dress professionally.  In-office dress codes are looser these days than ever, but you should still wear a suit to an interview.  If you haven’t dressed formally in a while, take a moment now to confirm that you have appropriate, well-fitting attire.  And if you’re flying, make sure to pack your interview clothing in your carry-on bag. 

Firms are taking their time to extend offers

Back when the market was red hot, firms were forced to make offers exceptionally quickly. Today, it’s customary to take more time.  Some firms may still move fast if there’s a pressing need to do so, but taking a week or longer to put together a written offer is not unusual.  Occasionally, firms may run conflicts checks before a formal offer is made, further delaying the process.  Be patient, but tell your recruiter if you have another offer pending, or some other good reason why an urgent decision is necessary.  Nobody wants to lose a strong candidate over timing, and we can prod firms to speed up where it’s genuinely necessary.

Once you receive an offer, there tends to be little scope for negotiation.  This is particularly true in large markets with lockstep associate salaries.  In some cases, class year may be a point of discussion: if you’re re-tooling to a different practice area, lateraling to a more sophisticated practice, or the scope of your practice is shifting, you may be asked to take a class year “haircut.”  This is standard practice and is often to your long-term benefit.  That said, if you disagree with the firm’s assessment of your level, talk to your recruiter about it.

Before 2021, sign-on bonuses were not standard practice, and today they are once again the exception.  Even so, there are circumstances where it makes sense to ask.  If you’re taking a pay cut to move from Biglaw to a regional firm, walking away from your previous year’s bonus, being asked to start on an accelerated timeline, or you have multiple offers, it’s reasonable to attempt to negotiate a sign-on payment.  If you are relocating, it’s common for large firms to pay a “relocation” allowance in the form of a sign-on bonus.  In any case, it’s important to keep your expectations realistic.  You aren’t going to get a $50k+ sign-on bonus as a matter of course.  The typical current range in a large market is more like $10-25k. 

Be aware of post-offer expectations

Once you have received an offer, you should inform the firm of your decision as soon as you’ve made it, ideally within a few days.  If a quick decision isn’t feasible (for example, because you’re juggling other interviews or offers), be transparent with your recruiter to enable us to manage the firm’s expectations.  Note that conflicts and background checks can take as long as a few weeks, so it’s best to get that process started as soon as possible.

Upon clearing conflicts and giving notice, it’s standard to start within 2-4 weeks.  If your circumstances require a longer gap, state your request clearly, but be aware that asking for more than a month is generally frowned upon.  Wrapping up a trial you’ve been staffed on or taking a pre-planned vacation are good reasons for requesting a delayed start.

Don’t get discouraged

All of us wish that the post-COVID lateral bonanza could have continued indefinitely.  But that was never going to happen.  Instead of lamenting the reversion to more normal conditions, focus on the positive.  If you commit to a lateral search and approach it correctly, you still have every chance of landing at a firm that will be a better fit.  In the end, that’s what matters most.

When Halloween falls during the business week, it makes it even more difficult for lawyers to get into the holiday spirit. After all, how are you supposed to get your job done when you’re wearing a costume? Even a legally themed costume would be pushing it at some firms. Other firms, however, take themselves a little less seriously, and encourage attorneys to deck themselves out for Halloween. But with that bit of joy can come some pretty embarrassing — and let’s face it, hilarious — moments.

Take, for example, a story that was recently shared on Twitter by [Matt Margolis](https://twitter.com/ItsMattsLaw/), the head of community at [Lawtrades](https://www.lawtrades.com/). His awesome(ly embarrassing) Halloween story happened when he was still working at a firm. Check it out:

It was around Halloween and we were all in costume at the office. I was a hotdog. My boss asked if I wanted to go to a deposition (my first) and help.“

“Can I could wear the costume.” Boss laughed and said yes. Retrospect, that was a joke.

Walked into the conference room and opposing counsel and his client both look at me like I have two heads.

“Why are you dressed like that?”

“It’s almost halloween.”

Midway through I took the costume off and we wrapped up the event. Put it back on and was invited to a cake contest that firm has going on. Politely declined and headed back. Never did that again.

One day I’ll trick a network into making a funny legal show and it will feature all of my dumb stories

Hot diggity dog! His costume didn’t cut the mustard for the depo, but let’s be frank, it made for a great story he’ll be able to relish in for years to come.

# A Deep Dive Into The 2021 Am Law 100 Rankings
## Last year was a difficult year for so many industries but a shockingly good one for Biglaw, at least in terms of metrics like gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per partner.

“Lawyers are terrible businesspeople.” You’ve surely heard this before. But is it true?

If lawyers are so bad at business, then why did the Am Law 100, the nation’s 100 largest law firms ranked by revenue, have such a banner year in 2020? In the midst of a global pandemic and economic downturn — one that hammered so many industries, from airlines to hospitality to commercial real estate — Biglaw firms flourished.

Last week, the American Lawyer issued its eagerly anticipated [Am Law 100 rankings for 2021](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/20/against-all-odds-the-am-law-100-were-stunningly-successful-in-2020/). As a group, here’s how the Am Law 100 fared in 2020 (as noted by Dan Packel in his excellent analysis of the data):

- Total revenue: $111 billion, up by 6.6 percent.
- Average revenue per lawyer: $1.05 million, up by 5 percent.
- Profits per equity partner: $2.23 million, up by 13.4 percent.
Who are you calling a terrible businessperson now? These growth rates exceeded those posted by the Am Law 100 in the far more normal year of 2019 (which were 5 percent, 3 percent, and 5 percent, respectively, for total revenue, RPL, and PPEP).

What drove the dramatic increase in profitability? Yes, cost-cutting did play a role; firms used the pandemic as an opportunity to make themselves more efficient, eliminating or reducing various expenses that they were already planning to cut (e.g., certain administrative roles, real estate costs, etc.).

But, at least collectively, the Am Law 100 didn’t juice their profits by slashing lawyer or even equity-partner headcount. Total attorney headcount actually grew slightly, rising by 1.7 percent to 105,718, and the number of equity partners remained flat (down by just 12 partners, to a new total of 21,258).

Let’s now take a closer look at the three key metrics — gross revenue, revenue per lawyer, and profits per partner — and the top 10 firms in each category.

Gross Revenue

Here are the top 10 firms in the 2021 Am Law 100 rankings, ranked by their gross revenue in 2020. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/20/the-2021-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/).



Kudos to Kirkland & Ellis and Latham & Watkins, once again the two top-grossing firms, which both grew their total revenue by double digits. All of the other top-10 firms also increased their revenue, except for Baker McKenzie, which saw a slight dip (perhaps due to the global nature of the firm; the U.S. legal market generally performed better than overseas markets last year).

As you can see, there wasn’t much change in terms of the rank order of the firms. Everyone kept their 2020 spots except for White & Case and Hogan Lovells, who swapped places; now White & Case is #8 and Hogan Lovells is #9.

In 2020, 42 firms enjoyed gross revenue in excess of $1 billion, one more than the 41 firms in 2019. Almost three-quarters of the Am Law 100 — 74 firms, to be precise — grew their gross revenue. On the strength of its capital markets practice, Davis Polk had the biggest gain, a whopping 22.6 percent. (For more on how Davis Polk pulled off such a great financial performance, see this [Bloomberg Law piece by Roy Strom](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/heres-the-secret-to-davis-polks-banner-2020-and-2021-so-far?context=search&index=24).)

Revenue Per Lawyer

Here are the top 10 firms in the 2021 Am Law rankings based on revenue per lawyer. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/20/the-2021-am-law-100-ranked-by-revenue-per-lawyer/).



As you can see, revenue per lawyer grew quite nicely among the top ten, with four firms posting double-digit growth. Once again, Wachtell Lipton and Sullivan & Cromwell took the top two spots — but Davis Polk zoomed up from #10 to #3. Two other firms known for strong capital markets practices, Cahill Gordon and Debevoise & Plimpton, also posted strong gains, breaking into the top 10.

Profits Per Equity Partner

And now, everyone’s favorite ranking: the top 10 firms by profits per equity partner. You can access the full list [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/20/the-2021-am-law-100-ranked-by-profits-per-equity-partner/).



As usual, Wachtell Lipton took the #1 spot, with an incredible $7.5 million in PPEP. But Kirkland & Ellis, in recent years the #2 firm, got bumped out of second place by Davis Polk, with $6.35 million. If 2021 turns out to be like 2020, it’s conceivable that Davis Polk could displace Wachtell as #1 in next year’s rankings (but based on the strong year that M&A is having so far, I wouldn’t necessarily count on that). As for the rest of the top 10, there wasn’t that much movement, except for the ascension of Cahill and Debevoise (which the revenue per lawyer rankings hinted at).

Taken collectively, the Am Law 100 performed well in terms of profitability. As the American Lawyer reports, average PPEP increased by 13 percent in 2020, and 56 firms enjoyed growth rates of at least 10 percent, compared to just 23 in last year’s rankings. So congratulations to Biglaw on its big success in 2020 — a year that was, to put it mildly, extremely challenging for so many of us.

Moving on from the rankings, I’d like to close with a personal announcement. As mentioned in passing in this [New York Times piece](https://nyti.ms/3e3m2y6) by media columnist Ben Smith, I’m returning to full-time writing as of next week. I’ve enjoyed recruiting, but one thing I’ve learned about myself over this crazy past year, including my [near-death experience with Covid-19](https://www.businessinsider.com/david-lat-coronavirus-harrowing-story-ventilator-2020-4), is that writing is what I truly love.

Back in December, I launched a new publication about legal affairs called [Original Jurisdiction](https://davidlat.substack.com/). I started off doing it for fun on the side, but I’ve realized after five months or so that I want to do it full-time and try to make a living out of it.

Original Jurisdiction comes out as both a newsletter and a blog; please feel free to [sign up](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/coming-soon) if interested. Right now it’s free, as it has been for the past five months. Next week, I will add paid subscriptions — which is how writers on the Substack platform earn a living — but there will always be lots of free content.

I have greatly enjoyed my two years at Lateral Link, in large part because of my amazing colleagues, and I wouldn’t have wanted to work at any other recruiting firm. I don’t think there’s another legal search firm out there that has such talented recruiters and does such an excellent job of encouraging and incentivizing them to work together as a team.

# Coming To A Biglaw Firm Near You: COVID-19 Vaccination Mandates
## Thanks, Biden.

The Biden announcement gives firms more cover to put in place mandates for returning to the office. They already had some cover, because a number of firms considered to be bellwethers have put those mandates in place. But the Biden announcement will cause that momentum to pick up.

— Kent Zimmermann, a law firm consultant with the Zeughauser Group, commenting on the [likely impact Biglaw firms will see](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/seyfarth-shaw-just-tightened-its-vaccine-mandate-will-other-firms-follow-2021-09-10/) in the wake of President Joe Biden’s vaccination (or weekly testing) mandate for companies with more than 100 employees. A great number of Biglaw firms have already [issued vaccination mandates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/law-office-reopening-tracker-2021/). Per [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/seyfarth-shaw-just-tightened-its-vaccine-mandate-will-other-firms-follow-2021-09-10/), Zimmerman doesn’t think law firms will institute “jab or job” policies, where unvaccinated employees could potentially be fired for refusing vaccination.

COVID-19 did more than just rock our healthcare system. It also caused great financial upheaval, and the legal industry — even those at elite Biglaw firms — was far from immune from the impacts. For months, Above the Law reported on the [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [furloughs, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/)and [associate salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-100-firm-turns-to-furloughs-and-salary-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/) that were rocking the profession. But now it’s clear that, at least for some firms, the worst seems to be behind them.

Lowenstein Sandler had [cut back on partner distributions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-200-firm-reduces-partner-draws-in-response-to-coronavirus-crisis/), but there’ve[ been signs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-biglaw-firms-on-a-lateral-hiring-spree-despite-the-pandemic/) the firm’s financial condition is pretty solid. Indeed, firm chairman and managing partner Gary Wingens [told Law.com ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/07/22/some-big-firms-are-walking-back-earlier-pay-cuts/)that after halting partner distributions from February through April, the firm was able to pay higher than usual distributions in May and June.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Clients and practices are far more resilient than we had feared heading into the recession, and even the practices that had a pretty severe demand shock in April are reversing and had come back pretty fast by June,” said Wingens.

The firm’s rebound has been buoyed largely by its bankruptcy and capital markets practices, but even its mergers & acquisitions practice is back to form:

“In our M&A practice, demand dropped by 35% year over year in April, but by the middle of June, demand was only off 5%,” Wingens said. “Not only did we see a lot of deals that went on hold in March and April come back, but we’re now seeing clients willing to do new M&A deals, even if they’re not physically getting together.”

Cozen O’Connor was working [to avoid layoffs and associate salary cuts ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/am-law-100-firm-deferring-partner-compensation-and-furloughing-staff/)during the worst of the economic uncertainty caused by COVID, but they also put partner distributions on hold and furloughed some administrative staff members. Firm executive chairman and CEO Michael Heller confirmed that, as of July 1, partners’ pay checks were back to normal. However, no word yet on what’s happened to the furloughed employees.

At Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, salaries (for anyone making over $40,000) were cut by [15 percent back in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-50-bclp-salary-cuts/) and the firm announced[ layoffs earlier this month](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-50-firm-to-lay-off-lawyers-and-staff-close-office/). Though the firm is not back to pre-COVID shape, they did decide to roll back the severity of the salary cuts, going from 15 percent cuts to 7.5 percent.

“After exceeding performance expectations during the first half of this extraordinary year, we’re pleased to begin rolling back salary reductions necessitated during the worst of the pandemic conditions,” BCLP co-chairs Lisa Mayhew and Steve Baumer said in a statement at the time of the recent changes.

Things are looking up in Texas too. [In May, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/covid-19-law-firm-austerity-comes-to-texas/)Munck Wilson Mandela reduced compensation for partners, associates, exempt directors, and managers, while some partners voluntarily deferred the entirety of their compensation for three months and some staff were furloughed or had their hours reduced. As of July 1, the firm has confirmed that all employees were back to their standard compensation.

Let’s hope more firms are able to roll back COVID-19 austerity measures — and soon.

# Hong Kong Law Firms Haven't Started To Panic, But That Day Is Coming
## This seems like this is going to be a problem.

If you’ve not been paying attention to Hong Kong lately, you may not have noticed the financial gateway to China [is in riot mode](https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/hong-kong-protests-airport-chaos-intl-hnk/index.html) and the airport is functionally closed for business for a second straight day.

The protests started over a proposed law that would force the city to extradite criminals to mainland China to face charges in China’s more confusing justice system — one that borders on “compromised” — instead of Hong Kong’s system with its roots in the English system. China’s put off the imposition of the law, but pointedly not withdrawn it prompting many to suspect it’s still coming. With all this in the midst of Trump’s trade war with China, is it time for Biglaw firms with a strong Hong Kong presence to begin to panic?

The protests themselves shouldn’t worry Biglaw outposts in China, but if international business perceives an erosion of the rule of law in Hong Kong — either through the imposition of the extradition law or a massive crackdown — the foundation of the Hong Kong market would crumble instantly. The whole economy rests on the idea that the Chinese government will remain true to its word to keep Hong Kong open — which spills over into providing confidence that other markets like Shanghai will also be governed softly. As [Bloomberg notes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/trade-war-latest-trump-hong-kong-china-economy-singapore):

Yet that’s only half the story. Hong Kong is an important gateway for capital, too. So the bigger fear is [the damage done](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-12/hong-kong-protesters-again-swarm-airport-as-violence-intensifies) to Hong Kong’s standing as a conduit between China and the rest of the world. Even if its economic relevance to China has faded over time, it’s still [an important valve](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-08-09/hong-kong-s-lam-promises-bold-measures-to-help-economy-video) for foreign money flowing into and out of the world’s second-biggest economy.

Hong Kong’s stock market clocks in at around $5 trillion and the M&A and IPO work generated in the city keeps a lot of lawyers busy. Mayer Brown, Linklaters, Baker McKenzie… most global firms have a presence there and it’s not a stretch to say that the pivot to law coming from the Big 4 accounting firms rests on a good deal on connections to the Hong Kong market too. If the flow of foreign capital through Hong Kong shuts down, there’s going to be a lot of turmoil in the legal industry. Bloomberg’s already expecting a recession in Hong Kong later this year — if capital flees in droves, that can turn a lot worse.

# New Warning For Biglaw Firms -- Not That They'll Listen Anyway
## The Biglaw model is going to have to change.

What will it take for Biglaw firms to wake up and see that the way they’ve “always” done business is not going to cut it anymore? Despite several [iterations of industry reports](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/law-firm-leaders-are-completely-confident-that-they-dont-have-much-confidence/) generously described as tepid, law firms seem entrenched in their stagnant ways, as they remain committed to “once-successful strategies even as evidence mounts of their failure.”

The most recent report comes from the Thomson Reuters Legal Executive Institute and the Center for the Study of the Legal Profession (CSLP) at the Georgetown University Law Center. Law firm growth is at a virtual standstill, with the Am Law 100 firms seeing a 1 percent increase in demand, and the second hundred in the rankings experiencing a decrease of 1 percent in demand. One report author is even hoping the results read as a wake-up call for the industry, as[ reported by](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2018/01/10/new-report-warns-of-a-wake-up-call-for-stagnant-law-firms/) Law.com:

“Our hope with this is that we can help build a kind of wake-up call,” said [James Jones](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/continuing-legal-education/executive-education/meet-our-team/James-Jones.cfm), an author of the report and former managing partner of Arnold & Porter who now serves as a senior fellow at Georgetown’s CSLP. “Because in point of fact, I think that law firms can have a real competitive advantage and be significantly successful if they will only do some of this basic stuff.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The report goes on to characterize the approach in biting terms — calling it consensual neglect:

“‘Consensual neglect’ seems a particularly apt description of the strategic posture of many (if not most) law firms in today’s rapidly changing market for legal services,” states the report. “Ignoring strong indicators that their old approaches—to managing legal work processes, pricing, leverage, staffing, project management, technology and client relationships—are no longer working, they choose to double down on their current strategies rather than risking the change that would be required to respond effectively to evolving market conditions.”

The report also [cites research](http://blogs.thomsonreuters.com/answerson/what-the-am-law-numbers-really-show/) by Bruce MacEwen that two-thirds of the increases in revenue for the Am Law 100 can be attributed to ~20 of the 100 firms, further illustrating the difference between the Biglaw haves and the have-nots.

“What is becoming increasingly clear is that the market in which law firms are required to operate today may in reality be quite different from the one that most law firm partners have fixed in their minds,” states the CSLP and Thomson Reuters report. “So far, the realignment of competition across the legal industry has been limited, but the direction of movement is clear and the pace of change is accelerating.”

If Biglaw firms don’t make a change they’ll see (even more) of their lunch eaten by alternative legal service providers like Axiom Global Inc., Consilio, and UnitedLex Corp. which have grown their industry to $8.4 billion in 2017.

Despite these challenges, Jones is somewhat optimistic about the state of the industry:

“[G]iven the types of competitors in the market, firms are going to have [to] work differently,” Jones said. “They’ll need to have different staffing models, be more multidisciplinary in the market. And that’s the hard part. But I’m optimistic that those that do will meet with some success. And the record indicates that.”

And all they have to do is change.

# Want To Be Happy? Don't Be A Lawyer.

‘Why did I pick this career?’

Law students and attorneys are struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues, and it continues to be an unspoken reality in law schools and law firms across the globe. In fact, according to a 2016 study conducted by the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation and the American Bar Association Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs, 21 percent of licensed, employed attorneys qualify as problem drinkers, 28 percent struggle with [some level of depression](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-struggle-law-students-suffer-from-high-rates-of-depression-and-binge-drinking/), 19 percent demonstrate symptoms of anxiety, and 23 percent are stressed out.

But does going to law school and becoming a lawyer cause depression? According to Alex Palmer, the author of [“Happiness Hacks,”](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Hacks-Scientific-Curiously-Effective/dp/1615194428) it certainly doesn’t help, and it likely doesn’t lead to much happiness. Here’s a relevent excerpt from his recent [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/dont-retire-early-buy-a-home-or-be-a-lawyer-if-you-want-to-be-happy-says-happiness-expert.html) piece about how to achieve long-term happiness.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
##5. Don’t be a lawyer
Maybe it’s all the lawyer jokes, but those who practice law have been found to be particularly unhappy. A [1990 study](https://www.scbar.org/media/filer_public/3d/25/3d25d564-bc05-468b-9cc0-6317004adb38/outline_for_lawyers_epidemic.pdf) from John Hopkins University found that lawyers were 3.6 times more likely than non-lawyers to suffer from depression. [Researchers](http://www.myassistplan.com/Content/LSUC/Articles/WhyLawyersareUnhappy.pdf) point to three main reasons as to why lawyers have a hard time finding happiness:

- Prudence is one of the main qualifications for lawyers, which can often translate to skepticism or pessimism.
- The high pressure put on and low influence given to young associates are the sort of work conditions that result in low morale in other workplaces.
- The work — at least in the U.S. — is often a zero-sum game where your win is someone else’s loss, creating a hyper-competitiveness that also drains one’s sense of workplace satisfaction.
No one is saying you can’t find happiness as a lawyer, but sad as it is, the deck may be stacked against you. Best of luck as you attempt to beat the odds.

Most law schools have counseling and psychological services resources that students and graduates can turn to if they are in crisis or would like counseling, even after hours. If these services are not available at your school, and if you or someone you know is depressed and in need of help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ([1-800-273-8255](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)) or a [lawyer assistance program](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state.html) in your state (don’t be fooled by the name; these programs also provide services to law students). Remember that you are loved, so please reach out if you need assistance, before it’s too late.

[Don’t retire early, buy a home, or be a lawyer if you want to be happy, researchers say — here’s why](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/dont-retire-early-buy-a-home-or-be-a-lawyer-if-you-want-to-be-happy-says-happiness-expert.html) [CNBC]

# He Wanted To Be 'More Successful' In Biglaw -- Why A Former Partner Tried To Sell Whistleblower Complaints
## Why did someone with such a successful legal career throw it all away?

Jeffrey Wertkin

Jeffrey Wertkin blew up his own career. This we know — hell, he knew it the second [he was arrested last February](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/akin-gump-lawyer-arrested-trying-to-sell-the-details-of-a-whistleblower-complaint/), when he told the arresting agent, “My life is over.” (Yeah, he was also wearing a disguise that included a wig at the time of his arrest.) But the $64,000 question underlying the arrest of the once-successful Georgetown-educated lawyer has always been, “Why?” Why did someone with such a successful legal career throw it all away?

For those who need a refresher on the Wertkin matter, he [pleaded guilty](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaw-partner-pleads-guilty-over-plot-to-sell-whistleblower-lawsuits/) to two charges of obstruction of justice and one count of transporting stolen goods across state lines for trying to sell an as-yet-unfiled whistleblower complaint to the target company for $310,000. He’d gotten hold of the complaint through his former work at the Justice Department prosecuting cases under the False Claims Act.

Now the plea agreement reveals his motivation for destroying his life — he wanted to be successful at Akin Gump, the Biglaw firm he’d recently joined as a partner. As [reported by](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/ex-justice-dept-lawyer-peddled-secret-us-whistleblower-suits-to-try-to-impress-his-bosses-with-new-clients/2018/01/24/49b7d934-e414-11e7-a65d-1ac0fd7f097e_story.html?utm_term=.ae47953ff34f) the Washington Post (yes, mainstream media has apparently figured out this scandal exists), he wanted to use the complaints he had access to while at Justice in order to solicit business at his new firm:

When he gathered up the cases in his last month on the federal job in April 2016, “I knew and understood that doing so was an illegal theft of the complaints and, during my exit process, I intentionally lied to the Department of Justice about taking the complaints with me,” Wertkin said in court at his plea hearing.

Exactly how many cases he stole or what he did with all of the information remains murky, but Wertkin was clear in his 10-page plea agreement about why he did it: “I began secretly reviewing and collecting complaints to identify clients to solicit for business when I was in practice and, thereby, to make myself more successful at Akin Gump.”

As part of the plea, prosecutors have agreed to not seek more than 30 to 37 months in jail for Wertkin, and from all reports the incident appears to be a break in character — though a pretty severe one:

“On its face, it’s a breakdown,” said a legal colleague who asked for anonymity to avoid jeopardizing a friendship with Wertkin and his pending sentencing. “It’s hard to understand and it’s not understandable, because it doesn’t fit anything else in his life. He was an unusually straight arrow.”

“Wertkin has resigned from the bar,” the person said, and is “back to the guy he’s always been” and is spending time taking care of his children.

At this time, in light of the charges pending against him, I do not see a law firm looking to add him to their roster. The reputational harm to the firm would be overwhelming.

— Sheri Michaels, a partner at legal recruiter Major, Lindsey & Africa, commenting on the [likelihood that any law firm would accept](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cuomo-confronts-post-albany-future-clouded-by-toxic-reputation) soon-to-be former New York governor [Andrew Cuomo](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/andrew-cuomo-resigns/) into its ranks. Cuomo, accused of sexually harassing 11 women, chose to resign on August 10 in lieu of being impeached by the state legislature. Mark Jungers, a legal recruiter in Milwaukee with Lippman Jungers Bala, said of Cuomo, “He will be considered poison or toxic for some time.”

# Thinking Like A Non-Lawyer

“Sue the bastards! This case is a laydown! They just copped a plea with the feds! You can’t lose, and you’d recover at least $10 million!”

“But your proposed defendant is a client of ours. It pays us $40 million in revenue every year.”

“Don’t worry about it! The defendant broke the law, not you. The feds caught the defendant red-handed! It can’t retaliate against you; that would be illegal. Not only that: We’re suing the same defendant for other clients, and the defendant hasn’t retaliated against a single one.”

“Suppose they fire us.”

“Huh?”

“I’m not worried about them counterclaiming against us. I’m worried about them firing us. They might prefer not to do business with someone who sued them for $10 million. Can’t they just fire us?”

“I suppose so.”

“So you think we should give up $40 million in annual recurring revenue for the sake of a one-time $10 million recovery?”

“Maybe you’re right. Forget about it.”

“Why do I have to forget about it?”

“Because, if you sue, they’ll fire you. That would be a stupid idea.”

“Suppose I don’t sue, but I still ask for the money?”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Huh?”

“We obviously know lots of people who work for your proposed defendant. After all, the company’s paying us $40 million every year. Couldn’t we have one of our senior executives call one of their senior executives, and ask for some money?”

“Ask for money? No one just gives away money.”

“We might say something like this: ‘I just read in the newspaper that your company engaged in a fraud that hurt many people. In fact, I see that your company pleaded guilty to criminal wrongdoing. I know that you’re an upstanding person, and I’m sure that you weren’t aware that low-level employees were stealing from your customers. You must be outraged that this happened.

“‘I’m also sure that you didn’t intend to steal money from us. I was just wondering what you, an upstanding business person, are thinking of doing to compensate longstanding customers from whom your employees have stolen money. Are you offering cash payments? Are you offering discounts on future services? What are you doing to make your longstanding customers whole? Do you want to take a few days to think about that and get back to me?'”

“They wouldn’t give you the $10 million.”

“Probably not. But they might give me something, and it wouldn’t cost me $40 million a year in revenue.”

“Hmmm . . . . ”

I understand that you’re a litigator, so you’re thinking of this as litigation. But we’re a business, and we have other things to consider.

We might not be able to sue your preferred defendant. Can we sue someone else? Recover a portion of the money without suing? How can we recast, or do without, your proposed lawsuit?

Or perhaps you’re finding opposing counsel to be simply impossible; you can’t make any progress negotiating with her.

Can our business folks call their business folks? Maybe we can work something out?

Or you can’t imagine where you’ll find the $5 million needed to bridge the gap between the settlement demand and the offer.

Does our company offer any products or services that might interest the other side? Maybe we can find something that’s worth $5 million. Better yet, maybe we can find something that’s worth $5 million to the plaintiff, but costs us only $1 million to provide. Or, better yet, maybe we can lock our opponent into a long-term contract with us, yielding revenue for years to come in exchange for providing a discount today.

Or who knows what.

There’s one topic as to which many litigators at firms seem to have a blind spot: Having spent years settling cases only by extracting cash from the unwilling, many litigators don’t consider that big companies may have personal relationships, or business clout, or goods or services to offer, or something else that’s worth a great deal in a negotiation.

Our in-house lawyers are keenly sensitive to this (although often not instinctively when they first come aboard).

Outside lawyers should think about this, too.

Sometimes, it’s best not to think like a lawyer.

Murray H. Shusterman

Amid the excitement over bonus season, some somber news seems to have been swept under the rug here at Above the Law. Although we mentioned this [briefly](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/non-sequiturs-12-06-16/) earlier in the week, the death of one of Biglaw’s only centenarians — a man who continued to practice law until his passing — deserves more than a blurb.

[Murray H. Shusterman](http://www.foxrothschild.com/murray-h-shusterman/) began practicing law in 1936, and he died this week at the age of 104. Shusterman was just five years younger than Fox Rothschild, the firm where he’d worked for almost 50 years (Shusterman was born in 1912, the firm was founded in 1907, and he started working there in 1969). When Shusterman joined the firm, only 25 lawyers worked there; the firm now boasts more than 750 lawyers and is now an Am Law 100 firm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Shusterman was a man who had dedicated his life to the law, so much so that he refused to retire from the firm he’d devoted almost half of his life to. Although his title at the time of his death was “senior counsel,” about 20 years ago, Shusterman was known as a [“senior partner”](https://books.google.com/books?id=ebT3FL1jomsC&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=Murray+Shusterman+fox+rothschild+partner&source=bl&ots=DSca529Z9b&sig=M-52vW_APpN6EkqwnDGuQucwdx4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nmvOU4fRPJKgyATezIL4AQ#v=onepage&q=Murray%20Shusterman%20fox%20rothschild%20partner&f=false) at Fox Rothschild. “What? Retire? Sit in a rocking chair and wait to die?” Shusterman said in a [2014 interview](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/a-101-year-old-attorney-is-still-working-at-this-biglaw-firm/?rf=1) with the Philadelphia Inquirer.

When speaking with the [Legal Intelligencer](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202774099030/Murray-Shusterman-of-Fox-Rothschild-Dies-at-104?slreturn=20161109125302), Abraham C. Reich, co-chair of Fox Rothschild, described Shusterman as “a real role model in terms of a family man, a lawyer’s lawyer, someone who was committed to the community and understood the concept of giving back.” Mark Silow, Fox Rothschild’s firmwide managing partner, had this to say of Shusterman: “Above all, Murray had an active mind and was always curious about politics, business and the law, literally right up to the moment he passed away.”

Several years ago, when Shusterman was asked to name the best and worst moments of his life, he gave a remarkably thoughtful answer, which now strikes a more poignant chord since his passing. Today, we share it with our readers:

There’s no such thing [as a best or worst moment]. A person has many experiences over time, some good, some bad. . . . The real secret is to be decent, to be fair, and to be forgiving.

# Biglaw Firm Organizes Twerking Class In The Name Of Gender Diversity
## The only asses you'll see here are those who came up with this law firm event.

Many Biglaw firms like to give their employees opportunities to bond and make connections over something besides their work. After all, it’s these small, human interactions that can really make the daily slog of law firm life bearable. But when organizing such programming, law firms time and time again find themselves falling into sexist and racist stereotyping.

Can you guess which Biglaw firm’s gender diversity committee organized a twerking class?

That would be Irwin Mitchell, which was ranked #24 in Legal Week’s most recent UK Top 100 (a revenue-based ranking that’s similar to the Am Law 100). According to [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-irwin-mitchell-boss-promotes-twerking-encourage-diversity), Niall Baker, the chairman of the firm’s asset management group, circulated an invitation on behalf of the firm’s gender diversity group, which came up with the idea for the class.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The invitation, open to everyone at the firm, was capped at a maximum of 20 people so the instructor could “offer individual input.” The invite recommended twerkers wear “a loose pair of shorts.”

“The class is designed to teach you the basis of Twerking,” said the email, and would include “routines as well as a Twerk choreography teaching you how to werQ to the beat.” …

The email described twerking as a “fun, effective way to get fit and stay in shape.”

Someone clearly wasn’t paying very much attention when this was suggested as an appropriate bonding activity, much less one to promote gender diversity. No one wants to shake their ass in a sexualized way at a firm-sponsored event. To refer to this as only as being tone deaf would be polite.

Here’s what a spokesperson from Irwin Mitchell said when reached for comment: “A professional dance workshop was arranged by our gender diversity group aimed at encouraging confidence, improving fitness and to raise money for a women’s domestic violence charity. Based on low engagement and feedback from colleagues we’ve taken the decision to cancel the class while still making a donation to the charity.”

Do better, Biglaw.

# What You Need To Know About Today’s Evolving Anti-Money Laundering Laws
## Regulators and prosecutors are focusing on the misuse of shell companies, offshore entities, trusts, and beyond.

While money laundering permeates today’s movies and TV — from dark dramas like Ozark to lighter fare like Good Girls — the practice is much more than a plot device in real life. 

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, anywhere [between $800 billion and $2 trillion](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html#:~:text=The%20estimated%20amount%20of%20money,goes%20through%20the%20laundering%20cycle.) is laundered each year. The United States Sentencing Commission reported the sentencing of [755 money laundering offenders](https://www.ussc.gov/research/quick-facts/money-laundering) in 2020, an increase of over 30% since 2016.

Today, regulators and prosecutors are focusing on the misuse of shell companies, offshore entities, trusts, and beyond. And while financial institutions are striving to comply, they’re also arguing for the need to reduce regulatory burdens and provide flexibility for new technologies and industries to grow.

It’s no surprise, then, that Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (“CFT”) regulation and enforcement continues to evolve, broaden, and become more sophisticated as launderers develop new and creative methods.

To help explain the unique legal challenges money laundering presents and the impact it has on financial institutions, executives, and professionals, PLI is offering a half-day program titled [Anti-Money Laundering 2022: Risks, Due Diligence and Compliance in an Evolving Legal World](https://www.pli.edu/programs/anti-money-laundering?t=live?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

The PLI program will cover some of the hottest money laundering topics today, including: 

- Why you, your clients, and other professionals should be concerned with money laundering and AML/CFT compliance
- Significant legislative and regulatory changes in this area
- The new beneficial ownership reporting required of millions of U.S. and foreign business entities
- The consequences for financial institutions’ AML program compliance
- Money laundering enforcement today, including the DOJ’s current focus
- How current AML/CFT regulations apply to cryptocurrency and digital assets, and how that might change going forward
We’re likely to see even more significant AML/CFT regulation, compliance, and enforcement in the year to come. To gain a practical understanding of this sophisticated area of law, [register today](https://www.pli.edu/programs/anti-money-laundering?t=live?tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

It’s just not the experience that ordinary people would have.

— Cooley’s Mike Rhodes, who represented Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Kylie Jenner in the high-profile defamation case brought by Rob Kardashian’s ex-fiancé Angela White a.k.a. Blac Chyna, [tells Law.com](https://www.law.com/litigationdaily/2022/05/10/keeping-up-with-cooley-how-techs-favorite-litigators-won-a-major-defamation-trial-for-the-kardashian-jenner-family/) about attending the premiere of the Hulu show “The Kardashians” as guest of the family. Of the case, he noted, “It was obviously a huge source of irritation to them because it was a family drama. As I said in my opening, this is a family drama that doesn’t have a happy ending.”

# Biglaw Firm Defers Associate Start Dates To 2023 Due To Work Slowdown
## Will other Biglaw firms decide to do the same thing with their incoming associates to save money?

The U.S. is staring down the possibility of a recession and inflation has skyrocketed. Business demand in Biglaw has slowed dramatically from its peak in 2021. Legal recruiters say that “demand for associates no longer exceeds supply.” [Outright layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/law-firm-lays-off-10-of-all-timekeepers-due-to-decrease-in-demand/) and [hiring freezes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/) have already happened and more may soon be on the way (not to mention [stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-dreaded-stealth-layoff-rears-its-ugly-head/), which may already be happening). According to tipsters, incoming associates, once so happy-go-lucky about starting their Biglaw jobs, might want to start getting worried about their futures. Perhaps these soon-to-be first-year associates won’t be associates — at least any time “soon.”

Why’s that? The deferral is making a comeback.

[Back in 2009](https://abovethelaw.com/deferral-stipend/), when Biglaw firms were faced with the problem of too many employees and not enough work, they came up with a unique plan to deal with this issue: the deferral. (This was part of a larger plan to deal with The Great Recession and also included mass layoffs, stealth layoffs, hiring freezes, and pretty much whatever Biglaw firms could think of to save a few bucks.) Incoming first-year associates’ start dates were delayed for up to a year (or [sometimes longer](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/08/dla-piper-defers-half-the-class-of-2010-to-2012/)) and many received compensation for going away with the understanding that they would be able to come back to the firm and resume their Biglaw careers after the deferral. Unfortunately, even the best laid plans fall apart, and some associates weren’t welcomed back to their firms on time — or at all, ever.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer — which adopted the Cravath scale back in March, offering [salaries of up to $425,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/gunderson-reraise-2022/) to its most senior associates — reportedly announced a deferral program for incoming first-years late last week. Gunderson is the first major firm that we know of to defer its incoming associates’ start dates this year.

Sources tell us that that the firm has delayed its new associates’ start date, firmwide, from October 31, 2022, to January 17, 2023. Partners communicated the temporary deferral to incoming associates by phone, and they were told the reason behind their stalled start date was that “demand has slowed significantly.” It was suggested that start dates for incoming associates could be delayed even further if demand remains slow.

Deferred associates will receive a monthly stipend of about $6,000, but the firm will not provide health insurance until associates actually start in January (or later). Given that first-year associates at the firm make $215,000 annually, Gunderson’s deferral stipend is just a fraction of what they’d be making if they started working on time. That’s certainly one way for the firm to save money during a slowdown in work.

We reached out to the firm several times to confirm these deferrals and for comment otherwise but did not immediately hear back. If and when we do, we will provide an update.

UPDATE (7:30 p.m.): A Gunderson spokesperson confirmed the deferrals and noted that because this is a personnel matter the firm had nothing more to say.

Now that one Biglaw firm has reportedly deferred its start date for incoming associates, we suspect that more firms will be comfortable doing the same. We will continue our coverage should this become an industry-wide trend.

# A Federal Judge And His Twitter Account: A Cautionary Tale
## Do you think this judge crossed the line in his use of social media?

Lawyers and Twitter can be a dangerous combination. Just ask [this Biglaw partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/biglaw-partners-tweets-spark-fbi-interest/), or [this one](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/a-biglaw-partners-big-twitter-meltdown/).

Judges on Twitter raise issues as well. I’ve previously written [in defense of judicial tweeting](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/09/judges-on-twitter-is-this-a-problem/) — based in part on exemplars like Justice [Don Willett](https://twitter.com/justicewillett) of Texas, who’s entertaining, enlightening, and ethical in his tweets. But a case currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit does present concerns.

United States v. Sierra Pacific Industries arises out of the [Moonlight Fire](http://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-burn-down-the-law-1420242330?alg=y), a 2007 wildfire that scorched almost 65,000 acres of California land before its containment. The federal government blamed the fire on Sierra Pacific, a lumber producer that the government accused of negligence in the hiring and supervision of a logging contractor. Sierra Pacific settled with the government, without admitting liability. But now, in the wake of [serious doubts](http://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-burn-down-the-law-1420242330?alg=y) about the propriety of the government’s investigation, Sierra Pacific seeks to vacate the settlement, arguing that it was reached as the result of a fraud on the court.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Judge [William B. Shubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_B._Shubb) (E.D. Cal.) denied Sierra Pacific’s motion to terminate the settlement. Sierra Pacific is now appealing that ruling to the Ninth Circuit. Here’s the Twitter issue, raised on page 80 of Sierra Pacific’s [opening brief](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sierra-Pacific-opening-brief.pdf) (citations and footnotes omitted):

Judge Shubb issued his order denying Defendants’ motion on April 17, 2015, at 2:45 p.m. Over the next two hours, the Sacramento AUSAs used their “[@EDCAnews](https://twitter.com/edcanews)” Twitter account to broadcast eight congratulatory Tweets concerning Judge Shubb’s order and the case’s merits to their office’s Twitter followers. Defendants have since confirmed that, through his then-public Twitter account, titled “[@nostalgist1](https://twitter.com/nostalgist1),” Judge Shubb “followed” @EDCAnews and thus received those Tweets. The mere existence of social network relationships between a judge and one of the parties appearing before him creates an appearance of bias and raises “significant concern” regarding the risk of ex parte communications. Those concerns materialize when a “followed” party posts Tweets regarding the case’s merits and the judge’s reasoning, which are then directed to the judge in his capacity as a follower.

This might seem like pretty minor stuff. One could dismiss Sierra Pacific’s complaints as little more than hurt feelings — especially when the company complains in a footnote that “Sierra Pacific has a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/sierrapacificin) as well, which Judge Shubb does not follow.” But there’s more going on here:

Additionally, that evening at 9:51 p.m., Judge Shubb completed the feedback loop by posting on his @nostalgist1 public Twitter account: [“Sierra Pacific still liable for Moonlight Fire damages.”](http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=28175) Just beneath this post, Judge Shubb linked to an article with the same title from the Central Valley Business Times.

Contrary to Judge Shubb’s imprimatur, the title was false. Sierra Pacific was never found liable and has paid no damages. Indeed, [retired Superior Court] Judge [Leslie C.] Nichols, the only neutral to evaluate the merits of this joint prosecution, found the government’s partner unable to make a prima facie case against Defendants. In the federal settlement, Defendants expressly disclaimed liability and have never paid a cent in damages.

Now this strikes me as problematic. Judges shouldn’t tweet about cases pending before them, even if the tweets are just links to news articles. This argument by Sierra Pacific seems persuasive to me:

Judge Shubb’s inaccurate public post violates Canon of Judicial Conduct 3A(6) and only increases the appearance of bias. It also prejudices Sierra Pacific and all Defendants in the pending state court appeal regarding the Moonlight Fire. When a judge selectively posts third-party communications pertaining to his or her cases, it necessarily creates the appearance of bias, especially with respect to articles that are inaccurate and prejudicial. The act of picking and choosing one article of many reveals a willingness to step out of the role of a neutral. By assenting to and posting a particular article, the court entangles itself with the message and slant of that article, thereby creating the appearance of having picked sides or of favoring one spin over another.

Sierra Pacific drops a footnote imagining the shoe on the other foot:

The government would, of course, also have cause for concern if Judge Shubb Tweeted “Prosecutors Burn Down The Law” and linked to the Wall Street Journal’s [Moonlight Fire editorial](http://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-burn-down-the-law-1420242330) with that title, or if he had Tweeted “A wildfire of corruption” and linked to the Washington Post’s [Moonlight Fire opinion piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kathleen-parker-talk-about-a-wildfire/2014/12/16/bf10b7d2-8567-11e4-b9b7-b8632ae73d25_story.html) of that title.

After the government sent Judge Shubb a letter informing him that his Twitter usage was being raised on appeal, Judge Shubb changed his account from “public” to “protected,” meaning that only approved followers can see his tweets. But he didn’t delete his account; you can see it (and send him a follow request) [here](https://twitter.com/nostalgist1).

I’m troubled by Judge Shubb’s tweeting (for the reasons set forth in Sierra Pacific’s [Ninth Circuit brief](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sierra-Pacific-opening-brief.pdf) and [motion for judicial notice](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Moonlight-Request-for-Judicial-Notice-Excerpts.pdf)). As Judge Simone Marstiller notes in [Social Media 101 for Judges](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xyyftwuzvz6ux6x/Social%20Media%20101%20for%20Judges.pdf?dl=0) (gavel bang: [Justice Willett](https://twitter.com/JusticeWillett/status/667018410396549121)), judges on Twitter should exercise good judgment, self-censoring when appropriate: “Before sending or responding to a tweet, DO ask yourself whether your statement could be seen as inappropriate, or could convey partiality or bias.”

But perhaps I’m being a stick in the mud? And we don’t yet have the government’s brief, which will presumably defend Judge Shubb’s actions. Readers, what do you think?

UPDATE (11/30/2015, 5:00 p.m.): Here is the government’s [defense of Judge Shubb](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/an-update-on-the-federal-judge-and-his-twitter-account/) (if, in fact, it was Judge Shubb doing the tweeting — which the government argues isn’t a proper subject for judicial notice). Thoughts?

Judge Shubb's Twitter activity in the Sierra Pacific case is:

- Proper - this is really trivial stuff.
- Improper - judges shouldn't tweet about cases before them.

# Biglaw Partner Calls Out Associates Unwilling To Drag Their Asses To The Office Three Times A Week
## Maybe now's not the time to be pushy.

If Above the Law wrote an article in 2019 that a Biglaw was telling its associates they only need to be in the office three days a week, then it would’ve been hailed as the ultimate perk. I mean who wouldn’t want to fire up the old VPN and avoid face time a few days a week?

But we all know what happened in 2020. COVID changed a lot of people’s expectations of the best way to get their job done. And now that we are finally, mercifully, largely out of the acute phase of the pandemic, reconciling the old way of doing things with the survival techniques of the last few years is the order of the day.

For the most part, Biglaw has settled into a [hybrid work schedule](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/law-firm-reopenings/), with most firms asking attorneys to come to the office two to three days a week. Well, it’s less of a request and more of a requirement — at least at Ropes & Gray. The firm got major kudos for a slow ramp up in their [back-to-the-office plans.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/ropes-grays-reopening-plan-puts-an-end-to-the-5-day-in-office-workweek-for-associates/) It’s been over a month since chair Julie Jones explained the firm’s expectation of three days in the office, preferably Tuesday through Thursday, for attorneys.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But it turns out, not everyone has been adhering to that schedule. As such, litigation co-chair John Bueker reached out to attorneys in that group who have not been coming around the office that much to let them know it’s no longer acceptable ([full email on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/ropes-three-days-a-week/2/)):

I’m writing because our group’s response to Julie’s May 5 email continues to fall far short of where it needs to be. Now four weeks later, too many are still not coming into the office at least three days per week, consistent with the firm’s expectations. You are receiving this email because attendance records show you have not met the firm’s expectations in three of the four weeks since Julie sent her email. That has to change now.

As Julie underscored, in-person presence is critical to you and others at the firm in a number of respects. Expectations for success at Ropes & Gray include mentoring (mentoring others and being mentored), teaching, learning, and giving and receiving feedback. You are expected to be a part of, and to contribute to, the Ropes community in many ways beyond billing hours. Not all of them can be accomplished via Zoom or on the other end of a phone call. In-person interactions are necessary to your career development and advancement, and to the development of your younger colleagues. Those interactions foster the collaborative culture that we value, and they allow you to get to know your colleagues in a more meaningful way.

Bueker’s email also notes if there is a special circumstance preventing three days in the office, attorneys should reach out and discuss their concerns. But folks who just feel like they can do their job from home ergo they should be able to do their job from home are out of luck. And as [summer associates who are eager to go to the office](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/where-the-push-for-biglaw-return-to-the-office-is-really-coming-from/) are now around, it’s easy to see why the hammer is dropping on the in-person attendance policy.

And Ropes is far from an outlier. Fully remote law firm jobs are [not nearly as prevalent](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/remote-roles-may-be-going-extinct-for-biglaw-associates-and-staffers/) as they used to be. Plus the booming demand for associate talent is waning, with some industry vets [warning of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/biglaw-business-is-booming-obviously-its-time-to-talk-about-layoffs/) on the horizon. Perhaps now isn’t the time for associates to be pushy for a more generous hybrid work schedule.

# Am Law 50 Firm Demands Massive Tax Breaks, Sues Government For Not Handing Them Over
## Sometimes it's about 'should we file this suit,' not 'can we file this suit.'

In defense of Dechert, they’re doing exactly what crafty lawyers eyeing a loophole should be doing.

The Am Law 50 firm moved its headquarters to Philadelphia’s Cira Centre in 2005, taking advantage of a tax break program that Pennsylvania offers businesses to move into developments in formerly run-down areas. Since taking up residence in Cira Centre, Dechert’s paid virtually no state or local business taxes in exchange for Dechert’s role in making the area an attractive business destination.

But the program expired in 2018, so when the Keystone Opportunity Zone program eyed a new tax-free area in Schuylkill Yards, Dechert walked up and asked to move there too.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
There’s nothing in the law to say companies can’t hop from zone to zone to remain permanently tax-free, and when authorities denied Dechert’s request to continue not paying its taxes, [the firm took the government to court](https://www.inquirer.com/business/dechert-law-firm-philadephia-tax-breaks-keystone-opportunity-zone-20200308.html).

On the one hand, by moving to the new location, Dechert’s asking to be rewarded for bailing on the first opportunity zone. On the other hand, Dechert’s right that the law doesn’t account for the stopping businesses from “zone hopping” and Dechert’s attorneys argue that Dechert’s already done its job and that Cira Centre can now fill its potential Dechert-sized vacancy with any number of willing tenants who won’t mind paying their taxes. They feel the firm should be rewarded for volunteering to march into a new frontier a second time.

These stadium deal-style tax breaks have a [pretty bad record for the cities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcwJt4bcnXs) when all is said and done, but states keep doing them, one of the many “race to the bottom” side effects of Federalism in the modern age where entities can play state governments off each other. At one point there was a concerted effort to force the businesses taking these tax breaks to aid in the development of the neighborhood — not so much anymore. From the Inquirer:

Originally a company had to either boost employment by 20% or invest at least 10% of its total revenue from the previous year. The new way to qualify just required a company to sign a lease covering the duration of the zone and to spend at least 5% of the previous year’s revenue on rent.

Much like the much-publicized Amazon headquarters deal in New York, the logic is that increased taxes on wages will pay for the business tax cuts. During the run of the deal, Dechert reduced headcount from 700 in 2005 to 461 last year.

But that’s surely going to totally turn around with these new tax breaks!

After [Linklaters announced bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/the-first-magic-circle-firm-pulls-money-out-of-its-hat/) following the Cravath scale, it was only a matter of time before another Magic Circle firm would follow suit. And not much time: Clifford Chance just announced a market match as well. From the bonus memo:

Class Year

Bonus

2009 and senior

$100,000

2010

$100,000

2011

$90,000

2012

$80,000

2013

$65,000

2014

$50,000

2015

$25,000

2016

$15,000

2017

$15,000 (pro-rated)

As is standard practice at Clifford Chance, bonuses will be paid next year, on January 12, 2018, to be exact. This leaves us wondering whether we’ll hear from the remaining Magic Circle firms — Allen & Overy and Freshfields — today. Quick, associates! We all know that your Patronuses are hundred-dollar bills, so the sooner you conjure them up, the sooner your bank accounts will thank you.

That’s our take on the Clifford Chance bonuses. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we promise we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Law School Students Protest Outside Of DLA Piper Over Alleged Sexual Assault
## They're keeping the pressure up on the Biglaw firm.

The heat is getting turned up on DLA Piper. When[ partner Vanina Guerrero wrote an open letter to the leaders of the firm accusing a fellow partner, Louis Lehot, of sexual assault](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-fellow-partner/), she also asked the firm to release her from the mandatory arbitration agreement which is a condition of employment at DLA Piper. So far, the firm hasn’t responded to this request, but that silence hasn’t gone unnoticed.

Kamala Harris, who is married to DLA Piper partner Douglas Emhoff, [weighed in on the subject in support of Guerrero’s right to go to court](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/kamala-harris-gets-dragged-into-dla-piper-sexual-assault-controversy/) rather than confidential arbitration. And now a group of student activists organized as the People’s Parity Project (formerly the Pipeline Parity Project) have taken to the streets in front of three of DLA Piper’s offices to protest the firm’s use of mandatory arbitration agreements.

This isn’t the first time law school students have protested DLA over their arbitration agreements. An online campaign urged fellow law students to[ #DumpDLA](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/) and there were organized[ protests](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) earlier this year. But with the attention currently focused on the firm, and a specific case and victim that wants to use the court system but is being barred from doing so, well, the time’s ripe to pound the pavement.

In their [statement about the action](https://www.peoplesparity.org/future-lawyers-take-to-the-streets-to-protest-forced-arbitration-of-sexual-assault-at-dla-piper/), students focused on the harms of mandatory arbitration:

DLA Piper has been a longtime target of the People’s Parity Project for its refusal to end its policy of forced arbitration, but the firm has stood proudly behind the practice. Ms. Guererro’s account of the firm’s hostile environment is a powerful reminder of how important it is for workers to be able to hold corporations accountable. “We now know why firms like DLA Piper refuse to give up forced arbitration,” said Elisabeth Campbell, a 2L at New York University School of Law. “Forced arbitration enables bad actors to cover up and avoid accountability for their gross misconduct.”

And they intend to keep up the fight:

Grace Bennett, a 1L at Harvard Law School, said that law students showed up because we have the power to change the legal profession for the better. “Law firms like DLA Piper have shown that they won’t change their policies without a fight. They have to be forced to, and we have to keep showing up because people like Vanina Guerrero shouldn’t have to fight for their basic rights on the job.”

They’ve also started an [online petition at coworker.org](https://www.coworker.org/petitions/dla-piper-dump-forced-arbitration) for others that want to amp up the pressure on DLA Piper.

# Biglaw Midlevel Associates Tie High Billable Hours To Their Mental Health Concerns
## Burnout is real for midlevels and the billable hour is to blame.

Making it to midlevel in Biglaw isn’t easy — especially in the wake of a pandemic. First you had to break into Biglaw in the first place (which can be quite difficult, especially if you didn’t go to a top law school or earn top grades). Then you had to survive the high stress and long hours. Finally, you needed to endure and somehow persevere through the incredibly uncertain times COVID-19 brought upon the legal profession and the world at large (though we’re sure the special bonuses and pay raises had to have helped a little).

But if you did make it to your firm’s midlevel ranks during the past few years, it was arguably more difficult than ever — and these associates have simply had enough. The American Lawyer just released its midlevel associates survey, and as noted by Dan Roe, “They kept firms going, they made partners rich, and now they plan to reshape the profession in their image.” He goes on to explain that midlevel associates seem to be doing better than they were last year, but under the surface, trouble may be brewing. Here’s more:

On paper, Big Law midlevel associates are doing better than they were last year. In The American Lawyer’s 2022 Midlevel Associate Survey, the average associate gave their firm a score of 4.36 out of 5, up from 4.29 last year. Associates’ perceived likelihood of being at their firm in two years also rose slightly, and 32% said they felt morale was higher than last year (50% said it was the same). Talent shortages appear to have improved, too, with 10% fewer associates saying they felt their firm was too leanly staffed, compared to the previous year.

However, on other key metrics of personal and professional fulfillment, associate satisfaction is still moving in the wrong direction. The same number of associates said they felt depressed and anxious compared to 2021. As many firms push in-office work, more than half of associates said hybrid flexibility was decreasing their odds of burnout. Over three-quarters said their job at a law firm had significantly impacted their mental health, and 52% said they’d consider quitting for more work-life balance.

To come up with these results, Am Law asked midlevel associates to evaluate how satisfied they are with their firm on a variety of different questions: compensation and benefits; training and guidance; relations with partners and other associates; interest in and satisfaction level with the work; the firm’s policy on billable hours; and management’s openness about firm strategies and partnership chances. And what came up time and again in respondents’ answers? This year, work-life balance and mental health are in the crosshairs, and high billable hours expectations are to blame.

Asked what they would change about their firms and the profession as a whole, over 1,000 associates talked about the direct relationship between high billable hour expectations and poor physical and mental health. The more hours firms required associates to bill, the more the long hours and lack of boundaries made their lives worse.

“We can’t plan a workout, healthy meals, or even time off with friends when a client’s ‘emergency’ (nothing a corporate client needs is actually an emergency) could pop up unexpectedly and interrupt it,” said a Greenberg Traurig associate. “This leads to high stress, poor sleep, lack of exercise, and eating too much fast food and takeout. All those are going to have a negative impact on mental health, and no amount of wellness webinars or weekly emails with wellness tips are going to change that.”

Another area of concern for midlevels was the availability of hybrid or remote work arrangements. Of the 300 or so associates who raised this issue, almost all said that they enjoy the flexibility these opportunities offer, and many wanted even more flexibility. The call for associates to return to the office has been met with displeasure. Here’s just one example:

A McDermott Will & Emery associate remarked that the firm coincidentally stopped circulating a happiness survey at the time it started asking associates to return to the office. “Associate mental health is more important than trying to impress Jamie Dimon by forcing everyone back into the office,” the associate said. “You’re wasting our time and money, making us less productive and miserable, and there is no benefit to it.”

That’s right, GT Miami is now on a lockstep salary scale that comes with a 2,000-hour billables target. Here’s what that looks like:



Associates at the firm could not be happier, and insiders at the firm tell us that partners were particularly proud to have been able to make this announcement.
