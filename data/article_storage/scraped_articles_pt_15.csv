# A Biglaw Behemoth's Weak-Sauce Raise
## First-year associates get $180K, but only in certain offices; pay for more-senior associates remains TBD; and the raise doesn't happen until September.

When Cravath [announced its new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/2/) two weeks ago today, I predicted that some firms might get cute on the “matching.” I wrote, “Expect some firms to adopt that $180,000 starting salary, so they can give the impression of keeping up with the Cravathians, but then pull the trick of [salary compression](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/on-growing-forever-when-the-economy-is-not/) (i.e., tiny pay increases for more-senior associates).”

Most of the [salary news](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/) we’ve covered so far has involved a complete or near-complete match of the Cravath scale (with occasional cases of senior associate compensation getting capped). But the latest announcement, from the [tenth-largest firm ranked by U.S. lawyer headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/whats-the-biggest-law-firm-in-the-country/), sounds like it falls well short of a “true” match.

Here are the key aspects of the pay raise just announced by [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/) ([full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-biglaw-behemoths-weak-sauce-raise/2/)):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
1. First-year associate salaries in ten offices — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Dallas, Houston, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and Orange County — are going from $160,000 to $180,000.

2. Salaries for second- through eighth-year associates in these ten lucky markets will also go up, but “the amounts of those increases are still being determined,” based on market conditions and individual performance. (One source called this move “typical” for K&L Gates.)

3. Several big offices are not included in the raise. They include Pittsburgh, where legacy firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart got its start, and Seattle, where legacy firm Preston Gates was launched. Compensation in these other cities is under review, and “any additional increases [will be announced] shortly.”

4. The raise isn’t going into effect on July 1, the date set by Cravath and followed almost universally by other firms; instead, it will go into effect on September 19, “the arrival date of most of our incoming first-year associates.” That’s almost three months later than the rest of Biglaw. K&L Gates is famously conservative on its finances, but c’mon, partners — a timely raise could have been funded quite easily from the [nine-figure fee from the Carnegie Mellon settlement](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/good-news-out-of-the-kl-gates/).

So this isn’t the greatest raise ever. But given that PPP at K&L Gates is only [$870,000](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202755653273/Firms-Ranked-by-Profits-Per-Partner), which puts it at #84 in the Am Law 100, and given that the firm has been [losing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/why-are-so-many-partners-walking-out-the-kl-gates/) [partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/what-the-kl-is-going-on-ten-more-partners-pass-through-the-gates/) to better-paying competitors at a decent clip this year, K&L associates might not have huge cause for complaint. (Those associates seeking better comp can, of course, follow the example of partners and lateral right out of the K&L Gates.)

# The Biglaw Firm That Started The Special Bonus Party Is Now Offering Bigger, Better Special Bonuses
## This was worth the wait.

Back in September, one of the top-ranked Biglaw firms in the country started a trend that would rock the industry in terms of 2020 associate compensation.

Cooley — a firm that brought in $1,329,329,000 gross revenue in 2019, placing it at No. 23 on the latest Am Law 100 ranking — announced that it would be offering [special appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) to its associates for all of the hard work they put in during the especially trying times that were created by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the firm’s bonuses ranged from $2,500 to $7,500, and associates were thrilled by the good news. Then, Davis Polk got involved and offered [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) that completely blew the Cooley numbers out of the water — and the rest of Biglaw followed, matching the new $7,500 to $40,000 range left and right as part of their year-end bonuses.

For a while there, it seemed as if Cooley was going to leave its associates hanging, as [the firm remained silent](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-got-the-bonus-party-started-but-doesnt-sound-like-theyll-be-following-the-leader/) on whether it would cover the difference between its original bonuses and the DPW bonuses that became the prevailing market standard.

Cooley has finally decided to speak up, and lo and behold, associates at the firm will be getting a second installation of special bonuses that will bring them up to market rates. Check out the new Cooley bonus scale, below:



All those eligible for these additional appreciation bonuses at Cooley will receive them on February 12. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses, But Not Every Associate Is Taking Home Money
## To their credit, at least the firm is transparent about their bonus process.

Here’s the thing about bonuses at Goodwin Procter: not every associate is going to take home a bonus. To their credit, the firm is transparent about their bonus process, so there shouldn’t be too many unfortunate surprises this bonus season. For bonuses [based on 2016 work](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/associate-bonus-watch-no-news-is-good-news/), only 68 percent received bonuses, and for [2017 work, there was an uptick](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/associate-bonus-watch-the-good-news-keeps-on-coming/) to 77 percent getting bonuses. Now comes their announcement for 2018 bonuses, and there’s another uptick but still a far cry from the firms that have no hard hours requirements and are lockstep bonuses.

According to an email sent last week by William Weiss, chair of the Attorney Review Committee, 83 percent of associates will be getting bonuses this year:

This year, 83% of associates are eligible to receive bonuses.  Of those receiving bonuses, 37% will receive an amount greater than the amount listed for their class, 60% will receive their class amount, and 3% will receive less than their class amount.

The bonus scale at the firm matches the familiar one established by Cravath in November:



The hours requirement at the firm is 1,950 hours, and from there associates can either scale up or down from the standard bonus amount depending on their rating and experience level:

All senior and mid-level associates who received a Successfully Achieves Frameworks rating will receive the full class amount starting at the lowest hour range.  In addition, associates who record ARC hours materially higher than 1,950 hours and associates who received a Distinctive rating will receive bonuses above their class amounts.  Only associates receiving a Below Frameworks rating will receive less than the full class amount. 

This year ARC will not give ratings to junior associates (classes of 2016 and 2017) except for associates who perform below the frameworks set forth for junior associates.  We have determined that focusing on feedback and development is more appropriate for associates beginning their legal careers.  Junior associates who met the 1,950 ARC hours threshold will receive the full class bonus amount unless they are performing below frameworks (in which case they will receive less than the full class amount).  Those who materially exceeded the hours threshold will receive higher bonuses.

# Check It Out: Quinn Emanuel's Bold New Lateral Hire Strategy
## The firm is bucking tradition again.

Quinn Emanuel has long been a firm looking to disrupt the usual path of legal recruiting. Two years ago they announced they were basically [ending their summer associate program](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/) — the traditional method Biglaw uses to restock its ranks –and focusing on hiring 3Ls, clerks, and laterals.

But it isn’t easy to hire good lateral associates — you’re getting a project some other firm has started, and you can’t be sure exactly what’s under the hood. There’s also the secrecy surrounding the process, as midlevel associates probably don’t want to advertise to their superiors that they’re looking for a new firm, plus the fees firms pay to legal recruiters to ensure they get the best and the brightest of the lot.

Once again, Quinn is finding a new and interesting way to do things, sending invitations to a “conversation” to the crème de la crème of midlevel associates in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The solicitation seeks midlevels for discussion, opinions, and refreshments, in the hopes the firm will find someone they are interested in bringing on.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The events, one in each of the three locations, are designed as more than just a cocktail party. Each hour will serve as its own session and focus on a specific thought-provoking prompt, and candidates (though it maybe too early in the process to really call them that) will be scheduled to discuss one of the following:

- Artificial Intelligence: Can we expect AI to exercise sound judgment?
- Generational Stereotyping: on point or prejudicial?
- Brainstorm: the necessary and expected skills the make for great trial lawyers.
- Lawyers in Balance: litigation can be part of a diverse life and personal obligations often feel like work.
- Loyalty and Lateral Change: where guilt and career advancement intersect.
- To Represent or Not To Represent: what do lawyers do when this question gets sticky?
Naturally, the firm will take care to ensure midlevels from the same firm aren’t in the same session — it might be embarrassing to know your colleague is also looking to jump ship.

It really is a departure from how things usually go in Biglaw, but with Quinn do you expect anything different?

Suppose you receive the court’s decision on summary judgment in the client’s Jarndyce case.  You send the decision along to the client, accompanied by this cover email:

“Here’s the decision in the Jarndyce case.  After you’ve had a chance to read it, please give me a call.”

What grade do you get for your work on the case?

You did nothing to make the client’s life easier, and you added no value.  Your email could as easily have said:

“Here’s the decision in the Jarndyce case.  I’m not going to tell you whether I read it, and I’m not going to tell you what it says.  Read if for yourself.  I realize that this email could have been written by a chimpanzee, but you don’t pay chimpanzees 700 bucks an hour, so I’m obviously not a chimpanzee.  After you’ve had a chance to read the decision, please give me a call.”

On reflection, perhaps you agree that you could have done more?

So you do more.  Suppose, instead, that you write this email:

“Here’s the decision in the Jarndyce case.  We won!  After you have a chance to read the decision, please give me a call.”

What grade do you get for your work on the case?

C.

This is better.  You proved that you read the decision, and you saved the client the time of popping open the decision and reading it.  But your email could as easily have said:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Here’s the decision in the Jarndyce case.  We won!  Of course, the kid down the block could have read the decision and told you whether we won or lost, and the kid down the block doesn’t charge you 700 bucks an hour.  Come to think of it, maybe you should have retained the kid down the block.  If you choose instead to stick with me, after you read the decision, please give me a call.”

Perhaps you could have done better still?

Suppose, instead, that you write this email:

“Here’s the decision in the Jarndyce case.  We won!  The court grounds its decision in two principles:  Point A and Point B.  The decision on Point B will be useful in the Summerson case that we’re handling for you because . . . .

“Although we won summary judgment, the co-defendant did not.  This decision is therefore not final as to all parties, and we don’t yet have to worry about an appeal.  After you’ve had a chance to read the decision, please give me a call.”

What grade do you get for your work?

I’m not sure.

But this is far better than the last two emails.  Whether you get a B, an A, or an A+ turns on the quality of your analysis.  Are you simply spewing pablum, or are you saying things that are new and insightful?

But at least we’re grading your work as a lawyer.

The work is suitable for grading.  You’re making the client’s life easy.  You’re telling the client what lies ahead.  You’re thinking about cases.  You’re doing the sort of things that lawyers do.

Got it?

Okay, then here’s a practice question, to help you to think about what you’ve learned.  You receive a series of several long emails relating to a case.  You need the client to answer one question contained in the string of emails.  The question appears on the third line on page six.  What do you say in your email to the client?

Choice 1:  “I’ve attached a chain of emails.  Please let me know what you think.”

Choice 2:  “I’ve attached a chain of emails.  Please let me know the answer to the question that appears on the third line of page six.”

Choice 3:  “We have a question that we think only you can answer:  [Recite the question, perhaps quoting what’s on the third line of page six.]  If you need any background information, you’ll see that the question appears on the third line of page six of the attachments.  The question arises in the context of . . . . “

Grade yourself.  I dare ya.

On this week’s podcast, we discuss a North Dakota law firm [sued its associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/law-firm-sues-associates-for-not-billing-enough/) and [won](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/law-firm-lawsuit-not-billing-enough-professional-dignity/), seeking to clawback paychecks for failing to meet billing requirements during the pandemic. Wasn’t there a program to protect employers from cutting salaries during the downturn, you might ask? There was! [And the firm took gobs of it](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/law-firm-associates-pay-back-salary-covid-792k-ppp-loans/). Also, [Clarence Thomas is likely getting a statue](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/clarence-thomas-statute/) in his honor, because as they say in Unforgiven, “deserve’s got nothing to do with it.” Finally, [the one simple trick to $100 million in billables](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/jones-day-100-million-controversial-bankruptcy-texas-two-step/) that the Third Circuit doesn’t want Jones Day to know about.

# Less Office Space, More Vaccinations: The Workplace Of The Future
## Overall, however, the future is going to involve many fewer people being in the office full time.

The fog in my crystal ball is slowly lifting. I’m beginning to see the future.

I see two things.

First, the future will involve less leased downtown office space.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Although companies are all over the lot, only banks seem to be requiring that all employees return to their offices full time. Curiously enough, only banks are massively dependent on the commercial real estate industry for their success. Banks lend to those in the industry, securitize loans, invest in real estate, and so on. I’m thus deeming banks to be the self-interested outliers who shout that everyone must return to the office. The rest of the corporate world is less biased and guides my vision of the future. What I overwhelmingly see is a hybrid model — a relatively few people will work from home full time; a relatively few people will work from an office full time; and the vast majority of people will go into the office only one or two days per week.

This will vary by worker, naturally. On the one hand, a restaurant’s wait staff or sales people in retail stores must be in their workplaces. On the other hand, employees of, say, tech firms can work remotely. At law firms, junior litigation associates — who learn a great deal by osmosis — will be in the office more often than 63-year-old M&A partners, who may never have to see a live human being again in their professional careers. Overall, however, the future is going to involve many fewer people being in the office full time.

This will drive up the cost of living in distant suburbs. Those far-flung homes will become more expensive because people will tolerate longer commutes if they commute only one or two days each week. This will thin out the crowds on the roads and on mass transit, because eliminating even a small percentage of travelers vastly eases the commute for everyone else. This will also reduce the number of people buying lunch at downtown restaurants and running errands downtown that can now be run near home.

Over time, this will also slowly reduce the demand for downtown commercial real estate. Office leases tend to run for a decade or more. They will come up for renewal only gradually over time. And some firms will be cautious and will choose not to dramatically reduce the amount of space they lease. But, generally, firms will need less space. They’ll lease less space. The value of commercial buildings will decrease, and players in commercial real estate will suffer.

Second, the future will involve more vaccinations.

City workers in parts of California and New York, certain federal employees, certain people associated with universities, some health care workers, and employees of several companies (including a few law firms) already must show proof of vaccination to be allowed to work from the office. The number of companies requiring proof of vaccinations is going to increase over time.

It’s tricky for the first-moving corporations to impose vaccination requirements on their employees, but it’s far easier for late movers to make the demand. And results will tell: Some people will be offended by vaccine requirements. But just a few outbreaks of COVID-19 at just a few workplaces will quickly change people’s minds. Getting vaccinated is, I suppose, inconvenient or somehow offends one’s principles; becoming seriously ill or dying is worse. Over time, people will appreciate employers who insist that their employees do what’s best for the employees’ collective health.

Governments may or may not take the political risk of imposing vaccine requirements, but private employers will worry less about politics and more about the health of their workforce. If governments won’t take the lead on requiring vaccinations, private employers will.

Over time, we’ll move to the workplace of the future: Most people will be vaccinated, and far fewer people will work from traditional downtown offices than they did in March 2020.

Sometimes being a lawyer is crappy. But if you are reading Above the Law, you already knew that. The hours, the pressure, the screaming partners — sometimes it is all you can do not to break down.

But here’s a better idea, instead of screaming, laugh. Who better to tickle your funny bone then someone who has been there, done that, and wrote a meme about it?

I’d like to introduce you to the Instagram account of [@attorneyproblems](https://www.instagram.com/attorneyproblems/). With over 21k followers, the account is quickly becoming a favorite among those who toil in Biglaw, their entire value to life held together by the arbitrary moods of a partner. So enjoy the sampling below, and be sure to check out the full Instagram account whenever you need to blow off a little steam.

# Biglaw Firm Steps Up Their Perk Game With Impressive Fertility And Family-Forming Coverage

Biglaw firms are finally coming around to understand that recruiting and retaining top-notch talent will require more than just throwing money at the problem (though, obviously, that’s nice too). Whether it is increasing [parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/parental-leave/), a [Peloton](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/the-new-hotness-in-biglaw-perks-peloton/), a [selection of high-end gifts](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/grading-all-the-davis-polk-gift-bonuses/), [billable hours for unplugging](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/) from work, [free food](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/kirkland-sweetens-associate-perks-with-free-food/), up to [$15K for any purchase toward rest, recreation, and relaxation](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/fenwick-spring-bonus-2021/), or [picking up the tab](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-firm-to-pick-up-the-tab-for-your-next-vacay/) for vacations — Biglaw is stepping up its game.

Now Reed Smith has announced a new fertility and family-forming benefit, which will see attorneys and professional staff get services and support from Carrot Fertility. The firm will cover 100% of eligible expenses (which includes a range of fertility treatments and family-formation services, such as adoption, IVF and gestational carrier services) up to a $60,000 lifetime limit. That’s some impressive coverage. What’s even nicer is the employees will not have to lay out the money and wait on the reimbursements; instead, they’ll receive a Carrot Card that will advance the costs of the expenses, limiting the upfront costs.

Casey Ryan, the firm’s global head of legal personnel, explains the upgrade the new program over previous coverage:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“While we have had fertility benefits as part of the firm’s healthcare plan, this benefit, available to all lawyers and professional staff, is a different order of magnitude. We are partnering with Carrot Fertility in order to provide best-in-class benefits that help reduce the stress for individuals and couples experiencing challenges in starting or growing a family. Carrot’s extensive clinic and agency network and comprehensive telehealth and care navigation platform will provide a tremendous boost for Reed Smith’s lawyers and professional staff on their different journeys to becoming parents. We are proud to offer a truly inclusive policy – one that supports the decisions of our employees to form families in any way they choose.”

The benefit is effective immediately for U.S. personnel, with the financial coverage services retroactive to January 1. The firm’s EMEA offices will see the benefit starting this summer.

In case you missed our [earlier announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/book-of-business-a-new-podcast-from-above-the-law/), Above the Law has launched a new, Biglaw-focused podcast. It’s called [Book of Business](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/), brought to you by ATL and our friends at [Kinney Recruiting](http://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/).

Book of Business is hosted by myself and veteran legal recruiter Robert Kinney, Founder and President of Kinney Recruiting (sponsor of the podcast). In each episode, Robert and I do three things. First, we analyze a recent notable lateral move or collection of moves, explaining the significance for the Biglaw world. Second, we take an in-depth look at a specific legal market, discussing what it’s like to practice in that market, including its pros and cons. Finally, we offer career advice for the audience of Book of Business — current and aspiring partners at leading law firms.

In our [latest episode](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/winston-strawns-impressive-expansion-in-energy-law-episode-2), our second, we analyze [Winston & Strawn’s](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/winston-strawn-llp/) aggressive (and impressive) expansion in energy law; conduct a market snapshot for Northern California, both San Francisco and Silicon Valley; and offer advice to lawyers on saying no gracefully and keeping their options open.

In case you missed our [first episode](http://atlbookofbusiness.libsyn.com/discussions-about-the-merger-between-andrews-kurth-and-hunton-williams-episode-1), we discussed [lateral moves](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/will-partner-poaching-stop-this-rumored-biglaw-merger-in-its-tracks/) related to the [recent merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-merger-creates-new-1000-lawyer-firm/) between Andrews Kurth and Hunton & Williams; conducted a market snapshot of New York, the biggest Biglaw market; and offered advice to lawyers on the important topic of negotiating lateral offers.

Check out Book of Business via the embed or links below, and subscribe to future episodes through your podcast purveyor of choice. Enjoy!

The July 1 deadline most firms set for raises has slipped by, and with it, a lot of the news. Firms that didn’t act before the deadline are enjoying the holiday lull and keeping their heads down. And that’s not sitting well with a lot of associates, who continue to write in to express their frustrations with AWOL salary announcements, shortchanged offices, and mistreated seniors.

These are the forgotten vintage of the Grapes of Cravath.

Let us hear their tales…

First up, we have a pair of complaints from different firms, but one location.

Miami

There was no raise to Miami Associates at Baker [& McKenzie]. They had communications and sent out a range for each year saying they will later send out individual communications to associate but nothing was done. So all other offices in the U.S. went to 180K scale and the Miami range is now from 145-160 first year and basically everyone falling on the lower end of the scale (145K) where they already were before Cravath.

We’ve also heard from…

While we are on the topic of associates pissed off by Biglaw raises, the only U.S. office of White & Case that did not get the full Cravath scale raise is Miami. Management at the Miami office has refused to email a memo about the raises they are offering because they are afraid it will end up on ATL…

They’ve decided to raise the current salaries by 12.5% effective today… So the new scale goes something like: $174, 180, 186, 200, 219, 238, 253, 270, 287. Again, I can’t confirm exactly since they refused to provide ANYTHING in writing. We are the ONLY U.S. office on a lower scale.

I’ve got to say, the Baker & McKenzie story should make the White & Case associate feel much better about life. It always sucks to know that someone out there is making a bit more for the same — or at least similar — work, but it takes [about $89K](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/moving-cost-of-living-calculator.aspx) to live in Miami at the same standard of living that $180K provides in New York. That’s almost double what New York is making in real terms!

Making $174K should allow you to experience Miami as Tony Montana intended.

But $145K is on the low end. Miami may not be one of the top markets, but it still has to recruit people and it’s hard to recruit when salaries are $35K below the top of the market. I understand that I’m the [avatar of New York privilege](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/) when it comes to salaries, but I still think firms need to do something for associates in these satellite offices to minimize intrafirm grievances.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Quinn’s June 8 raise “match” scale stopped at 7th years and said more senior associates would hear about their compensation soon. A month later, raises have gone into effect for everyone else but radio silence for senior associates here….

This isn’t the first we’ve heard of senior associates getting lost in the shuffle. But even if seniors are getting individualized raises, someone needs to figure out what those are going to be. If nothing else, bump everyone $10K while “we further evaluate individual raises.” Something.

And this complaint doesn’t look great coming as it did on the same day that the firm announced it had enough money to [give its new hires $35K bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-firm-offering-signing-bonus-for-3ls/).

Holland & Knight

I’m a mid-level at Holland and Knight, and it’s incredibly frustrating seeing other less profitable, equally or more leveraged firms match the new scale. We’ve had very strong recent performance and PPP is now $1.25 million. Our salaries are not lockstep and bonuses are infamously below market. If HK doesn’t step it up on the comp front, they will lose good associates, especially in markets like NY, California and Texas. Have already had multiple recruiters reach out to me. Morale is LOW amongst other associates I’ve spoken with.

Yeah, recruiters must be having a field day with Holland & Knight. And why wouldn’t they? This is how capitalism works… resources flow to where they’re needed the most and, for good or ill, we define “need” with dollar signs. Sure, the market might be wrong about where good lawyers are needed most, but that’s for the invisible hand to work out through capitalism’s masturbatory trial and error process.

Foley & Lardner

Partners have been 100% silent on the new salary scale and we just heard from summers that management has told them that they will be informed of whether Foley will match (at least first year salaries) by the time they get their offers. Ridiculous for all their hardworking associates busting their butts to keep them profitable. The firm already compensates 95%+ of associates in major markets below market due to their tiered comp system for 4th years on up. Bonus policies won’t even get you close to market until 2,400+ billable hours. If they don’t match the bleeding will begin fairly quickly. Recruiters are pushing us all pretty hard to start interviewing with firms that have matched.

I hope firms are noticing this “recruiters are pushing” trend. Every day you stay off the market norm, there will be poaching. That’s not a reason to raise salaries as a knee-jerk reaction. If you can’t afford to play with Cravath, then you [can’t afford to play with Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/). Take your lumps and move on. But it’s why firms can’t pretend “if we just keep quiet and wait for ATL to leave us alone everything will go back to the way it was.”

Winstead

Not all Texas “big law” firms have raised salaries. Even after Jackson Walker and HayBoo raised salaries (Winstead’s nemesis), Winstead is still evaluating compensation.

I’ve gotten my share of flack for saying that Texas firms should still be below the top of the market, but as Bill Munny says, “[Deserve’s got nothin’ to do with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuvEJ-U1UDc).” Once the center of gravity in the market shifted to a Cravath scale, everyone had to.

But the “send it to a committee” approach is quite adorably politic for “we really don’t know what to do.”

Beck Redden

Beck Redden, a top-tier litigation boutique in Houston, still has not matched! According to the Chambers Partners ranking for commercial litigation in Texas, the firm is in “Band 1” along with Susman Godfrey and Gibbs & Bruns. (To put things in perspective, Vinson & Elkins and Baker Botts are in “Band 2.”) Beck Redden salaries already drop off after the 5th year or so (the scale by associate year is shown on the Vault profile of the firm, online). And now, it is below-market in Houston where it considers itself among the top litigation shops in the state!

Ditto the Winstead commentary. The only thing worth adding here is that boutiques still driven by their founders may well have different pressures than the Biglaw firms. Could the firm be looking to wind down in a couple of years as the founders retire? Maybe it’s not worth reaching for the brass ring in recruiting if the ride is coming to an end? We’d expect Beck Redden to move on to the future, but this is a factor worth considering as some boutiques slide out of line with the market.

Philadelphia

Meanwhile in Flip, Flip, Flipadelphia…

Will you be doing any upcoming articles on the Philly market? There was an article a few years back about Drinker following MLB and Dechert after they jumped to 160 (and other firms like Cosen and Blank Rome increasing to lower scales). Now that MLB and Dechert are at 180, I’m wondering if Drinker and the others are also considering increases.

This is yet another Texas effect. There’s no good reason Philadelphia associates should make Cravath salaries. And yet MLB and Dechert decided to move the local market up to $180K and now it’s hard for Drinker to say no.

But where does this flattening across markets end? Maybe there’s some statistical analysis proving that a Philly office generates as much revenue as a Dallas office as a New York office as a Charlotte office. If so, I’ve not seen it yet. Couple the differences in value to the firm with the cost-of-living variance, and at some point we need to reintroduce some sort of New York premium.

# Why Are Clients Leaving Traditional Law Firms? Because Lawyers Can't Keep It Simple, Stupid
## Legal mumbo-jumbo is how we’ve gotten to where we are. We need to simplify what we do and how we do it.

Have you heard of the term [“Occam’s Razor”](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)? It’s a problem-solving principle attributed to William of Ockham, who lived almost 700 years ago, long before smart phones, online legal research, social media, and other things we have learned that we can’t live without.

The essence of Occam’s Razor is that if there are two explanations for something that has happened, the simpler explanation is usually better.  The more assumptions that are needed to arrive at a conclusion, the more likely it is that the conclusion is not the right one. It’s the KISS principle (not the Gene Simmons/Paul Stanley rock group). It’s the acronym for “keep it simple, stupid.” The principle is used in philosophy, science, medicine, and other disciplines.

I think that the principle of Occam’s Razor aka KISS applies to us. We often needlessly complicate things, to the despair of our clients, both in understanding what we’re trying to say, as well as in the bills the clients receive. How many times has a client asked you to explain something in “plain English, not legalese, please”? Can we count that high?

There’s no disputing that many legal issues are complicated and hard for even us to explain (the Rule Against Perpetuities as just one example), but that doesn’t abdicate our responsibility to explain them to the client in a way that the client can and will understand. After all, it is the client’s case, not ours, and it’s hard to make good decisions when a client doesn’t understand the underlying premises on which the issue is based.

Legal mumbo-jumbo is how we’ve gotten to where we are — that is, clients looking to alternative legal service providers who demystify the law (to the extent possible) and who offer similar, if not identical, services at lower prices.

So, if the best explanation is the simplest, why do we have such a hard explaining concepts in simple terms? What if a client gives a convoluted and confusing answer to a question? Do we believe that answer or do we think that there’s a simpler answer and that the client is confused, uncertain, or perhaps just outright lying?

I think the Occam’s Razor principle also applies to working smarter, which may well affect, to lawyer detriment, the concept of the more hours billed the better. See how hard I’m working? See how many hours I’ve billed? Will I make partner? Will I keep my job?

So, suggestions about how to work “smarter,” not “harder,” abound. Here’s [one list](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/5-scientifically-proven-ways-to-work-smarter-not-harder-tues.html) which I’m sure will provoke shudders to those whose metrics depend on hours billed and not results achieved.

The first: take more breaks. Really? That’ll go over big with the powers that be.   Apparently our brains can only focus for 90 minutes at a time, and after that, brains need rest, preferably 15 to 20 minutes. So how efficient and effective were all those all-nighters that clients were billed for?

Second: take naps. Another suggestion that will horrify the powers that be. If you’re not at your desk or, if offsite, readily available at a moment’s notice, then those powers know beyond a reasonable doubt that you’re not working. I don’t know whether an air mattress under your desk qualifies for napping purposes. Do work, if you have to, and we all know what that is like, but be working and make sure that’s on those timesheets.

Third: [spend time in nature](http://enewspaper.latimes.com/desktop/latimes/default.aspx?pubid=50435180-e58e-48b5-8e0c-236bf740270e).  More easily said than done, but perhaps for those working at home or any place where the outdoors is readily accessible, it’s doable. Spending time dodging traffic in a downtown city canyon does not constitute time spent in nature.

Fourth: divide your work into blocks and move around, not just around the desk, but physical locations. The rise in “open architecture” office spaces seems to allow for that, but it’s not just moving around in an open architecture environment, but moving physically from one coffee bar to another, focusing on one discrete task at each location. I wonder how schlepping from one place to another is actually productive to working smarter, not harder. Is this non-billable time?

Fifth:  Check your email first thing. I had never really thought about why I do that, aside from being OCD and making sure I haven’t missed anything, but the reason makes sense, especially in today’s world where people on a team work remotely from all different time zones.  If you check it first thing, then you know what you have to do straight away, pushing things down on your to do list in order to respond to whatever crises or emergencies have arisen while you were unavailable.

Not on any list but my own, and heretical as it may sound, although coming from this dinosaur, not all that surprising, reduce the time spent on social media. As the economist Herbert A. Simon [said](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/herbert_simon_181919), “A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.”  He said that long before social media, and he was spot on. We suffer from information overload and [problems concentrating](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/can-attorneys-practice-law-while-suffering-from-adhd-pamela).

Some people are starting to throttle back on social media. Do you think that social media helps you to work smarter? Doubtful, but it does make you work harder because of all the time you spend on social media and the late nights you have to spend foraging for billable hours.

As an aside, a recent Instagram feed, [@attorneyproblems](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/the-legally-themed-instagram-feed-every-attorney-needs-right-now/), is hilarious and truer than most attorneys will cop to.  Request for Admission Number 25 supports my Occam’s Razor theory.

We need to simplify what we do and how we do it. Making [the changes the profession needs to make](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/new-warning-for-biglaw-firms-not-that-theyll-listen-anyway/) to stay competitive, to avoid having all our meals eaten by upstart innovators is what Biglaw, small law, solos, and every firm in between must do.  It really is a matter of KISS.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# The 3 Factors Driving Decisions On Biglaw Bonuses This Fall
## 2020 has had no shortage of surprises -- and not all of the surprises are bad.

2020 has had no shortage of surprises — and not all of the surprises are bad.

In Biglaw, the latest big surprise is that in the middle of a pandemic and a recession, law firms are paying special bonuses. You can call them [“appreciation bonuses,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) which is the name bestowed upon them by Cooley, which kicked off the trend. You can call them [“special bonuses,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) the term used by Davis Polk, which issued the bonus scale that’s most widely used right now. But no matter what you call them, the bonuses are great news for associates — as well as quite surprising.

I certainly didn’t expect this plot twist in the story of Biglaw. To the contrary, in August, I predicted that bonuses would be [down this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/some-cautious-optimism-about-biglaw-and-a-prediction-on-2020-biglaw-bonuses/). But now we know that they won’t be; Cooley, Davis Polk, and other fall-bonus firms have already declared that 2020 year-end bonuses will be at least as generous as 2019 year-end bonuses.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Not all firms, however, have followed the fall-bonus trend. Kirkland & Ellis, traditionally a compensation leader, announced that it [won’t be paying fall bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) — but did promise that it would “take into account … the fall bonuses paid by any other firm” when calculating year-end bonuses. That was better news for associates than word from Cravath, also traditionally a compensation leader, which similarly declared that it [won’t be paying special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) — but unlike Kirkland, Cravath made no mention of taking into account fall bonuses when setting the year-end bonus scale.

And then there are the many, many firms that have not made an announcement of any sort on fall bonuses. For a comprehensive roundup of the bonus announcements that have been made, check out ATL’s [special bonus tracker](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/).

What factors go into firms’ decisions on special bonuses? There are basically three: performance, peer pressure, and publicity.

1. Performance. This is, of course, the most important factor. The firms that are willing and able to pay fall bonuses are all doing well — or at least well enough — during the pandemic.

As Zeughauser Group consultant Kent Zimmermann predicted to Dan Packel of the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2020/09/10/for-2020-revenue-may-fall-but-profitability-is-largely-expected-to-hold/), for the year of 2020, “a small set of firms will show an impressive jump in PEP [profit per equity partner], while more than half the market will be within 5% of last year’s numbers (up or down), and a third set, comprising roughly 20% of the market, will exhibit a steeper decline.” This seems about right to me, based on my own observation of the industry and conversations with law firm leaders.

The firms paying fall bonuses are almost all in either (1) the first group of firms that could see an increase in profits per partner this year (sorry, it’s always going to be “PPP” to me, not “PEP”), or (2) the second group of firms, slightly up or slightly down.

The firms in the third group, which are really hurting right now, are not in the bonus-paying group (or, if they are, they shouldn’t be). Indeed, instead of paying bonuses, some of these suffering firms might still have austerity measures in place.

2. Peer pressure. If some firms decided to pay fall bonuses despite shaky financials, then they probably did so out of peer pressure — traditionally a major factor, and sometimes the only factor, in many firms’ bonus decisions. The flurry of announcements in the wake of the Davis Polk announcement can be chalked up to Biglaw’s “keeping up with the Davises” mentality.

It’s worth noting, however, how many firms have either not announced anything or have announced they won’t be joining the fall-bonus party. Which takes us to the third and final factor.

3. Publicity. The decisions by Kirkland and Cravath not to pay fall bonuses were surely not driven by financial considerations. Kirkland must be having an excellent year, thanks to its market-leading bankruptcy practice, and while Cravath might not be doing as well, it’s still Cravath.

Instead, Cravath and Kirkland probably felt it wouldn’t be great, from a public-relations perspective, to be paying our special bonuses during a pandemic and a recession whose full extent remains to be seen. This concern for appearances is hinted at in the [Cravath memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/), which alludes to “this ongoing pandemic and all its challenges for our communities.” It’s made more explicit in the [Paul Weiss memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/paul-weiss-wont-be-offering-fall-bonuses-and-associates-are-angry/), issued earlier today: “So many of our clients and others across our community are experiencing unprecedented economic trauma, including the shuttering of their businesses and the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, as a direct result of this pandemic. Providing a special cash reward in direct response to the pandemic does not feel right at this time.”

I wouldn’t be surprised if clients of these firms, especially general counsels at companies that have taken major hits during the downturn, expressed their displeasure over fall bonuses to Kirkland, Cravath, Paul Weiss, and other firms that have either announced they won’t be paying fall bonuses or have yet to announce. Paying bonuses to twenty-something lawyers during a time of national crisis isn’t a great look.

But you know what’s also not a great look? Millionaire partners taking home even more millions because their law firms remained busy during the pandemic, while many of their expenses — everything from travel to client entertainment to utility costs for their offices — went down or went away entirely. I suspect that one reason law firm partners have shared the wealth with their associates, in addition to a desire to express appreciation and support during challenging times, is that if they didn’t pay out such bonuses, the partners would end up doing obscenely well. In-house lawyers read the American Lawyer too — and they will notice next spring when certain firms report significant increases in PPP during a pandemic.

So for firms that are doing well right now, there’s a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” problem regarding fall bonuses. If you pay them, you might look bad to some of your clients now; but if you don’t pay them, you might look bad to some of your clients later (and your associates will be unhappy too).

Having to hide how well you are doing: in the midst of a pandemic and a recession, it’s a good problem to have.

# Is A Biglaw Firm Pulling A Bait And Switch On Associate Bonuses?
## Nothing like the last minute to announce brand new hours requirements for bonuses...

There are a set of expectation built into the employer/employee relationship. And when a Biglaw firm has historically given associates market rates for bonuses without an hours requirement, they pretty much think they’ll be getting the same money as everyone in the industry and not unceremoniously [enrolled in the jelly of the month club.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K8-kNuDgoA)

But here at Above the Law, we are hearing rumblings that a major Biglaw firm changed the requirements for bonuses at the last minute — like only a few days before they were due to be disbursed. And that left a lot of associates with less money than expected.

From an angry associate at the firm:

[The firm] never had an hours minimum for bonuses but called associates 2 days before they were supposed to be paid out and told them they were getting anywhere from 0% – 100% of what they were expecting. They said it was a very recent firm wide decision to now implement an hours minimum however no email has been sent saying so. A lot of associates got hit and received 0%-25%. Allegedly associates were ranked against other people in their class years for hours and that is how the grouping and payout was determined. First years and stub years seem to have been unaffected and gotten full bonuses, but every other class year was subject to this retroactive hours requirement without warning, They called everyone to tell them this so there are no email records.

This, unfortunately, isn’t the only time we’ve heard of a firm [retroactively](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/associate-bonus-watch-biglaw-firm-retroactively-changes-bonus-rules-associates-left-with-50-to-80-percent-of-expected-bonus/) changing the [requirements](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/shearman-bonus-2022/) for bonuses, but it is the most recent. And we’d love to gather more details — in the name of transparency, of course!

So, is *your* firm engaged in bonus shenanigans? Above the Law wants to know! Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)).

# Shearman & Sterling Announces More Staff Layoffs

More bad news for Shearman & Sterling. According to an internal message shared with Above the Law by a tipster (see below), the firm is once again cutting headcount. This “global workforce reduction” focuses Business Services. The amount of impacted individuals is unclear, though the firm has indicated they’ll inform impacted folks in the Americas this week and in EMEA and APAC over the coming weeks.

This is only the latest stumble for Shearman having announced [associate and staff layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) earlier this year. They’ve also [seen slower growth](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/27/shearmans-long-road-from-wall-street-darling-to-merger-partner-405-116391/) in both revenue and profits over the last 20 years compared with its peer firms and a[ disappointing bonus season last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/shearman-bonus-2022/) with many associates feeling screwed by the process. And of course, the anticipated merger between Shearman and Hogan Lovells was [scrapped in March.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/rumored-merger-between-hogan-lovells-and-shearman-scrapped/)

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

# Wachtell Lipton's New Partners: 100 Percent Diverse
## Good news about diversity at one of the nation's most prestigious and profitable law firms.

Wachtell Lipton’s home, 51 West 52nd Street (by Americasroof via Wikimedia).

Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz, one of the nation’s most [prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/) and [profitable](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) law firms, is a major meritocracy. It promotes lawyers to partnership based on their talent as attorneys, and it doesn’t go out of its way to enhance diversity in the partner ranks.

When I worked at Wachtell Lipton, the partnership contained very few women, people of color, or other diverse individuals. Instead, many of the partners fit the demographic profile of the founding partners: white Jewish males from top law schools.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As [noted](https://books.google.com/books?id=EKXGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT154&lpg=PT154&dq=wachtell+lipton+jewish+discrimination&source=bl&ots=kI4skEL0qD&sig=bLk5bqUL8cMgjIYEyDGapJn-5f4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio6vOJy7rQAhUrrlQKHe6LCwkQ6AEIRTAG#v=onepage&q=wachtell%20lipton%20jewish%20discrimination&f=false) in [Jews and the Law](http://amzn.to/2gdXog1) (affiliate link), the firm “was founded in 1965 by four young Jewish lawyers who, it was said, had doors at other firms closed to them” as Jews, despite strong records [at NYU Law School](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2008/11/joe-floms-steps.html). I always thought that this experience of discrimination contributed to the partnership’s focus on merit above all with regard to hiring and promotion.

And as we saw with Cravath’s [newest partner class](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cravath-names-new-partners-and-all-three-are-women/?rf=1), composed entirely of women, focusing on excellence will naturally lead to diversity in 2016. Wachtell Lipton recently announced its new partners — it traditionally holds the vote on Election Day, with partnership effective in January — and the class consists of two women and an openly gay man:


Tijana Dvornic

- [Tijana Dvornic](http://www.wlrk.com/TJDvornic/): A tax lawyer focused on M&A work (par for the WLRK course), Dvornic joined the firm in 2009, after graduating from Harvard Law School and clerking for Judge Priscilla Owen of the Fifth Circuit (also a [former female Biglaw partner](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2004/06/filibusted_righ.html), at Andrews & Kurth).
- [Jenna Levine](http://wlrk.com/JELevine/): A member of the firm’s marquee corporate practice, Levine graduated from Dartmouth College, worked as an investment banker, and graduated from Columbia Law School, before arriving at Wachtell Lipton in 2008.
- [Ryan McLeod](http://www.wlrk.com/ramcleod/): A litigator, McLeod graduated from Ursinus College (summa cum laude) and Duke University School of Law, clerked for Chancellor Chandler of Delaware Chancery Court (a common venue for Wachtell litigators), and joined the firm in 2008.

Congratulations to these three young lawyers on joining one of the nation’s top partnerships. They won’t see much improvement in their hours — as firm co-chair [Daniel Neff](http://www.wlrk.com/DANeff/) told David Parnell of [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidparnell/2016/02/24/daniel-neff-wachtell-lipton-on-leading-most-prestigious-law-firm/print/), Wachtell Lipton partners continue to work like dogs are some of the hardest-working in all of Biglaw — but their already large paychecks are about to get an extra zero.

# Where In Biglaw Are Midlevel Associates The Happiest? (2019)
## Is it even possible to be happy in Biglaw?

At this point, [everyone in the legal profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/is-it-even-possible-to-be-happy-in-law-school/) knows we’re [an unhappy bunch](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/want-to-be-happy-dont-be-a-lawyer/). But for those with law school loans to service, ditching it all and opening up a scuba shop in the Caribbean isn’t really an option. So, is there any way to find a modicum of happiness or satisfaction and still be a top flight attorney?

Well, the American Lawyer’s [annual midlevel satisfaction survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/08/26/where-are-midlevel-associates-happiest-the-2019-national-rankings/) may give you a little direction. They’ve asked third through fifth year associates how satisfied they are with their firm on a variety of different questions: compensation and benefits; training and guidance; relations with partners and other associates; interest in and satisfaction level with the work; the firm’s policy on billable hours; and management’s openness about firm strategies and partnership chances. The resulting list gives a little insight into what it’s really like to practice at some of the best firms in the country.

# Chadbourne Kicks Out Partner Suing Them Over Gender Discrimination
## No matter what the firm says, they aren't finished dealing with Kerrie Campbell just yet.

Kerrie Campbell

The twists and turns just keep on coming in the case of Kerrie Campbell versus Biglaw firm Chadbourne & Parke. When last we left the saga, Campbell (who’d [sued the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/) in a putative class action for $100 million alleging gender discrimination and unequal pay) was in a precarious position at her firm. The firm announced they were[ holding a vote](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/biglaw-firm-will-vote-to-oust-partner-suing-them-for-gender-discrimination/?rf=1) to oust Campbell from the firm, calling it “the inevitable result of the choices Ms. Campbell has made.”

Campbell, through the firm representing her, [Sanford Heisler Sharp](https://sanfordheisler.com/), sought intervention from the court, saying that the firm’s announcement was designed to be an “[undisguised threat](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/court-docs-allege-biglaw-firm-made-undisguised-threat-to-potential-class-members/?rf=1)” to potential class members. Arguments on the motion were heard Monday, April 17, and the judge refused to intervene. Today, the seemingly inevitable happened: the partners at Chadbourne & Parke voted to remove Kerrie Campbell from the firm.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In advance of the vote, Campbell provided the partnership with a three page memo (available in full on the next page), outlining the reasons she should remain a partner at the firm. Campbell’s memo included a defense of her legal work — and billable hours:

During my time at Chadbourne, I have delivered on my commitments to this Firm. I transferred all of my clients and matters from my previous firm to Chadbourne, and I generated substantial new business and matters from existing and new clients within my first two years with the Firm. I have originated dozens of new matters since joining the Firm. You do not have to take my word for it. Readily-available matrix and Intelsat data confirm my business origination, revenue generation and strong track record. During my time at the Firm, I have also been recognized as one of the Best Lawyers in America in First Amendment litigation. Even after the Management Committee’s decision to terminate me, I continued to bring in substantial revenue for the Firm – on the order of around $1 million in collections as billing partner during the last matrix year.

She also made an emotional appeal to prevent being voted off the island. Campbell is currently on medical leave following complications from surgery, and was not informed before the firm stopped making payments to her. For her final appeal, she highlighted the financial turmoil the move would place her and her family in:

The upcoming expulsion vote that the Management Committee has initiated will only exacerbate the Firm’s wrongful conduct. The expulsion will be ruinous to my professional reputation and place my entire family’s financial future at risk, as I am the sole earner.

Campbell’s plea also included a response to the allegation the lawsuit against the firm was filed to deflect attention from her performance at the firm or to garner attention:

I initiated the lawsuit to do what I believe is the right thing to make a change for the good in this Firm and in the legal profession. I brought the case only after my efforts to address my concerns internally with Chadbourne’s management proved unsuccessful.

Ultimately, the appeal was unsuccessful. The vote was recorded this morning, and according to a representative of the Sanford Heisler Sharp, approximately 70 partners voted for expulsion. Though a number of partners abstained from voting, the only one to vote to keep Campbell at the firm was Campbell herself.

Campbell’s attorney, [David Sanford,](https://sanfordheisler.com/team/david-sanford/) made the following statement, which reflects the mindset that while this was a setback, the fight — that is, litigation — continues:

Chadbourne’s vote to expel Ms. Campbell was based on biased and incomplete information.  The result of the vote is, therefore, not surprising.  The vote is the culmination of Chadbourne’s series of retaliatory measures taken against their partner, Ms. Campbell, while she was out on medical leave.  We will be filing an amended complaint.

A trial in this case will bring to light the facts and we are confident that the truth will emerge.  This case, ultimately, will not be about Kerrie Campbell alone.  It will be about three class representatives, all female partners, with nearly 50 years of collective experience at Chadbourne who will prove a systemic pattern of discrimination in pay at the firm directed against female partners.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
A spokesperson for the firm provided this statement:

At a meeting of the full Partnership today, the Partners of Chadbourne & Parke, voted to terminate Kerrie Campbell’s partnership interest. Ms. Campbell attended, spoke at, fully participated and voted as a partner at the meeting. No partner other than Ms. Campbell voted against the motion to expel.

This action was reluctantly taken 14 months after Ms. Campbell was asked to transition her practice to another firm and after numerous efforts to resolve this matter without resorting to such a measure.

The grounds for the decision of our Partners have been discussed at length by the Firm in court filings and need not be repeated here. However the action may be mischaracterized by her, Ms. Campbell’s decision to sue the Firm and her more recent medical condition were not a basis for today’s outcome and were expressly not considered by the Partners in reaching their decision. The bases existed long before her suit.

The Firm now looks forward to moving on as it prepares to enter a new chapter in its future.

Despite the language of closure the firm uses in its statement, as long as this case is ongoing, Chadbourne’s dealings with Kerrie Campbell are far from over.

Like it or not, if you’re a lawyer who’s been working at a Biglaw firm for any amount of time, you’ve probably been tethered to your cellphone for an unhealthy portion of your existence. After all, you need to be able to [CHECK YOU EMAILS OFTEN](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/10/quinn-emanuel-believes-in-c-b-a-check-blackberry-always/), which usually requires an unhealthy relationship with your mobile device on a 24/7/365 basis.

A Biglaw associate’s cellphone is a ball and chain, but one firm has responded to this sad fact by offering up a brand new bring your own device program that’s incredibly up to date with the times. Which firm will be providing its associates with funds for the latest and greatest mobile technology that money can buy? A bit of background is needed before we can answer that question.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Yesterday, Apple executives announced the launch of the iPhone X, a cellular stunner with features like a huge screen, an OLED display, a Face ID security system, and wireless charging capabilities. The iPhone X goes on sale on October 27, and it ships on November 3. Its starting price is $999.

On the same day the world was introduced to the iPhone X, Paul Weiss announced the launch of its new mobile device reimbursement program via email. Here are the relevant details from firm chair Brad Karp (the full email is available on the next page if you’d like to learn more about the program):

[E]ffective immediately, we are updating our mobile device reimbursement (BYOD) policy. Our new policy allows up to a $1,000 reimbursement every 18 months, which can be used to purchase any mobile phone or tablet.

With just a $1 difference between PW’s maximum mobile phone reimbursement and the starting price of the iPhone X, this is the quickest that we’ve ever seen a Biglaw firm respond to a major technological advance. You can expect to see hundreds of Paul Weiss associates with an iPhone X in hand later this fall. Congratulations! Above the Law will look great on those True Tone displays.

# John Quinn Is NOT Happy About Selendy & Gay -- And He Sent The Angry Reply All To Prove It
## When partners leave law firms, it can leave some very hurt feelings.

When partners depart to rival firms or to set up their own shop, we always hear the polished party line about “wishing them the best in their future endeavors.” But you always wonder if some hurt feelings aren’t lingering under it all. After all, partner defections take business away from the mother firm and often carry associate talent with them. It’s actually crazy to believe everyone should just passively accept business walking out the door.

So when John Quinn replied to Faith Gay’s departure memo with some blunt honesty, it was a breath of fresh air. With the benefit of hindsight, he probably wouldn’t have hit send on such an off-the-cuff response and stuck with the party line. But we’re here now and we’ve got a window into the high-stakes emotions behind running a high-stakes litigation practice.

Faith Gay, until now the Co-Chair of Quinn Emanuel’s National Trial Practice group who is [leaving Quinn to start Selendy & Gay](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/big-name-departures-from-quinn-emanuel/) with fellow Quinn alum and [Litigator of the Year](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202745122224/) Philippe Selendy, sent her departure memo at 8:50 p.m. on Valentine’s Day. It provides the standard effusive praise of the firm and expressions of gratitude you’d expect. It does end with this:

The Life That I Have
The life that I have
Is all that I have
And the life that I have
Is yours

The love that I have
Of the life that I have
Is yours and yours and yours.

Which… a poem? Really? You’re quitting your job not leading a fellowship to Mordor. Also this poem famously [got someone killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violette_Szabo) so maybe it’s not the best way to cap off a letter. In any event, this isn’t the time to be waxing poetic while you know a good deal of the people reading it are already steamed. At a certain point, that kind of posturing is just asking for an angry response.

Enter John Quinn’s reply all. You know what, let’s not even break this down — here it is in full:

Faith, I wish I could join in the high minded sentiment you express here. Some day maybe I will be able to. But not yet. At this time I am still perhaps too mindful of other facts.

Such as that you really were not very well known at all when you joined us from White and Case.
That during your time with us we supported you in every way we could and, I think, made you a legal star.
That during your time with us you were paid well over $100m—far more than you ever dreamed you could earn.
That when you wanted to take time off to go to graduate school, we supported you.
That when you wanted to come back part time, we supported you.
That you planned your departure in secret, we now know, for months.
And let us know that you were leaving, not even with a phone call, but with an email to me and to peter, attaching a proposed form of joint press release.
That you are now planning to take as much of our work as possible.
And to recruit as many of our attorneys as possible.
I can tell you that virtually all of the attorneys you name here are pretty angry with you.

There must be a poem about deception or ingratitude that would be more apposite?

First, damn.

Second, this is unfortunately inevitable. High-ranking partners can’t be entirely transparent in setting up their move. There are any number of obstacles that could derail the move and they can’t put their present firm through the roller coaster of “will they or won’t they” for months on end. But that secrecy also leaves the rest of the firm blindsided when it finally comes out. There’s just no good way to make a break like this — only time will heal. One might point to other high-profile separations and say there’s clearly a model for a smoother transition than this one, but really that’s only what we saw from the outside.

My sense is that Quinn’s irritation is much more prevalent when partners depart than you might think.

# Peer Pressure Causes Another Firm To Increase Associate Compensation

Peer pressure: it’s for more than just teenagers desperate to appear cool. Biglaw firms are now admitting it’s the big reason they are showing associates the money. DC-based Hogan Lovells just announced they are moving to the Cravath scale for most of their offices:

Our associates are critical to our overall success. We have always aimed to provide our associates with fair and market-based total compensation — both base salary and merit-based bonuses — that is competitive with our peer firms.

Thirteen-year-olds everywhere were right, [peer pressure works](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/).

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The Miami and Colorado Springs offices won’t be seeing as big of a raise ([perhaps wisely](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/?rf=1)), but they will be getting a raise — they’ll get a percentage increase the same as the others in their class year. Summers are getting the benefit of the raise, and counsel will be dealt with individually. With those small caveats, the Hogan Lovells associates are just enjoying their payday. As one tipster noted:

The real story here is that we are all pretty excited to be the first dc based firm to move, especially after Covington beat us to the punch on bonuses. Associates here beginning to truly believe management is committed to its positive new messages regarding firm vision and operation across the board.

Also, if other dc centered firms don’t up their base, we are very excited for lateral and law school hiring seasons :).

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

(Read the full Hogan Lovells memo to associates on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/peer-pressure-causes-another-firm-to-increase-associate-compensation/2/).)

# Clients Should Try Not To Contact Lawyers During Odd Hours
## Lawyers are people too, and they have the same social and family responsibilities that everyone else does.

Clients sometimes need to contact lawyers at all times of the day and night because an emergent situation requires the immediate attention of counsel. Many people have contemplated which lawyer they might call if they were in a pinch at an inconvenient times, and some things cannot wait until ordinary business hours. However, sometimes clients contact lawyers at odd times for nonemergent matters. In certain instances, clients just want to communicate with a lawyer once they remember something and think if they hold off on doing so they might forget to contact counsel later. However, clients should try not to contact lawyers at odd hours whenever this is possible.

The main reason why clients should try not to contact lawyers outside of business hours is because lawyers might not be able to give their full attention to an issue during their personal time. This could be because a lawyer is involved in a social affair that makes it difficult to drop everything to help a client. For instance, a few months after starting my law firm, I was at a bar on a Saturday. At about 9:30 p.m., while I was with a group of friends, a client texted me about a contract I was working on. At the time, I was away from my computer and was not too focused on client work, so it was difficult to give the client adequate feedback at that moment.

Several years ago, I was at a noisy and crowded holiday party when a client called me. This was actually an emergent matter, so I understood why the client reached out to me when he had free time to discuss the matter. However, I had a difficult time hearing what the client had to say while at the party since there was a lot of revelry going on in the background. I ended up leaving the party to speak with the client, but I was definitely not as efficient in responding to the client as I might have been a few hours earlier if I had been called while I was at my desk.

A client who communicates with a lawyer during odd hours also runs the risk that they might not get as quick of a response from their lawyer than they would if the communication occurred during business hours. Sometimes lawyers do not wish to respond to a client immediately during nights or weekends. Lawyers are people too, and they have the same family responsibilities that everyone has and this can keep them from immediately responding to client calls or emails.

When the business day finally rolls around, it can sometimes be difficult to remember all of the people that reached out during off hours. Even the most diligent lawyer might not remember people who called a day or two ago when faced with the many various things that a lawyer needs to do during a given day. As a result, contacting counsel during odd hours for nonemergent issues can lead to a client getting slower service than if they waited to speak to counsel during work hours.

Another reason why clients should try not to contact counsel during odd hours is because many lawyers do not want to be bothered during their personal time. The work-life balance has been eroded in recent years, especially due to the work-from-home revolution. It is difficult for lawyers and other professionals to carve out time to spend with family and friends without worrying that they will be interrupted by work. Reading a work email or text during personal time can make that personal time less enjoyable.

No matter what lawyers might publicly admit, lawyers appreciate some of their clients more than others. This can be due to a number of reasons, which might include paying bills on time, being efficient in the handling of attorney-client matters, and contacting lawyers during work hours to minimize the impact that clients might have on a lawyer’s personal time. Lawyers need to decide how to triage their clients’ work and make the most efficient use of their time since there are often not enough hours in the day to give substantial attention to every matter. Lawyers might devote more attention to clients who respect work-life boundaries than those who reach out over nonemergent matters at odd hours.

James Gilliland, Jr.

Late last month, [ we reported on the shooting death](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-partner-murdered-outside-of-his-home/) of James Gilliland, Jr., an intellectual property partner at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton. Gilliland was shot to death at his California home on October 27, and at this time it is still unknown whether Gilliland was stalked or followed, whether he was the victim of a robbery (though [police say that’s unlikely](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/few-leads-have-emerged-in-case-of-slain-biglaw-partner/)), or whether he and gunman knew one another. Police do not yet have a motive for the crime, and to date, have no information on a possible suspect.

Gilliland served as the chair of Townsend & Townsend & Crew from 2001 to 2010, before it merged and became Kilpatrick Townsend. During his time as an IP partner with the firm, he represented clients including Apple, Sony, and Oracle.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Given the dearth of information related to Gilliland’s shooting, the El Cerrito Police Department has announced a [$50,000 reward](https://local.nixle.com/alert/5777528/) offered by an anonymous, private donor, for any leads in the case that may result in the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible for Gilliland’s death. Police have asked anyone with information about Gilliland’s death to contact them by calling 510-215-4400, emailing investigations@ci.el-cerrito.ca.us or leaving a voice mail at 510-215-4414, ext. 40.

Susan Spaeth, the managing partner of Kilpatrick Townsend, released this statement:

We strongly encourage anyone with information that might assist the investigation into the tragic death of our colleague and dear friend to immediately come forward and contact the El Cerrito Police Department. Jim Gilliland was such a positive force of nature. While he kept his loving family at the center of his life, he also volunteered his time to those in need, including his lifelong work to develop wider educational opportunities for disadvantaged youth in the East Bay. The larger community, not just the legal community, is a much lesser place without Jim. Whoever is responsible for this heinous crime needs to be brought to justice.

Our thoughts remain with the family, friends, and colleagues of this prominent attorney.

# 4 Ideas For Advancing Diversity And Inclusion In The Legal Profession
## Everyone's always talking about how to improve diversity in the law; here are some concrete ideas for doing so.

Earlier this week, I attended an excellent event on [diversity and inclusion in Biglaw](http://www.bna.com/Big-Law-Business-Diversity-and-Inclusion-Agenda/), sponsored by Big Law Business. Thought leaders from law firms, in-house legal departments, government agencies, and bar associations came together to discuss what Biglaw can do to improve its [less then stellar record](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/americans-rank-law-firms-dead-last-in-commitment-to-diversity/) when it comes to diversity issues.

Based on the wide-ranging discussions, here are four concrete ideas for improving diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) in Biglaw and in the legal profession more generally:

1. Make the business case for diversity and inclusion.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The current president of the ABA, [Paulette Brown](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/aba_officers/brown.html), pointed out that a good record on diversity is good for business. She cited studies showing that companies with women on their boards of directors outperform companies with all-male boards, that companies with more racial diversity in their employee ranks outperform companies with less, and that law firms with greater diversity outperform firms with less diversity, even controlling for other variables.

This theme received reinforcement from former Orrick partner [Patricia Gillette](https://www.orrick.com/lawyers/patricia-gillette/Pages/default.aspx). She argued that D&I advocates for years focused on things like work/life balance and flexible schedules, when instead they should have been focused on things like bringing in business and assuming positions of leadership. By stressing work/life balance over business development, women and minorities were inviting themselves to be pegged as lawyers not interested in business.

As a former rainmaker herself, Gillette argued that in a law firm, those with big books of business hold the power. Less than 10 percent of top Biglaw rainmakers are women or minorities — and if that doesn’t change, then law firm leadership won’t become more diverse.

In a later panel, Dr. [Rohini Anand](http://www.diversityinc.com/rohini-anand/), senior vice president and global chief diversity officer of Sodexo, expanded on the business benefits of diversity. She talked about how a company’s diversity can help it strengthen client ties and recruit the best talent — especially millennials, who prioritize diversity when selecting employers.

2. Keep track of diversity data within your organization.

As the old business saying (attributed to management guru [Peter Drucker](http://www.guavabox.com/blog/if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-improve-it)) goes, “You can’t manage what you can’t measure.” If legal workplaces want to improve their diversity, they need to keep track of their diversity (or [lack](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/ball-dont-lie-what-percentage-of-biglaw-partners-are-white/) [thereof](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/92-of-biglaw-partners-are-white-is-this-problematic/)). So it’s important to maintain records about the diversity of your workforce (consistent, of course, with local laws; some speakers pointed out that privacy laws in certain overseas jurisdictions, including various European countries, limit the ability to collect such data).

Erika Irish Brown, global head of diversity and inclusion at Bloomberg, emphasized how her company is famously data-dirven. So Bloomberg maintains many metrics on diversity, and then it asks the leaders of different business units to set diversity goals for themselves reflecting the data available.

Further underscoring the importance of gathering data, Rhonda Mims of Paul Hastings (previously [profiled](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/what-being-a-lawyer-means-to-rhonda-mims-of-paul-hastings-new-chair-of-the-executive-leadership-council/) in our pages) announced that her firm will be working together with Bloomberg to conduct further research into D&I issues.

3. Tie part of compensation to progress on diversity.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If you want to make progress on D&I, you might want to put your money where your mouth is. Rohini Anand of Sodexo noted that her company uses a diversity scorecard, and how a particular unit or division performs on diversity will affect an executive’s compensation. For some execs, as much as 15 percent of their bonus can be tied to diversity-related metrics. Executives will take D&I issues much more seriously when they know that part of their paycheck depends on it.

4. Strengthen formal training programs on diversity issues.

Training is not a panacea to D&I problems, of course, but it can help — especially when it comes to helping well-intentioned people became part of the solution rather than the problem.

Pat Gillette gave this example: a well-intentioned, white male partner, worried about hurting the feelings of a minority woman associate, doesn’t give her candid feedback on an assignment that she doesn’t complete perfectly; instead, he thanks her for her work product and doesn’t work with her again (which is, as columnist Mark Herrmann has explained, a [pretty common approach](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/do-you-manage-projects-or-do-you-manage-people/) to Biglaw talent management). This partner thinks he’s being nice, but he’s actually doing the associate a disservice; it would be better for him to give her honest feedback so she can improve. This is the type of situation that can be avoided through proper training.

Another problem that can be remedied, at least in part, through training: implicit bias, which Paulette Brown referred to as [“the silent killer of diversity in the legal profession.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/implicit-bias-the-silent-killer-of-diversity-in-the-legal-profession/) To see one example of a training video on implicit bias, Brown directed the audience to the webpage of the ABA’s new [Diversity & Inclusion 360 Commission](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/office_of_the_president/diversityandinclusion360.html).

Despite the challenges, Paulette Brown described herself as a “glass half-full kind of person” when it comes to diversity and inclusion. If we work together and work hard enough, she said, “we can bring about prosperity and justice for all.”

Thanks to Big Law Business and Bloomberg BNA for hosting an afternoon of thought-provoking conversations. If you’re interested in law firm diversity, please keep up with our [ongoing coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/law-firm-diversity/) of this important issue, including the weekly column of [Renwei Chung](https://abovethelaw.com/author/renweichung/) each Friday.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Announces Layoffs
## The layoff trend continues in Biglaw.

Fresh [off the news](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/perkins-coie-billable-hours-change/) that Perkins Coie — a firm that made $1,155,565,000 in gross revenue in 2021, making it 42nd on the Am Law 100 — told associates the number of billable hours they’d have to log to get their full bonus was going up, there’s another cost-cutting measure at the firm: layoffs.

Today, Bill Malley, Firmwide Managing Partner, announced the firm’s laying off 58 business professionals across their U.S. offices. The firm’s severance package for those laid off includes severance pay, assistance with healthcare coverage costs, access to Lyra Health for mental health support, outplacement services, a payout for unused paid time off, and sabbatical pay for those that qualify.

In a firmwide memo obtained by Above the Law, Malley blamed the staff reduction on a combination of economic forces and technology taking over one-time manual functions:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The legal industry has shifted again over the past year. Like most law firms, we are navigating macroeconomic forces and market conditions that are driving up costs at a higher rate than revenue. Those conditions have forced us and other law firms to take steps to manage the rate of increase in expenses, while continuing to serve our clients at the highest level and to make investments that support the firm’s long-term growth.

Beyond the immediate economic environment, we are navigating deep transformations in the workplace and in the way legal services are provided. As a firm, we operate more than ever in national teams that provide highly specialized support across time zones and locations. We use technology in new ways to deliver information more efficiently. We automate tasks that previously were manual. We build custom solutions tailored to client needs. We innovate in the way we price and deliver legal services. These changes compel us to transform our own business by re-thinking roles, restructuring departments, and re-imagining the way we work together to serve our clients.

Malley also indicated the cuts are “consistent with delivering excellent service and maintaining the long-term health and competitiveness of our firm.” Perkins Coie will also be offering informational sessions to answer questions that folks at the firm may have about the layoffs.

You can read the firm’s full memo below.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

# A Day In The Life Of A Biglaw Mom
## The specter of face time looms large.

Everyone (or at least all the people reading Above the Law) is aware that working in Biglaw is a beast of a job. The hours, the stress, the competition — it is a lot to deal with. Then throw on responsibility for making sure a tiny human doesn’t die, and wow, [that’s a lot](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/11/departure-memo-of-the-day-parenting-gets-the-best-of-one-biglaw-associate/).

Over on CorporetteMoms, they have a[ series](http://corporettemoms.com/category/week-in-the-life-of-a-working-mom/) that details the week in the life of a working mom. This week a Biglaw working mom from Chicago was [featured](http://corporettemoms.com/biglaw-mom-chicago/), in what was termed a “slow week.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, the days start early and end late. But despite the hours this mom is logging on a daily basis, the specter of face time looms large:

6:00 p.m. – I leave work. Supposedly this firm is not big on “face time” but even though I work most evenings from home, I’m usually the first one to leave at 6:00 and feel weird about it. I think my department is actually pretty keen on face time. I am almost always the first one in in the morning, but no one is here to see that — they only see that I leave at 6:00.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As much as flextime, part-time, and remote working options are touted by firms as a response to a need in the market, they are only meaningful if using them doesn’t hurt the user’s career. Worrying about face time means these benefits won’t be used as much as they could or should be. The bias, whether conscious or not, towards in office work in the legal profession is a real issue that needs to be dealt with head-on if firms want to be serious about diversity.

# Diversity For The Legal Industry Continues To Be A Riddle, Wrapped In a Mystery, Inside An Enigma
## The diversity and inclusion equation isn’t unsolvable, but there isn't a simple solution either.

“Strength and guidance / All that I’m wishing for my friends / Nobody makes it from my ends / I had to bust up the silence.” – [Drake](http://genius.com/8940024)

Last week, Law360 released their most recent data on diversity in the legal profession. It published two articles: [US Law Firms Fail To Move Needle On Racial Diversity](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/794900/us-law-firms-fail-to-move-needle-on-racial-diversity) and [The Top 100 Firms For Minority Attorneys](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/794901/the-top-100-firms-for-minority-attorneys). The results revealed more of the same. As Law360 noted, “law firms continue to make negligible progress toward improving the diversity of their attorney ranks.”

According to Law360’s survey, more than eight in ten attorneys at more than 300 U.S. law firms surveyed were white, almost identical figures as the year before. While [some law firms](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/794901/the-top-100-firms-for-minority-attorneys) were able to gain traction, other firms continued to spin their wheels. More than nine in ten partners at U.S. law firms were white, with an even higher percentage of equity partners who were white.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Since 2000, minorities in the legal profession have increased by [less than one percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/minorities-in-the-legal-profession-have-increased-by-less-than-one-percent-since-2000/) of the total attorney population. In 2020, the figures will look [nearly identical](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/without-significant-changes-diversity-in-the-legal-profession-will-remain-on-life-support/). If there is no 2025 plan by the majority of law firms, then there will likely be little to no change in the legal profession. In other words, the legal profession will continue to look more like a [mirrortocracy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/what-do-the-oscars-and-the-legal-profession-have-in-common/) than a meritocracy.

Last week, Stanford Business’s Lee Simmons wrote about [how to solve Silicon Valley’s gender problem](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/solving-silicon-valleys-gender-problem). Simmons’s introduction, discussing the [Ellen Pao discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/the-curious-case-of-ellen-pao-and-the-lesson-we-can-learn-from-it/), stated, “testimony revealed a startling lack of diversity and pervasive sexism, not just in venture capital but throughout Silicon Valley. This wasn’t what we expected from an industry that claimed to be inventing the future.”

Just as venture capitalists tend to blame “pipeline issues” on the lack of diversity, law partners often [cite these issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/why-lack-of-diversity-isnt-biglaws-fault/) as well.  But since 2002, more than 20 percent of law school graduates have been minorities, according to the [American Bar Association](https://www.law360.com/companies/american-bar-association). At the top law schools that traditionally feed recruits to elite law firms, the percentage of minority students hovers around 30 percent, with some top-tier law schools closing in on 40 percent, as noted by Law 360.

Monica Leas, co-producer of [Elephant in the Valley](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/solving-silicon-valleys-gender-problem), believes that hiring targets are an optimal strategy for solving the diversity riddle. She differentiates targets from quotas and states, “even if you don’t hit the numbers on the timeline, you’re making progress, and just setting a target forces managers to think through all the pieces that go into the equation.”

There is a [big difference](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/differentiating-diversity-goals-from-quotas-in-the-legal-profession/) between goals and quotas. Goals are aspirational. In reality, these diversity goals may never be achieved. But failure to solve the [diversity crisis in the legal profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/3-things-law-firms-can-do-right-now-to-increase-diversity-in-the-legal-profession/) should not be for lack of effort. Law firms that aspire to be more diverse can and should share their clear numerical targets for diversity.

The [lack of diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/92-of-biglaw-partners-are-white-is-this-problematic/) is startling for an industry that claims to address discrimination and inequality. The failure to plan a strategy for addressing diversity often results in a [plan of failure](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/americans-rank-law-firms-dead-last-in-commitment-to-diversity/) for a diverse workforce.

Without a specific plan, diversity for the majority of law firms will continue to be a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. Of course, the diversity and inclusion equation [isn’t unsolvable](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/4-ideas-for-advancing-diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-legal-profession/?rf=1). But admittedly, there isn’t a [simple solution](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/4-thoughts-about-closing-the-diversity-gap-in-the-legal-profession/) either.

# Biglaw Firm Gives Associates Raises, With A Side Of Increased Hours Requirements
## With more money comes more billing requirements.

Yesterday, associates at Locke Lord got a surprise memo, asking them to attend — if their schedules permit, natch — an in-person meeting about associate compensation. The firm hadn’t made any moves on the raise/special bonus front that’s been sweeping Biglaw this summer, so finding out what the firm had in mind was big news. Though some Above the Law sources weren’t about to get their hopes up:

Current rumor is that we are not matching the new scale. And an in-person meeting vs an email is never a good sign.
Once there, a chart was distributed laying out new base salaries for each class year at three different levels of billing: one at 1850 hours, one at 1950 hours, and bonuses that are available at 2050 hours. Looking at a comparison of the old scale to the new one, you can see the base compensation numbers never match the market rate for each class year. It’s only at the 2050-hour bonus level that associates can hope to catch their peers at other firms, though as most firms haven’t announced their 2018 bonus scale yet, it’s impossible to know how high-billing associates at Locke Lord will stack up against the market.

But there’s more than just a confusing chart to take away from the Locke Lord compensation meeting. With more money comes more billing requirements. As a tipster told us, the minimum hours requirement has been jacked up from 1700 hours to 1850. Yikes.

It’s important to note that the minimum billable requirement at Locke was 1700 before (2000 expected but minimum of 1700 to move forward with your class year). The new scale is going into effect January 1, 2018, so we have 3 months and change to try and hit at least 1850. And if we don’t, we could be facing a pay cut (supposedly up to 5%).

Best of luck to our readers from Locke Lord — here’s hoping your hours are plentiful.

# This Is Why Working In Biglaw Sucks So Hard
## Biglaw would be okay, for most people anyway, if going to work every day didn't fill them with a sick sense of dread and the certain knowledge their soul was slowly being sucked away.

Something that I know to be true, but have a difficult time explaining: working in Biglaw is the worst. Now, folks that have been there immediately understand that truth, but for the uninitiated, it can be a tough sell. Sure, the hours are long, and the demands often unreasonable, but more than anything, it is the treatment that causes people to bail on the life.

According to [Valerie Alexander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/speakhappiness), a corporate trainer and former Biglaw ([Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison](https://abovethelaw.com/brobeck-phleger-harrison/)) associate, [that attitude](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/valerie-alexander/the-epidemic-thats-costin_b_11413600.html) is costing firms hundreds of thousands of dollars. She defines the phenomenon of “Accidental Managers,” people who fall into supervisory roles without any management training, and it is a huge problems for law firms:

When I work with a law firm that is losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in turnover and absenteeism, one of the first questions I’ll ask is, “How many managers do you have?” The answer for a large firm is generally, “Around 10 or 12,” at which point I have to point out that they have 300 attorneys, every one of whom has an assistant, and supervisory duties over paralegals, junior lawyers, receptionists and so on. Thus, every one of those lawyers is a manager. And none of them has been taught managerial skills. I was a lawyer in a 900-attorney firm and I taught law school, and this kind of curriculum or training does not seem to be offered anywhere. In fact, while I was a visiting professor at Berkeley Law, I took an hour out of my syllabus to teach, “How to speak to your assistant,” which most students thought was a waste of time. A year or two later, I started getting their emails, as so many finally understood what I was trying to convey.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The notion that happy employees will cost an employer less than unhappy ones seems logical, but the increase in productivity, decrease in absenteeism, and cost of turnover can be difficult for firms — and other employers — to quantify. As a result, terrible management practices continue, despite the hit to employers’ self-interest. And there can be other reasons the practice continues:

[Upper management] came up through the ranks under their share of Accidental Managers and have never seen mindful, effective team leadership modeled. The second is that if they are aware of what makes for good managerial practices, they assume everyone already knows this as well, intuitively. That’s a grave mistake. Nothing about modern workforce management is instinctive. For most of human existence, our leaders were those who were the biggest, strongest and most aggressive — the ones who the tribe most feared. In today’s culture, fear is not a motivator for employee engagement, and yet, our instinct still tells us it is.

All of which rings very true to those that have done their time in the Biglaw ranks. Think about it: Do Biglaw firms generally offer management workshops or even give informal assistance on  how to deal with junior associates? Nope. And the type of personality that does well in the academic rigors of law school (and thus winds up in Biglaw) isn’t always the best at interpersonal skills.

The hours and workload of Biglaw would all be okay, for most people anyway, if going to work every day didn’t fill them with a sick sense of dread and the certain knowledge their soul was slowly being sucked away. Crappy managers make the day in, day out of even the best jobs awful. Once Biglaw partners realize that, they’ll have a better, happier workforce on their hands.

# Second Set Of Layoffs Strike Am Law 100 Biglaw Firm
## The cuts are being made to 'manage costs.'

Following a slow 2023 that saw a dip in revenue, Biglaw firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner is making its second round of layoffs in a year. This time, the firm is cutting almost 50 jobs in their U.S. and U.K. offices. The majority of the laid-off employees worked in business services positions.

In response to the layoffs, a firm spokesperson said, “Like many firms in recent months, we are conducting a small and targeted restructuring in selected areas of the firm to manage costs and shape our size and capabilities to practice demand.”

“The purpose of this is to maintain our strong footing and further focus on investing in priority growth opportunities, whether in terms of practice area or geography, where client demand is greatest,” they continued.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/18/in-another-round-of-layoffs-bclp-cuts-50-roles-across-us-and-uk-offices-405-138203/) Law.com, BCLP did not have a great 2023 financially, with both revenue and revenue per lawyer taking a hit.

BCLP posted a 0.6% decline in revenue in 2023 at $840 million and a 0.1% decline in RPL, as head count held roughly flat at 1,185 full-time equivalent attorneys. A 5.7% decline in equity partners helped push the firm’s profits per equity partner up slightly, with a 0.8% gain to $950,000.

[Ten months ago, BCLP made](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/bryan-cave-layoffs/) its first set of layoffs — 47 business professionals were let go at that time.

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Bryan Cave.

# Getting A Job Versus Performing At A Job
## Baseball offers examples for personal growth as a lawyer.

Baseball, in some ways, is perfect.

If you bat .366 for a lifetime, your name is Ty Cobb.

If you batted .406 in a single year, your name is Ted Williams, and it’s 1941.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For purposes of today’s column, baseball is perfect in another way: We know you earned your job. If you can bat .333 and are serviceable anywhere in the field, you’ve earned your spot on a major league roster. Your qualifications for the job — batting .333 — and your performance in the job — continuing to bat .333 — are identical.

Politicians, naturally, got me to thinking about this subject. The qualifications for the job might include being rich (so you can fund your own campaign) or being reasonably attractive (so your TV ads are enticing) or being able to deliver a memorized speech as though it were extemporaneous (so your campaign events don’t sound stilted) or some such thing.

Your performance in the job, however, is completely unrelated to your qualifications for the job. It’s hard, in fact, to put one’s finger on exactly how one should evaluate politicians’ job performances. Legislators don’t, for example, write laws; that’s all done by staff. And typical legislators don’t generate support for laws; that’s done by the senior folks in leadership.  Maybe legislators are supposed to be able to distinguish liberal laws from conservative laws, so the legislator’s record over time means something — although I’d like to believe that a thinking person is liberal on some issues and conservative on others and doesn’t always vote the party line.

In any event, a legislator’s qualifications for a job are unrelated to a legislator’s capacity to perform the job. It’s a mismatch between how you get the job and whether you succeed in it.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
How about lawyers?

At big firms, junior lawyers must be smart, conscientious, hard-working, gifted writers, and adept on their feet. Check those boxes, and you’ll succeed while you’re young.

Senior lawyers must attract business. Sometimes that coincides with being smart or conscientious or hard-working or a gifted writer or adept on your feet. But in some ways it’s an unrelated skill.

There’s a funny dichotomy here. If you started at a firm and worked your way up into the partnership ranks, you may well have the skills needed of young lawyers and old ones: You probably earned your partnership in part by being a good associate and maintained your status by generating business. (Some firms might invite into the partnership associates who were inept lawyers but attracted huge amounts of business, but that seems like a dangerous bed to lie in.)

Lateral partners, on the other hand, are judged on a different scale. No one really knows if a lateral partner is technically competent. No one has worked with the lateral for years and seen the lateral develop over time; the lateral’s work product, if any is reviewed at all, may well have been generated by others on the lateral’s team. The lateral’s quality as a lawyer may be suspect; the lateral was judged primarily on the lateral’s ability to bring in business.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This certainly doesn’t say anything about the quality of any individual lawyer.  Any individual lateral partner could be good or bad; that probably wasn’t what they were judged on.

But this may say something about the nature of a firm: Where a firm consists primarily of home-grown lawyers, the firm may be better able to control quality in the way the firm prefers.

# Biglaw Firm Hit With Second Discrimination Lawsuit This Year
## These are some salacious allegations.

Just over a month after being hit with a[ $300 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/am-law-100-firm-hit-with-300-million-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1) purported class action alleging gender discrimination and unequal pay, Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart has been hit with another discrimination lawsuit.

The most recent suit was filed by a “John Doe” who was employed at the firm as both a staff attorney and counsel. He alleges that Los Angeles-based employment partner [Johnnie James](https://ogletree.com/people/johnnie-a-james) subjected him to sexual harassment and discrimination, which he says began shortly after he joined the firm. According to the complaint, James propositioned Doe to have sex with him and his husband, discussed his porn habits, showed Doe explicit images, referred to Doe as the “cute Latino,” and told Doe about his sexual fantasies involving Latino men. The complaint goes on to detail several instances of alleged inappropriate behavior:

On February 24, 2017, Doe once again reluctantly accepted James’s invitation to go out for drinks after work. While they were having drinks, James began discussing a “go-go boy” (i.e., a male stripper) with whom he was “obsessed.” In an apparent attempt to arouse Doe, James pulled out his cell phone and began playing a graphic porn scene of two men having sex. Doe was in shock, looked away, and told James he did not want to watch it. James put his phone away, but continued to brag to Doe about his sexual exploits with the go-go dancer, specifically how James “got [his] dick sucked in a gym shower stall at the Gold’s Gym in downtown LA” by the dancer. He then told Doe, “I guess I just told you that I cheated on my husband,” which Doe interpreted as a suggestion that James wanted to cheat on his husband with Doe.

Doe also alleges he was paid at least $30,000 less than associates with the equivalent amount of experience, even after he was promoted to counsel.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/02/21/ogletree-deakins-and-la-based-partner-hit-with-sex-harassment-suit/) Law.com, the noted employment law firm denies the allegations:

An Olgetree Deakins spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that while it takes “the allegations filed by a former staff attorney very seriously, the salacious nature of these allegations do not make them true and cannot change the facts.”

“We promptly and fully investigated these allegations once they were brought to our attention, and subsequently determined them to be false, unsubstantiated or deficient,” the spokeswoman said. “Far from being terminated by the firm, upon voluntarily resigning the plaintiff accepted a partner position at another defense firm, which in fact is currently defending approximately ten cases brought by the plaintiff’s attorney in this matter.”

Biglaw firms across the country are implementing all manner of initiatives to bring attention to the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion among their ranks.

We now have news that one of the top firms in the country has amended its billable hours policy in the name of promoting diversity.

Greenberg Traurig — a firm that brought in $1,730,230,000 gross revenue in 2020 — has been focused on this important initiative since July 2020, when it announced this policy change to recognize associates’ efforts to bring positive change to their firm and their community at large. From the firm’s press release:

Greenberg Traurig has also updated its guidelines for the firm’s U.S. associates intended to reward and incentivize participation in diversity and inclusion activities, as well as in community and civic activities. Effective July 1, 2020, associates will receive up to 50 hours of billable equivalent credit for work on diversity and inclusion initiatives and 25 hours for activities that serve to advance community and civic interests. The firm’s associates can also receive up to 100 hours of billable equivalent credit for pro bono legal work; this includes 25 hours that are mandatory for associates.

Here are some of the activities that are billable and bonus-eligible at the firm:



Greenberg Traurig also launched a Social Justice Action Academy, in the hope of educating and training personnel on matters of race, justice, and equity while facilitating and encouraging “Courageous Conversations” on the topics of race and social justice. The Academy also aims to provide law firm employees with the resources they may need to become leaders on matters of race, inclusion, and equity through the use of its Equality Toolkit. The firm has also pledged to commit $5 million over the next five years to support Equal Justice Works fellows focused on addressing racial, social, and economic justice issues.

“Through a range of targeted activities and new initiatives, our Social, Racial, and Economic Justice Action Plan is now further enhanced with the goal of achieving even greater impact,” said [Brian L. Duffy](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/d/duffy-brian-l), CEO of Greenberg Traurig. “Under the direction of Chief Diversity Officer and Shareholder [Nikki Lewis Simon](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/s/simon-nikki-lewis), the academy promises to be a highly relevant resource for education and meaningful discussions aimed at bridging the gaps in understanding the causes and effects of racism and creating a platform for change,” said [Ernest Lamont Greer](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/g/greer-ernest-lamont), co-president of Greenberg Traurig.

Armed with hundreds of cut-and-pasted complaints and boilerplate discovery motions, Strike 3 floods this courthouse (and others around the country) with lawsuits smacking of extortion. It treats this court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATM. Its feigned desire for legal process masks what it really seeks: for the court to oversee a high-tech shakedown. This court declines.

— U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth of the District of Columbia [blasting](https://www.law.com/2018/11/27/fox-rothschild-overseeing-high-tech-shakedown-for-porn-client-judge-says/) the copyright cases Fox Rothschild has brought on behalf of its client, [porn company Strike 3](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firms-staggering-work-on-behalf-of-a-porn-studio/). Judge Lamberth’s opinion was in response to plaintiff’s request to subpoena an internet service provider to find the identity of a user who Strike 3 alleged illegally downloaded their copyrighted content. Fox Rothschild partner Lincoln Bandlow had this to say about the judge’s opinion: “[his] ruling is wrong on the facts and the law,” and he vowed to appeal the decision.

# Supreme Court Leaves Nine Stones Unturned
## And what's going on with the legal market right now?

The Supreme Court’s inquiry into the source of the leak of its draft opinion in Dobbs failed to find the culprit among the clerks and permanent staff. Attorneys familiar with internal investigations pointed out that the report appeared [carefully drafted to mislead the public without technically lying](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-supreme-court-leak-report-but-the-justices-were-afraid-to-ask/) about the failure to investigate the people with the most access and motive, leaving the Court’s legitimacy more compromised than when the investigation started.

# 5 To Thrive: In-House Email Hacks 2.0
## Email efficiency is key to your success.

I know, I know.

I have already blogged once about email hacks for in-house counsel — and the idea that there might be more tips just about managing email may be ridiculous. At the same time, whenever I get together with other in-house colleagues, the number of emails we receive daily is still a common complaint and obvious bane of our collective existence.

So in hopes of being helpful, here are five more tips for more efficient use of email.

1. Consider whether the information should be an email at all.

This may seem like too obvious a tip, but think about how many times you have personally received an email or a long email thread or chain and thought to yourself, “Why is this even an email?” So out of creating good email “karma,” consider whether the information you want to send should be an email before sending it.

For example, if you are looking for rich brainstorming on a complex legal issue or collaborating on a single document, email is not the most efficient method. A meeting is probably better for brainstorming and benchmarking, and collaborating using software where users can suggest changes in real time on a document is probably better for version control and will cut down on duplicative or cumulative suggestions.

Also, consider if there are other applications that are better suited to your needs.  Recently, our company moved to Microsoft Teams, and I am loving the chat function for “FYIs” and quick questions. If my quick question turns into something more complicated, I can set up a phone call on the fly, if the person is available, or schedule a meeting for a later time — with zero added emails to my inbox.

Lastly, when you’re the person sending an email, from your perspective, it’s probably clear, but once you receive a couple of questions asking for clarification, it’s a sign that: (1) your email wasn’t as clear as you thought, which may be a sign to take more time next time in drafting it and/or (2) it’s better left for a meeting. My personal rule of thumb is if my email creates two or three “back and forths,” I need to abort mission and try something else.

2. Don’t bury the lede.

This tip is a little different than starting with the ask. One of my readers shared this tip — when it comes to legal advice, start with the exception or what is wrong first, in case your recipient just skims and doesn’t read your entire email.

If your email reads like this: “Overall, this looks good. I like how X, Y, and Z are presented. Makes a lot of sense. Puts us in a competitive position. Kudos to the team. But I might suggest we push back on A because …” there is a risk that your reader doesn’t get to the exception.

And while that is not necessarily your fault because you presume people read the entire email, the fact is a lot of people don’t, and let’s face it — are you going to be the one to tell the C-Suite executive that she misread your email?

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Save yourself the trouble and get in the habit of pointing out what needs to be fixed or addressed first. Consider how busy your audience is and how they might just want to get through their hundreds of email as quickly as possible and draft accordingly.

3. Consider timing for best chance of response.

This is a new one I’ve learned. Fridays (especially after noon) are just not great days to send something you need a response to, even if you just want to get it off your to-do list. It won’t likely get read — and then when Monday rolls around, your Friday email gets pushed to the bottom and possibly lost. I try to target Monday to Wednesday mornings for my most important messages.

4. Consider using OOO even when you’re not actually OOO.

I know this sounds a bit like cheating, but I love customizing my out of office messages to help me set expectations with clients. For example, if I’m in an all-day meeting, I like to share that “I’m in the office, but in an all-day meeting, where I can’t be as responsive as I’d like to be. I plan to respond to emails received by X date. If you need a response sooner, please let me know. If this is an emergency that cannot wait until tomorrow, please text me.” I do something similar if I’m working on a project that needs my concentration — my “deep work” days. You could even share something like, “My calendar is tight this week, but if you need to meet, I can be flexible and make myself available during these dates/times on a first come, first-served basis.” Beyond setting expectations, it’s the intentional precommunication that saves you time.

5. Avoid forwarding strings.

This one is probably self-explanatory. How many times have you received a long string of forwards with a one-liner like, “Your thoughts?” or “Legal advice?” or better yet, only “????” And you have no idea what the actual ask is. It came from someone who was obviously trying to get through their emails as quickly as possible (such as a busy executive) and unintentionally wasted your time because even after reading every single email in the string, you still have no idea. Unintentional or not, don’t be that person. Take the time to create an email with a proper ask and include only the relevant information. You may find that it will limit the “back and forths.” Plus, if you use an email management system where you need to save the emails for searching later, the “FW FW FW or RE RE RE” are not great ways to try to “find” the email later on so take the time to change the subject too.

Hopefully there are helpful! Any other email hacks I may have missed?

# Lawyers Can Innocently Cite To Nonexistent Authorities

Some news articles recently have reported on lawyers who were caught citing legal authorities that did not exist. Earlier this year, [a lawyer relied on artificial intelligence](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/judge-contemplates-whether-to-sanction-lawyers-who-used-chatgpt-after-hearing-them-out/) to compose legal writing, and the AI tool cited to nonexistent authority in a manner that is consistent with the “hallucinations” that some AI tools experience. More recently, a lawyer was seemingly caught [citing to made-up authorities](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/michael-cohen-trump-lawyer-chatgpt/) that people were not able to track down. Although making up fake authorities is unacceptable in the legal profession (and most others), there are some ways that lawyers might more innocently cite nonexistent authorities when preparing legal papers.

Copying Citations

From my own experience, lawyers can get tripped up if they copy citations from work that other people prepared. For instance, sometimes a legal decision includes a solid recitation of the law and a citation to an authority, and it can be tempting to copy and paste the entire passage into a brief that an attorney is preparing. Lawyers might think that courts would not cite to nonexistent authorities and that this practice is safe. However, courts are run by fallible people, and I have definitely checked citations included in legal opinions and found errors in the past. As such, lawyers should not trust legal opinions to include trustworthy citations to the law.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Copying the work of other lawyers can also be perilous. Sometimes, lawyers work on large teams when preparing legal papers. A team is only as valuable as its weakest link, and if one person has a bad citation, it might not be caught by other members of the team. As a practice, if I rely on work that was prepared by another lawyer, I always cite check the authorities. Every so often, I find that citations are wrong, and this could have easily caused problems.

Bad Citations

More commonly, citation issues are caused by bad citations rather than any negative motive by the lawyer. It is easy for lawyers to mix up page numbers or copy and paste a citation that does not reflect the point of law to which the lawyer is referring. At the beginning of my career, when I was working at a Biglaw shop, I worked on a team that had a citation failure. The court dropped a footnote in its opinion calling out the fact that a citation in a given brief was not accurate, and a partner put me in charge of finding out what had happened.

I ended up reviewing the authorities that had been cited and discovered that the point of law was included in the case but in a different part of the opinion than reflected in the citation. I surmised that the lawyers drafting the papers simply included the wrong page number, likely due to the fact that the lawyers had immense pressure to complete a given brief on a demanding time schedule. This was sloppy lawyering for sure, but this was definitely not at the same level as manufacturing authority from nothing.

Confusing Citations

Sometimes when a lawyer is looking for authorities to buttress a point, they will search for anything that will support their position even though the authority only tangentially relates to their point. A court can say things in only so many ways, and sometimes lawyers will include language from opinions in legal writing that does not really support what they are trying to convey in their papers. Adversaries should be the first line of defense to this tactic, since adversaries can point out how the opinions cited are actually different from the situation being litigated and how a lawyer is being somewhat dishonest for including the citation.

In other instances, lawyers might mix together different quotations from opinions to make it seem as if a court has decided the matter in a way that might be beneficial to a lawyer. Although doing so might be dishonest, it likely does not carry the same scorn as making up authorities from whole cloth. Most of the time, lawyers who employ this tactic are desperate, and courts as well as adversaries can help police legal professionals who employ such methods.

Again, for a variety of reasons, making up completely fake authorities should not be tolerated in the legal profession. However, it is worth pointing out that lawyers can be guilty of citing to nonexistent authorities in other more innocent ways, and attorneys should avoid this practice whenever possible.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Conducts Layoffs En Masse, Letting Go 150 Attorneys And Staff

We’ve been reporting on alleged [hiring freezes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/hiring-freezes-and-stealth-layoffs-hit-top-50-biglaw-firms/) and [stealth layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-junior-associates-top-20-biglaw-firm-cooley/) at Cooley since September. Throughout that time, the firm issued denials and claimed that any layoffs were the result of unsatisfactory performance reviews. Now, the bloom is officially off the rose.

Today, Cooley — a firm that brought in $1,986,777,000 gross revenue in 2021 — outright laid off 150 employees, a combination of both attorneys (78) and paralegals and business professionals (72), providing notice of its actions in an internal memo to the entire firm.

Chairman Joseph Conroy referred to the cuts as a “painful but necessary” step to deal with the firm’s “overcapacity.” It seems that the firm overhired during last year’s post-pandemic workload boom, and now that a tech implosion is upon us, Cooley is feeling the burn. “Simply put, we hired more talent than we can reasonably develop, train and deploy against current and anticipated client demand,” Conroy said.

In its memo (available in full on the next page), Conroy says the firm is making “comprehensive severance benefits” available to all lawyers and staff members who were part of today’s reduction in force. One of our attorney sources claims that three months’ of severance has been offered to those who lost their jobs.

Cooley is being incredibly transparent with its workforce as far as these layoffs are concerned. Will more firms be forced to make outright layoffs thanks to their 2021 hiring sprees? Let’s hope not.

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Cooley.

# Biglaw Firm Gets Benchslapped Over 'Astonishing' Fee Request

The good news for Latham & Watkins is that they were successful on the merits. Whether they’re able to recover legal fees from the plaintiff in what the firm terms vexatious litigation remains to be seen.

Latham represents the defense in a pair of cases, now dismissed, brought by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen against an employee of his investment fund, Shawn Cox. The complaint alleged Cox recorded conversations with Christensen in violation of Massachusetts law. Only problem? The plaintiff never claimed he was in Massachusetts at the time of the alleged wiretap — which is an essential element.

Now that the case has been dispensed with, defense counsel, led by Latham attorney Steven Pacini, requested legal fees of $60,000.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“The fee request is aggressive beyond any convention,” [Superior Court Judge Mitchell H. Kaplan] said in court. “The fee request is astonishing.”

Actually, that’s about the [going rate for a week of Biglaw work.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/yes-this-is-how-much-a-biglaw-partner-working-for-one-week-bills/)

And that was precisely Pacini’s justification, saying the fee request in this case was the same they charge other clients, and actually the Latham team was pretty efficient:

“To whip something up in respect to these guys [Christensen’s counsel] in less than 10 hours, I think, was efficient,” Pacini said. “They forced us to look into and respond to all of this misunderstanding of Massachusetts law, and that’s where the hours were spent.”

But, [as reported](https://www.law360.com/articles/1049153) by Law360, Judge Kaplan couldn’t seem to wrap his mind around the cost of litigation when the complaint was so deficient:

“[Massachusetts General Laws] Chapter 231.6F is designed to deal with frivolous litigation because frivolous litigation tends to be the most expensive to deal with,” Pacini said in court.

“It doesn’t say anything about frivolous litigation being the most expensive to deal with,” Judge Kaplan responded. “The most expensive to deal with is hard-fought litigation over serious issues with complicated matters of fact and law, none of which is apparent here.”

“I agree there’s not, but the plaintiff has tried to make it—” Pacini said before the judge cut him off.

“So you have no justification,” Judge Kaplan said.

The judge chided Latham for charging thousands of dollars “to file a brief that a first-year law student could write.”

With all respect to the judge, a first-year law student can’t read a single case in 10 hours, let alone write a brief.

Pacini seems to understand the judge’s frustration stems, not from the firm per se, but from the effort required to deal with a baseless claim:

“I think, Judge Kaplan, he sees clearly the plaintiffs have no case here and it shouldn’t take any work to point that out,” Pacini told Law360 after the hearing. “But we had to explain that; we had to analyze what they were saying to show how they were misconstruing the law.”

Kaplan has yet to make a determination about the award, but it looks from from a slam dunk for the defense.

Unsurprisingly, Simpson Thacher can now be counted as a firm paying its associates at the top of the market. After all, they’re currently ranked 14th on the Am Law 100 with  $1,844,627,000 in gross revenue last year.

As of July 1, the new salary grid at Simpson will be as follows:

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to [American Lawyer’s Midlevel Associate Survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/where-in-biglaw-are-midlevel-associates-the-happiest-2020/), which breaks the rankings out by specific offices, which two Kirkland & Ellis locations got top marks in their respective cities?

Hint: One office got a 4.854 out of 5 in overall satisfaction and the other, slightly less happy location got a 4.745 but still takes the number 1 spot for the city.

# Biglaw 'Booze Chaperone' Policy Is Like A Designated Driver For 'Not Being Lecherous A-Holes'
## Once again, alcohol is blamed for the rot of sexual misconduct buried in firm culture.

The hard-drinking Biglaw culture can become unhealthy in a lot of ways, but one of the most glaring is its contribution to the incidence of sexual harassment in the workplace. It’s a connection that’s led some firms to [phase-out drinking at firm social events](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-summer-programs-phasing-out-boozefests-to-create-all-new-worse-sexual-harassment-opportunities/) in a bid to stay ahead of misconduct. But across the pond, Linklaters has [appointed a number of booze chaperones](https://www.legalcheek.com/2020/01/linklaters-appoints-sober-supervisors-to-chaperone-boozy-social-events/) to stay sober and monitor social gatherings to make sure nothing untoward happens.

The policy is really more of a strong suggestion, with the firm encouraging partners to designate chaperones to keep their people safe while pounding a few back.

“Our people work hard and we recognise the value of teams socialising together to help provide a healthy work-life balance,” a spokesperson for Links said. “As part of a wider set of guidelines covering social activities, we have recommended to partners, directors and business leaders that they designate a non-drinking role to a senior person to assist the smooth running of our social events.”

Just how blackout drunk are these folks getting that they can’t keep control of their gatherings without a hall monitor? The new policy, which was in place for the firm’s holiday party, brings it in line with the recommendations of the Law Society’s Junior Lawyers Division, the gathering of legal Brainy Smurfs who recently “offered up a range of alcohol-free networking alternatives including paint-balling, hat making and mini-golf.” Hat making. Talk about something that will drive people to drink.

The problem with all of these solutions is that while cutting back on alcohol for its own sake may be a worthwhile endeavor, tying it to sexual harassment misses the mark. The partner hitting on the associate may be the drunken expression of misconduct but most likely stems from a pre-existing problem that manifests daily in a million other ways. That more subtle inappropriate behavior is what needs to be stamped out.

If only there were sober chaperones keeping an eye out for misconduct every day at the office. We could call these people “human resources professionals” and take wild steps like having them “believe women” or “empowering them to make changes even if it could impact high revenue generating partners.” I know it sounds crazy!

Maybe we’ll just ban happy hour instead and call it a day.

# Top 5 Holiday Gifts To Yourself In Biglaw
## How has this year gone for you? And how can you set yourself up for a strong 2022?

With the holidays approaching, now is a great time to reflect. Of course, the holidays are an opportunity to think about the important people in your life. Don’t forget to do that. But as we near the end of a very busy year for most Biglaw attorneys, you may also want to think a bit about yourself. How has this year gone for you? And how can you set yourself up for a strong 2022?

With that in mind, here are the top 5 holiday gifts to give yourself if you work in Biglaw.

Attend lots of holiday parties

Okay, not literally. Holiday parties can sometimes be a lot of fun, but you know what’s better than being hosted at a holiday party? Having firms flatter you, court you, and maybe throw a six-figure signing bonus at you! Just as your inbox will soon be brimming with party invitations, there will be no shortage of firms seeking to host you if you decide to start the lateral interview process. The market remains exceptionally hot, so you’d be wise to accept a few invitations and see how it goes.

Make your shopping list

In case you aren’t sure you want to stick with your current firm, now is as good a time as any to think broadly about your goals and make a list of your ideal employers. Are you drawn to big firms? Boutiques? In-house roles? There’s no wrong answers, but just as with holiday gifts, your list isn’t going to make itself!

Consider whether your firm has been naughty or nice

At a time when attorneys have a lot of options, it’s worth reflecting on how your firm has been treating you lately. Has it paid special bonuses in line with the top of the market? Is it promising a flexible remote work policy in 2022? If your firm hasn’t been showing much appreciation of your efforts, there’s a good chance some other firm is ready to treat you right.

Send your holiday cards

After two years of relative isolation, there’s nothing like a personal touch to let your clients and other professional contacts know you’re thinking of them. So send a card or pick up the phone and give someone a call. They’ll be happy to hear from you. And it’s a good investment in your future. From winning at business development to receiving a heads up about intriguing professional opportunities, a strong network will pay continuing and sometimes unexpected benefits in the years to come.

Ensure you have a happy New Year’s Eve

You know what sets you up for a great New Year’s Eve celebration, besides plenty of champagne? Having secured a fat year-end bonus. If your firm pays at 1950 hours and you’re at 1820, it’s time to hustle! Don’t let yourself fall just short of a $50k or more bonus. The champagne will taste sweeter with an extra five-figure check in the bank!

Which Biglaw firm was ranked #1 in Vault’s 2020 practice area rankings in the area of intellectual property law?

Hint: The firm’s IP bona fides go back a long way — one of the firm’s name partners represented Alexander Graham Bell in over 600 patent cases.

# The Best Law Firm In The World (2019)
## Money makes the world go round, and these firms are definitely keeping it spinning.

The world keeps getting more and more interconnected, and law firms that are able to smoothly navigate international waters across dozens of practice areas are extremely valuable. Cross-border legal work is complex, and the firms that do it well deserve recognition as the global powerhouses that they are.

[Law360](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1181369/law360-reveals-the-global-20-firms-of-2019) (sub. req.) has announced the latest edition of their list of the top 20 global law firms. Their methodology, described below, attempts to find the firms that are truly able to compete in the international legal market:

Firms are ranked based on five factors: the percentage of the firm’s attorneys located outside its home country; the number of offices outside the firm’s home country; the number of countries where the firm has at least one office; the practice area breadth of the firm’s cross-border and international work; and the size and complexity of the firm’s cross-border and international work.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here are the top 5 firms of the 2019 Global 20:

1. Baker McKenzie
1. White & Case
3. Allen & Overy
4. Norton Rose Fulbright
5. DLA Piper

Click [here](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1181369/law360-reveals-the-global-20-firms-of-2019) to see the next 15 firms on the list.

White & Case once again snags the top spot on the list, but this time shares its glory with Baker McKenzie, a firm that was ranked at #12 on last year’s Global 20. That’s quite the leap in just one year’s time, so way to go!

# How To Live Frugally While Working In Biglaw
## Can you really live a Biglaw lifestyle without busting your bank account?

I am sure that many of you out there went to law school in order to earn a big paycheck.  Indeed, a lot of us were brought up to believe that lawyers earn a very comfortable living and have the resources to purchase fancy cars, nice properties, and all of the other trappings of wealth.  Of course, the reality is that many lawyers do not earn the kind of money we were made to believe, and this website and others have comprehensively discussed this fact.  However, some lawyers will indeed earn a good living right after graduating from law school and will have significant monetary resources to either pay down student loans or purchase items that bring personal enjoyment.

As I have discussed many times on my blog Student Debt Diaries and on this website, it is extremely wise to pay down student debt as soon as possible in many situations.  However, it can be very difficult to resist the urge to spend the money one earns from working at a big firm.  It takes a great deal of sacrifice and commitment to be hired at a large law firm, since one must typically excel at law school in order to be hired by a Biglaw shop.  After all of this effort, it might be appealing to reward oneself with creature comforts.

Indeed, it could be argued that large law firms benefit from hooking young associates on an expensive lifestyle.  Large law firms make a massive investment in beginner attorneys, and the longer associates stay at these firms, the more value firms will realize from their investment.  However, if one wants to be liberated from student debt as soon as possible, and keep career options open, it is necessary to live frugally and not get used to wearing “golden handcuffs” while working in Biglaw.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One of the strategies I employed while working at a big firm that kept me committed to a frugal lifestyle was never realizing how much money I had.  I paid the majority of each paycheck to my student loans, and I set the payments to be automatically deducted from my bank account the day before each pay day.  By employing this tactic, I literally never saw the lion’s share of my paychecks hit my bank account, and I never had the temptation to not pay down my debt and use these funds in another way.

I also did not keep much money in bank accounts except for a modest emergency fund.  Rather, I devoted nearly all of my money instead to paying off student loans.  Even after I completed my summer associate gig, I only kept a small amount of my earnings, and used the rest to lessen the amount of debt I needed to borrow during my final year of law school.  The reason why I kept so little money in savings was to devote more cash to my high-interest student loans as soon as possible and to not have cash on hand should I have the urge to make unnecessary purchases.

I also kept all of the savings I had in several different accounts with a variety of financial institutions.  By employing this strategy, I never really knew exactly how much money I possessed.  This tactic had the effect of reducing my urge to spend money, since I never felt like I had enough funds to make big purchases.

It is also important to take steps before you enter Biglaw to set the foundation for a frugal lifestyle once you are working at a large firm.  Before I even started working as an associate attorney, my roommate and I signed a lease for a modestly priced apartment, and this low rent ensured I would be able to pay the majority of my paychecks toward student loans.  We ended up staying in that apartment for years, mostly through inertia since it is a huge hassle to move, and living there kept me from spending more money on housing.  This concept can be applied to other parts of your life too, and you could lease a modestly priced car, and make other life choices before entering Biglaw that will ensure you maintain a frugal lifestyle while working at a large firm.

Some people have told me that while working in Biglaw, they were expected to dress well and make other purchases to project a positive image and perhaps fit in with the culture of their firms.  I did not do this at all, and I encourage everyone to save their money while employed at a large firm.  During my time in Biglaw, I mostly wore clothes that my grandmother bought for me through the KingSize Catalog (I’m 6’8″, after all) on the cheap.  Some might be embarrassed to admit this fact, but I don’t think that anyone should be ashamed of saving a buck even while working at a large firm.

During my time in Biglaw, I wore the exact same shoes that I wore in high school, until the shoes literally had holes in them.  A few times, I even wore the same shirt and tie that I wore at my bar mitzvah!  I know people who probably spent thousands of dollars on clothes while working at a large firm, and by not spending too much money on a wardrobe myself, and by being frugal in other ways, I was able to devote more money to my student loans.

All told, living frugally while working in Biglaw is not easy, and internal urges and peer pressure might try to influence you to spend money.  However, keep your eyes on the prize and take any steps necessary to save the most money possible.  The rewards of student debt repayment and the flexibility to do whatever you want with your law degree will be well worth any sacrifice.

# West Coast Powerhouse Joins The Biglaw Compensation Party
## This firm is starting the New Year off on the right foot. Congrats!

Happy New Year! What better way to celebrate than by ushering in a new compensation scale for associates?

Yesterday afternoon, Wilson Sonsini — a firm that brought in $1,354,000,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 33 in the most recent Am Law 100 — delighted associates (and of counsel, too!) by announcing raises and bonuses in line with the Cravath scale. This is what the new compensation grid looks like at the firm, effective February 1, 2024:



The firm is also following the Cravath scale for year-end bonuses. Take a look:



Associates must have billed at least 1950 hours to be bonus eligible — and it’s certainly worth noting that the first 40 hours of an associate’s time off at the firm will be considered billable. Bonuses will be paid on Wednesday, January 31.

Congratulations to everyone at Wilson Sonsini!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from the firm.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# How To Help Recruiters Alert You To Relevant Opportunities On LinkedIn
## If your LinkedIn profile doesn’t clearly communicate your skills and specific experience, recruiters are left to guess.

It won’t come as a surprise to you that virtually every recruiter uses LinkedIn to source candidates. You’ve likely received at least a few unsolicited LinkedIn messages from recruiters. Chances are, some of those messages were for positions that do not align with your practice area. This can be a source of frustration, leading some lawyers to become pretty jaded about the general notion of recruiter outreach.

But here’s the thing. If your LinkedIn profile doesn’t clearly communicate your skills and specific experience, recruiters are left to guess. The best way you can improve the quality of recruiter outreach is to maintain an informative, up-to-date profile. This gives recruiters quick and valuable insight into your background, enabling us to contact you if there’s a strong match and, conversely, to move on if you’re obviously not the right candidate. I can’t promise that a more informative profile will entirely solve the problem of messages for irrelevant roles, but it will definitely help.  

Introduce yourself effectively

The “intro” portion of your LinkedIn profile (the top section) is in many ways the most important. This is your opportunity to communicate crisply who you are and what you offer. The best way to enable a recruiter to find your profile is by inserting informative keywords into the “headline” (the line immediately below your name). Describing yourself simply as an “Attorney” is a missed opportunity: instead, tell us what type of attorney you are. The more specific, the better. For example, “Litigation Attorney” is better than “Attorney.” But the best is a headline like “Litigation Employment Attorney Specializing in Discrimination and Retaliation.”

Double-check that your location is current. Many lawyers moved cities during the pandemic, and some have neglected to update their LinkedIn profiles accordingly. It only takes a moment! While you’re at it, consider selecting the “open to opportunities” setting that is only visible to recruiters. This will confidentially communicate to recruiters that you’re receptive to relevant outreach.

Photos are another critical element of an effective intro section. Adding a photo increases the likelihood that a potential contact will accept your connection request by 9x. In addition to uploading a professional profile photo, make sure to include a background photo. Your background is a visual representation of your personal brand and is one of the first things recruiters will see when they visit your profile.

Fill in the details

A basic rule: if it’s there, fill it in. The more complete your profile, the better. Obviously, you have to fill out Experience and Education. But beyond that, add some content to Skills (in case recruiters are filtering on those keywords) and your licenses and certifications (you’re a member of a bar, right?). Other optional sections can help give your profile a more personal touch. Are you bilingual? Fill out the Languages section!

Ensure that your Experience section is more informative than a simple list of titles. The nice thing about LinkedIn, in contrast to a resume, is you don’t have to worry about fitting all the content onto a printed page. So go ahead and include a couple of bullet points about each of your past positions to indicate specifically what you did and what you achieved. Naturally, this will change over time as you advance in your career and accomplish new things, so don’t just fill in the Experience section once and forget about it — be proactive about keeping the description of your current role up to date. As a matter of style, note that it’s perfectly appropriate to write in the first person on LinkedIn, in a way that would be uncommon on a resume. Using “I” statements helps to humanize you.

Education should be fairly straightforward, but do keep in mind that this is not the place to be modest. If you graduated with honors, say so. You may also wish to list your GPA and/or class rank, especially if you’re early in your career, with limited work experience.

Stay active

At a minimum, you should log into LinkedIn weekly to check your messages. If you aren’t in the habit of logging in regularly, you can also put your contact info (personal email and/or cell phone) on your profile, enabling recruiters to contact you through those alternative channels.

As an optional bonus, consider creating content on LinkedIn. This will boost your ranking in search results and can be a great way to get noticed — not just by recruiters, but maybe even by law firm partners directly. Being active on the platform builds credibility, demonstrating that you know your area of law and are comfortable speaking about it publicly. This is by no means required, but when you do it well, it certainly helps!

Check your search appearances 

Be sure that you are getting noticed by the right audience. To do this, go to your profile page, look under the Analytics heading, look for the magnifying glass icon, and click on “search appearances.” This lets you see how often you appear in search results. In addition to the number of search appearances, it also shows you the keywords you were found for. If these do not align with your current practice area or industry, consider adjusting your headline and intro section until you are appearing in more targeted searches. 

Have fun 

Finally, have fun. Networking and being open to new opportunities can be intimidating, but LinkedIn makes it relatively simple and stress-free. Treat it as a no-pressure environment for you to be yourself and engage with like-minded people.

# Biglaw Firms Finally Speak Up In Wake Of SCOTUS Leak, And They're Prepared To Defend Abortion Rights In America
## Lawyers, it's time to assemble!

As the Supreme Court enters its homestretch, time continues to tick down on abortion rights in America. Thanks to a leaked draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito in the Dobbs case, we now know that the Supreme Court is ready, willing, and able to overturn nearly 50 years of precedent to take away the right to choose. With the final opinion set to be released any day now, Biglaw firms have entered the scene, prepared to protect the rights of those who will be affected should Roe v. Wade be struck down by the high court.

An alliance of 23 major law firms has been formed — the Legal Alliance for Reproductive Rights — and their goal is to provide free legal services to those in need should Roe fall.

Teresa Johnson, co-chair of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer’s capital markets practice and one of the founders of the group, noted that because SCOTUS is on the precipice of “tak[ing] away a fundamental right that has been on the books for nearly 50 years,” it “calls for a public-private collaboration to pool our strength and resources.” The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/01/big-law-steps-up-to-defend-abortion-rights-if-roe-falls/) has the details on how the alliance plans to help:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Under the terms of the alliance, firms will provide pro bono representation when pregnant people and providers face civil suits and criminal charges related to seeking or providing abortions in California and other states. Member firms will also assist in pro bono civil and criminal defense in other states where the right to choose no longer exists, according to a statement on the formation of the alliance.

Johnson said, while the alliance was still taking shape, matters with which it could assist include defense in vigilante lawsuits against pregnant people, providers and assisters; representation of providers who receive subpoenas seeking records; advising hospitals, clinics and medical professionals on policies relating to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, partnering with public defenders to assist in the criminal defense of people who have had abortions in states where the action is criminalized; and even affirmative litigation, including constitutional claims relating to blocking harmful state laws—like travel bans.

According to Johnson, the alliance — which will be led by San Francisco city attorney David Chiu — is a “dream team” of law firms “ready to meet the challenge” that lies ahead. Those law firms include:

- Altshuler Berzon
- Arguedas Cassman Headley & Goldman
- Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer
- BraunHagey & Borden
- Clarence Dyer & Cohen
- Conrad Metlitzky Kane
- Crowell & Moring

- Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe
- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
- Ramsey & Ehrlich
- Rogers Joseph O’Donnell PC
- Swanson & McNamara
- Willkie Farr & Gallagher
“During this moment when fundamental rights are at stake,” Chiu said, “we welcome legal communities around California and our country to join us.” Is your firm ready to join the members of the Biglaw and boutique abortion avengers to form an even stronger team? Your help is sorely needed, and it’s time to assemble. Please join the squad today.

We are confident that our process has been professional and appropriate. In fact, I am proud to say that we have received overwhelming praise from our clients for our transparency and the professionalism of our response to this attack.

— [Pat Quinn](https://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/pat-quinn), managing partner of Cadwalader, in a statement given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/05/november-cyberattack-hobbled-cadwalader-for-weeks-internal-emails-show/), concerning the firm’s response to a mid-November cyberattack that forced the Am Law 100 mainstay to wipe hard drives and take many of its systems offline, some of them for weeks (like its internal document management system). Quinn went on to note that the firm quickly informed clients about the issue and hired “renowned external cybersecurity experts and legal counsel.” Cybersecurity experts told Am Law that Cadwalader’s response was in-line with industry best practices.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Stat Of The Week: Law Firm Mergers Bounce Back
## Will 2021 see a return to triple digits?

Law firm mergers set a record in 2019, before the pace fell dramatically as the pandemic took hold. Now, mergers are again poised to hit the triple digits, according to a new report.

[As noted by Reuters](https://today.westlaw.com/Document/I73d73450970b11ebb2cbbf0d2509a923/View/FullText.html?transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=(sc.Default)), an Altman Weil survey tracked 26 mergers in the first quarter of this year — short of the pace of 2019, which saw 115, but up substantially from last year’s 65. These include Winston & Strawn’s acquisition of Scheper Kim & Harris and Crowell & Moring’s pick-up of Kibbe & Orbe.

As Altman Weil’s Thomas Clay told the publication, “We wouldn’t be surprised to see law firm merger and acquisition totals back over 100 by year-end.” 

[Will law firm mergers break 100 this year? Q1 report says they’re on their way](https://today.westlaw.com/Document/I73d73450970b11ebb2cbbf0d2509a923/View/FullText.html?transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=(sc.Default)) [Reuters]

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It works until it doesn’t, and I don’t mean that in a negative way. They don’t have a lot of partners leaving for other firms. They bring people up, some make partner, and they stay there for large portions of their careers. They are in a unique position.

— Jon Truster, a New York law firm recruiter and a partner at Macrae, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/20/wachtell-seeks-balance-between-continuity-and-change/) on Wachtell’s steady approach amid a [change in leadership](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/wachtells-co-chairs-step-down-after-17-years-ushering-in-new-leaders/) after nearly two decades. Andrew Nussbaum, a corporate partner, and William Savitt, co-chair of the firm’s litigation department, will [take the reins](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/wachtells-co-chairs-step-down-after-17-years-ushering-in-new-leaders/) at the elite firm, and will likely maintain the traditional approach their predecessors took in leading the firm.

# The Critical Need For Pro Bono Immigration Work
## Substantial attention is needed to deliver fairness to those who soon are to need it the most.

Any pending increase in immigration deportation proceedings will require an uptick in vigilance, a rededication to due process and fairness. Democracy has to step-up. Those who are vulnerable, who face removal from the United States, who are at risk of returning to dangerous and uncertain futures in a home country from which they fled, are entitled to our democracy’s historic promises.

Regardless of politics, the laws as currently written entitle immigrants to certain rights when their fates are in the hands of the judicial system. Regardless of politics, many of those facing possible removal are entitled to be here, to find the safety they risked their lives to reach. But those promises mean almost nothing unless democracy serves the people who need it most urgently. And the judicial system, simply, will not work unless those in it have lawyers to represent them. For that to happen, several crucial steps must be taken.

First, the particular realities of millions have to be acknowledged. They are not dangerous felons, rather they are terrified children, mothers, and families who were assaulted, left widowed and orphaned by brutal violence, raped, extorted, kidnapped, threatened in countries where law enforcement was either unable or unwilling to help them. They risked their lives to escape, enduring horror on a journey with no certain outcome. Many are children, fleeing alone. Many are mothers and young children, frightened and running for their lives. Others still are families, leaving behind all they knew for the chance to live safely together. Many of the children are eligible to remain in the United States and be granted Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Many more are eligible for asylum. Most do not speak English, all are terrified, none can navigate a complex system of justice and laws in a language they do not understand.

Second, even though the laws may entitle them to be in this country lawfully, virtually none are entitled to have a lawyer appointed to represent them. In recent years, 70 percent of all who face deportation do not have attorneys. Almost half of them were ordered deported at their very first court hearings. However, of those who managed to find representation, only 4 percent were ordered to be removed at that early stage. Only one in 15 families without lawyers were even able to file the correct papers with the court. With the advent of the so-called “rocket dockets” that were instituted to deal with the women and children crossing the U.S./Mexico border, the need for lawyers has become only more critical.

Third, the overwhelming need for attorneys requires an overwhelming need for the private bar to volunteer their pro bono services, be trained, and represent, as a community, as many clients as they possibly can. More than 500,000 cases are pending in the immigration courts. Increased enforcement will put the system further and further behind. There are as many as 750,000 recipients of temporary status and work permits under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program whose protections may soon be reversed. Although many lawyers and law firms already have increased their pro bono activities, tens of thousands more will be needed. The usual suspects will not be enough. The big firms, the immigration practitioners, the many other solid volunteers from throughout the legal community already are doing their part. Efforts to delve far deeper into the private bar, to solicit many more new volunteers, must be made by bar associations, elected officials, legal aid organizations, and anyone else who can help.

Fourth, and most important, substantial funding for legal services organizations must immediately be found and infused into a service delivery system that already is stretched beyond capacity. The efforts of the private bar to provide support can go only as far as the shoulders of the legal aid community can carry them. Pro bono volunteers need to be trained. Critically, they need to be supervised and mentored by expert practitioners. Cases need to be screened and evaluated by experienced immigration attorneys. Clients need to be systematically interviewed, analyzed and referred in an effective and thorough manner. This complex process can only be accomplished if our country’s legal aid organizations have the funding they need to significantly ramp up, expand their expertise, grow their capacity, create more leverage through their pro bono efforts, and maintain their quality.

The promise of our democracy is built on the effectiveness of the judicial system. It is the most directly responsive branch of government, the arm of our Constitution that ensures liberty and justice. Substantial attention is needed to deliver fairness to those who soon are to need it the most. Politics do not matter. The law demands nothing else.

# Associate Bonus And New Partner Watch: Susman Godfrey
## Bonuses are down a little from last year, but they're still great, and the new partner class is large.

On the evening of December 1, the place to be for New York litigators was the [Susman Godfrey](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/susman-godfrey/) holiday party. The food — catered by Daniel Boulud, who flew back from Tokyo to personally oversee the preparations — was fantastic, as always. The drink flowed liberally. The setting — the firm’s first year in its spectacular new offices — was better than ever. (The crisis of the evening: a shortage of olives at the bar, presumably due to excessive martini consumption.)

It’s not surprising that the firm was in a celebratory mood. Susman Godfrey once again had a strong year, reflected in bountiful bonuses. As reported by [Vivia Chen of The Careerist](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202774537053/Susmans-Santa-Bonuses-Up-to-140K-and-Designer-Canapeacutes?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=0&slreturn=20161113121437):

Associates who’ve been at the firm six years are bagging a minimum of $120,000 in bonus, maxing out at $140,000 for those who’ve put in super long hours. That’s a $20,000 to $40,000 surplus over what Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which sets the industry standard, is paying its most senior associates (graduates of 2009 and earlier years).

Out-paying Cravath (and all other major firms) to get prized associates has long been a Susman strategy. But unlike Cravath, Susman pays out bonuses based on length of service at the firm rather than class year. Here’s the bonus scale at Susman:

Six years at firm:
$120,000 to $140,000 bonus (verus $100,000 for class year 2009 and earlier at Cravath).

Five years at firm:
$105,000 minimum ($90,000 for class of 2010 at Cravath).

Four years at firm:
$95,000 minimum ($80,000 for class of 2011 at Cravath).

Three years at firm:
$85,000 minimum ($65,000 for class of 2012 at Cravath).

Two years at firm:
$65,000 minimum ($50,000 for class of 2013 at Cravath).

One year at firm:
$40,000 minimum ($25,000 for class of 2014 at Cravath).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The class of 2014 is the relevant comparison for people who have been at Susman Godfrey for a year because the firm requires everyone to complete at least one clerkship (and many Susman Godfrey lawyers do two or more, including Supreme Court clerkships).

It is true, as noted by Chen, that these bonuses are down a little from [last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-susman-godfrey-are-these-the-best-bonuses-of-the-season/). The top bonus in 2016 was $140,000, compared to $165,000 in 2015, and the lowest bonus in 2016 was $40,000, compared to $55,000 in 2015. [Bill Carmody](http://www.susmangodfrey.com/attorneys/bill-carmody/), head of the firm’s New York office, explained that this year wasn’t quite as good as last year for the firm. But even at these lower levels, Susman Godfrey bonuses are still way above the market scale (ranging from $15,000 to $100,000).

Furthermore, Susman Godfrey associates don’t have to worry as much about their bonuses because they are partners before they know it. “It’s a seven-year track,” Bill Carmody explained, “and since most everyone clerks for two years, that means you only have to be here for five years to be partner.”

UPDATE (6/8/2017, 2:27 p.m.): A clarification: one year of clerking gets counted against the track, but the second year of credit goes just to Supreme Court clerks.

Which brings us to Susman Godfrey’s new partners. The firm elevated seven out of the eight associates up for consideration (with office location and law school noted parenthetically): Matt Behncke (Houston / Texas 2009), Amanda Bonn (Los Angeles / Stanford 2009), Jordan Connors (Seattle / Columbia 2008), John Lahad (Houston / Houston 2009), Oleg Elkhunovich (Los Angeles / Penn 2009), Weston O’Black (Houston 2008 / Houston), and Steven Shepard (New York / Yale 2007).

The new partners — one of the firm’s largest classes, according to Carmody — exhibit geographic diversity, with at least one lawyer coming from each of the firm’s four offices. They are a bit short on gender and racial or ethnic diversity — one woman, six white men — but as we’ve chronicled in these pages, Susman Godfrey is [far](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/) from [alone](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/) on that front. (Also, given the firm’s small size — it has around 114 lawyers in total — one could argue that achieving demographic diversity presents more of a challenge for SG compared to its Biglaw brethren.)

Congratulations to Susman Godfrey’s seven new partners, and congrats to its associates — i.e., its future partners — on the fantastic bonuses.

# Am Law 100 Firm Finally Decides To Offer Special Bonuses To Associates
## But they're tied to billable hours.

Back in December, special bonuses reigned supreme as a part of Biglaw firms’ year-end bonuses; after all, associates had worked themselves to the bone through the repeated vagaries of the pandemic, and this extra cash served as a way to thank them for their many sacrifices. The vast majority of firms offered these special bonuses without hourly requirements, but quite a few did tie them to billables, and some firms opted not to offer special bonuses at all.

As can be imagined, associates at those firms were [quite angry](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/sheppard-bonuses/); not only was their work not being rewarded, but their bonuses were officially below market. One firm that originally refused to offer special bonuses recently announced that appreciation money was officially in play.

The firm in question is Sheppard Mullin, and while more money is now on the table for associates, the additional bonus compensation is being offered on a sliding scale based on billable hours. Check out the firm’s scale, below:

As you can see, the firm is offering the prevailing market rate special bonuses to associates who have billed 2,000 hours. Associates who billed 1,900 hours will receive half that amount, while those who billed 1,950 hours will receive a bit more. This may not be the market standard for special bonuses, but hopefully this is enough to assauge associates at the firm.

All bonuses at Sheppard Mullin will be paid out on January 22.

# Biglaw Associates Are Probably Working In Smaller Offices Than Before

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Now you’re seeing lawyer offices at 150 square feet. The office is becoming a place for heads-down work [instead of meetings].

— Thomas Fulcher, chair of the legal tenant practice group at Savills, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/01/08/more-law-firms-in-new-york-opt-for-larger-spaces/) on the shrinking office sizes that lawyers can expect to see, down from an average around 225-250 square feet per attorney. Biglaw firms in New York, however, have been expanding their office footprints. “If you have more attorneys, you’re going to need more space,” he said.

Chris Michel, Frederick Liu and Michael Huston

It’s been a busy season at the Solicitor General’s office. The summer has been characterized as a “[game of musical chairs](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/whats-going-on-at-the-solicitor-generals-office/?rf=1)” with attorneys moving in and out of the office. Now comes word that the office has made a trio of Biglaw hires — and not a moment too soon, they have about a month to prepare before the start of the October Supreme Court term.

Frederick Liu, partner at Hogan Lovells, Christopher Michel, associate at Kirkland & Ellis, and Michael Huston, associate at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher are all moving to the Solicitor General’s office in the position of assistant to the SG, and that’s not all they have in common. The three have all clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As Law.com [reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/08/30/solicitor-generals-office-fills-ranks-with-big-law-hires/), high-profile positions in the SG office routinely lead to even bigger and brighter things in the future:

“Assistant to the SG is one of the best jobs an appellate lawyer can have. I don’t think that’s changed at all,” said Joseph Palmore of Morrison & Foerster, who left the SG’s office in 2014 to co-chair the firm’s Supreme Court and appellate practice. A several-year tour of duty as an assistant to the SG can often become a launching pad for a return to law firms as leaders of appellate practices.

These hires complete the staff of 16 at the assistant level. Since it’s expected to be a [particularly noteworthy term](https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/08/swing-time), the hires are essential for the office. Now, if they could only get the head of the office confirmed… (Noel Francisco, Donald Trump’s pick for Solicitor General was formally nominated on March 7th, but has not, as of yet, gotten the official nod from Senate.)

# Sound Off: What Is *The* Worst Law?
## Not all laws are created equal.

As lawyers, we’re obliged to uphold the law…. but that doesn’t always mean you agree with it. Attorneys are in a unique position to know the underbelly of the system of laws that govern our society.

So, we want to know, what is *the* worst law?

Perhaps it’s the fact that qualified immunity — the doctrine that lets police get away with pretty much everything — was a [goddamn scrivener’s error](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/police-can-legally-set-you-on-fire-because-someone-in-the-1800s-made-a-copying-error/). And what about the [immunity of the gun industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/the-law-the-needs-to-be-repealed-immediately-to-bring-gun-makers-to-heel/)? That only makes the American gun problem worse. Maybe it’s the[ injustice of the felony murder](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/it-looks-like-sotomayor-is-1-of-3-supreme-court-justices-who-actually-believes-the-whole-do-the-crime-do-the-time-thing/) rule? Speaking of injustice, maybe [mandatory minimums](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/scotus-plays-hell-with-congressional-intent-in-mandatory-minimums-case/) infuriate you. Let’s not get started on the [dumb immigration laws](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-does-the-doj-prosecute-20000-people-a-year-for-immigration-crimes/). We’ve all witnessed the wild results the [electoral college yields](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/why-is-the-electoral-college-constitutional/). Or maybe you’re annoyed by the simple power grabs like towns putting an [age limit on trick or treating](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/you-are-too-old-to-trick-or-treat-like-by-law/).

Frank Aquila

The awfulness of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings has touched us all. Some people have turned to friends or political activism to cope with the emotional turmoil that the mockery of our judicial branch stirred up. Others took to Twitter to release their rage. In that respect mergers and acquisitions partner at Sullivan & Cromwell [Frank Aquila](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/FrancisJ-Aquila) is like a lot of us, but his social media rant went the extra mile and got him in some hot water.

It started when Sarah Huckabee Sanders used the official @PressSec Twitter account to exalt Lindsey Graham’s angry shock that people somehow care that a potential lifetime appointee has been credibly accused of sexual assault. But instead of expressing disgust in the privacy of his own corner office, Aquila took to Twitter, which would have been fine, except for the misogynistic language he used. Yeah, telling a woman — no matter how vile her opinions — to “Rot in Hell You B!tch” isn’t a good look when you’re trying to express your support for victims of sexual assault.

Once the tweet started going viral, as Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/09/28/sullivan-cromwell-partner-apologies-for-rot-in-hell-tweet-after-kavanaugh-hearings/), Aquila deleted his account. And as part of the apology tour he’s subjected himself to, Aquila sent around a firm-wide email on Friday, calling his tweet “inappropriate and hurtful”:

Last evening, I responded to a tweet from Sarah Sanders in an inappropriate and hurtful manner. Clearly my emotions got the best of me, but equally clearly neither Ms. Sanders nor any woman should be subjected to such animus. I take full responsibility for my ‎actions and I sincerely apologize to Ms. Sanders.

Aquila’s outrage is certainly understandable — a lot of people feel similarly. But cursing out women isn’t a great idea when you’re supposed to be a professional.

# More Lawyers Should Take The Final Week Of The Year Off
## The amount of work, much like the amount of daylight, can be pretty thin at the end of December. Use that to your advantage.

During the year, many attorneys have court appearances and other commitments that make it extremely difficult for them to take any real vacation. However, one of the best times for lawyers to take off from work for a long vacation is the end of the year due to the natural slowdown. Nevertheless, in my own experience, it seems like fewer people than usual are taking time off at year’s end despite the benefits.

Earlier in my career, I worked at a law firm that paid attorneys and staff modest salaries. In exchange, the law firm offered a number of nonmonetary benefits, which included letting employees actually take weeks off for vacation each year without judgments or questions. While working at that firm, I decided to take the last two weeks of the year off entirely, as did many others at the firm. There were fewer disadvantages to taking this period off than other days in the year.

I did not travel anywhere during this time off, but the vacation was amazing. In a similar vein to the film “Office Space,” I basically did nothing, [and it was everything I thought it could be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AiGNL0LYN0). I focused on hobbies more than I was able to during other periods of the year, and I caught up on all of the movies and television shows that interested me.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The experience had a positive impact on my outlook when I finally returned to work. Having enjoyed the holidays to the fullest since I did not need to think about work responsibilities, I was able to interact with family and friends in ways that were not possible at other points of the year. Since I was able to recharge my batteries, I was also in a solid position to complete work tasks when I finally returned to work in the new year.

Even though the end of the year is naturally a good time to take off from work, people may refuse. Some attorneys and staff like to take performative steps to show supervisors that they are dedicated to a job even though these steps may not impact the bottom line for employers. Showing up to work around the holidays is one such performative step, and if you are early in your career, or are on thin ice at work, I can understand the strategy. Indeed, shortly after starting a new job once, I showed up to the office on President’s Day — even though most attorneys and staff did not — for the express purpose of showing my new employer that I was dedicated to my job.

However, a career is a marathon and not a sprint, and in most circumstances, people have no good reason to be at an office around the holidays. More people should embrace a long time off from work toward the end of the year to recharge their batteries and take advantage of the natural slowdown of this time of year. This can have a number of personal benefits that can also make an employee even more effective when they return to work in the new year.

# Associate Bonus Watch: More Word From The West Coast
## People are generally happy, although individual numbers remain to be communicated.

The California-founded firms — note that careful phrasing, to reflect how they are now national, even global, enterprises — are announcing associate bonuses. Last week, we reported on bonus news from [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-no-memo-no-problem/) and [Morrison & Foerster](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-mo-money-at-mofo/).

Late last week, associates at [O’Melveny & Myers](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/omelveny-myers/) also learned their financial fate. Associates received a voicemail — the firm’s standard mode for communicating compensation-related news, such as last summer’s [pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/money_on_the_west_coast/) — explaining what to expect:

- Associates meeting the firm’s expectations regarding quality and productivity (informally, around 1900-1950 hours) will receive a standard bonus.
- The standard bonuses follow the [market aka Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) (although the voicemail did not refer to it in that way; instead, it just announced the various amounts for each class year).
- The firm will make upward adjustments to bonuses for factors including, but not limited to, quality, productivity, and citizenship.
- There was no mention of any below-market bonuses.
- Bonuses will be included in the last paycheck for February.
- Associates will learn of their individual bonus amounts in their reviews, which are now underway and should conclude before the end of the month.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Reactions could change depending on how those individual reviews go — OMM associates, you know [where to reach us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=OMM%20Bonuses) — but for now, O’Melveny associates are (mostly) content:

- “Folks are happy with the announcement, but we’ll see how the mood will be once everyone gets their individual bonus numbers.”
- “I’d say we all just expected this. No one has been complaining, as far as I’ve heard.”
- “Partners are expected to communicate individual bonuses in reviews, which are just starting, so no real sense of reactions just yet beyond being generally pleased that we matched.”
- “The overall scale is welcome news…. I have not yet had my meeting, so I can’t really comment on my reaction just yet. I do, however, think it’s ridiculous that it takes them this long to announce and pay out the bonuses.”
- “There’s some confusion over what one exactly needs to do to hit bonus — informally, hours cutoff is 1950, but I’ve heard that there is some flexibility on that number, possibly based on how busy it was for individual groups.”
As for the upward adjustments or above-market bonuses, it’s not clear how large they are. As one source of ours said, “I don’t know of any specific amounts given above scale. I don’t think I would want to work enough to find out.”

Fair enough. Extra cash is nice, but you know what else is nice? Working in Biglaw and still having a life.

The aughts were a WILD time. It wasn’t all boy bands and butterfly clips, no, it was also the largest financial collapse since the Great Depression. Good times!

Sure, everyone’s talking about a recession these days, but it ain’t got nuttin’ on the ’08 era. The housing market collapsed, Lehman Brothers went under, and a 100+-year-old Biglaw firm declared bankruptcy.

For those who worked in Biglaw at the time, of course you know I’m talking about Dewey & LeBoeuf. It started as a mega merger of two venerable law firms and ended with 1,000+ attorneys out of work, bankruptcy court, and criminal charges. Above the Law came of age in that era, breathlessly reporting on all the drama as it happened —- and there was so much to say.

Sad news for the legal community — it’s been reported that McGuireWoods associate Lauren Graff died on October 30th. Graff suffered a pulmonary embolism while pregnant and passed away after giving birth to a son, James Rolland Graff-Ness. She is survived by her spouse, Mitchell Ness, [who works ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-ness-80885190/)at the Illinois Attorney General’s office.

The firm offered the [following statement](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/people/g/lauren-m-graff) on Graff’s passing:

Our colleague and friend Lauren Graff passed away on Oct. 30, 2021. An associate with the firm’s Corporate & Private Equity Department, Lauren tirelessly served her clients and was dedicated to community service and children’s causes. She will be greatly missed by all who knew her.

Graff and Ness both attended the University of Minnesota Law School, and Dean Garry Jenkins [offered](https://law.umn.edu/news/2021-10-31-minnesota-law-mourns-passing-lauren-graff-19) the following words:

“Please join me in offering our heartfelt condolences to Mitchell, baby James, and Lauren’s family,” said Dean Garry W. Jenkins in a message to the Minnesota Law community. “Lauren touched the lives of so many in our community and this is a heartbreaking loss.”

Professor Emily Buchholz also said Graff was an up-and-coming legal talent:

Lauren was kind, thoughtful, and a natural leader,” Buchholz recalled. “During group discussions, she was always willing to share her perspective, which was a blend of pragmatism and common sense on the one hand and sharp intellectual insight and deep knowledge on the other hand. She had a way of amplifying the perspectives of those around her either by acknowledging their contributions directly or by modeling assertive, yet respectful and humble participation. The best lawyers are often the best people and Lauren was well on her way to becoming a star attorney at McGuireWoods, I have no doubt about it. Losing her is a blow to us all. She was a bright light who made the room better just by being in it.”

A[ GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/graff-ness?qid=f8bdd33e06ca81f0f2f08d91379ed3e0) has been set up in support of Graff’s family. Our condolences to her family, friends, and colleagues.

# Looks Like Another Biglaw Firm Opts To Defer Incoming Associates Until Next Year
## Involuntary vacations abound.

Layoffs continue to be mostly contained to firms with tech-heavy portfolios and a few additional outliers sorting out overleveraging in some practice areas. But if you thought “avoiding layoffs” meant a firm wasn’t feeling the deal slowdown pinch… Well, denial ain’t just a river in Egypt.

Because defer ain’t [just a river in Saskatchewan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir_River). The deferral taboo has been broken and whether firms are [pushing off everyone](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) or [just some practice groups](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/perkins-coie-is-the-next-firm-to-defer-incoming-associates/), asking the incoming class to cool its heels for an extended period is the trendy way to save on some expenses before deal volume returns.

A tipster informs us that another firm has joined the deferral ranks, deferring all first years across the country until January 15, 2024. As far as we can tell, the firm is offering a $15K stipend (“less applicable taxes” as the tipster notes) and no health coverage. We reached out to the firm for comment but have not heard back at this time.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The market appears to be coalescing around a $15K stipend for deferral — with the exception of Cooley’s special offer to some associates willing [to defer to 2025 for a $100K price](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/cooley-deferral-corporate-associates/). Assuming a September start date that’s the equivalent of a $45K-50K annual salary. Which isn’t bad, assuming the incoming class hasn’t lined up real estate in New York or San Francisco beginning in September.

If they have, then it’s probably time to start making choices between food and shelter. Just what people need to heap on top of studying for the bar!

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

Basically, I grew up privileged, I had it all, was a really good lawyer until I burned out, and then I squandered it all, and THEN I got the HIV, and it was hard, and I’m stronger for it, but my life is very different now….

— An anonymous Biglaw alum, in an insightful and moving [‘Ask Me Anything’](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/6oz59k/hiv_former_dc_biglaw_attorney_washed_out_now/) (AMA) posted on Reddit over the weekend. He’s ‘putting [his] life back together,’ ‘optimistic despite it all,’ and willing to share his hard-earned wisdom with lawyers and law students struggling with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS — all challenges he has confronted over the years.

Continuing from my [previous article](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/power-niche-marketing-6-things-not-to-do/), here are some more things that are almost certainly a waste of time in terms of business development (or, at the very least, not the best use of your time).

- Spending a ton of time writing a great article for publication.

First, you will be giving away your expertise and industry knowledge for free to your competition

Second, you will spend a great deal of your most precious resource – your time – for a very uncertain payoff.

Doing things like this make you “feel” like you are doing something useful, but sorry, you likely aren’t doing anything that will really help you.

Having said that, sometimes articles can be useful to establish your reputation and bona fides; however, overall it is not the most effective use of your time.

I will give you, in a later column, a more useful way to write articles for publication.

- Advertising.
Of course advertising can potentially be a powerful technique for a major company that is trying to build its market share (e.g. “Things Go Better With Coca Cola”); however, for law firms (other than global law firms and regional powerhouses that are already a dominant player trying to extend that dominance), I think the dollars are better spent elsewhere.

- Brochures, Videos, Website, Your Bio, etc.
I am overall torn on brochures (get it?). There is a perfectly good argument that no one ever reads them so they are a complete waste of time. Yet, on the other hand, if they are well prepared they can put forth your message – maybe in just a few key words – on the cover, and in the call-out boxes (which people sometimes do look at), and they provide a modicum of seriousness and class to your enterprise. Although I am being a little wishy-washy here, I will say that ideally you will have a really nice-looking brochure that is very professionally prepared; however, I urge you to pull this off in a way that doesn’t take much of your precious asset of time.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Videos can be cool, and if they are unique, a bit crazy, and along the lines of a [Purple Cow](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/reinventing-the-law-business-blend-in-at-your-peril-you-need-to-stand-out/), and let you “put on a show” (which I will talk about in a later column), then I would say go for it. However, I would do everything I could to not spend that much time or money on it.

Of all these written materials, there is no question that the website is by far the most important thing you will write and where you should devote the most time. Third parties “always” go there to “check you out.” In this regard I advocate that it is key to have your website e interesting and not look like all the others. You want to stand out and make clear how different and unique you are — i.e., the heart of your message is you are a power player in your Power Niche.

It is the same with your online bio. Try to stand out and be different and make the same point about your power in your Power Niche. And don’t worry too much about mentioning every single thing you ever did in your career for fear that by omission you will lose out on customers and clients. It doesn’t work that way. Worry more about what you are saying than what you are not saying.

For all of these mediums, I advocate that you figure out your “message” before you write them up. It should be the same message in all of them. The message should be a short one. And the message should be about your power in your Power Niche.

- Direct Mail.
Today this is mostly by internet and is loosely called spam, and “spam” is hardly a compliment. Indeed, other than Monty Python’s [famous Spam skit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python)), I haven’t ever heard anything positive about it.

I think spamming people is overall a terrible idea because it is such a turn-off and convinces people to ignore and avoid you as much as possible.

However, there is a way to cold call someone over the internet that can be done in a very classy manner, which I have used many times before, and which I will explain in a later column.

- Sponsorship of Cultural or Sporting Events.
Except for major law firms that find plain old advertising worthwhile, as I noted above, I don’t think this is worth it either. It is every expensive, plus time-consuming, and I don’t see what you get for it. Yes, your clients have a nice time, but I think if you took the time and the money and spent it as I otherwise advocate above, you will have a much more positive outcome.

By the way, this is very different from a one-on-one situation when you take a client out to a sporting event. That can be superb bonding time and very useful to building a relationship.

- Anything else that takes a ton of your time for an uncertain payoff is “probably” not worth it – unless the payoff is potentially enormous.
. . . .

If you have been doing any or all of the foregoing things, don’t bum out too much. I think I did every one of them, other than the social media stuff. The past is irrelevant – all that matters is what will happen going forward.

By the way, if you have done some of the foregoing and it has actually worked for you, consider why that is the case. Is it pure luck, in which event it is great that you were lucky but you still shouldn’t waste more time on it? Or, do you maybe have a special angle on the foregoing that I personally haven’t seen but is nonetheless successful that could be exploited?  I don’t like to admit it – but I don’t (yet) know everything….

# Biglaw Firm Plans To Cut 5% Of Its Workforce, Including Attorneys
## The latest in Biglaw layoffs, and more than a dozen lawyers will be left jobless.

We hate to say it, but even though demand is slightly up, Biglaw’s [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) show no sign of stopping.

The leaders of Choate Hall & Stewart — a firm that brought in $311,956,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 119 in the most recent Am Law 200 — recently announced a reduction in force. The firm is cutting about 5% of its employees, including attorneys and business professionals. A source tells us that 17 associates are affected.

Although Choate was one of the Am Law 200 firms that made it into the top 20 for RPL in the American Lawyer’s latest rankings (No. 17, $1.61 million), it was also the only Am Law 200 firm to see a decline in RPL from the prior year (down 5.8%).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s memo (available on the next page), citing “economic conditions” that have thwarted demand in certain practice areas as the reason behind these layoffs:

Despite our success, like our clients and major law firms generally, we live in a world which is impacted by general economic and market conditions. Reductions announced at many of our competitors during the last 6-12 months illustrate the challenges of the current economic environment. We have not been immune to them, and economic conditions have impacted work levels in certain parts of the Firm. After monitoring these developments carefully for a period of time, we have come to the difficult decision that we currently have too many lawyers and business professionals in certain practice areas and departments based on the current demands of our clients.

Bill Gelnaw and Charles Cheever, the firm’s co-managing partners, noted in the memo that the reduction in force “is a difficult step for Choate and one we deeply regret is necessary.”

Choate’s firmwide memo announcing the reduction in force is a kinder, gentler version of the layoff memos we’ve seen in the past. “The reduction is not a reflection on any of these individuals,” Gelnaw and Cheever wrote. “It is the result of work levels, not performance.” The memo continues, explaining that all those affected will receive severance packages and outplacement services from the firm.

# A 'Sort Of, Not Really' Cravath Match For The Holiday
## At least it is good news for first-year associates.

After close of business on July 1, when literally everyone had abandoned the firm to celebrate America’s long history of blowing things up, Jackson Walker announced its raises, which left a lot to be desired according to associates.

On the plus side, the Texas-based firm of over 350+ attorneys will adopt $180K salaries for first-year associates. This keeps the firm in the hunt for the top talent now that everyone and their mother in Texas raised salaries.

But the rest of the firm opened the email to find continued silence…

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The Compensation Committee continues to study how to update our compensation approach with respect to our other associates; again with focus on the need to attract and retain talent.

This isn’t necessarily bad news. The firm might announce more than generous raises throughout the firm in the coming weeks. But the only thing more frustrating than waiting until the holiday weekend to acknowledge associate compensation is teasing your associates with salary news and then saying, “um, we’ll get back to you.”

Until then, welcome to the 180K club, Jackson Walker first-years.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# All The Cool (And Smart) Kids Are Staying Away From Law School
## If you're smart, you probably want to steer clear of law school.

So, the [“Trump Bump”](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trump-bump/?rf=1) appears to be a real thing. That’s the notion that, in the wake of the surprise election of Donald Trump, more people are applying to go to law school. Indeed, [over 30 percent of recent applicants](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/over-30-percent-of-applicants-want-to-go-to-law-school-because-of-trump/) cite the 2016 election as a motivating factor in applying to law schools. While those numbers are encouraging for law school administrators that need to put butts in seats to keep the lights on, it doesn’t say anything about the quality of the applicants.

From both anecdotal and statistical metrics, we are in the midst of a law school [brain drain,](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/law-school-brain-drain/?rf=1) with the best and the brightest taking a hard pass at law school. Applicants [with terrible LSAT scores](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/law-school-applications-with-terrible-lsat-scores-are-soaring/) are applying to law schools in droves, causing a crisis in legal education. Remember, going to law school is only half of the “become a lawyer” equation. You still need to pass the bar exam when you graduate. And on that front, things don’t look so great — former head of the National Conference of Bar Examiners, Erica Moeser, called today’s law school graduates [“less able”](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/when-bar-scores-plummet-who-will-examine-the-examiners/) to pass the bar exam. Yikes.

Now comes another statistical measure from the most recent law school application cycle that indicates the overall quality of law students is on the decline. As [reported by](https://associatesmind.com/2018/03/30/top-university-students-avoiding-law-school-2018-edition/) Associate’s Mind, the number of law school applicants from top undergraduate institutions dropped 6.7 percent from 2016 to 2017. This is particularly bad since, after steady decline from 2008, last year’s applicant pool actually saw a small (1.2 percent) increase in people with undergrad degrees from elite institutions. With the most recent set of numbers, it’s clear last year was an aberration, and the overall downward trend is continuing.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Since 2008, law school applications from people with degrees from top universities has plummeted a staggering 44.9 percent. It’ll take more than a few years of despotic rule by an orange man-child to change that trend.

# Fired Biglaw Partner Convicted Of Cyberstalking Former Colleagues
## Prosecutors say he was held ""accountable for his yearslong harassment of his former law partners.""

Yesterday, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted former K&L Gates partner Willie Dennis of three charges of cyberstalking.[ Dennis was accused ](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/ex-biglaw-partner-arrested-accused-of-cyberstalking-former-colleagues/)of sending thousands of threatening emails and text messages to partners at his former firm between the years of 2018 and 2020.

The campaign of problematic communications began after Dennis was fired from the firm. As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1540805/ex-k-l-gates-partner-convicted-of-cyberstalking-attys) Law360, that’s when the deluge of messages began:

During opening statements last week, prosecutors told the jury that after he was fired from K&L Gates, Dennis “flooded” three former colleagues with messages containing degrading names, violent imagery and threats against their families and careers.

Dennis’ messages included warnings like “I will find you” and “sleep with one eye open,” according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Simon.

“They thought the defendant might come to their home or office and that he might even hurt them,” Simon told the jury.

Simon said Dennis’ harassment upended his former colleagues’ lives, causing one to move to a different state and another to sleep with a loaded gun under his pillow.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Dennis contended that the messages were “justified” because he was complaining about sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and management at the firm. Dennis has sued the firm over these allegations, and the case is stayed pending arbitration.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said of the conviction, “Dennis terrified his former colleagues to the point they had serious concerns for their own safety. Today, a unanimous jury has made sure that Dennis is accountable for his yearslong harassment of his former law partners.”

During the course of the case Dennis, who represented himself during the week long trial, also came under fire from presiding judge Jed Rakoff:

Dennis, a longtime member of K&L Gates’ corporate practice, gave an at-times erratic opening statement that prompted numerous objections from the government. Judge Rakoff rebuked the attorney for bringing up off-limits topics like his interactions with police officers and seemingly unrelated current events, such as the war in Ukraine.

“Please confine yourself to the issues in this case,” the judge told Dennis.

Judge Rakoff’s frustration appeared to mount before the trial began Tuesday when Dennis arrived a half-hour late for jury selection. The judge also chastised the defendant for continuing a long pattern of sending improper emails to the court.

“If I receive from any party in this case any email, I will consider holding that party in contempt of court,” said Judge Rakoff, to whom the case was transferred two months ago. “You are a serial violator of the one and only rule that I’ve stressed.”

Northern District of Texas district judge David C. Godbey has found the Biglaw firm of Proskauer Rose has to stand trial in the case brought by the receiver in the Stanford Financial Ponzi scheme.

[Robert Allen Stanford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Stanford) was convicted in 2012 of charges surrounding a $7 billion Ponzi scheme, and the appointed receiver is charged with protecting the interests of the legitimate creditors. As part of that effort, a lawsuit was brought against Proskauer and other Stanford attorneys alleging they were negligent and aided and abetted Stanford’s fraud in breach of their fiduciary duties.

Judge Godbey ruled Proskauer is not protected by the attorney immunity doctrine in a suit by the receiver and the trial should go forward. Proskauer appealed, but Judge Godbey [called that appeal](https://biglawbusiness.com/proskauer-rose-must-go-to-trial-on-stanford-receivers-claims/) “frivolous and dilatory.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Why don’t you tell us how you really feel.

As you might imagine, yesterday the firm[ filed](https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/1036958/proskauer-asks-5th-circ-to-stay-1-5b-stanford-trial) an emergency motion for stay:

“Proskauer requests an emergency stay from this court to prevent the district court from depriving Proskauer of its right to an orderly appeal to resolve serious issues of attorney immunity.”

The receiver has previously settled claims with Hunton & Williams — to the tune of $34 million — for their representation of Stanford.

# Kasowitz Facing Two Lawsuits Brought By Diverse Partners Who Say They Got Stiffed

Marc Kasowitz (screenshot via YouTube)

Marc Kasowitz had an [altogether disastrous 2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/marc-kasowitz-is-waking-up-to-a-bad-morning/), but things have been fairly quiet ever since he [stepped back from Russiagate](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/kasowitz-checking-out-of-russiagate/) and handed the role of “ostensible lawyer spewing wild nonsense” job [over to Rudy Giuliani](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/esteemed-legal-scholars-giuliani-and-pirro-urge-scotus-to-decree-impeachment-illegal-under-marbury-v-madison/).

But last week, Kasowitz got sued by not one but TWICE. The two lawsuits, one in Texas and one in California, may be entirely independent but they have a lot in common. In both suits, a diverse former partner alleges that the firm stiffed him on pay before firing him. Both even allege that the firm was paying them on the same deficient scale.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[The first suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/kasowitz-facing-two-lawsuits-brought-by-diverse-partners-who-say-they-got-stiffed/2/) was brought by Kyung Lee, who joined the firm’s Houston restructuring practice in 2018. According to the complaint, the firm agreed to a $550K in annual comp for Lee’s first year on the job and then proceeded to pay him $20K/month — on target for $240K/year. When Lee asked for the remaining $310K, he claims that was told on October 15, 2019 that the firm would take a $51K offset and would pay him “$125,000 today” which doesn’t add up. He says that Kasowitz responded soon afterward by making “false allegations.” On October 16, he received the $125K and on October 17 he complained that he felt as though punitive actions were being taken against him. On October 18, he was fired. Lee noted that this was done without a proper vote of the firm’s Executive Committee.

[In the second suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/kasowitz-facing-two-lawsuits-brought-by-diverse-partners-who-say-they-got-stiffed/3/), San Francisco white collar partner David Fermino, a gay African-American attorney, alleges a number of discriminatory incidents from his time at the firm. Not to downplay the seriousness of those allegations — UPDATE: a Kasowitz spokesperson notes that the firm denies these allegations — let’s focus on the compensation issues because that’s where the two suits come together. Fermino, who joined Kasowitz in 2017, alleges that the firm promised him an annual salary of $400K. You’ll never believe what Fermino alleges happened next:

Between Plaintiff’s start date and December 2017, Kasowitz paid Plaintiff a salary of $20,000 per month, or $240,000 on an annualized basis, substantially less than his agreed upon compensation.

I guess $20K/month is a magic number! Fermino says the firm made a partial payment of the deficiency in January 2018 before reducing monthly compensation to $10K in April and later to $9K. Fermino then claims that Kasowitz made “false and defamatory statements” about him to others in the legal community before terminating him unilaterally… without the proper vote of the firm’s Executive Committee.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
For its part, the firm informed Texas Lawyer that “[Kyung Lee’s allegations are false, and his claims are unfounded](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/01/08/houston-lawyer-alleges-kasowitz-fired-him-amid-compensation-dispute/).” The firm claims that Fermino misrepresented his book of business and only billed “about 10 hours per week,” which could certainly justify firing someone through a formal process as opposed to systematically dropping his pay.

Two partners, two different offices, two different specialties. And yet some disturbingly familiar allegations: diverse partners, paid an associate’s salary despite earlier agreements, subject to what they say are false claims when they raise complaints, and then unilateral termination without proper EC process.

These are two cases to keep an eye on.

(Check out the full complaints on the next two pages…)

Once you engage in merger talks to that degree, and then it breaks up, the perception can be that you are now really in play.

Because those firms that are at the top of the food chain know that there’s a lot of quality at Shearman & Sterling, and if they can make a run … they’re going to try to do so. So it’s imperative to try to keep those people.

— Brian Burlant, a managing director at legal recruiting firm E.P. Dine Inc., in [comments given to Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1582158) on the troubles Shearman & Sterling may be looking at in the wake of the firm’s [collapsed merger talks](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/rumored-merger-between-hogan-lovells-and-shearman-scrapped/) with Hogan Lovells. During the course of the merger talks, Shearman [conducted layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/shearman-sterling-associate-layoffs/) and lost a number of high-profile partners, as well as an [entire European team](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/03/shearman-dealt-another-major-blow-as-munich-team-quits-for-morgan-lewis-405-118476/). Burland emphasized the importance of the firm retaining top talent during this transitory period.

# The Pink Ghetto: When A Biglaw Partner Asks You About Prostitution During An Interview

The new norm for Biglaw interviews?

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we’ll be examining the way women in law school and law practice are treated based on their gender and perceived ties to feminism. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I was over 40 when I started law school in 2009, and at the end of my first year we had to do a mock oral appellate argument. I thought I nailed mine but, afterwards, as the class was dismissed, the professor asked to speak with me. I was informed that while I obviously was both well-prepared and articulate, I came off as “hard” and “masculine” and that I should think about softening my tone and presentation.

The professor was a female, about 15 years older than I. I was so stunned (and hurt, honestly) that it wasn’t until later that I thought I should have asked her if she ever told any of the males in the class that they came off as hard and masculine and should think about softening their tone and presentation.

I was a law student who was hoping to land a Biglaw summer associate position for summer after my 2L year. I was top 15% at a regional law school, but one big firm that I interviewed with clearly did not think that I was in the running for a 2L summer position.

During one of the worst half hours of my career, the male partner zeroed in on the fact that I was a women’s studies major in college. He asked me if I was a “feminist” and “what was I thinking majoring in women’s studies.” Each time that I tried to bring one of his sexist interview questions back to my qualifications, he would say, “That’s not what I asked you.”

It finally culminated in him saying, “Let me ask you a question. Prostitutes. The ultimate feminists or the ultimate anti-feminists?” I was through at this point. So I told him, “Well, I guess it depends on the prostitute,” and then walked out.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Baby Pls Don't Go: An Ode To Biglaw Special Bonuses

Ed. note: Please welcome [BigLawBoiz](https://www.instagram.com/biglawboiz/) (“BLB”) to the pages of Above the Law. BLB will be writing about what associate life is like in Biglaw.

You spent the last 12 months hunched over at your kitchen table redlining documents and fielding Zoom calls, pretending you’re wearing pants and have showered in the last three days.  You hardly saw the sunlight, and somehow in the midst of a global pandemic where the economy should be tanking you worked… more?  Well, your bonus check finally cleared.  You’re dipping your toe in the water to see what else is out there: greener pastures, work-life balance, more hands-on experience.  You never thought you’d be in Biglaw this long.  Most top out at the midlevel somewhere; it’s no secret that this is how the business model works.  Lawyers and law firms bank on it.

Well, it looks like a lot of people got wise to that business model, all while the SPAC craze kept M&A and Capital Markets activities at all-time highs.  Biglaw firms need their people, more than ever it may seem.  Goldman Sachs caught the business end of the chainsaw when a few of their analysts very publicly complained they “work too hard for this shit.”  Some Biglaw firms wised up and did what they know best: throw money at an issue and pretend it’s the same thing as respect.

These bonuses are significant.  It is certainly a lot of money to give out to your team, and it makes sense — costs were certainly down.  Firms don’t have an entire office, or multiple offices, to keep lit up 24/7 (you paid your increased utilities bill), the extravagant summer programs did not happen (instead of firm-sponsored lunch at Michelin-starred restaurants, you ate a string cheese and Gatorade), and revenues were flat, if not up across many firms.  It’s good to see some of the wealthiest lawyers in the country spreading the love with their people who make the firms so successful.

However, let’s not mistake these as purely altruistic.  The way these bonuses are structured scream “Please don’t leave us!”  You get some now-ish, and some later.  How much later?  Well, wait until fall when we bring in a new class of associates.  These bonuses will not be “free,” and I don’t think are meant to reward associates for the past work they have done, but rather to entice them to stay through what could, and likely will, be a grueling few months.

With vaccine rollouts and cases decreasing, the COVID catastrophe will at some point end.  I’ve heard the rumors of back to office by July, or September.  The far-off dreams of 2022 return seem to have been crushed underneath Joe Biden’s feet as he tripped up the stairs.  If you thought you were busy last year, you better gear up for this year.  It will continue to be SPAC-tacular!  A true SPAC-tacle.  When the money is free, can you really blame banks and law firms for getting in on the SPAC-tion?

Firms really can’t afford to lose you.  They want to hire short-term staff and move associates from different groups into the hot spaces.  They just need the manpower.  You can stay.  You will get worked like a dog. (Side bar, dogs work the least out of any animal.  All dogs I’ve known spend their entire day sleeping.  Bad idiom.)  But you’ll get a nice little piece of change to make you feel special.  You can buy things that fill the void in your life, I know those red bottoms and rollies are looking real right now.

So, you have to ask yourself:  is it worth it?  You may have been ready to leave, maybe take a modest pay cut, but regain some control over your life.  Or do you double down on the golden handcuffs, spend the summer and leave when you get the “surprise” bonus?  But wait, then the winter bonus is only a few months away… might as well stay for that too… Maybe the model has changed.

Love will be in the air in the nation’s capital this coming fall, when [Naomi Biden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomi-biden-95939874/), an associate at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, marries her longtime boyfriend. Biden, of course, is granddaughter to President Joe Biden, and earlier this week, she announced on Twitter that the affair would be taking place at the White House.

Peter and I are endlessly grateful to my Nana and Pop for the opportunity to celebrate our wedding at the White House. We can’t wait to make our commitment to one another official and for what lies ahead.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But who is this Peter character that the president’s granddaughter is planning to marry? Let’s dig in.

According to the New York Times, Naomi’s future husband is [Peter Neal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealpeter/) of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Neal is a third-year student in his final semester at Penn Law. You may recognize his name as one of the creators of [My CARES Act Benefits](https://www.mycaresactbenefits.com/), an online quiz that calculates eligibility for federal relief. (Neal’s co-creator in this public-interest endeavor? His future wife, Naomi. Aww!) Per his LinkedIn profile, he spent the past summer working as an associate at Cooley. Assuming he received an offer, that would be awfully convenient because the firm just so happens to have an office in D.C.

While the location for their ceremony has not yet been announced, the couple’s reception will be held at the White House on November 19. The last wedding reception for a presidential family member to have been held there was in June 2008, in celebration of Jenna Bush’s marriage to Henry Hager.

Congratulations to the happy young couple, and may they survive and thrive together through wedded billable hours bliss!

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Don’t take yourself too seriously, and if there is something you love, do it. [It’s important to make a living, but] there are other things beyond the law. Find that thing that makes you feel good and stay relevant.

— [Alan Barinholtz](https://www.leplaw.com/attorney-profiles/alan-barinholtz), a personal injury lawyer who starred as Judge Alan Rosen in the Amazon Prime TV series [“Jury Duty,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_Duty_(2023_TV_series)) in comments given to the American Lawyer on how skills from side hustles can help in a career as an attorney. “Improv was a huge asset. What I learned more than anything: be prepared. Know your [stuff]. Know the facts. Know the law,” he told Am Law. “And then if you have the ability, improvise.”

# Above The Law’s 9th Annual Holiday Card Contest
## We look forward to your submissions. Thank you, and happy holidays!

It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Amid balmy “winter” weather mixed with a bonanza of [bonus news](https://abovethelaw.com/bonuses/), the holiday season is off to a great start. Jolly Old Saint Cravath was very kind this year, stuffing associates’ stockings with good cheer and [wads of cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/). The law firm holiday parties are starting to kick into gear, but the parties and paychecks pale in comparison to what’s about to get underway: Above the Law’s ninth annual holiday card contest. We’ve already received several emails asking about when this year’s contest would start. The answer: It starts today.

We are a legal website, so of course there are some rules to follow:

1. Because we are committed to the environment here at [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/), we will consider ONLY E-CARDS. You can certainly send us paper holiday cards via snail mail — our address is Above the Law / Breaking Media, 611 Broadway, Suite 907D, New York, NY 10012 — but they won’t be considered for this contest.

2. To submit an e-card, please email either a link to the card or the card itself (as an attachment) — but note that WE PREFER LINKS, if available — to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest), subject line: “Holiday Card Contest.” The subject line is very important because it’s how we will comb through our inbox to collect the entries when picking finalists. If you don’t use the correct subject line, expect a lump of coal in your stocking.

3. Please limit submissions to holiday / Christmas cards that you view as WORTHY CONTENDERS. We’re looking for cards that are unusually clever, funny, or cool; we’re not interested in cards that are safe or boring (e.g., a beautiful winter landscape, a “Happy Holidays 2017,” and the law firm name). We’re seeking cards with some attitude, with that extra je ne sais quoi. If you send us a banal card, don’t be surprised if we [make fun of it](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/atl-holiday-card-contest-honorable-and-dishonorable-mentions/).

4. In your email, please include a BRIEF EXPLANATION of why this card is compelling — an explanation that we MIGHT QUOTE FROM if your nominee makes the finals (if you want to be anonymous, let us know). If you can’t offer an explanation, please rethink whether the card is a worthy contender (see rule #3, supra).

5. The deadline for submissions is two weeks from today: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, at 11:59 p.m. (New York time). No exceptions. If you’re reading this post after the deadline, then you don’t read Above the Law frequently enough.

— [Tracey Chenoweth](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/c/chenoweth-tracey-l), a member of the banking practice group at Skadden, commenting on her [ascension to the firm’s partnership](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/06/amid-industrywide-uncertainty-skadden-moves-forward-with-new-partner-promotions-405-57591/) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the firm announced its [new partnership class](https://www.skadden.com/about/news-and-rankings/news/2020/04/skadden-names-new-partners): Chenoweth, [Dohyun Kim](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/k/kim-dohyun) (M&A), and [Jennifer Permesly](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/p/permesly-jennifer) (international arbitration) in New York; [David Clark](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/c/clark-david-r) (M&A) and [Marcie Lape](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/l/lape-marcie) (litigation) in Chicago; [Paul Schockett](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/s/schockett-paul) (tax) and [Julia York](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/y/york-julia-k) (antitrust/competition) in Washington, D.C.; [Peter Mair](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/m/mair-peter) (real estate) and [Virginia Milstead](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/m/milstead-virginia) (litigation) in Los Angeles; [Shu Du](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/d/du-shu) (China corporate) in Hong Kong; [Andrew Good](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/g/good-andrew-m) (white collar crime/government enforcement) in London; [Ken Kumayama](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/k/kumayama-ken-d) (IP) in Palo Alto; and [Jenness Parker](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/p/parker-jenness-e) (litigation) in Wilmington, Delaware. Nearly 70 percent of this class is made up of women or people of color. Congratulations!

# Top 5 Biglaw Firm Raises The Bar On Billable Diversity & Inclusion Hours
## Whoa! This is the highest number of hours that any firm has offered yet.

Recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion in the legal profession, Biglaw firms have started to implement strategies to improve how their workforces operate when it comes to moving toward achieving equity. We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/), and [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-bonus-eligible-diversity-inclusion-billable-hours/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We’ve just received word that yet another leading law firm has had a successful program like this that’s been quietly running since summer 2020 — and this firm is offering the highest number of billable diversity and inclusion hours we’ve heard of yet.

Baker McKenzie — the firm that was [the first to announce 2020 bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) and sits at #4 in the latest Am Law 100 rankings — rolled out its diversity and inclusion billable hours credit program in July 2020 when it announced the formation of an Anti-Racism Taskforce. Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s announcement:

The Firm’s Anti-Racism Taskforce will examine the Firm’s hiring processes, work allocation systems, partner promotions and other long-standing practices with a critical eye toward rooting out bias and increasing equity and inclusion. The Taskforce will work closely with the Firm’s leadership to bring about concrete change. The Firm’s recognizing and providing credit for attorney time spent on diversity and inclusion activities includes up to 125 hours annually in the US and Canada and 50 hours annually in Mexico.

Baker McKenzie’s 125 billable D&I hours dwarfs the offerings of all other firms we’ve covered by 75 hours. This is a major move in the right direction. Firm leadership shared their thoughts on why this was such an important step to take:

North America Chief Executive Officer, Colin Murray, said, “At Baker McKenzie, we stand united as a Firm in saying that Black lives matter. We are adopting meaningful, concrete changes within the Firm to dismantle institutional bias and to walk down the path to full inclusion and equity.”

Anna Brown, the Firm’s first Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer, said, “Baker McKenzie is not neutral. We are committed to taking an affirmative stand and putting action behind our words. These actions are steps forward in those efforts, and we look forward to making meaningful, long overdue change.”

Congratulations to Baker McKenzie on its commitment to diversity, and for offering its attorneys a way to create a more inclusive workplace. If diversity billables are anything like bonuses, perhaps we’ll see more firms rushing to meet (or perhaps even beat) the firm’s 125-hour rule. Which firm will take the challenge?
