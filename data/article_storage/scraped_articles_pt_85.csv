# Goodwin Is Cutting Even More Associate Jobs Under The Guise Of 'Performance Reviews'
## There's a reason why we referred to this firm as the 'poster child' for recent layoffs....

Goodwin Procter kicked off 2023 with a [round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/), eliminating about 5% of the firm’s timekeepers, including associates and all manner of other attorneys. We’ve known since last week that Goodwin started off 2024 by conducting [even more job cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/public-posts-mentioning-goodwins-layoffs-keep-disappearing/), and now the firm has offered up the reasoning behind what very much looks like a round of stealth layoffs.

According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/01/goodwin-citing-performance-reviews-parts-with-number-of-associates/), Goodwin is in the middle of performance reviews which have resulted in “an unknown number” of out-of-work associates. Here’s some additional information:

“Every January, we deliver performance reviews as part of our annual associate and professional track attorney evaluation process. And as part of this process, each year, the firm facilitates the transition of lawyers who are not performing at the high standards that our clients expect of us,” the firm said in a statement.

Many of the cuts in the past year within law firms have been framed as “performance-related.” Still, it’s not clear whether Goodwin’s 2024 cuts were the result of a more aggressive review process.

Looking back through the Above the Law archives, we can say that to the best of our knowledge, it’s unlikely that Goodwin’s “annual” January performance reviews have ever resulted in such a large-scale job loss for associates. In fact, the only January dismissals we’ve ever discussed were part of last year’s reduction in force, which had nothing to do with associate performance. Goodwin needs to be more transparent with its employees — and in this case, it seems that the only performance that needs to be reviewed is that of the firm.

Best of luck to those who have been let go from Goodwin.

# Judge Benchslaps Biglaw Partner Bagging On The Mueller Investigation
## Protip: Don't make an 'Animal House' joke in front of Judge Friedrich.

It looks like U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich of the District of Columbia has drawn a line in the sand. Just because she was appointed to the judiciary by Donald Trump, that doesn’t mean she’s going to cotton to lawyers trying to drag Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

In a recent status conference in the case against Concord Management and Consulting, Judge Friedrich reached down and benchslapped Reed Smith partner Eric Dubelier over what she said were “unprofessional, inappropriate, and ineffective” comments. The smackdown stems from Reed Smith’s [brief](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VKSYRfvWKTLPvyPY-liSkrtdKJfmJCl/view?usp=sharing) of January 4th, over a discovery dispute between the government and Concord Management. The brief analogizes an argument made by the Mueller investigation to the classic comedy “Animal House.” And that was the bridge too far for Judge Friedrich, who went on to say the strategy was “undermining your credibility in this courthouse,” before telling Dubelier to “knock it off.”

According to [a report](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/01/07/knock-it-off-judge-upbraids-reed-smith-partner-litigating-mueller-case/) by Law.com, that wasn’t the end of the matter. Not content to willingly take the chastisement, Dubelier responded that he’d speak with his client to see if it made sense for him to continue with the representation, saying the judge’s comments amounted to a personal attack.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
He angrily asserted that there had been “bias on the part of the court here.”

“There’s no bias,” Friedrich responded, again telling Dubelier there had been “many inappropriate remarks” in his filings to the court. “You know it,” she said.

“That’s your opinion,” Dubelier shot back, saying he was “entitled” to discuss it with his client. On that, the judge agreed.

Looks like this will be a fascinating dynamic to monitor as the case continues.

# Burnout Or Boreout? Which Is Worse?
## Unfamiliar with boreout? It’s a term to describe being bored out of your mind along with crises of both meaning and growth. It’s stagnation, but more than that.

We all know about, and many of us have experienced, [burnout](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/analysis-survey-finds-lawyer-burnout-rising-well-being-falling). It’s on the rise this year, and not unexpectedly, due to what’s happened over the past 16 months. Job satisfaction is headed in the wrong direction, junior and midlevel associates are feeling the burn (and not the Bernie Sanders kind) of declining well-being, and nearly half of the attorneys surveyed report a decline in their well-being. This is not good news for all of them and for the profession at large. You can replace [everything but your health](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/stat-of-the-week-growing-discontent/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=139425238&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9xdrre-7rs7taXcnuh_fyh8cnXcNZU8Skvo5I708GkgQVVW1I0pC5hgHA81Kqfc3gy3WiyD4KaC3VvwBqAw1HAwe4LJQ&utm_content=139425238&utm_source=hs_email). You don’t want that to hit the skids.

What about boreout? No, that’s not a typo. It’s a term to describe being bored out of your mind along with [crises of both meaning and growth](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210701-the-damaging-effects-of-boreout-at-work?ocid=global_worklife_rss&xtor=ES-213-%5BBBC%20News%20Newsletter%5D-2021July5-%5Bworklife%5D). It’s stagnation, but more than that. While the pandemic may have exacerbated boreout, it’s not new. It’s a feeling of “if I have to review one more canned document sent by agent counsel or write one more motion to compel, I will totally lose it.” Having a lack of motivation or a lack of interest in the job does not bode well for the career path, and being stuck in the same-old same-old is just as paralyzing.

It’s hard to work up the courage to tell your boss that you would like something new to do, something new to learn, something that sparks your interest, rather than just being that hamster endlessly trudging on that wheel. Part of the practice that has always interested me is the opportunity to learn something new, whether it’s about an aspect of the client’s business that I had known nothing about, whether it’s an area of law that is new to me.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What if you are either burned out or bored out, and you dread going back into the office? Now that many are returning to work, how will meetings be handled? Hybrid? Will command in person performances aka “[presenteeism](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210604-why-presenteeism-always-wins-out-over-productivity)” be required? One Biglaw firm with an office in Atlanta really really really wants peeps to [return to the office](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/troutman-pepper-email-back/), saying that “It’s not simply a function of being able to bill hours. There is more to being a lawyer than simply the capacity to bill 2,000 hours a year.” Please tell that to anyone who doesn’t meet the billable hours requirement. So, as someone asked, “is this the new normal or the new better?”

A recent article in the New York Times questions the need for meetings in the headline: “Meetings. Why?” The subhead asks two salient questions: “Does this need to be a meeting? Does anything?” Those are very Zenlike, going to the heart of [why we have meetings](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/work-meetings-zoom.html?campaign_id=93&emc=edit_fb_20210708&instance_id=34846&nl=frank-bruni&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=62940&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c) and whether they really accomplish the goals of the meeting.

As the author, Caity Weaver, notes, meetings are opportunities to gather with “people we hate.” We lawyers live (but not necessarily thrive) on meetings: with clients, with opposing counsel, with partners, with associates, with corporate law department colleagues. There is nothing worse, at least to me, than time spent in a meeting where absolutely nothing gets done, no decisions are made, it’s just endless navel-gazing, endless dithering, endless blithering, and endless circling round the drain. Running meetings like they were prepandemic is not going to work, nor, I think, do we want them to.

What are participants doing while in that meeting? Texting? Googling? Do they look up from their devices at all? Are they engaged even just a little? The existential question is really whether the meeting is necessary to accomplish the meeting’s goals if peeps are not paying attention (and hard to do in these times of attention deficit). Meetings are often the scourge of in-house counsel.

As a former in-house counsel in charge of litigation wherever it was, I loved Mark Herrmann’s [recent ATL post](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/the-real-reason-big-cases-dont-go-to-trial/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=140057526&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8VMOFIuH9prtjI11auivIHvyM4W-qqj2SZ3cP0eecos8zwdu431x6pn_TxVSA7rhneZWW1h4VpvHftZwdfhf3HUOGw5g&utm_content=140057526&utm_source=hs_email&rf=1).

My client was sued in places that we didn’t even know existed. Our litigation manager would pull out his trusty national road atlas to figure out where in the country that venue was and the closest reasonably big city to find local counsel. It’s never fun to lose a case, especially when the financial stakes are high and in an unfamiliar jurisdiction, but I always preferred outside counsel to overestimate what we might lose and include not only what the compensatory damages might be, but attorneys fees, ours, and theirs. Those numbers add up. Prepare your client for the worst scenario.

To all those newbies who aspire to in-house positions or who are newly ensconced in them, understand that being in-house is far from the bed of roses as some would portray it. While you only have one client, you still have many masters. Too many counsel were overly optimistic about our chances, but they weren’t the ones who had to deliver the bad news as to why the case had gone off the rails. That may well be your task, found in the job description rubric of “other duties as assigned.”

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

Nixon Peabody is in disarray after the firm [took on Donald Trump as a client in secret](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firm-adds-donald-trump-as-client-rest-of-the-firm-may-not-be-too-happy-about-it/), publicly filed a motion [parroting Trump talking points downplaying January 6](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/11/Trump-Nixon.pdf), and when the rest of the firm asked why it’s putting its reputation on the line like this, leadership told them to [kindly pound sand](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/after-nixon-peabody-hitched-itself-to-donald-trump-blindsided-partners-told-to-get-over-it/).

There are calls for [leadership to step down](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/nixon-peabody-donald-trump-managing-partner-step-down-demand/) and for the team repping Trump to follow the lead of every other Trump attorney with Biglaw roots and leave the firm before going further. So far, no action on either front.

But a reader’s insightful question got us wondering: put aside the damage to client relationships, the professional risks of slapping the firm name on buffoonish political talking points masquerading as legal arguments, and the shattered trust among the partnership following a cloak and dagger attempt to slip repping the most famous wingnut in the world past the rest of the partners… did Nixon Peabody get a retainer? And, if so, how much?

One would think so. Securing a retainer is standard procedure. But then again, so is running a potential client by the rest of the partnership and that didn’t happen, so who knows?

Trump is notorious for stiffing lawyers, [as Rudy Giuliani knows well](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/trump-stiffs-rudy-for-all-his-amazing-legal-services/). And it’s not a new phenomenon either. Several months ago, a former Biglaw attorney told me that back in the 1980s, his firm held a party after winning a key victory for Trump’s business empire and The Donald crashed the event to tell the celebrating attorneys that he wasn’t going to pay their invoices. The firm eventually got paid but only after taking an unspecified haircut.

Firm CEO Stephen Zubiago has indicated that the case came to the firm through the GOP and not Trump specifically. Substantively, it doesn’t matter who referred the case because Trump is, ultimately, the client. As a procedural matter, it might mean the Republican Party and not Trump picked up the tab on this one. Though, query why the GOP would view it as a party matter to get clarity on whether throwing a coup triggers the Fourteenth Amendment.

Actually, scratch that. OBVIOUSLY, the GOP should view it as a party matter since it will surely come up again — but why would the GOP want the public to know the party is legitimately worried about candidates attempting coups again?

If Trump or his campaign is on the hook… is the firm covered? Motion practice can get pricey!

And the only thing that could irk Biglaw partners more than having the firm go behind their backs and making risky, embarrassing moves… is not getting paid for it.

In this episode, I speak with Yvette Ostolaza and Mike Schmidtberger of Sidley Austin LLP, about the rationale behind dedicating different resources to the members of the firm without fearing them leaving. They also share what the twists and turns of their careers were to where they are now. Yvette also talks about her goals and priorities as she takes over the role of the first female chair of Sidley’s management committee. Together, Yvette and Mike describe how they keep the balance between all of their responsibilities as leaders and everything that’s on their plate right now.



The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Handing Out Year-End And Special Bonuses
## There's also extra money on the table -- but only if you billed a ton of hours.

Bonuses are making their way through Biglaw! By and large, the industry had a successful year, and firms are sharing that monetary success with the attorneys who made it all possible. That’s good news for associates who spent the year billing and could use some extra cash to (probably) pay down their student loans.

The latest firm to announce bonuses — of both the annual and special varieties — is Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer. The firm made $961,900,000 in gross revenue last year, making it 46th on the Am Law 100. As expected, the firm will be matching the prevailing market rate on those bonuses.

Associates in good standing will get bonuses according to the following grid:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
 	Year-End Bonus	Special Bonus
Class of	2021	$15,000	
Class of	2020	$20,000	$4,000
Class of	2019	$30,000	$6,000
Class of	2018	$57,500	$11,500
Class of	2017	$75,000	$15,000
Class of	2016	$90,000	$18,000
Class of	2015	$105,000	$21,000
Class of	2014+	$115,000	$23,000
The firm also said that supplemental year-end bonuses — valued at 20 percent of an associate’s year-end bonus — are available. But (and it’s a big but), only for those who worked 2,600 hours (2,400 of which must be billable).

# I Like Having Clients And Counterparts In Different Time Zones
## Having clients and counterparts on the West Coast can give lawyers on the East Coast an extra chance to be productive.

When I first opened my practice, pretty much all of my clients were in the same geographic area as me. As a result, I rarely needed to consider time zone differences. As my practice expanded, I started serving clients in different time zones and dealing with counterparts and stakeholders who were located all over the world. Although this initially presented my firm with some challenges, I now understand that dealing with counterparts and clients in different time zones can be an advantage in many situations.

The first time I had a situation in which I had to deal with a client in a vastly different time zone occurred a year or two after I opened my practice when I had to communicate with a counterpart who was located about 10,000 miles from me. I am super bad at math, so it was hard to calculate what time it was in the client’s area at any given point, especially since we often were not even in the same day, and propose a good time for everyone to speak. Usually when we would communicate, it would involve conversations at night on the East Coast which would be conversations in the morning in my client’s time zone. By timing it right, the conversations were not so difficult to organize and occurred pretty close to working hours for everyone involved.

Another time, we needed to organize a deposition for a deponent in Asia. This also posed some problems since it was difficult for everyone to arrange an appropriate time. We eventually settled on early evening on the East Coast, which was early morning where the deponent was located. I prayed that the deposition would not last too long since this would mean burning the midnight oil for my colleagues and me. Thankfully, the deposition only lasted a few hours and we were able to complete the examination without too much of an imposition for all of the people involved.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As my practice grows, I am actually happy to deal with counterparts and clients in different time zones since my ordinary working hours are packed with clients in my own time zone. During the typical 9-to-5 working day, I hardly get a break since I continuously have clients and counterparts call or email me asking for updates on the matters which we are handling. Clients and counterparts usually prefer to be contacted during working hours, and it is difficult to pack all of the necessary work tasks into those typical working hours.

After 5 p.m. or so, the din of work begins to die down, and I can start catching up on some of the things that might still be outstanding from the day. During this period, I can also still work on matters that involve clients and counterparts on the West Coast. Folks on the West Coast are still at their desks after 5 p.m. in my time zone, so I usually wait for this time to reach out to people I need to contact on the West Coast so I can prioritize the people in my time zone who might sign off around 5 p.m.

As a result, having clients and counterparts on the West Coast essentially gives me an extra chance to be productive during my workdays. It also enables me to organize my work so I am not so overloaded during working hours on the East Coast by spreading out some of the tasks that can wait until later for people located on the West Coast. As a result, having clients and counterparts in different time zones can be a substantial advantage and can make individuals more productive in how they stack their work.

Of course, having clients in different time zones can definitely lead to some work-life balance issues. In order to maintain a solid personal life, individuals should rarely work more than 40 hours a week, and this is more difficult if lawyers have clients and counterparts in different time zones. Dealing with people in different locations might mean that lawyers need to be at work before or after normal working hours to accommodate the time difference among parties. Nevertheless, it is usually easy enough for people to find an appropriate time that works for everyone in different time zones to communicate. In addition, for lawyers who are trying to maximize their productivity, having clients and counterparts in different time zones can enable attorneys to more efficiently handle their work and extend their useful work periods.

# Another Biglaw Firm Delays Opening -- Thanks Delta
## The overwhelming majority of the firm's employees are vaxxed, but the Delta variant is still causing delays in the firm's plans.

Count me as one of the growing number of fully vaccinated folks who is downright salty about the unvaxxed clogging up our ICUs and letting the Delta variant of COVID-19 ruin our summer plans. One of the many repercussions of this shortsightedness is being felt in Biglaw, as carefully planned office reopenings are being pushed back.

The latest firm to push back office plans is Wilson Sonsini. In managing partner Doug Clark’s latest message ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/wsgr-delays-opening-delta/2/)), he explains that the firm is pushing back its planned full reopening from September 20th to October 25. The firm [previously made clear](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/wsgr-reopening/?rf=1) that “No one will be required to return to an office during calendar-year 2021.” And while the office is currently available to those that wish to work from there, the “enhanced” grand reopening planned for its U.S. offices with full amenities and services as well as “celebratory events” will have to wait for now.

The firmwide email also notes that unvaccinated employees and visitors are not able to enter their offices, and that policy will remain. The good news is that an impressive 93 percent of WSGR employees are vaccinated. And the firm hopes that number will grow.

# ATL Law Firm Rankings: The Office 100
## You work in an office, not a firm.

Everybody wants to know which law firm is the “best,” and we try to capture that every year with our “Power 100” law firm rankings. [Check out the 2017 list, here](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2017-power-100-law-firm-rankings/).

It’s fun to think of firms as the giant behemoths they are, but people don’t really work at a “firm.” They work in an office. And each office has its own quirks, its own strengths, and its own security protocol to prevent people from jumping out of the window.

The Office 100 rankings try to capture that. And while, sure, these rankings suggest that working for Kirkland anywhere is better than working for Skadden everywhere, there are more granular questions that prospective first-years are asking themselves. Are you better off at Quinn Emanuel, L.A. or Boies Schiller, NY? [Survey says: Quinn.] Jones Day seems ascendant right now, but would you rather be at Jones Day in D.C., or Latham Watkins in D.C.? [Survey says: Latham.]

[So check out our office rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2017-office-100-law-firm-rankings/). A law firm is not a monolith, and some offices are better than others.

# Davis Polk Joins The Biglaw Associate Salary & Bonus Wars
## Big money for Biglaw associates. Exciting news for all!

One by one by one, Biglaw firms at the top of the Am Law 100 ranking are lining up to shower their associates with cash in the form of higher salaries and year-end bonuses, all thanks to [Cravath’s new compensation scales](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/).

The latest firm to offer associates raises is one that once [led the pack when it came to bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/), but now it’s just as happy to follow along as all the rest.

We’ve now confirmed that Davis Polk — a firm that brought in $1,849,000,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 20 in the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see come 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016+ – $435,000
DPW is also matching the Cravath bonus scale, and this is what year-end bonuses will look like at the firm, paid on December 29:

- Class of 2023 – $15,000
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016+ – $115,000
Congratulations to everyone at Davis Polk!

(Flip to the next page to read the firm’s memo.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Beware Of Big Hacking In Biglaw
## Is your law firm prestigious enough to be targeted by Russian hackers? Check out this list of almost 50 Biglaw targets.

It seems that Russian hackers are every bit as prestige-obsessed as second-year law students going through on-campus interviewing. The nearly 50 law firms targeted by cyber-criminal “Oleras” and his (or her) gang are some of Biglaw’s biggest and best names. If you take the nation’s [15 most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/2016-vault-law-firm-rankings-self-perpetuating-prestige/), you’ll see 13 of them on the list of targets.

The missing two? Litigation powerhouses Boies Schiller and Quinn Emanuel, which makes a certain amount of sense. According to the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-breach-cravath-swaine-other-big-law-firms-1459293504) and [Crain’s Chicago Business](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160329/NEWS04/160329840/russian-cyber-criminal-targets-elite-chicago-law-firms?X-IgnoreUserAgent=1), the hackers’ goal was to steal confidential client information for purposes of insider trading. Litigation shops like Boies and Quinn, working on publicly filed cases, just aren’t as tempting targets compared to M&A giants like Skadden and Sullivan & Cromwell, who have advance notice of market-moving mergers.

On the bright side, as we noted [earlier today](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/morning-docket-03-30-16/), there’s no indication (yet) that the hackers succeeded, in terms of either obtaining actionable information or trading on it. And also on the bright side, the threat — apparently discovered by cybersecurity firm [Flashpoint](https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/), and now under investigation by federal authorities — has caused top law firms to review and shore up their cyberdefenses as necessary. Firms are also signing up to join the information-sharing group about cyberthreats formed by [Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center](https://www.fsisac.com/) (FS-ISAC), which seems like a step in the right direction.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The episode does raise a question, though: why lawyers? They don’t get paid like investment bankers or traders, nor do they get the same kind of glory — movies like The Big Short or The Wolf of Wall Street don’t get made about transactional attorneys, no matter how prestigious their firm or [strong their pedigree](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-rankings-top-transactional-law-firms-by-pedigree/). So why don’t hackers focus on the Wall Street titans and leave the poor paper-pushing lawyers alone?

One can think of a few possible reasons. First, hackers might see corporate lawyers as the soft underbelly of the financial sector — or, as columnist Keith Lee [put it](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/is-your-law-firm-a-target-for-hackers-spoiler-yes/), “a back door to the valuable data of their corporate clients.” Many Wall Street workers are comfortable with math and science and know a thing or two about technology; lawyers, not so much. Many of us (myself included) went to law school because we’re more comfortable working with words than with stats. So attorneys might be, on average, less tech-savvy than Wall Streeters, and therefore more likely to fall for, say, a random phishing email. If a brilliant Harvard Law School professor [can fall for a phishing scam](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/12/hls-potpourri-professor-victim-of-phishing-while-students-fish-for-constitutional-protection-from-the-tsa/), any lawyer can.

Second, compared to the highly regulated financial-servies industry, Biglaw is simply more lax than Wall Street when it comes to internal controls and cyberdefense. Take the trend of preventing lawyers from accessing personal email while at work (a trend many lawyers don’t like, although [note this possible solution](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/a-sensible-solution-to-the-problem-of-personal-email-and-web-browsing-at-work/), a product called [Silo by Authentic8](https://www.authentic8.com/what/)). This policy is taking hold only now at law firms, but it has been in place at many Wall Street firms for years (as many of you might know from your friends working at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley).

What can you do to protect yourself and your law firm against cyberthreats? This was a major theme of the recent [ABA TECHSHOW](http://www.techshow.com/) conference, which I had the pleasure of attending and presenting at, and I might share some of what I learned in a future post. In the meantime, read the prior posts of [Jeff Bennion](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/you-are-already-behind-enemy-lines-protecting-yourself-from-email-attacks/) and [Keith Lee](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/is-your-law-firm-a-target-for-hackers-spoiler-yes/) for insights and guidance on this important topic.

# Elite Litigation Boutique Wows With Year-End Bonuses That Exceed Biglaw
## These are some very generous bonuses.

It’s easy to think that the top salaries in the legal profession can be found at the biggest law firms. But perhaps you haven’t been paying attention to the bonuses at elite boutiques. These small but mighty firms often offer associates bonuses much larger than Biglaw. Today, we have another boutique wowing with its bonuses.

Litigation boutique Susman Godfrey just announced associate bonuses — and, wow, are they impressive. The median bonuses for Susman Godfrey associates by graduation year are as follows:

2014

$160,000

2015

$155,000

2016

$147,500

2017

$140,000

2018

$112,500

2019

$95,000

2020

$85,000

These median bonuses blow the numbers for Biglaw out of the water. Take the class of 2020, their Biglaw bonus is $30,000 while at Susman they’re averaging $55,000 more. The class of 2014 is $45,000 better off at the elite boutique over Biglaw.

Additionally, the firm announced its partnership class, all seven associates eligible for election were made full equity partners. You can read the firm’s announcement [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/susman-bonus-22/2/)

The firm’s managing partners, Kalpana Srinivasan and Vineet Bhatia had this to say about the good news:

“We are extremely fortunate to have had a strong financial year and thrilled that our firm can continue to expand its partnership along with our growing business. We have exceptional associates, and we are delighted that we can reward them for their hard work and critical contributions to our firm’s success.”

# No Bonuses For First-Year Associates At This Biglaw Firm
## Ouch! That's got to sting.

This year’s bonus season is a lot like last year’s bonus season, the bonus season the year before that, too. Save for [some outliers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/this-firm-wont-give-you-anywhere-near-a-full-bonus-if-you-dont-meet-your-hours-requirements/) at a few firms, associates have seemed generally happy with their cash hauls. With the latest bonus announcement, however, all of those good vibes seem to have come to a grinding halt as of Friday afternoon.

Which firm is depriving first-years of their first-ever Biglaw bonuses?

That would be Akin Gump, and first-year associates at the firm are furious. “No bonus for first-years with crushing student loan debt,” said a source affected by the firm’s refusal to offer even pro-rated bonuses for its new attorneys. To be quite frank, this is a bunch of horseshit. The firm’s gross revenue for the most recent [Am Law 100 rankings](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:VM5tZmKV8kUJ:https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/%3Fid%3D4%26name%3DAkin-Gump-Strauss-Hauer-%2526-Feld+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) was $980,000,000, with profits per partner of $2,100,000. The firm is the 36th highest grossing law firm in the world. With all of that money, Akin Gump can afford to pay its first-year associates a small pittance of a bonus this holiday season.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
UPDATE (3:20 p.m.): Another source from the firm reached out to us in order to express a different point of view about the bonuses, or lack thereof, for first-years:

While I would of course love a bonus, it isn’t as bad as it initially seems. First, Akin counts our billable hours from January to December. This means for us first years our hours don’t count, either for us or against us, for the first 3 months or so we are working. While I would totally understand the opposite perspective, I don’t mind this because it has let me get introduced to the firm and get a warm up period before I have to start really watching the clock and grinding it out.

Also, they are going to pay off $100 a month to our student loans next year, so that will come out to about 1/3ish of a pro-rated first year bonus.

So again, while I’d love a bonus, I personally do not feel like it’s unfair.

Here’s what the firm’s bonuses look like for all other class years:

Class of 2016 – $15,000
Class of 2015 – $25,000
Class of 2014 – $50,000
Class of 2013 – $65,000
Class of 2012 – $80,000
Class of 2011 – $90,000
Class of 2010 – $100,000
Class of 2009 – $100,000

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
According to the Akin Gump bonus memo, which is available on the next page, “[t]here is no hard and fast productivity level for receiving a bonus,” but associates should have about 1950 hours if they’d like to see some bonus money this year. Luckily, the firm will count pro bono hours as well as general counsel hours in associates’ productivity assessments, as well as business development hours, which is new this year. For associates who do receive bonuses at Akin Gump, the firm plans to reward “outstanding performers” with above-market bonuses for their class years, ranging from $5,000 – $25,000. Congratulations to all of the firm’s high-billers!

Our condolences go out to all of the first-year associates at Akin Gump; unfortunately, despite your huge debt loads, your checking accounts will be left achin’ for cash.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us at 646-820-8477. We look forward to hearing from you.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Our aim is to help firms and institutions minimize unnecessary changes to valuable DEI initiatives that are perfectly legal and good.

— [Julie Jones](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-embrace-roadmap-against-diversity-program-attacks), chair of Ropes & Gray and a member of the [New York State Bar Association task force](https://nysba.org/committees/task-force-on-advancing-diversity/) that created a plan for firms to protect their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the wake of the Supreme Court’s anti-affirmative action ruling that has been used as a basis to attack law firms’ DEI initiatives. As noted by [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-embrace-roadmap-against-diversity-program-attacks), Paul Weiss attorneys Brad Karp (the firm’s chairman), Loretta Lynch (former US attorney general), and Jeh Johnson (former Homeland Security secretary), serve as co-chairs of the task force, and worked with about four dozen other Biglaw attorneys and law school deans to write a [93-page report](https://nysba.org/committees/task-force-on-advancing-diversity/) suggesting ways law firms can legally attract and retain diverse talent.

Gender equality is given a lot of lip service in the legal profession, and yet women continue to face many disparities when they sign on for work each and every day. From pay to partnership promotions to the composition of leadership committees to family policies, there are many areas where law firms must change to keep up with the times — especially during the pandemic era. Thankfully, some law firms are becoming more progressive, but which firms are doing the best they can for women in all areas?

For the third year in a row, the Yale Law Women have released a ranking of the Top Firms for Gender Equity, coupled with its annual list of the Top Family-Friendly Firms. We’ve written about the latter ranking every year (see our coverage from [2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/the-top-10-most-female-friendly-law-firms-2018/), [2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2017/), [2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2016/), [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2015/), [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2014/), [2013](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2013/), [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/the-2012-top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law/), [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law-women/), [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/05/family-friendly-law-firms/), [2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/yale-law-women-anoint-top-ten-family-friendly-firms/), and [2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/non-sequiturs-09-08-08/)), and covered YLW’s important new dual ranking in [2019](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/the-top-10-law-firms-for-gender-equity-family-friendly-policies-2019/) and [2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/the-top-law-firms-for-gender-equity-family-friendly-policies-2020/).

- 61% of firms have implicit bias training for all attorneys that has been updated since 2020
- 12% of Equity Partners are POC
- 97% of firms gave paid time off to workers who contracted COVID without a test as proof

Please click [here](https://ylw.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-YLW-Top-Firms-Report-vF.pdf) (PDF) to see the full report from Yale Law Women.

While vast improvements have been made in terms of gender equity and parental accommodations offerings at large law firms, there is still a lot of work to be done. We said this in the past, but it bears repeating in times like these: “The legal profession has come a long way in terms of attempting to afford equal opportunities for success for both men and women, but it’s still got a long way to go. Why are lawyers still hurrying up and waiting for change?” Be forces for good at your firms. Women deserve to be treated equally, and allies have never been more important. Offer help where help is needed, and together, we can achieve true greatness.

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made the Yale Law Women Gender Equity & Family Friendliness ranking. How did your firm do this time around?

# Phooey On Dinobabies
## Just because we’re old doesn’t mean we cannot still contribute. Conversely, just because someone is young doesn’t mean that they can’t either.

Ever heard the term “dinobabies”? I am not making this term up. You are not alone in your ignorance. I had never heard the term until I read an article in the New York Times about an age discrimination case against IBM. In a raft of previously sealed documents now made public, company executives disparaged older employee as “dinobabies.” (Need for an emoji of a dinosaur in a diaper?) I don’t know if the “babies” part of the term meant that the older workers were “crybabies.” An [example of infantilizing older workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/12/business/economy/ibm-age-discrimination.html?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20220214&instance_id=53120&nl=dealbook&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=82666&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c)?

I have some questions. Didn’t anyone ever tell anyone at IBM (or other companies for that matter) that email are discoverable and often provide the smoking gun, the ammunition to resolve a case to prevent reputational risk and save some bucks? I guess not, or they didn’t attend any training because they didn’t think that they needed it. With so much training now online and compliance officers tracking everyone down to make sure employees at whatever level take the compliance training for their area, they can hardly plead ignorance, or wait, maybe they should.

Cringeworthy emails include two examples that the Times article mentioned:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Another email by a top executive, appearing to refer to older workers, mentions a plan to ‘accelerate change by inviting the “dinobabies” (new species) to leave’ and make them an ‘extinct species.’ ” If you are wondering where the term came from, now you know.

Another one is especially offensive to older women workers, which “refers to IBM’s ‘dated maternal workforce,’ an apparent allusion to older women, and says: ‘This is what must change. They really don’t understand social or engagement. Not digital natives. A real threat for us.’ ” Cringeworthy, but no surprise, even in the second decade of the 21st century.

These emails are not circumstantial evidence of wanting to cull older workers from the workforce; these are direct evidence, and as we all learned in law school, while circumstantial evidence certainly is a fine way to prove facts, direct evidence is like winning the Super Bowl of evidence. (Yay, Rams!)

A recent email from a 2L reinforces the notion of ageism in our profession. Attending law school after another career, he commented “finding work, whether for summers or during the school year, has been a major challenge and I’ve been shocked (call me naïve) at the degree of ageism, both covert and overt, I’ve experienced in the process.” The ageism hasn’t come from his classmates or faculty, but from prospective employers. No surprise there.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
All of us older workers understand (at least the ones with any cognition) that adding younger workers (aka “early professionals”) is essential to the continuation and growth of any and every business. Surely there must be more diplomatic ways of transitioning older workers in ways that allow them to retain their dignity and even their jobs, in preretirement mode, so that companies like IBM aren’t caught with their smelly dinobaby diapers down. And continuous training and reminders on the discoverability of emails wouldn’t hurt.

However, companies today don’t make retirement attractive. Dependent on 401(k)s and thus the whims of the stock market, many older workers continue to work not because they want to, but because they must. Given the demise of defined benefit pension plans, what choices do they have except to continue working when they would prefer not to? Unless peeps have saved like squirrels do for winter, is it time to look again at defined benefit plans in some fashion 50 or so years after they went the way of VCRs?

Do law firms and corporate legal departments have “dinobabies”? What are they doing about them? How are they preparing for the next generation and the next after that? But it’s not just the Biglaw firms and corporate departments, what are solos doing? What are the small firms doing? So many details and everyone focuses on the here and now, rather than the hereafter. Aren’t there ways to collaborate on how best to transition, other than rudely showing “dinobabies” the door? Please don’t shove us out, we can walk out on our own, thank you very much.

To be fair, ageism is not just a matter of older lawyers being affected; although there’s no age protection for those under 40, age discrimination is just as real for those peeps as well. Comments like “you don’t look old enough to be a lawyer who’s been practicing for X years,” “you don’t have enough experience to argue this motion, handle this trial” [to which I ask, how does one get experience otherwise?]. Bullying and intimidating newer lawyers happens far too often. Why not combine hard-won wisdom of the “dinobabies” with the “early professionals,” who are chomping at the bit to show what they can do? Infantilizing runs both ways.

Sometimes you know when it’s time to go, when you have accomplished professionally all that you wanted to do (Tom Brady?); other times, it’s illness, weariness, boredom, or just the desire not to spend the rest of your days managing idiotic discovery requests, repetitive motions to compel, and smoking gun emails. Just because we’re old doesn’t mean we cannot still contribute. Conversely, just because someone is young doesn’t mean that they can’t either.

If, as predicted, robots take over many of the drudgery tasks that lawyers still do, you won’t have to worry about robots aging out (unless there’s a shortage of usable chips, which given current supply chain issues could be a real fact of AI life.) But you will still have to worry whether to use cloth or disposable “dinobaby” diapers.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

This summer, as law students around the country began the stressful process of seeking a summer associate position, we invited you to[ share interview horror stories](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/all-the-things-that-can-go-wrong-during-on-campus-interviews/). And you responded. We heard about[ flying ravioli](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/interview-horror-stories-eating-and-talking-at-the-same-time-can-be-a-challenge/),[ rude associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/biglaw-is-filled-with-some-elitist-jerks/) and[ disdainful partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/biglaw-partners-need-to-remember-their-humanity-when-conducting-interviews/), and the perils of[ pushing yourself too hard](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/the-on-campus-interviews-that-sent-a-law-student-to-the-hospital/).

Now, we’d like to get a fuller picture of your experiences with on-campus interviews and callbacks. Which firms stood out — in either positive or negative ways? What matters most to you when choosing a firm? Which firm’s offer did you accept and why? And if you interviewed and were offered a position[ outside of the OCI process](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-tons-of-summer-associate-offers-before-oci-even-starts/), we want to hear from you, too. 

Tell us about your recruiting experiences in this [short survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0INrQRevQigfpVY). All responses are completely anonymous. We value your opinions and appreciate your time. All survey respondents will be eligible to enter a drawing for a $500 Amex gift card.

And please share the survey with your classmates. We want to hear from as many students as possible!

# Former Biglaw Partner Doomed To Work On Crimson Tide's Coaching Staff
## Most would love to work as a member of the legendary football team's coaching staff, but not this lawyer.

It’s not a significant role. I do some background work that some would classify as grunt work.

— [Dean Altobelli](http://www.rolltide.com/staff.aspx?staff=329), a former equity partner at [Miller Canfield](http://www.millercanfield.com/), commenting on his role as an [analyst for the Alabama Crimson Tide](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202775559844/Partnership-Dispute-Leaves-ExBig-Law-Partner-Marooned-on-Alabama-Coaching-Staff?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=3) under the leadership of coach [Nick Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban). Altobelli alleges that he was forced out of the firm in what he calls a “deep, deep betrayal of trust”; Miller Canfield, on the other hand, alleges that Altobelli abandoned the firm to become a football coach. Altobelli had been [locked in litigation with the firm](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202775559844/Partnership-Dispute-Leaves-ExBig-Law-Partner-Marooned-on-Alabama-Coaching-Staff?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=3) since 2012, until the Supreme Court denied his request for certiorari earlier this month, on December 5.

Altobelli has been an analyst for the Crimson Tide since 2010. He says he has no plans to coach football full-time, and that his position is [comparable to that of graduate assistant or intern](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202775559844/Partnership-Dispute-Leaves-ExBig-Law-Partner-Marooned-on-Alabama-Coaching-Staff?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=3). He [makes about $45,000](http://www.al.com/alabamafootball/index.ssf/2016/06/alabama_football_staffer_once.html), and left behind a $400,000 pro-rated profit allotment at Miller Canfield.

# Unlike In The Past, This Firm Won't Help If You Were Hoping For More Bonus Money
## The firm's market-busting spring bonus promises of yesteryear are nowhere to be found.

Biglaw associates, were you hoping that another firm would swoop in and offer more bonus money, forcing other firms that have already matched to up the ante?

Sorry, but if you thought that Sullivan & Cromwell would rescue the market from the same bonuses that have been handed out year after year — and perhaps even offer spring bonuses like back in the day — your hopes have officially been dashed. After weeks of waiting, SullCrom’s black bonus box has been smashed open, and the firm is matching standard market bonuses.

Based on the deluge of tips we received, it looks like S&C has done exactly what the rest of the Biglaw market has done, matching the bonus scale set by Milbank last month. Needless to say, associates at the firm are a bit miffed — there’s not even any extra cash being offered for high billers. This seems to be representative of the comments we’ve received from associates at the firm:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We were expecting a match, but really would have gone a long way to give a bump for high billers. We’re basically below market. I billed a crazy number of hours in last 12 months and would easily qualify for extra at other firms.

At least SullCrom is paying out its bonuses on December 18, so associates will have some good cheer deposited into their bank accounts before the holidays.

If you still have something to say about your S&C bonus, feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). All complaints (or praise) will be kept anonymous — and could find its way into an update to this story.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Nationwide Pay Raise Watch: A Long-Neglected Market Gets A Raise
## Another salary bump sets the market in one corner of the legal world.

It’s been a few months since we’ve been able to announce a salary bump from the suddenly volatile Pacific Northwest. As you may recall, Perkins Coie [bumped up its Seattle salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/which-firm-just-gave-its-first-years-a-20000-raise/) back in October, and rival Stoel Rives [joined the craze](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/northwest-salary-wars-continue-and-two-other-markets-get-raises-too/) offering its Seattle associates a bit more too — though, it’s worth noting, less than Perkins Coie pays.

When Stoel Rives announced its decision, we noted that the firm’s Portland office was not included in the fun:

But it’s not all good news for Stoel Rives, as the firm’s large Portland office got left in the cold, despite [big increases in housing prices](http://www.oregonlive.com/front-porch/index.ssf/2015/07/portland-area_home_prices_clim.html) making the area less and less affordable every year.

There’s still hope for those hipster lawyers in Stumptown as Van Brocklin’s memo concluded by promising “market adjustments to other selected 2016 associate salaries in a number of our offices and at various experience levels.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Perkins Coie must have seen that and decided to up the ante in Portland too:

Perkins Coie’s Portland office bumped their first year salary by $20k from 115,000 to 135,000, bringing it back in line with their Seattle office, which was bumped to 145,000 earlier this year. I heard this from a mid-level associate in the Portland office and also noticed a change on their NALP page for the Portland office. As the top firm in the PNW, the raise puts them at least $20k above any other firm in Portland, a market desperately in need of a salary push given the skyrocketing price of rent.

Perkins Coie has indeed [updated its NALP page](http://www.nalpdirectory.com/employer_profile?FormID=7002&QuestionTabID=36&SearchCondJSON=) and fired another salvo in the Northwest salary wars. Congratulations to Perkins Coie’s Portland gang on their new moolah. Go out and enjoy a free-range kale burger or whatever you people eat.

The ball’s in your court now, Stoel Rives.

# Navigating The EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive
## A comprehensive guide on sustainability reporting for startups.

In the ever-evolving landscape of corporate responsibility, the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) has emerged as a significant regulatory framework, akin to the GDPR for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations. This article explores the key aspects of the CSRD and its implications for startups, shedding light on the practical day-to-day impacts and offering actionable advice for navigating the sustainability reporting landscape.

Understanding the CSRD

The CSRD mandates companies to report information across 12 ESG categories, encompassing environmental, social, and governance dimensions. This directive is set to impact over 50,000 companies, with more than 10,000 entities outside the EU falling under its purview. For many of these businesses, it marks the first time they are obligated to provide comprehensive sustainability reporting, involving over 1,000 data points.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Many startups will fall below the reporting thresholds of the CSRD. Nevertheless, they will be indirectly impacted.

- Client Impact: If a startup has clients that are subject to the CSRD, those clients will need to collect corporate sustainability data from the startup.
- Investor Impact: Venture capital, private equity funds, and other investors are expected to incorporate ESG considerations earlier in their due diligence processes. Investors are concerned about the potential impact on revenues if startups cannot provide essential sustainability information required by customers, potentially affecting sales and exit valuations.
- Consumers: Consumers are demanding more sustainability data. Companies that can produce this data may gain a competitive edge.
Not sure where to begin? Here is a checklist that startup leaders can use to start preparing to meet upcoming ESG demands:

- Governance: Establish ESG governance approach at the board level — whether managed through a committee or by the full board. Designate an executive team member responsible for overseeing ESG objectives.
- Regulations: Review the laws of the counties in which you are operating to determine whether any of the new sustainability regulations will apply.
- Business Risk: Catalogue the requests for sustainability information you have received from clients and investors, and quantify the business risk associated with inaction.
- Education: Educate leadership teams on global ESG context and industry-specific risks. Seek external expertise for customized training and strategy development.
- Climate: Anticipate requests for 2024 carbon footprint data from investors and clients. Select a carbon reporting service provider and begin collecting data gathering now. Estimate a minimum of three months for this project.

# Biglaw Managing Partner Is Fearful After Enduring Hate Speech

Lawyers across the country were shocked by the news that in the lead-up to the November election — a time when one presidential candidate’s campaign seemed to encouraged racism, xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and sexism — one of the most prominent members of the legal profession was a victim of hate speech. William Lee, WilmerHale’s former managing partner, was told to “go back to [his] country.” Lee is of Chinese descent, and said he hadn’t heard a comment like that in four decades.

Lee was but the first Biglaw partner to step forward and speak out about the racial animus he’s experienced in this time of great political upheaval. Unfortunately, he’s not the only one to have endured such vile commentary.

[Cyndie Chang](http://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/cyndiemchang.html), a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and Loyola Law School (Los Angeles), is an accomplished corporate attorney who serves as the managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Duane Morris. Chang also [serves as president](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/napaba-president-and-managing-partner-cyndie-chang-aims-to-continue-her-familys-legacy-of-community-building/) of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This past spring, Chang was standing on the steps of the Capitol in Washington, D.C., when an older Caucasian gentleman told her to go back to her country. The [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202773158771/Lawyers-Hear-Message-of-Hate-Go-Back-to-Your-Country?slreturn=20161028102219) has the rest of Chang’s story:


Cyndie M. Chang

“I was in shock, and fear a little bit,” said Chang. She said that she didn’t respond to the man.

Chang, whose family came to the country from China five generations ago, said that she’s been hearing similar stories from others amid this year’s presidential race and its aftermath, including accounts of threats of violence.

“I am somewhat anxious and fearful,” she admitted. [This] week, she said, she will be traveling to another city that she didn’t want to name. She decided to skip a visit to a relative who lives a few hours away to avoid driving alone during that trip. “It’s giving me a little pause,” she said.

“Ignorance and prejudice don’t have a party,” Chang remarked in the wake of the racial incident she experienced in the nation’s capitol. Thanks to the race-based hostility its members may be facing, NAPABA has put together a hate crime tool kit for members on how to identify and report hate crimes.

As we noted last time we discussed these issues, lawyers must recognize that these outrageous incidents can, do, and will affect even those who have reached the highest echelons of the legal profession. Racial animus does not stop just because one is a managing partner at one of the most profitable law firms in the country. Stand up, speak out, organize, and support one another in these times of uncertainty. The law is supposed to be a noble profession — let’s band together do what we can to prevent incidents like this from happening to each other and to other Americans.

# Am Law 100 Firm Announces Attorney Layoffs, Salary Cut Rollbacks
## Furloughs have turned into layoffs at yet another Biglaw firm.

One by one, Biglaw firms that introduced austerity measures in the spring due to the coronavirus crisis are now reversing them, but in some cases, the news isn’t all good. When announcing salary cut reversals, some firms have managed to slip in news about layoffs in the same breath.

Back in April, Seyfarth — a firm that posted $717,370,000 gross revenue in 2019, earning it the 60th place on the latest Am Law 100 ranking — rolled out [firmwide cost-cutting measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-u-s-lawyers-staff-cuts-pay-for-all/) effective May 1, ranging from salary cuts to furloughs of attorneys and staff. Equity partners reduced their monthly draws by 20 percent, all U.S. lawyers had their pay reduced by 10 percent, and staff salaries were cut up to 10 percent based on earnings. The firm also furloughed 10 percent of its U.S. employees, and at the time, sources told us that 180 staff and 50 attorneys were taken out of play.

Today, the firm is announcing not only the reversal of its salary cuts, but the layoffs of some of those who were furloughed — including attorneys.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Here’s a statement from Pete Miller, Chair and Managing Partner of Seyfarth Shaw:

Over the last few months, we have faced incredible challenges, but we have been quick to adapt, supporting each other and responding to our clients’ needs while implementing a series of necessary economic measures to ensure the firm’s success moving forward. Our targets have shifted, but with hard work, our firm’s performance has exceeded our revised forecast. As a result, effective October 1 and going forward, we will be returning all staff to their full 2020 salaries and restoring attorney compensation. In addition, we have been able to bring back some of our furloughed employees.

However, we have also had to make the difficult decision that some staff and a small number of attorneys who were furloughed in April will not return. The affected employees will be provided severance packages, including a minimum of two months of severance, regardless of how long they have been with the firm. The remainder of those furloughed will stay on furlough until the end of the year, at which time we will revisit their status. We will continue to pay their health insurance premiums and will bring them back sooner if the needs of our clients and the firm support it.

Miller continued, noting that the decision to let go some of the staff and attorneys who were furloughed was “largely a result of underutilization” due to the way work changed during the pandemic and the way the firm will work in the future. “Decisions like these that impact our colleagues are never easy to make. This has been an extremely difficult time, and we are grateful for the resilience and dedication our firm has shown in the face of extreme circumstances,” he said.

Best of luck to all those who are affected by the layoffs at Seyfarth.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

[](http://www.mintz.com/home.php)Can’t we all just get along? This is our second story today about an associate claiming discrimination by her law firm. No wonder Kirkland & Ellis has adopted a new [mandatory arbitration policy](http://www.abovethelaw.com/2008/02/kirkland_ellis_we_love_minorit_1.php).
From [Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly](http://www.masslaw.com/news032008.cfm):

An associate in the employment, labor and benefits section of the Boston firm of [Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo](http://www.mintz.com/home.php) has filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination charging that colleagues discriminated against her because of her gender and status as a wife and mother.

Mintz, Levin associate Kamee Beth Verdrager also alleges in her MCAD filing against the firm and ML attorneys Robert M. Gault, Donald W. Schroeder and David Barmak that she was the target of retaliation when she complained about the treatment accorded her by certain members of the employment section and that she was subsequently demoted and placed on probation.

Commenting on behalf of the firm, Public Relations Director Gina Addis said that “the reality is from time to time allegations like these are made against all businesses, including law firms. Our firm has and will deal with any such allegations in the ordinary course and at the appropriate time and in the appropriate forum.”

More discussion, including highlights from Verdrager’s complaint, after the jump.

The firm’s track record seems to be mixed. There’s positive stuff:

[A]ccording to the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, Mintz, Levin has been named to the Working Mother magazine list of best law firms for women attorneys.

And less positive stuff:

Verdrager’s complaint marks the second time in recent years that Mintz, Levin has been hit with allegations of discrimination against a female associate.

In 2005, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a jury had acted permissibly on the evidence in finding that Mintz, Levin’s Reston, Va., office had retaliated against a female employee, attorney Dawn M. Gallina — by deferring a pay increase and ultimately terminating her — because of her continued complaints of gender discrimination.

Mintz Levin has retained WilmerHale in the matter. Here’s what they had to say:

Boston attorney Joan A. Lukey, representing Mintz, Levin, told Lawyers Weekly the firm “obviously denies that there has been any discrimination or retaliation of any kind. Ms. Verdrager is a current associate, who is very well compensated for her services, and the action for which she primarily complained was a setback in her seniority level, which was a product of issues pertaining to her performance.”

Ah, so it’s an Aaron Charney action — going after a firm while you’re still there.

According to WilmerHale attorney Lukey, Verdrager came to Mintz, Levin as a lateral hire, with five years’ experience, “most of which was with a firm in New York. As it turned out, her experience was not at the fifth-year associate level for Mintz, Levin. That was the reason for which the action of which she complains was taken, and the firm categorically denies that there were any improper motives involved.”

Kamee Beth Verdrager’s complaint contains several different allegations. These are the most juicy:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
In December 2004, Verdrager told [partner Robert] Gault she was getting married in a few months, and, according to the MCAD complaint, he suggested she “follow in the path of another female attorney who had agreed to take a cut in salary and status as a means of ensuring her job security.”

Verdrager goes on to claim that Gault made comments in her performance review in the spring of 2005 “that were so derogatory and false that the firm later revised the review to exclude them.”

In October 2005, when Verdrager informed Gault she was pregnant, he responded in what she says in her filing was “a sarcastic and demeaning manner: ‘I guess these things happen. I suppose we have your honeymoon to blame for this?‘”

If these allegations are true, it would be ironic. Bob Gault is an employment lawyer who “has frequently represented employers in…. wrongful termination and discrimination suits…. and litigation arising from employment disputes.”
Since Verdrager and the lawyers she’s accusing happen to work in the employment area, perhaps this will be a learning experience for everyone. They’ve seen employment disputes from the lawyer’s perspective; now they’ll find out what it’s like to be the client.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# What The 2009 Legal Layoffs Were Really Like

Gather round, little children, I want to tell you a tale. You want to know what has happened in the last 10 years in the legal industry? By far the biggest story over that time is the layoffs that nearly shattered the industry, and irrevocably changed it.

The 2009 layoffs that rocked the legal industry were brutal. There is little other way to describe it. Of course, there were other industries and jobs that were lost during the Great Recession. But when the shit first started to hit the fan, and the newly jobless masses from Lehman Brothers streamed wide-eyed into the streets in Midtown, many in Biglaw took solace in the relatively staid and conservative nature of the legal industry, hoping that its business model would provide stability.

That turned out to be a false hope. I know — I lived through it. By the time the bloodshed was over, about 6,000 lawyers would be looking for work. Some were lied to and told they were losing their job for performance issues — issues that magically appeared once the financial institutions that had happily paid for billable hours during boom times hit their own hard times. Others were told a more straightforward story, but the result was the same. There we were — in unprecedented numbers — waiting on the [breadline](https://abovethelaw.com/notes-from-the-breadline/).

It’s bizarre to see so many high-achieving people desperate for the few jobs that were actually available. Midsized firms in major markets saw a deluge of résumés for any lateral position they posted. And when lucky enough you were to get an interview, you spent half of the time trying to convince the powers-that-be that you really were committed to this sudden change in your career path, and no, you would not bolt for Biglaw the second a job there came up.

That part at least was true — there would be little bolting for Biglaw, since most of those jobs weren’t coming back. Firms learned they could live by staffing matters more leanly, and some of the more junior tasks — like the hours of discovery work that used to pad a litigation department’s bottom line — were being outsourced (often at the client’s demand) to third-party vendors.

So, we waited. Though that simple sounding task proved challenging, as Above the Law’s Roxana St. Thomas [documented in real time](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/notes-from-the-breadline-you-may-find-yourself-living-in-a-shotgun-shack/):

How quickly things change. This morning I had to stop for a moment to ask myself what month it is. January? No. February? I think so. In fact, I’m pretty sure that it is February-something, although it’s hard to say when tumbleweeds blow through the Outlook calendar that remains on your BlackBerry, prepared to accept the appointments you do not have and the meetings you will not schedule. Is it Thursday? Friday? Tuesday? That’s even tougher. Those are all days on which one might have a conference call, or a motion due, or a litigation department dinner to sit through while rolling your eyes and emailing a friend across the room (like sixth graders disguised in business attire and outfitted with less crinkly note-writing tools).

But none of those things happened yesterday, or will happen today, and I am wearing the same thing I slept in and, for that matter, wore to the gym. And I haven’t washed my hair since whatever day was three days ago, which I couldn’t tell you the name of.

The days slipped into weeks and then into months.

Even with an entire industry seemingly on the verge of disaster, there were intense feelings of failure and self-recrimination — as if there were something you should have done differently that would save you from this fate. Maybe if you’d stayed a little later, not taken any vacation days, or volunteered to add one more assignment to your 12-hour days, you could have done… something that could have proven your loyalty and worth to the Biglaw firm that just cast you aside. But the reality is, even when couched in the bullshit of “performance-related termination” (that remarkably only became an issue as the economy was collapsing), there wasn’t.

The legal industry was bloated, and the financial transactions that had become the bedrock of many firms were based on a lie. Something had to give, and now you’re screwed.

And when the long days of résumé revisions and cover letters turned up no new opportunities, cheap alcohol could always keep the specter of doom at bay. Of course, that strategy doesn’t really work, but who said lawyers have good coping skills?

From Pilot and Above The Law  
But survive it you must. Leaving New York, plaintiff firms’, small firms, and document review are all on the table as you struggle to end the unemployed life. This shark-like, ever-forward mantra, plus the prayer that once again you’ll work as a lawyer, is all that’s keeping you together. Then halfway through cooking ramen for the fifth dinner in a row — in some poorly remembered pantomime of frugality — the overwhelming futility of your life hits. You’ll remember the dinners with friends you canceled on, the occasions you missed, and the family you disappointed all because you had a high-powered job, and now you have nothing but unemployment checks to show for it. The elitist in you screams — this wasn’t supposed to happen to me! Not the kid who always got good grades, busted ass in college, and graduated from a T14 law school. But here you are, and you aren’t alone.

Fast forward seven years, and you have indeed survived. Now the Biglaw dreams you once pinned everything on seem like an unrealistic childish fantasy, like a nine-year-old declaring they are going to marry Tom Cruise (with the obvious [exception of Katie Holmes](http://www.celebuzz.com/2012-07-17/katie-holmes-had-schoolyard-crush-on-tom-cruise-and-prayed-for-him-daily-reveal-hometown-friends-exclusive-interviews-photos/), and even that didn’t turn out the way she’d planned). Those that stayed or managed to return to Biglaw see that it has changed. It once seemed a safe career choice, where hard work could guarantee you a decent life. But no more. We now know it is as volatile as any market even as it struggles to stay above the fray. The collapse sucked, but it was a defining experience for those that lived it, especially for those still kicking around in Biglaw.

When I ask senior associates their number one complaint about junior associates, it isn’t (just) that they are millennials — it’s that they all say, “I don’t remember 2009.” That experience left an indelible mark. When my grandmother died, we found boxes of cookies and candy hidden around her house; she’d lived through the Depression, and some small part of her was always worried there would come a time when she wouldn’t have any more sweet treats. Similarly, these attorneys work in constant fear that one day the assignments will all dry up. Anyone who survived ’09 knows: the only thing worse than too much work is not enough.

Which cases must you report on?

When you talk to a muckety-muck, what cases will muckety be most interested in hearing updates on?

The first category is obvious: Big-ticket cases.

If the plaintiffs are suing us for a billion or two, then the folks in the C-suite care. Report on those cases regularly.

But things other than money matter.

If the case poses possible risk to the corporation’s reputation, then the folks in the C-suite care. Report on those cases regularly.

If the case involves a government regulator, the folks in the C-suite probably care. Add those cases to the list.

But that’s all obvious.

What other categories of cases does muckety care about?

Cases in which muckety is personally involved.

Perhaps the CEO’s deposition was for some reason taken in a relatively small-stakes case. The stakes are no longer material, but the CEO will likely remain interested in hearing about developments as they occur.

Suppose somebody in the C-suite was named personally as a defendant in a case, was blocked at an international border because of some false report to the police, or otherwise has a personal interest in the case. Instantly, those cases move up the ladder. Report regularly (to the involved person) even though the stakes are relatively low.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
What’s the next category of cases about which muckety cares? Cases in which muckety has a personal relationship with counsel.

Suppose you’re looking for counsel in Panama. You don’t have regular counsel there. The CFO was college roommates with a very impressive person who’s now a lawyer in Panama. You check out the recommendation, and you end up hiring the recommended lawyer.

The stakes were never necessarily material. There’s no personal involvement in the case. But the case becomes a matter of interest because the CFO has a personal relationship with counsel. The C-suite generally won’t care about this case; the CEO, though curious about the case in which she was personally involved, doesn’t care about this other case; but the CFO, who has a personal relationship with counsel, cares. Give regular reports about this case to the CFO.

None of this is difficult stuff; it’s all self-evident when you think about it.

But many in-house lawyers take years — or forever — to start thinking about these things.

Think about whether your audience will care about the case.  Vary your reporting depending on the level of personal interest.

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

Yikes. Things in the London office of Jones Day do not seem okay. Indeed, there’s a lot of discontentment of allegations of sexual harassment flying about. It all started when American Lawyer affiliate Legal Week repeatedly heard complaints about the firm’s London office in the wake of the #MeToo movement. They then decided to launch a [six-month long investigation](https://www.law.com/2019/10/16/sexual-inappropriateness-jones-days-london-office-culture-in-the-spotlight-405-46437/) that consisted of in-depth interviews with 10 firm alumni that once worked in the London office, who vary in terms of gender and seniority. The stories they tell paint an unsettling picture of life at Jones Day’s London office.

Multiple interviewees described a pattern of senior male attorneys having relationships with junior women that usually resulted in the woman leaving the firm:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
One woman, who spent several years as an associate at the firm, says: “There was an endemic culture of sexual inappropriateness among partners and associates and trainees—people felt they could behave inappropriately and get away with it.”
One former partner and one former staff member recall a number of relationships that took place between several senior men and junior women at the firm during the last decade, where the women involved in those relationships left the firm.

“It was the same pattern—partner has an affair with an associate or trainee and it is the woman who left,” the former female associate adds.

The firm alums also talked about inappropriate comments and behavior at work events:

Another former female associate recalled a work dinner she attended a number of years ago where male lawyers at the firm boasted about sexual exploits, including infidelity, and “making amateur porn films”.

She said she felt “deeply uncomfortable and upset” by the scenario, adding that a nearby male partner did nothing to prevent the discussion.

Another described being objectified at a drinks event:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“I was talking to a female associate and a very senior partner there came up and said: ‘I’ve come to talk to the hot blondes in the room.’ He then asked us to guess his age—this was in a room full of people, in the early evening,” she said.

She said that after that incident she chose to never attend another drinks event at the firm.

One alumnus also said her work was unfairly targeted by a male partner and that even other male attorneys noticed the way she was treated. She ultimately credits these partner interactions with being the reason she left Jones Day:

“It’s the reason I left the firm,” she said adding she felt “destroyed” by the experience.

She said the partner frequently spoke to her aggressively, and occasionally male associates would comment on the difference in how she was addressed compared with them. She described one occasion in which the partner was “tearing me to pieces” near to open-plan offices, where “everyone could hear.”

When she decided to speak up about how she felt, she claimed it affected her prospects at the firm.

“I went from receiving excellent feedback, to being told I lacked confidence and was questioned about whether I even wanted to be a lawyer,” she said.

Here in the States, Jones Day is currently facing a purported class-action gender discrimination [lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) alleging a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system with [named plaintiffs across multiple offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/).

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Matches DPW Scale... But Raises Won't Be Effective Until 2022
## It'll be worth the wait, but some associates sure are pissed.

July 1 has come and gone, and Biglaw associates across the country whose firms have matched are now eagerly awaiting their fat new paychecks on the $205K Davis Polk salary scale. Of course, we’ve seen some stragglers when it comes to matching the market, and by that, we mean that a few firms took their time sweet time and decided to announce their matches yesterday.

One firm that waited until the eleventh hour to match the new salary scale is really stretching its associates’ patience thin. Not only did partners wait to make their announcement until July 1, but these raises won’t be effective until February 1, 2022, a full seven months after nearly all other firms have instituted their salary increases. But, there is a bright side….

With $922,354,000 of gross revenue in 2020, Foley & Lardner placed 48th in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. While the firm is making associates wait to receive their salary increases, management has decided to move to a national pay scale, which is great for those in smaller markets who have been getting paid much smaller salaries than their colleagues in major markets. We should also mention that only the first three class years at the firm (Tier 1) will be lockstep on the DPW scale, while all other class years (Tier 2) will receive merit-based increases, with pay “comparable to the salaries recently announced by other major firms.”

Insiders at the firm are pleased that they’ll be moving to a national salary scale, but others are less than thrilled about the long wait to receive their raises and the “cryptic” language concerning what midlevels and senior associates will be paid. Here’s what some of them had to say:

“Associates are not happy with the delayed increase, especially because associates were just told 1 week ago that billable hours, average billed rate, collections, etc. are all above budget so far this year and the firm is on track for its best year ever.

Associates also aren’t happy with the lack of clarity on what happens with salaries for everyone other than first years.”

“Foley & Lardner raised salaries today! The biggest news is Foley adopted a national pay scale, meaning the people in the Midwest and some other smaller markets are seeing a HUGE bump. People are super pumped in Milwaukee!”

Foley will distribute the full salary scale to associates in about two weeks. For now, congratulations to everyone at the firm. It may be difficult to remember right now, but good things come with time — including lots of money.

This week brings us disturbing news out of Georgia. In what police believe may have been a targeted killing, an in-house attorney in Atlanta was shot in the back during her morning commute.

According to police, [Trinh Huynh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trinh-h-huynh-5a32166/), 40, was fatally shot on Monday morning while she was crossing the street, presumably while headed to the train to get to work. She was carrying her lunch bag, gym bag, and purse at the time of her death.

Huynh was a graduate of Princeton University and Emory School of Law. Huynh began her career as an associate in the government contracts and construction practice group at Powell Goldstein (now a part of Bryan Cave), and later lateraled to Alston & Bird, where she was a senior associate. She then left Biglaw to open her own firm, serving at the same time as a project attorney with Counsel on Call. Last summer, Huynh was hired as an in-house corporate attorney for the legal department at UPS.

Trinh Huynh

The [Daily Report](http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202782886965/UPS-Lawyer-Former-Big-Law-Associate-Killed-in-Atlanta-Shooting-?slreturn=20170304102944) obtained a statement from UPS following Huynh’s tragic killing:

UPS was saddened to hear of the death of one of our corporate attorneys, Trinh Huynh, who joined the company last summer. We will cooperate with the Atlanta Police Department through its investigation.

Huynh’s killing was captured on surveillance footage, and police say that they believe she was “specifically targeted” by the gunman. It is unknown if there are any leads, but police encourage anyone who recognizes the man in the footage below to call 911 or contact the Atlanta Police Department as soon as possible at (404) 546-4236.

On a far too frequent basis, members of the legal profession see news reports about partners at some of the largest law firms in the world who have allegedly committed acts of sexual harassment, misconduct, or assault against their associates and fellow partners. Some forward-thinking firms are seeking ways to stop this sort of foul behavior from happening in the first place.

One Biglaw firm has finally come to terms with the fact that money is the motivating factor for attorneys to remain within their hallowed halls, and the powers that be plan to hurt these partners where it matters most: Their wallets.

According to [Legal Week](https://www.law.com/2019/10/21/exclusive-freshfields-to-establish-conduct-committee-partners-could-face-20-pay-penalty-for-bad-behaviour-405-46772/), Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer will be setting up a “conduct committee” and doling out stiff financial penalties for partners who have been warned about their behavior. How stiff are we talking? Here are the details:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
According to a person with knowledge of the matter and documents seen by Legal Week, a new “conduct protocol” would mean partners who are subject to an internal investigation process that results in a final warning about their behavior would face an “automatic fixed financial penalty” of 20% of their profit share for a period of 12 months. …

The new conduct protocol, which, according to the person, was deliberated over by the partnership council within the last two weeks, is designed to “reset the collective understanding around the expected standards of behavior” and to demonstrate the partnership’s “commitment to improving our culture.”

In a statement given to Legal Week, senior partner [Edward Braham](https://www.freshfields.com/en-us/contacts/find-a-lawyer/b/braham-edward/) said: “We are committed to improving behavior and inclusiveness. For more than a year we have been running a global behaviors program to drive culture change, which includes reviewing and adjusting our HR processes, governance and systems across the firm. We want to ensure that positive behavior is consistently valued and that inappropriate behavior is called out and acted upon. The plans for a conduct committee and protocol are part of this ongoing program across the firm.”

Will more Biglaw firms be inspired to tie partner pay to behavior-based incentives? If it does something to stem the tide of partners’ sexual improprieties, we certainly hope so. We’ll be closely watching this new program to see what comes of it.

# Davis Polk: Biglaw's New Compensation Champion

Davis Polk, if not the emergent leader this year in compensation, is absolutely a frontrunner in setting the compensation scale.

— New York legal recruiter Sharon Mahn, commenting on Davis Polk’s rise to glory as [Biglaw’s compensation leader](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/12/07/law-firms-stalled-after-cravath-bonus-but-fall-in-line-to-follow-davis-polk/) throughout the pandemic years. From its [Fall 2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) and [Spring 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) special bonuses, to its [setting of the lockstep salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) for associates, to its latest round of [special year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/), Davis Polk has completely changed the financial scene for lawyers at large firms.

This is the Am Law 100 walking away from the second hundred.

In celebration of American Lawyer’s 40th anniversary, ALM has collected a treasure trove of Biglaw data. How many Biglaw firms currently notch partner profits over $1 million?

Hint: In 1985, the year this data goes back to, exactly zero firms hit that bar.

Woohoo! We’re just about halfway through April and the Biglaw spring special bonuses are still hot news.

Last week, Boies Schiller Flexner announced their own special bonuses, and they’re on par with the market bonus rate, set by Davis Polk last month. Reaction from insiders has been pretty positive, as exemplified by this comment from a tipster:

We are all pretty pleased! Particularly so soon after COVID bonuses were paid!

Embarking on a legal career can be both challenging and rewarding. This comprehensive guide delves into law school, selecting a law firm, law firm life, the lateral market, and maintaining a successful career throughout. By understanding the intricacies of each aspect, you can make more informed decisions and excel in your legal profession.

Prioritize Your Law School Grades: Strong academic performance in law school is crucial for securing prestigious summer associate positions that can lead to permanent roles. Maintaining high grades throughout law school is important, as second- and third-year grades can impact lateral moves or in-house opportunities, especially for litigators. Prospective employers will request your transcript when applying for lateral attorney positions and, in some cases, even for partner candidates.

Consider a Federal Clerkship for Litigators: Aspiring litigators should consider the value of a federal clerkship, as it can enhance your legal career, particularly if you plan to work in a litigation boutique or prestigious law firm. A clerkship can be completed before starting your legal career or as a break from law firm work. For corporate associates, a clerkship may not hold the same weight and might not count towards your years of experience.

Choose a Prestigious Law Firm: The prestige of the law firm where you begin your career plays a significant role in your ability to lateral to another firm or move to a company. While smaller firms may offer better hands-on experience and training, prospective employers often prioritize candidates with experience in prestigious firms.

Select the Right Practice Area: Choosing the right practice area involves considering factors such as your personality, lifestyle, academic background, geographic preferences, and future goals. Assess whether you enjoy the substance of the work, can handle the personalities and work culture in a specific practice area, and have the necessary educational background and aptitude.

Understand Law Firm Structures: Understanding law firm structures, such as lockstep firms and two-tier partnership tracks, is essential when making career decisions. Lockstep firms may foster cooperation and have more institutional clients, while two-tier partnership tracks can offer opportunities to prove your worth as a business-building partner.

Manage Your Professional Development: Take charge of your professional development, as law firms may not always prioritize your long-term growth. Be proactive in seeking opportunities for growth and learning within the firm and externally, such as attending workshops, conferences, and networking events.

Stay Informed in Your Field: Stay updated on the latest firm and industry news to remain competitive and knowledgeable about your field. Be aware of emerging practice areas, firm financial performance, and potential opportunities for growth or lateral moves.

Prepare for the Lateral Market: The lateral market requires you to ensure your résumé, deal sheet, and firm bio are always up to date and easy to understand. Having a clear record of your experience and accomplishments can increase your chances of being contacted by recruiters and considered for lateral opportunities.

Invest Time in Interview Preparation: Invest time in preparing for interviews, researching the firm or company, and practicing common interview questions. Maintain a positive attitude during the interview process, avoiding negativity or complaints about current or former employers. Respond promptly to interview requests to convey interest and enthusiasm.

# Partners Shouldn't Require Associates To Complete Their Personal Chores
## Partners should refrain from requiring associates to complete their personal tasks that have nothing to do with legal work.

This column has already discussed a number of hassles associates often need to deal with while working at law firms. Indeed, associates must usually conform to [archaic notions about the workplace](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/partners-shouldnt-expect-associates-to-be-in-the-office-at-9-each-morning/), and are sometimes [hazed during the first few years they work at a firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/hazing-is-prevalent-at-many-law-firms/). Associates at many law firms also need to complete personal chores for partners that have absolutely nothing to do with the practice of law. Although some partners may view themselves as Miranda Priestly-like figures who can order associates to complete personal chores, partners should refrain from requiring associates to complete their personal tasks that have nothing to do with legal work.

When I was an associate in Biglaw, I felt like I had hit the jackpot. Only a small fraction of law school graduates secure spots in Biglaw, and as an associate at a large firm, I was in a better financial situation than most people my age. This sentiment was definitely undercut by the pecking order of the firm at which I worked, which required associates to “kiss the ring” in order to advance in the organization. Kind of like that movie The Pursuit of Happyness, associates needed to be ready to complete personal tasks of the partners in order to curry favor with the brass and hopefully secure their blessing when it came time to be reviewed or considered for advancement.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
On more than one occasion, I was asked to get coffee by a partner. I was fine with completing this task, but I was unsure why the partners couldn’t just get up and head to the Keurig machine themselves, since it was pretty easy to whip up a cup o’ Joe. At least one time that I can remember, a partner also tasked me with getting him lunch. I had already eaten lunch myself, so I had to make a separate trip just to pick up this partner’s meal.

Thankfully, the partner told me to get money from his secretary for the lunch so that I did not need to go out-of-pocket in order to secure his meal. I remember walking over to the restaurant and walking back, frustrated that I had endured three years of law school, the bar exam, and other crucibles just to be the boss’ errand person. Thankfully, the partner seemed pleased with me when I arrived back at the office with his lunch.

A few minutes later, the partner came into my office while munching on a sandwich that I had just picked up for him. He wanted to talk about a project that I was working on, and he apparently did not even have time to put down his sandwich. While he was talking, a part of his sandwich landed on the carpet of my office! This definitely added insult to injury, since I had to grab a napkin off of my desk after the partner left and clean up the food I had just bought for him.

Another time, some other junior associates and I were tasked with running the March Madness pool at our office. Shortly before the deadline to submit brackets through the internet-based system we were using, a partner came to me with handwritten brackets for himself and his family members. I then spent an hour or two translating these handwritten submissions into the system.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In order to do this, I had to use each of my personal email addresses to set up new accounts for all of these friends and family members of the partner. To this day, I still get spam email to my personal email addresses that I think are a result of these efforts. If I recall correctly, I even had to contribute my own money to the March Madness pool until the partner paid me back for the submissions made by his friends and family members. I have absolutely no idea why these folks could not make their submissions through the easy-to-use online system we were using to run the pool, but because partners viewed junior associates as their errand people, I got tasked with performing this role myself.

I think partners in Biglaw are more guilty of making associates complete personal chores than managers at other types of firms. Biglaw partners know that associates owe their big paychecks and their lifestyles to them, and they likely feel more enabled to order associates to complete their own personal chores. When you pay associates lower salaries, there is less of an expectation that attorneys will go above and beyond to please their bosses, such as completing personal tasks of the partners.

It should be noted that other attorneys have told me many (extremely entertaining) examples of associates completing personal chores for partners, but in order to preserve the confidentiality of those who told me their stories, I won’t mention them here. I hope people will share their own experiences on social media posts related to this article, or email me directly about their stories. Many attorneys I know have their own horror stories about completing personal chores for partners, and I’d love to learn about the experiences of others.

Before someone accuses me of being a “snowflake” online, I don’t think that partners ever crossed any lines with ordering me to complete personal chores (although, some of the stories I’ve heard from others definitely do!). However, just because associates are at the bottom of the law firm hierarchy does not mean that they should be required to complete personal chores for the partners. Unless you work for a boss like the one depicted in The Devil Wears Prada, partners should only require associates to complete legal work as part of their law firm jobs.

The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) director Craig Leen [told Biglaw he was coming for them](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/trump-administration-warns-biglaw-to-improve-diversity/), and that’s exactly what happened. Back in April of 2019, Leen told legal industry representatives at a town hall meeting that his office was concerned about issues of diversity and representation at law firms. As a result of a probe into diversity in Sidley’s summer associate program, the Biglaw giant will now offer, inter alia, additional internships and scholarships to diverse candidates.

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1317548) Law360, the OFCCP’s claims against Sidley largely boil down to a failure to maintain and track employment data and to analyze it for bias:

The OFCCP alleged Sidley failed to accurately track race, ethnicity and gender data for applicants to its summer associate program and that this prevented the agency from analyzing its hiring, according to a portion of the agreement discussing the agency’s claims. The firm also failed to preserve personnel or employment records for staff in its Los Angeles office, and did not analyze its “total employment process” to root out “impediments to equal opportunity” within its bonus program for associates at its New York and Los Angeles offices in certain years, the OFCCP said. Sidley denies these allegations.

To settle the claims, as stated above, the Biglaw firm will offer more internships and scholarships to diverse candidates, which is valued at ~$150,000. Additionally, Sidley will look at partnerships with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities and other “organizations with established internship programs.” The firm will “expand its already robust outreach” to diverse law students, specifically by providing job postings to and seeking applications from historically Black colleges and universities and the Asian Pacific Islander American Association of Colleges and Universities.

To settle the tracking claim, Sidley will train its Los Angeles-based office staff and share job openings with “organizations serving diverse communities.” Regarding the bonus allegations, Sidley will assess compensation annually for any disparities based on gender, race, or ethnicity. They’ll also file a a progress report at the end of 2021.

# World's Largest Law Firm Lays Off 20+ Partners
## The culling of this firm's enormous herd has begun...

About a month ago, after Dentons [cut 60 positions](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/nationwide-layoff-watch-60-positions-across-22-u-s-offices/) across 22 offices, we predicted that more Biglaw layoffs would be coming soon, but we bet you didn’t think that partners would be affected before associates. This is what’s been happening at the world’s largest law firm since January, and according to several sources, U.S.-based partners have been affected.

What’s the cause of the latest round of cuts at Dentons? The firm has apparently missed its budget for two years running, and those partners who didn’t measure up have been kicked to the curb. The [Am Law Daily](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202783875690) has more information on the layoffs:

[F]ormer lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said profits had been tamped down by poor revenue collection and high operational expenses shouldered by the U.S. partnership, including millions of dollars in salary and bonuses that went to the firm’s global management and staff.

“This year’s unhappiness was last year’s unhappiness compounded,” said one lawyer who recently left the firm.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The firm’s 90-day departure period — which makes it easier for affected lawyers to find jobs elsewhere — makes it almost impossible to be able to distinguish which partners were forced out and which ones left Dentons voluntarily. That being said, some partners who were canned last month are still listed on the firm’s website. Per the report from Am Law, some of the partners who are currently in limbo are biding their time out of the firm’s New York, Chicago, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C. offices.

When asked for details about partners in the U.S. who were recently laid off, Dentons declined to comment: “We do not comment on the specifics of our partner review process, though, as is the case with virtually every law firm, there is a regular review where the current and future needs of our clients are considered.”

We fear even more cuts are coming in Biglaw. If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) or text us (646-820-8477). Thank you for helping us to bring transparency to an often opaque profession.

# Did The Pandemic Break The Cravath System?
## Is Cravath about to go on a lateral hiring spree?

Well, the pandemic changed a lot in Biglaw. The biggest firms saw increased profitability, but that came at a cost — notably more billable hours for associates. This sparked[ fierce competition in the lateral associate market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/). Firms looking to retain their talent pool started throwing money at associates in the form of special bonuses. When that didn’t prove enough incentive, raises ruled the Biglaw market.

But how does this whole background play at Cravath?

Remember, Cravath fancies itself different than the rest. The Cravath system is legendary in these parts and it’s all about home-grown talent. In describing their own hiring process,[ Cravath’s website boasts](https://www.cravath.com/careers/legal-hiring/recruiting/hiring-process.html) explicitly that they do not hire attorneys tainted by other Biglaw firms:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Particularly because we do not hire associates laterally, it is very important to us that we make offers to candidates who have the potential to excel in our challenging environment, and equally important that those who accept our offers do so because they believe Cravath is the right place for them.

And before they eventually matched the Davis Polk scale, [we speculated](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2021/06/associate-pay-jumps-to-205k/) that, in order to keep mid-senior associates at the firm, Cravath might go above market for those über valuable associates — just like [they did in 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/). Of course, [they didn’t make that play](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cravath-raises/). But it doesn’t mean they’re doing nothing.

An eagle-eyed Above the Law tipster [spied](https://careers-cravath.icims.com/jobs/2548/attorney-talent-recruitment-manager/job) a job opening at the firm for Attorney Talent Recruitment Manager. Hmmmm, the role “will be involved in many aspects of recruiting, with a focus on lateral attorney hiring.”

That is definitely a new turn for Cravath. More details on the position’s lateral focus:

Lateral Hiring

- Managing the recruitment of all lateral attorneys in both our New York and London offices;
- Collaborating with Firm management to identify lateral attorney needs, drafting job descriptions, and liaising with search firms and candidates to identify candidates who align with the needs of the Firm;
- Cultivating and maintaining strong relationships with leading search firms and conveying the Firm’s hiring needs;
- Communicating with stakeholders on status of market pertaining to lateral searches and providing regular updates as it relates to compensation, benefits, Cost of Living Adjustment and market trends;
- Reviewing applications, coordinating interviews, facilitating reference checks, offering decisions and terms and executing offer letters;
- Regularly reviewing and updating search firm agreements based on updates to Firm policies or competitive market trends;
- Verifying placement fees and processing payments;
- Collaborating with the Legal Personnel team and the Office of the General Counsel on the conflicts checks process, and any other policy questions;
- Collaborating with the Legal Personnel team to create a program for smooth integration of hires into the Firm; and
- Conducting lateral attorney orientations.
Cravath has not returned our request for comment, so who knows exactly what a lateral hiring spree would even look like at the firm. So, it’s too early to start bombarding the firm with lateral associate resumes… but maybe start brushing them up, just in case.

Good afternoon guys and GHOULS! It’s that time of fear where we put on our homage to the old Tales from the Crypt host’s penchant for groan-inducing scary puns. This started as a tribute to the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror credits but also owes a debt to the great work over at Deadspin of turning the corpse of former Oakland boss [Al Davis into a Cryptkeeper spoof](https://deadspin.com/how-the-fuck-did-so-many-teams-pass-on-patrick-mahomes-1829974377). If you have even a passing interest in the NFL and aren’t reading that, then you need to reassess your priorities.

So here we go with a list of Biglaw firm names for your Halloween pleasure:

Biglaw has done well — really, really well — in spite of the ongoing pandemic. In fact, the largest law firms in America have done so well that many of them are in the process of handing out millions of dollars’ worth of special bonuses to their hardworking associates. But are there any firms that are willing to do more and increase salaries along with those bonuses?

The last time we saw a salary raise was in 2018, when the majority of Biglaw firms increased their base pay for associates to $190K. Earlier this spring, [DLA Piper increased base pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/dla-piper-2021-salary-raise/) for its associates in some offices, and we wondered whether others would follow in the firm’s footsteps, and now, it looks like that day has come.

Back in June 2018, Am Law’s #51 firm Alston & Bird — which brought in $835,865,000 gross revenue in 2019 — matched the prevailing market rate salaries for [all of its major offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/big-player-in-smaller-market-joins-the-raise-train-with-a-catch/) (New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, and Dallas). More than a year later, associates in the firm’s Charlotte office [received raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/forget-bonuses-these-associates-just-got-raises/) as well. Here’s what that salary scale looks like:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

1st Year: $190,000
2nd Year: $200,000
3rd Year: $220,000
4th Year: $255,000
5th Year: $280,000
6th Year: $305,000
7th Year: $325,000

According to a [recent report](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/23/alston-bird-amid-busy-lateral-hiring-year-boosts-profits/) about the firm’s finances, both its revenue and profits increased in 2020, with December being the “busiest month in the firm’s history—exceeded only by work in January.” Now, Alston & Bird is quite literally sharing the wealth with associates outside of major markets in the form of salary increases, and across the nation in the form of special bonuses. (This is probably a good way for the firm to make up for skipping out on associate appreciation bonuses.)

Elizabeth Price, the firm’s chief legal talent partner, said of the raises, “This scale reflects current trends and recognizes that, as a top tanked Am Law firm with complex matters and sophisticated clients around the globe, our associates represent he best talent in our profession.” This is what the new salary scale and special bonuses look like at Alston & Bird (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/alston-bird-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

Base compensation changes will be effective as of June 1 and will appear in June 15 paychecks. Associates must bill an annualized 1950 hours to receive special bonuses, which will be paid out on June 30 and December 31.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm who just got a big raise, and congratulations to everyone who will be receiving special bonuses. Associates are truly happy at the firm, and this is something we absolutely love to see.

###[ClauseBase](https://www.clausebase.com/)
Founded: 10/1/2018.

Headquarters: Leuven (HQ) and Antwerp, Belgium.

Elevator pitch: ClauseBase is a contract drafting platform that allows lawyers to turn their clauses into intelligent and reusable clauses and manage them in a clause library. From there, they can build contracts by stacking clauses on top of each other like building blocks, with ClauseBase ensuring internal consistency in terminology, grammar, styling, cross-referencing, and much more. The software also allows users to transform intelligent templates into a Q&A-style interview for easy contract generation.

How we’re unique: Instead of automating entire templates, as traditional document automation software does, ClauseBase looks at the individual building blocks that make up a document. This approach allows you to not only build templates for automation in a traditional Q&A format, but also to create bespoke documents by stacking clauses on top of each other. ClauseBase also lets you upload your house style to the platform so that every document’s styling is consistent, eliminating the typical battle with MS Word.

Demo video (if any): [https://vimeo.com/398581600](https://vimeo.com/398581600).

Target customer: Law firms and in-house legal departments.

Pricing: License subscription.

###[Della](https://www.dellalegal.com/)
Founded: 6/1/2018.

Headquarters: Della has offices in London (HQ) and Paris.

Elevator pitch: Simple to set up and easy to use, Della is supplanting established contract analysis and review tools, by offering lawyers an intuitive way to review contracts. Using proprietary AI, Della allows lawyers to ask questions about their contracts, in plain English (and other languages), and get clear answers. Della learns every time you use it and recognizes that lawyers don’t think about contracts in terms of “extracting clause X or Y,” they just want to find the answer to a query. Quickly.

How we’re unique: Traditional contract review focuses on clause detection and data extraction. Della focuses on the questions we want to ask of our contracts, allowing users to focus on legal work, not paperwork or tech. It takes 10 minutes for a new user to start using Della. Our models learn directly from any interactions, allowing users to review docs faster every time. Powered by massive language models, Della reduces time-to-value, while ensuring the use of a sophisticated tool is achievable for smaller firms.

Demo video (if any): Multilingual demo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdT6anQM8iU&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdT6anQM8iU&feature=youtu.be); teaser video: [https://youtu.be/W-WgvZnUTs0](https://youtu.be/W-WgvZnUTs0).

Target customer: Law firms and in-house legal departments, who need to speed up the manual review of contracts, either historically during an audit or pre-signature. That includes law firms of any size, as our AI can be used by anyone to help them save time. The smallest law firm currently using Della has 12 lawyers.

Pricing: Della operates on a SaaS model basis for most customers. Law firms can buy Della for one-off projects, but after trying Della, many want to benefit from the way that our system learns, so tend to buy a flexible subscription for a given number of documents a month. Corporates can buy the system on a per-user basis.

Outside funding: $1M – $5M in outside funding.

Traction: Our platform only launched in January 2020, but we are already being used by small and large law firms across multiple countries and several large multinational corporations. Those partners range in size from top UK and European law firms to smaller boutique providers and enterprise organizations. Earlier this year (2020), we launched a partnership with Wolters Kluwer to provide Della to their contract management platform customers.

###[Legal Karma](https://legalkarma.org/)
Founded: 2/26/2020.

Headquarters: Austin, Texas.

Elevator pitch: Legal Karma accelerates law firms’ most important client interactions. We build client portals that allow lawyers to assign tasks/build work flows for clients, provides a “case tracker” for clients to stay in the loop on their matter, and automate any document or form like a TurboTax for law. Plus, law firms can sell their legal services online with a menu of options. We are a client-centric portal. This isn’t your place to manage your matter internally.

How we’re unique: Most folks focus on client interaction from the perspective of CRM or how best they can manage their matter internally. Legal Karma is a client-centric tool that sits on top of any law practice, litigation-centric or contract-centric.

Demo video (if any): N/A.

Target customer: Law firm owners or support staff at a firm sized 1-50 for now. We have enterprise visions, but are targeting these folks now.

Pricing: $99 a month for a law firm membership. Unlimited attorneys/staff seats.

Outside funding: No outside funding.

Traction: We officially launched in October 2020. We have a dozen folks in the app with a line of 30 other folks waiting to be onboarded. We’re moving slowly as the app is new, and we want to provide an elegant user experience. The competitive pricing and app value are clear. Another proof point: Our users want to be investors in our tool.

###[Merlin Digital Magic](https://www.merlindm.com/)
Founded: 3/15/2019.

Headquarters: Denver, Colo., and Coimbatore, India.

Elevator pitch: We build software for investigations, discovery, and compliance, combining the power of AI and cloud computing with our own digital magic to make search smarter, review easier, and discovery more affordable. Our software helps people easily find the information they need — without mastering complex search syntax. We created Sherlock, the world’s first AI-powered digital document bloodhound. It works like Pandora, only when you click thumbs up, it finds great documents rather than great music.

How we’re unique: Our software, Merlin Integrated Search, is the first to combine keyword and investigative (Sherlock) search in a secure cloud platform and offer True Cloud Pricing allowing users to pay by the day, the week, the month, or longer with discounts for one- and three-year resource engagements.

Demo video (if any): [https://youtu.be/j0ce9NkuOi0](https://youtu.be/j0ce9NkuOi0).

Target customer: Investigators, lawyers, legal departments, government agencies, and companies with large document populations.

Pricing: We plan to be the first to offer True Cloud Pricing, allowing clients to use our investigations and discovery platform on their own terms, e.g., by the day, week, month, or longer, choosing the resources needed for their purposes.

Outside funding: No outside funding.

Traction: Merlin has grown substantially in size in its second year. We expect sales will take off with the release of Sherlock and Merlin Integrated Search, which will be the first AI-powered search and investigations platform delivered securely via the cloud on a pay for what you need basis.

###[Motionize](http://motionize.io/)
Founded: 8/16/2019.

Headquarters: New York; Omaha, Neb.

Elevator pitch: Motionize’s intuitive design and navigation leads you through the document automation and creation process seamlessly. We help lawyer’s save up to 80% of their nonbillable time.

How we’re unique: Our intuitive system takes your existing documents, and our AI programs them for you. Also, unlike any other system, we have complete compatibility with Microsoft word documents and allow users to edit them with full end-to-end encryption in the cloud.

Demo video (if any): [https://youtu.be/WIlxxtO0Z9U](https://youtu.be/WIlxxtO0Z9U).

Target customer: Law firms under 50 attorneys.

Pricing: $60 per seat, plus optional consulting fees for document set up.

Outside funding: No outside funding.

Traction: In a mere fourteen months Motionize developed one of the most advanced, technically sophisticated document automation platforms. Already piloted with three major law firms and growing new customer subscriptions at the rate of 200% month over month, Motionize is one of the most exciting new startups to come out of the LexisNexis Accelerator.

###[Painworth](https://www.linkedin.com/company/painworth)
Founded: 5/1/2019.

Headquarters: Edmonton.

Elevator pitch: Painworth helps people calculate, manage, and settle personal injury cases.

How we’re unique: We serve end users directly and broker fast settlements and arbitration that cut through unnecessary legal hoops.

Demo video (if any): N/A.

Target customer: Consumers with a personal injury case, law firms, and insurance companies.

Pricing: SaaS licensing.

Outside funding: Less than $1M in outside funding.

Traction: Within one year, we have already been approached about acquisition. We have become the world’s largest tool of our kind despite only having bootstrapped growth. Provisional patents filed, and we were awarded some financial grants which allowed us to grow and gain the attention of LexisNexis, several national insurers, the nation’s largest litigation financer, a major international candy company, and the UK government.

###[Prelimine](https://www.prelimine.com/)
Founded: 7/1/2019.

Headquarters: Arlington, Va.

Elevator pitch: Prelimine builds products that liberate litigators from procedural, formulaic, and repetitive tasks. Our first product, LitKit, targets tasks that waste litigators’ time while drafting briefs and other legal documents –- exhibit numbering, transferring redactions, or copy-pasting form language for discovery responses and complaints.

How we’re unique: Prelimine focuses on litigators and the tasks that pull them away from their substantive work. We are not trying to disrupt or reinvent legal practice, but meet litigators where they work (in Microsoft Word) and offer small solutions to make their lives easier. The experience of our co-founder, a big law senior litigation associate, and her colleagues led to the building of Prelimine –- as the solutions for their daily annoyances were not being addressed by the legal tech market.

Demo video (if any): N/A.

Target customer: Law firms of all sizes are our target customer; our users will likely be junior and midlevel attorneys, paralegals, and word processing.

Pricing: Enterprise-wide licensing based on law firm size. 

Outside funding: No outside funding.

Traction: LitKit just wrapped up beta testing and will launch in January 2021. Since our testers’ feedback usually concluded in, “Can I keep it?” we extended the beta licenses for many of our testers through January when their law firms will be able to purchase a license to the release version of the application. Some of our testers already convinced their firms to complete the purchase in January.

###[Spectacles](https://spectaclesreader.com/)
Founded: 4/3/2019.

Headquarters: Bloomfield, N.J.

Elevator pitch: Spectacles patent-pending technology displays all terms defined in a document in an interactive side-panel so you can see what matters while you read. No flipping pages, no multiple document windows, no searching for definitions. Spectacles brings the definition to you. Just highlight the word and click, Spectacles will handle the rest.

How we’re unique: Our patent-pending technology makes reviewing even the most sophisticated and complex legal and finance documents a breeze. Never hunt through indexes or multiple pages of a contract again. Just highlight and click, Spectacles will bring the definition to you.

Demo video (if any): [https://youtu.be/QBHS–Je06c](https://youtu.be/QBHS--Je06c).

Target customer: Big law (multi-national AmLaw law firms); investment banks, private equity funds, private credit funds; small/medium sized law firms; and regulatory agencies.

Pricing: Software-as-a-service: Basic: $25 per month per user. Premium: $40 per month per user. Sell both bulk subscriptions to enterprises and individual subscriptions to individual consumers.

Outside funding: No outside funding.

Traction: We are currently in discussions with large multinational law firms.

###[Syntheia](https://www.syntheia.io/)
Founded: 5/22/2018.

Headquarters: Sydney, Australia (HQ), and New York, N.Y.

Elevator pitch: Syntheia is a knowledge platform for lawyers. We make it easy for lawyers to do their best work by providing them with useful information at the right time and in the right place.

Our software turns legal expertise and long documents into bite-sized and reusable machine learning models and text. These models and text plug into multiple use-case specific applications — including for AI-assisted document review, automating clause bank creation, and recommending drafting in Microsoft.

How we’re unique: There are five key differentiators:

- Our natural language processing technology is capable of learning new legal concepts from 3 to 5 examples;
- Our machine analyzes documents at a granular level, starting with document layout analysis;
- Our software is deployed privately to law firms, so data is never shared;
- Our applications are designed to fit existing workflows, but share learnings across them; and
- We aim to fill the gaps left by incumbents, rather than challenge them head-on.
Demo video (if any): [https://youtu.be/6TLHFypFnMc](https://youtu.be/6TLHFypFnMc).

Target customer: Our target customers are primarily medium to large law firms. However, our software is also suitable for in-house legal teams and small law firms.

Pricing: We charge an annual license fee for our software. Our pricing model depends on the number of applications and seats desired by a customer.

Outside funding: No outside funding.

Traction: We came out of stealth in July 2020. As of November 2020, we have commenced pilots with one EU company, one US law firm, and two AU law firms.

###[TermScout](https://termscout.com/home)
Founded: 5/18/2018.

Headquarters: Denver, Colo.

Elevator pitch: TermScout reviews, rates, and compares B2B software contracts based on customer favorability so that software buyers can quickly understand what they’re being asked to sign and so software vendors can better understand how their contracts compare.

How we’re unique: We are the world’s first objective contract rating agency. While we’re building our initial business in the B2B software contract space, our model is applicable to any contracts that are used on a one-to-many basis (e.g. privacy policies, employment agreements, leases, insurance contracts, and more). Our model produces high-quality contract reviews, comparisons, and ratings at extremely competitive pricing.

Demo video (if any): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cvOPQALMg&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cvOPQALMg&feature=youtu.be).

Target customer: Commercial lawyers at large companies and law firms.

Pricing: Ridiculously affordable access to all of our data on a subscription basis (i.e., content as a service).

Outside funding: $1M – $5M in outside funding.

Traction: We work with a handful of Fortune 500 companies, have raised $1.9 million in outside investment, won the Global Legal Hackathon 2018 (then called LexLucid), and went through the LexisNexis Legal Tech Accelerator and Techstars Boulder accelerator.

###[Trokt](https://www.trokt.com/)
Founded: 1/1/2013.

Headquarters: Des Moines, Iowa.

Elevator pitch: Thumbprinter protects vital files from fakes, forgeries, or fraud by instantly validating any file’s digital originality. As files continue to rapidly move from place to place — and cyber attacks accelerate — Trokt Thumbprints provide “anchors of truth” that prove a file’s validity even if its chain of custody is lost. Our Thumbprinter app can help anyone from sole practitioners to large firms, offering third-party file validation that holds up in any court across the developed world.

How we’re unique: We are unique because our focus has been on creating world class security built for the “80-year-old lawyer test” — any lawyer can download, setup, and protect their files in less than five minutes.

Demo video (if any): Quick Overview: [https://youtu.be/VjR5D1dwGq8](https://youtu.be/VjR5D1dwGq8). Demo: [https://youtu.be/J62V8TsJL0g](https://youtu.be/J62V8TsJL0g).

Target customer: Compliance lawyers, city governments, law firms, and local governments looking to protect official documents

Pricing: $1 per file for lifetime.

# Biglaw Partners, It's Time To Say Bye-Bye To Your Big Offices
## Ugh. Thanks a lot, COVID-19.

The majority of partners recognize there’s a lot of different things you can spend your money on as a law firm. Having an office that’s bigger than somebody else just because you’re a partner, I just don’t think most people are motivated by that anymore. There may be a lot of hubris in the legal profession, but I don’t think that’s what most people think of as a top priority.

— the leader of an Am Law 100 firm who asked to remain anonymous to discuss industry news, commenting on the fact that [Biglaw offices are going to be forever changed thanks to the pandemic](https://www.law.com/2020/09/17/the-covid-pandemic-could-kill-the-partner-office/) that drove attorneys and staff to work from home. “[I]t will be the rare firm that won’t go to uniform-size offices,” that leader added. Kenneth Wiesehuegel, a senior associate at architecture and design firm Gensler who works with Am Law 100 and 200 firms, had this to say about Biglaw firms shrinking their real estate footprints, “The bottom line is it comes down to money. Rent comes out of partner pockets, so are they willing to pay rent on their office if they’re really not spending their time there?”

Ever since New York confirmed its first official coronavirus infection on March 1, we knew it would only be a matter of time until community spread began. Just days later, the state confirmed its first community spread case of coronavirus — and person who was infected is a lawyer.

[NBC 4 New York](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/westchester-county-man-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-nys-1st-possible-community-spread-case-gov-cuomo/2310134/) has the details:

An attorney who lives in Westchester County and works in Manhattan is New York state’s second confirmed coronavirus case … the governor said Tuesday.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said an initial review of the 50-year-old man’s travels doesn’t suggest any travel to China or other countries at the nexus of the outbreak so authorities are looking at it as a possible case of person-to-person spread. He has been with his family in Westchester, so health officials are testing relatives and working to backtrace any other contacts for risk. That includes coordination with the schools his children attend.

The man, who has an underlying respiratory illness, experienced respiratory issues and was diagnosed at a hospital in the city on Monday, the first day the city was able to conduct such rapid testing locally, Mayor Bill de Blasio added. The man remains hospitalized in serious condition in Manhattan. At this point, authorities are working to trace how he got there from Westchester County, including whether he may have used mass transit.

It’s also been reported that the schools the lawyer’s children attend — SAR Academy and SAR High School, located in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx — closed today due to a “suspected case of coronavirus.”

Do you have any insights on who this lawyer is? Please please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Coronavirus%20Lawyer) (subject line: “Coronavirus Lawyer”) if you have any ideas.

UPDATE (2:35 p.m.): Sources say this fellow works for a small firm. It’s been reported that [seven people](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/westchester-county-man-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-nys-1st-possible-community-spread-case-gov-cuomo/2310134/) from his firm are now being tested for coronavirus.

UPDATE (4:15 p.m.): A law student has been [put into self-quarantine](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/new-york-law-student-in-self-quarantine-after-contact-with-infected-lawyers-firm/) due to contact with the coronavirus patient’s law firm.

UPDATE (3/4): The lawyer has been identified. Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/new-york-lawyer-with-coronavirus-in-critical-condition/) for additional details.

In the meantime, there are steps you can take to try to protect yourselves from contracting COVID-19. Here are some recommendations from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html):

- Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
- Stay home when you are sick.
- Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
- Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
- If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
We know law firms have stepped up to protect their employees, but please make sure you take care of yourselves to avoid catching this illness. Stay safe out there, everyone.

Last week at the Rocket Aid virtual conference, someone addressed those of us on the media roundtable panel and said, “I’m tired of hearing about layoffs, is there any good news out there?” And the answer is… not much. But it’s not entirely nonexistent.

Over at Paul Weiss, the firm is tackling a number of projects related to the outbreak and placing themselves on the front lines of lawyerly efforts to bounce back. They served as an advisor and donated half-a-million dollars to [NYC Healthcare Heroes](https://www.nyp.org/healthcareheroes), a program focused on getting food and supplies to more than 100,000 healthcare professionals throughout New York City.

The firm also set up a [Coronavirus Relief Center](https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/transactional/coronavirus-covid-19-relief-center/practice-overview/relief-center) to act as a clearinghouse for government and non-profit relief programs. It’s really a tremendous undertaking — scrolling through its pages provides a road map for anyone looking for help out there with instructions on how to apply and answers to frequently asked questions.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.

According to the firm, almost half of the firm’s legal staff are engaged in COVID-related pro bono work right now, exactly what socially responsible firms should be doing right now. There are no doubt other Biglaw pro bono efforts underway right now that deserve trumpeting. Even firms not currently engaged in public interest initiatives are eyeing opportunities to assist once the immediate crisis subsides and the work of picking up the pieces begins.

Keep us in the loop about these efforts. We can’t necessarily catalog them all, but we’ll do our best to let people know what your firm is doing and help other firms looking for something to do by providing a model to follow.

As the questioner from last week suggested, we should have a little good news these days.

Jeff Sessions (Generated by JG JPEG Library)

Last week, Steve Bannon, Trump’s newly named chief White House strategist, told [The Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steve-bannon-trump-tower-interview-trumps-strategist-plots-new-political-movement-948747) the following:

“Darkness is good . . .Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power. It only helps us when they [alluding to “liberals and the media”] get it wrong. When they’re blind to who we are and what we’re doing.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Amid the “darkness,” we can add for the marijuana industry the appointment of Jeff Sessions as our new attorney general, which may give rise to a new battle regarding the [survival](http://www.citywatchla.com/index.php/the-la-beat/12153-trumping-pot-will-california-legalization-survive?_utm_source=1-2-2) of state-by-state marijuana legalization.

As I mentioned in my column last week on [Trump’s pot policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/icymi-trump-is-marijuanas-wildcard/), Sessions has been hostile to marijuana for a long time, and he’s a known drug war proponent. For the general flavor of Sessions talking about marijuana, go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3965&v=gg0bZvIS0K8) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KJSwgzP64).

Even though eight out of nine states voted yes to marijuana legal reform this election season, the appointment of Sessions as U.S. Attorney General is not very encouraging for the marijuana industry. The main question right now is where does that leave the state-legal marijuana industry? Just because Sessions doesn’t like marijuana and thinks only “bad people” use it does not automatically mean increased law enforcement action against marijuana users or marijuana businesses in states that permit them. Any federal attempt to roll back marijuana’s big gains would be incredibly unpopular politically, and it seems Sessions wants to focus on national security, terrorism, and immigration as his primary areas of attention. He may rant and rave against marijuana (and [poor Lady Gaga](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2014/01/29/jeff-sessions-marijuana-cant-be-safer-than-alcohol-because-lady-gaga-says-shes-addicted-to-it/#6deb76925354)’s alleged addiction to it), but actions speak loudest, and taking action against state-legal marijuana may be too costly even for Sessions.

Sessions is also limited in what he can do when it comes to medical marijuana. So long as the [federal spending bill](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/icymi-ninth-circuit-rules-doj-cant-stub-out-medical-marijuana-businesses/) continues to say that the federal government cannot spend money to interfere with state medical marijuana laws, Sessions should be hamstrung in his ability to take action in those states.

Still, that means recreational marijuana states and those who participate in recreational marijuana businesses should remain cautious. There is nothing stopping federal agents from raiding recreational marijuana businesses, as possession, distribution, and manufacture of marijuana remain illegal under federal law and the federal spending bills only apply to medical marijuana. The [Cole Memo](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/the-feds-are-blunting-legal-marijuana-in-america/) isn’t going to stop the Department of Justice, and Sessions can withdraw that memo with the stroke of a pen. Logistically, however, there simply are not enough federal agents or resources to enforce federal marijuana laws everywhere, but that won’t necessarily stop them from targeting big players to set an example.

Lastly, Sessions still has to go through the confirmation process. Last time he went through the process in trying to secure a federal judgeship, in 1986, he was [rejected](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/politics/jeff-sessions-racism-allegations/index.html) for having made racist comments. I doubt he will be rejected this time, but political pressure on Sessions to maintain his focus on real law enforcement and leave marijuana policy to the states can have a significant impact.

Even if Sessions is appointed as the new attorney general, the hope will be that he and the Department of Justice will have far bigger fish to fry than state-legal marijuana. But only time will tell. So, stay tuned.

There’s a reason Donald Trump has [a parking garage lawyer](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/trump-pals-worry-that-bad-lawyering-might-tank-his-doomed-lolsuits/) on an existential case for his business empire. The former president is infamous for [stiffing his lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/trump-stiffs-rudy-for-all-his-amazing-legal-services/) and, at this point, proximity to his brand is downright toxic for the sort of corporate clients that fill a firm’s coffers. That’s why [Biglaw partners hoping to represent Trump end up leaving their firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-partner-leaves-firm-to-represent-donald-trump-in-criminal-case/) because the rest of the partnership, for some reason, sees little value in attracting a lot of negative press, scorching more lucrative business relationships, and eventually not getting paid.

Which makes [this nugget from the District of Massachusetts docket](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/11/Trump-Nixon.pdf) (1:23-CV-12121-MJJ) all the more interesting because it seems as though [Nixon Peabody](https://www.nixonpeabody.com/) has gone where other Biglaw firms fear to tread and thrown the firm’s lot in with Donald Trump.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Does he think the fact that [everyone’s a winner at Nixon Peabody](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/08/nixon-peabody-this-is-not-a-love-theme-song/) bolsters his claim that he won the election?

Castro v. Galvin, technically versus Secretary of State Galvin and Donald Trump, is the Massachusetts version of the popular yet ultimately doomed liberal theory that the Fourteenth Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists holding federal offices should exclude Trump from appearing on the ballot. Appearing on behalf of Trump, Nixon Peabody partner [Brian T. Kelly](https://www.nixonpeabody.com/people/kelly-brian-t) moved to dismiss the case.

There are good reasons why this argument fails. And then there are incredibly stupid reasons. Former US Attorney General Michael Mukasey who has spent the last 20 years staking out increasingly embarrassing public legal takes like his law degree owed him money, argued that [the President can’t be “an officer” of the United States](https://www.wsj.com/articles/was-trump-an-officer-of-the-united-states-constitution-14th-amendment-50b7d26). Does the Constitution refer to the President as “an officer” of the United States? Yes. NINE FUCKING TIMES, in fact.

On the other hand, it’s unclear who gets to act upon that prohibition. Amendments aren’t necessarily self-executing and while its text might prove an actually valid reason for a future legislature to reject Electoral votes, it’s unlikely to give any individual citizen an avenue to keep someone off the ballot via lawsuit.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The Nixon Peabody motion takes a kitchen sink approach, offering both the good arguments and the silly one championed by Mukasey. Offering technical, lawyerball defenses of the former president still amounts to a terrible business decision for a firm, but it’s at least spinnable. “Look, we don’t endorse what he did, but we’re ‘standing up for standing'” is a message you can sell to nervous clients. It’s not like the brief tries to downplay January 6 or anyth… oh wait:

So “insurrection,” as understood at the time of the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, meant the taking up of arms and waging war upon the United States. At the time of Section Three’s enactment, the United States had undergone a horrific civil war in which over 600,000 combatants died, and the very survival of the nation was in doubt. As shown by the omission of the word “incitement” in Section Three, Congress did not intend that provision to encompass those who merely encouraged an insurrection, but instead limited its breadth to those who actively participated in one.

This is asinine. Yes, everyone alive in years following the Civil War thought of it as an insurrection, but that does not mean the public was obtuse enough to think the Civil War was the only insurrection that could ever exist. If one wanted to be needlessly textual, you could say the Fourteenth Amendment could’ve sought to disqualify “participants in the just concluded war between the states” but they didn’t because they fully understood the law to encompass future efforts to subvert the government. The brief also features a digression into how Brandenburg should govern the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In total, almost a third of the brief is spent blowing off January 6 or Trump’s role in it.

Just the sort of arguments that Fortune 500 companies love to see their law firms making!

Rumblings suggest that there are Nixon Peabody partners already calling for Kelly to step down over the matter to shield their books of business from the taint of Trump. Because obviously.

How does something like this happen? I guess he did [pardon one of their old partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/former-biglaw-partner-gets-a-trump-pardon/)… maybe they felt they owed him?

An unconfirmed report claims that this matter skirted the firm’s established incoming client procedure that would have undoubtedly put a stop to it before it hit the papers. In any event, one has to wonder where managing partner [Stephen D. Zubiago](https://www.nixonpeabody.com/people/zubiago-stephen-d) was in all this. Even if Zubiago had no prior knowledge of the representation, he knows about it now and the fact that this got filed with Nixon Peabody’s name all over it amounts to a severe business risk that someone should’ve been on top of. One tipster informed us that “no confidence” conversations have already begun among the partnership over this affair.

It doesn’t sound like everyone’s winning over there right now.

In general, most high-performing firms are trying to do two things at once in the current environment. They’re trying to be disciplined and pick up the pace on holding their attorneys accountable for meeting expectations on a multi-year basis, while also increasing their profitability in order to compensate higher-performing attorneys.

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/people/kent-zimmermann/), legal management consultant at the Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/25/layoffs-with-one-hand-and-group-hires-with-the-other-big-law-may-get-used-to-it/), on the likelihood that Biglaw firms will more frequently conduct layoffs in 2023. Zimmerman noted that it may now be easier for firms to perform layoffs due to the state of the economy than it was during the prior two years, when the legal sector was booming and bodies were needed to complete work.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I do believe women in the legal space will recognize this as another way that Husch Blackwell is uncommon and doing things differently. It’s a privilege to be a woman chief executive.

— [Jamie Lawless](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/jamie-lawless), incoming CEO at Husch Blackwell, commenting on her rise to the top as a woman in the law, in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/10/husch-adds-business-first-ceo-from-baker-mckenzie/). Lawless, a business professional who does not have a law degree, will be part of the firm’s virtual office, The Link, and will join [Catherine Hanaway](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/catherine-hanaway), the firm’s chair, during a “really an exciting time in the evolution of [the] firm.”

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

The U.S. economy has been steadily improving for the past several years. Although it’s hardly had a rocket strapped to its back, key economic indicators have been creeping upward steadily since the nadir of the Great Recession. Stock markets have climbed to [record altitudes](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/02/us-stocks-fourth-quarter-trump.html), the [unemployment rate is at 4.2%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm), and [consumer confidence is high](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/16/trump-is-telling-his-supporters-to-focus-on-the-economy/). By all accounts, the U.S. economic engine is building up steam.

But the picture isn’t so pretty for Biglaw.

[Recent reporting](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784499899/Can-Firms-in-The-Am-Law-51100-Keep-From-Falling-Further-Behind?slreturn=20170903171528) by the American Lawyer examined the 2016 financial performance of the Am Law 200, representing the largest law firms in the country. It found a stagnant scene. The top 50 name-brand firms have had anemic growth, and firms ranked from 51-100 actually saw a 1.3% decline in revenue, along with a profit-per-partner decline of 1.7% and profit-per-lawyer decline of 3.3%. Firms ranked from 101-200 have even bigger challenges, turning into the “[hollow middle](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202786574623/Exclusive-Report-The-2017-Am-Law-200?mcode=1202629935189&curindex=1)” of the legal market.

So why is this happening? It’s complicated. But distilled to the core, it’s the inevitable result of years of complacency. Much of the legal market is based on the same billable-hours revenue model that’s defined the practice of law for a century, and on the same partner-supported-by-a-raft-of-associates organizational structure that it seems has existed as long as the concept of large law firms.

Although the world has morphed since the bottom fell out in 2008, Biglaw has not. Legal-solutions providers that have been ready to adapt and seize control of the changing market are drinking the traditional firms’ milkshake. Niche firms that have figured out how to commoditize practices like labor and employment with low flat rates are sucking work from white-shoe firms like a Roomba. Alternative legal services companies like Axiom Law are carving out pieces of the traditional legal market space for themselves, and even technology-based platforms like LegalZoom are gobbling up market share from the incubator-based startup world. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest clients with the most leverage have either slashed what they’re willing to pay or taken the work entirely in-house. Just being a great lawyer is no longer a guarantee of a successful practice, or even a steady job.

The good ol’ days are gone, and they’re not coming back.

So what’s a Biglaw lawyer to do? For all the doom and gloom, there’s a roadmap that exists that offers large-firm attorneys a glimmer of hope. But it exists in the unlikeliest of places – in the dark recesses of a world where most firm lawyers have never thought to look: the plaintiffs’ bar. Yes, you read that right.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The lawyers with Biglaw’s answers aren’t any old “dirty shirt” plaintiffs’ lawyers; they live in a little-known subset of the bar my colleagues and I affectionately call the “pro-business plaintiffs’ bar.” Why pro-business? Because members of this informal bar are not only willing to represent business entities and owners as plaintiffs in contingent-fee cases, but also because they treat their practices as a business – a concept that countless firms have given lip service to but few actually employ.

The pro-business plaintiffs’ bar follows two guiding principles a modern firm needs to survive: innovation and discipline. As a lawyer who helps manage an exclusively [contingent-fee practice](https://lambergoodnow.com) in the halls of a 160+-lawyer, [130-year-old law firm](https://www.fclaw.com/), I’ve seen first hand the power of this bar, what it stands for, and the ideas it can generate.

When you’re on a contingent fee, with no guarantee anyone is going to pay your bill at the end of the day, you have to innovate. Even outside of the headline-grabbing trial technology world, more prosaic, less-sexy tech allows members of this bar to automate large swaths of the practice, eliminating time sinks and freeing up time to work on productive tasks. The bar is also at the forefront of innovative staffing solutions to ensure work is done by the people best suited for it — not just reflexively defaulting to sending work to junior associates solely because that’s how it was traditionally done. The pro-business plaintiffs’ bar is always hustling, always thinking, always getting better for one simple reason: their livelihoods depend on it.

In contrast to the pro-business plaintiffs’ bar, Biglaw is a graveyard for innovation. The law firm industry churns out lawyers who are insulated in bubble wrap from the business side of the profession. Business discipline takes a back seat to grinding hours. All too often, lawyers able to generate cash by putting their heads down miss out on learning about law firm economics. With many if not most lawyers going to law school to avoid dealing with entrepreneurial risk and balance sheets, Biglaw was a match made in heaven. But as the American Lawyer research above shows, that fairytale story has turned into a bad episode of “The Bachelor: After the Final Rose.”

A contingent fee-based practice also naturally instills a strong sense of discipline. This discipline starts with a relentless and regimented approach to business generation. When your lifeline isn’t the increasingly elusive institutional client that sends all of its work to your firm, there’s a sense of urgency to client development; every business interaction, every community event, every relationship turns into a rainmaking opportunity. Lawyers in well-run pro-business plaintiffs’ practices also scrupulously monitor every cent of case costs and time expended on a matter. Members of this bar have a powerful incentive to use time and resources wisely—exactly how hourly-paying clients want their attorneys to think.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The traditional law firm model incentivizes against this kind of discipline. Attorneys billing hourly rates may want to spend more time solving their clients’ problems, not less. Good firms, like the large firm I’m proud to be a part of, work hard to keep hours and costs low to best serve clients. But there’s truly nothing like make-it-or-break-it accountability to teach you how to figure out what resources and time a case truly needs to get its best possible result.

Let’s be honest: The Social Network had it right. A rapidly shrinking group of lawyers taking million-dollar-per-year profits isn’t cool. You know what is? A [billion dollars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5fJmkv02is). By unshackling itself from a more-hours-means-more-money business model, a firm can grow its income by orders of magnitude with well-chosen, well-executed alternative-fee matters.

Case in point: earlier this year Above The Law [reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-500-million-man-is-now-a-name-partner-at-this-litigation-powerhouse/) on the firm Kellogg Huber, which had recently made litigator David Frederick a named partner. Frederick’s contingency fee-based practice had brought in over half a billion dollars to the firm from a string of related cases, presumably off only a fraction of a fraction of that in resources expended. No matter how much you sacrifice your family, friends, and sanity, your $1,000/hour billing rate is never going to get you or your firm half a billion dollars and your name on the building.

So Biglaw friends, don’t despair. If you’re tired of watching your firm tread water and bleed clients, if you’re tired of collecting modest paychecks while waiting for the ax to fall, maybe it’s time to roll up your sleeves, get a bit gnarly, and start thinking like a pro-business plaintiffs’ lawyer.

Maybe it’s time to save Biglaw.

# Geopolitics And Legal Tech -- The Risk And Resilience Nexus For Corporates
## Headwinds are driving desire for corporate agility and adoption of legal tech.

The global COVID-19 pandemic, conflict in the Ukraine, rising inflation and interest rates, debt levels, and volatile food and fuel prices, among other things, are creating acute macroeconomic headwinds.

So it’s perhaps no surprise that corporate desire for greater agility and flexibility in response to geopolitical instability is the No. 1 factor considered to have the greatest potential impact on investment and adoption of legal tech solutions today.

This is according to proprietary research we at [Hence Technologies](https://hence.ai), in collaboration with research agency [Coleman Parkes](https://colemanparkes.com), conducted this year with more than 150 general counsel, chief legal officers, and heads of legal operations.

Notably, in this study, almost two-thirds of respondents (64%) identified their company’s need to more easily adapt and respond to today’s volatile and uncertain economic and political environment as one of the top five drivers for procuring legal tech solutions. That this factor ranked the highest overall — above using data for decision-making (57%) and cost savings (55%) — is particularly interesting. Since this study was conducted earlier this year, the world has arguably become more uncertain, and the need for agility has become even more acute.

Geopolitical Challenges Set To Endure

Corporates, governments, and other institutions struggling to respond to today’s persistent headwinds should get used to these conditions. While it may seem like the acute factors — for instance, Russia/Ukraine — could abate, in fact the tensions causing such disputes are structural.

In a recent report titled “How Global Companies Can Manage Geopolitical Risk,” McKinsey forecast that these challenges “will get worse” and that “in the next two decades, competition for global influence is likely to reach its highest level since the Cold War,” citing the U.S. National Intelligence Council’s report “Global Trends 2040: A More Contested World.”

As the U.S. has retreated from the global leadership role it held since the end of World War II, other countries are filling in the gap. The rise of China creates fault lines across geographies and issues that companies once viewed as settled for the time being — for instance, the status of Hong Kong and Taiwan. In January 2022, the Financial Times observed that “China’s rise to superpower status” was intensifying “the urge in Washington to decouple from its ‘strategic competitor’” and that “in 2022, the increasingly bipolar world that results from this basic dynamic is set to cause a host of geopolitical headaches for smaller powers and multinational corporations.” While there appears to have been a shift toward rhetoric of coexistence and compromise when China’s leader Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, the structural factors remain unchanged.

It is against this backdrop that spoilers like Russia attempt to make themselves relevant by striking out and forcing their agenda to the top of the news pages, not that dissimilar from North Korea testing nuclear weapons within 90 days of every U.S. election. These headaches, which knock on to supply chain issues and sanctions, are exactly the type of shocks to corporate five-year plans that companies must navigate and ultimately avoid.

Nurturing Greater Supply Chain Resilience — An Imperative For Corporates Today

A key part of the corporate effort to withstand today’s constantly changing political contours is investing in nurturing greater supply chain resilience. The logistics “bullwhip effect,” which distorts upstream supply chain planning due to shifts in demand, was starkly evident during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Now corporations across many, if not all, industries have faced similar supply chain challenges in the longer-term wake of Brexit, protectionist policy-making, sustained saber-rattling between the U.S. and China on trade, and turbulence from the Russia-Ukraine war.

Resilience Of Enterprises’ Legal Services Supply Chains Mission Critical Today

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Key to embedding such supply chain resilience is how a corporation harnesses inputs from knowledge providers such as accountants, public relations companies, recruiters, and, perhaps especially, lawyers. The large global law firms in particular play a pivotal role given they also advise governments and regulators worldwide on topics like the global pandemic, financial crises, state-level sanctions such as those imposed against Russia and corporate reorganizations that follow conflict escalation as seen in Ukraine, energy market reforms, and how corporations navigate the challenges, or grasp opportunities arising from, tax changes due to substantial fiscal gaps.

Technology Enhancing How Corporates Leverage External Knowledge Services

In today’s more digitally connected world, large enterprises are deploying advanced technologies to more efficiently and effectively manage their supply chains. Buyer/supplier relationships with knowledge providers, almost by definition, spawn high volumes of data and information. This, in turn, is intensifying demand within corporates for improvement in any decision-making that arises from the services being procured from law firms and, indeed, through the advisory services offered by accountancy firms, management consultancies, recruitment agencies, advertising holding companies and the like.

Yet Technology Is Also Presenting Competitive And Cyber Threats

Of course, the strategic role law firms play also make them an attractive target. We at [Hence Technologies](https://hence.ai) authored an [article](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/there-are-only-law-firms-that-have-been-hacked-and-those-that-will-be/) in this publication in August 2022 highlighting how “law firms are finding themselves as unique nodes under attack in a geopolitical environment with cross-cutting adversarial intentions,” further illustrating how fragile the legal services supply chain has become in an increasingly adversarial geopolitical context as well as how important it is that corporates ensure their relationships are as robust as possible.

When Buying Services From Law Firms, Knowledge Of Geographical Markets Key

Interestingly, from the study we conducted with the senior-most legal representatives of global enterprise, the top-rated option when respondents were asked to choose the “key areas of knowledge and understanding sought from external lawyers,” 89% rated “knowledge of the geographical markets their company (i.e. the corporate) serves” as “very/quite important.” When read casually, it might imply that in-house teams want to work with lawyers who know their geographies — this seems pretty basic and indeed might reduce itself to a desire for attorneys with the right country level credentials.

In fact, the point is deeper, which is that companies are looking for strategic legal partners who can advise them on the broader cross-currents affecting their business context. It’s no surprise, then, that major law firms like Dentons have invested heavily in building up geopolitical offers to help their customers see and navigate the full picture, [as we wrote about previously. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/the-4-reasons-every-law-firm-wants-to-do-geopolitics-and-how-to-know-who-to-trust/)This is particularly true as the geopolitical risks firms are facing are increasingly localized and in far-flung geographies.

Thus, it’s critical to be able to map the full footprint of an enterprise’s legal providers in order to understand if they actually have these capabilities. It would be time-consuming and futile to search one by one through all publicly available data to do so, and simply asking for references isn’t good enough when the risks one is facing are so micro that others may not have had that experience. That’s where legal tech software can come in, cataloging everything that’s knowable about law firms and surfacing it in real-time for decision-making.

Importance Of Transforming How In-House Legal Teams Buy From Law Firms

So while corporate investment and adoption of legal tech solutions forms just part of a corporation’s implementation of wider digital transformation strategies, legal tech solutions specifically are fundamental to global enterprise embedding greater agility, flexibility, and resiliency into their worldwide operations as they seek to better respond to geopolitical instability.

The challenges stemming from today’s flux in the global political environment are far from over and, if this is so, then now is the time for corporate leaders to drive transformation in the procurement of services from knowledge providers and, perhaps especially, bolstering how in-house legal departments buy-in support from external law firms and lawyers.

# Female Breadwinning In America

I’m Kate — wife, mom, and lawyer (not always in that order). In my nine years of practicing law, I’ve glowed up from a public defender to in-house counsel at a national company, a feat that would not have been possible without hard work and determination. But also completely inconceivable without the unwavering support of my husband, who gave up his dream career to support mine and eventually left the workforce entirely to stay home with our two kids.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
When we met over eight years ago, he and I were making roughly the same annual salary. That changed when I left the public defender’s office and started in private practice doing mostly civil litigation. During that time, I was a high billing, well-liked associate on the path to shareholder-dom at some unspecified time (private firm speak for “I worked A LOT”).  Then, in November 2019, I got pregnant with our daughter. Between morning (all-day) sickness for my entire pregnancy, the ever-demanding caseload, and a global pandemic, I was spent. At the same time, underperforming was not an option — our family relied on me to remain financially stable. Always one to buck the system, I was empowered by being the breadwinner.

After 12 weeks of maternity leave, I was so ready to return to work. I expected to jump right back in and pick up where I left off. That did not happen. I struggled. Month after month, I missed my billables, getting so far behind that it would be mathematically impossible to meet my yearly goal. As year-end approached, my anxiety was through the roof. By my firm’s standards, my billables were terrible. I knew there were repercussions for not meeting billable goals — docked pay, reduced hours, no bonus. Between a new house, my student loans, and a baby, a reduction in pay would have been difficult to navigate. Luckily for me, I worked for a firm (and a few specific shareholders near and dear to my heart) who saw me as more than my billable hour.

In that moment, I would have told you that my anxiety was solely related to failure and my bruised ego. However, a few years wiser and another baby later, I realized that the very thing that I was empowered by — carrying the financial burden for our family — almost broke me. I was torn between what society tells me a good mom should be and being the “all-in” lawyer that I worked so hard to become. I love my family and cherish the moments I have with them; but I also love being a lawyer. To this day, I hold my breath when I say that out loud. Do people think I regret having my kids? Do they think I am selfish? Am I a bad mom/wife? Is it possible to be a “career woman” and a good mom?

Somewhat recently, I saw a TikTok of a woman standing in her kitchen with the text: “My favorite part of being a ‘working mom’ is that I’ve literally never heard anyone use the term ‘working dad.’” For us working moms with spouses that stay home, there is another layer. When my male peers talk about their wives staying home with their kids, no one thinks twice about it. When I am inevitably asked what my husband “does” and I reply that he stays home with our kids, the reactions vary depending on the setting. Most often, I’d say it’s a mix between a flat, dripping with traditional gender norms “How does that work?” and a somewhat sheepish “That’s great!”

My mind then immediately goes to all the negative perceptions that society has of the “career woman.” Do “career men” experience this? Perhaps. But, chances are these men have friends in similar situations who can, whether they realize it or not, empathize with each other’s similar family setups. As a working mom with a stay-at-home spouse, I don’t have anyone in my life who is in a similar situation.  Notably, neither does my husband. When he takes our kids to the park, he is surrounded by stay-at-home moms. He worries if the kids make a friend at the park, how does he ask for the mom’s number without coming off as weird. Is it creepy to invite a mom and her kids over for a weekday playdate while the spouses are at work?

While I have worked on silencing the negativity, real or perceived, that comes with being a female breadwinner, I am still working through the emotions that come with having a stay-at-home husband. Will he resent me? Does he have enough support? Does he know how invaluable he is to our family? A day will come where no one will think twice about a career-driven mom and a stay-at-home dad. For those of us in that camp now, it can be lonely. Sometimes I come home from work and my husband is ready to pull his hair out. Those days, I feel guilty that he has to deal with being the default parent. On other days, I’m sitting in my office, and my husband sends a video of the baby using the walker for the first time. Those days, I’m sad that I missed another milestone but happy that my husband was there to support our kids.

No matter what kind of parent you are — working, stay at home, single, intergenerational — parenting is hard. Projecting traditional gender norms on families with different situations can have real consequences. Here’s to focusing more on raising empathetic, intelligent, caring humans, and less on how each family divides their responsibilities.

Kate Landis is in-house counsel for a national construction company where she fills her days reviewing contracts and putting out random fires. Although her days of public defending are long behind her, Kate is passionate about criminal justice reform and dreams of the day that she can retire and volunteer for the Innocence Project and/or Equal Justice Initiative. She and her husband have endeavored to raise their children, ages 3 and 10 months, to be compassionate, empathetic, and curious human beings in hopes that they can make this world a better place for all. Feel free to follow Kate on Instagram @mama.esq_ where she hopes to create a community for career parents to connect and share the joys and struggles of parenting.

Facebook recently made the big move to change its name to Meta as it pursues a broader market beyond social media and advertising. The name is drawn from “the Metaverse,” a digital reality cyberspace world where people and computers interact with each other. As humans live in the “real world,” people can enter this digital world to interact with others, and elements of this digital world can interact with people in the real world.

For many, this notion of a virtual world is pretty farfetched, and perhaps a passing fad; but in truth, we’ve learned to interact with computers and people digitally for years. Clicking on a mouse. Using AOL chat rooms. Dating through the Internet. Using the rear-view camera on your car. These are all experiences that have been prepping demand for an increasingly digital experience through the Metaverse.

While they fall into the genre of science fiction, popular movies like Disney’s “Tron” (1982 and 2010), the “Matrix” series, and Netflix’s “Free Guy” have made the understanding of deeper real world/virtual world interaction a part of pop culture. There is an entire generation that has grown up with games like “The Sims” and “Pokémon Go.” I remember watching my kids playing the “John Madden NFL” game nearly 20 years ago and being entertained by the life-like play on the screen — it was as enjoyable to watch as a real football game on TV. Today, the top gamer on Twitch, who goes by the name Ninja, [allegedly makes $95,000 a month](https://ftw.usatoday.com/lists/top-twitch-streamers-ninja-shroud) playing games like “Fortnite,” while his more than 28 million followers follow along as spectators and occasional competitors online.

Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement to build Meta — the seventh-largest market cap company in the world — is yet another indicator of the increasing influence that the virtual world is having on our society. From online gaming to digital currencies and everything in between, the rising prevalence of the Metaverse represents new frontiers for how individuals, organizations, and businesses can interact with each other — and that also means new issues and challenges for legal professionals to tackle.

While early, there is tremendous promise and opportunity for legal professionals as new types of issues surface in the virtual world.

Meta itself poses some interesting topics of discussion. For example, Zuckerberg is promising that individuals will have property rights that are transferable across platforms. Compare that to some online services where you lose all of your data (e.g., e-mails, gaming tokens) if you cancel service. This could potentially pose some challenges for some of its competitors.

Outside of Zuckerberg’s platform, here are some other questions for legal professionals to consider as the Metaverse at large continues to grow.

- Will property rights be regulated in the Metaverse? What might be the role of contract law?
- How will contracts be designed and executed? Will certain legal services be automated?
- Is it possible for property to be stolen (i.e., hacked) in the Metaverse? What kind of liability might exist? What might tort law look like in this context?
- Could disputes that are contained to the Metaverse and involve parties around the globe be resolved using alternative dispute resolution? Might that rise to a separate “Metaverse” legal system?
As the Metaverse expands, these are questions that leading-edge firms may need to consider. It is also likely that governments will begin to try to regulate interactions between the real world and the virtual world.

These developments could present a new frontier for smart contracts, too. Smart contracts use blockchain technology to implement the terms of an agreement, such as execution of payment terms for the purchase of property, liens on an asset, or a return policy. Smart contracts would seem to be a natural, automated solution for buying, selling, and fulfilling products in the Metaverse — and while the legal status of smart contracts is far from established, the growth of the Metaverse could present opportunities for wider use of them.

While early, there is tremendous promise and opportunity for legal professionals as new types of issues surface in the virtual world — and those issues are likely to put pressure on legal professionals across several different practice areas. We may still be a generation away from the Metaverse being large enough to be mainstream, but a stronger vision of the future can serve as a north star for innovation and opportunity.

# Why A Conflicts Check Should Be Step One In A Partner’s Lateral Move
## Despite the general understanding that conflicts are an important factor, many law firms wait until the end of the lateral process to run conflicts, even when the candidate is a partner.

Any experienced lawyer knows that making a lateral move to a new firm requires a conflicts check. You have surely heard about lawyers whose attempt to lateral was blocked when a client refused to grant a waiver. But despite the general understanding that conflicts are an important factor, many law firms wait until the end of the lateral process to run conflicts, even when the candidate is a partner.

Waiting to run conflicts until after starting interviews and vetting LPQs is an inefficient practice that leads to unnecessary frustration for both lateral partner candidates and firms. A sophisticated legal recruiter doesn’t need to wait to help in the process and is cognizant of conflicts from the beginning of the process given their experience, databases, and knowledge. By taking time upfront to examine the partner’s book of business and the client list of the partner’s current firm, a recruiter can proactively determine which target firms are a nonstarter due to conflicts before a firm even runs conflicts typically closer to the end of the hiring process. This helpfully narrows the set of targets and positions the candidate should consider at the start of the process before devoting time and resources to devoting attention to opportunities that are nonstarters.  

Conflicts are a key initial filter

There are several factors to consider when drawing up a list of firms that could be a good fit for a partner lateral candidate. For example, are the firm’s billing rates compatible with the rate the candidate currently charges? Will the firm’s profits per partner and [partner compensation structure](https://laterallink.com/evolving-partnership-economics-the-equity-and-non-equity-models-are-starting-to-blur/) match the candidate’s expectations? Would the firm provide a strong platform for the candidate’s practice? Does the firm operate in the city where the candidate lives? Just as you would eliminate certain firms at the outset based on these filters, you should also eliminate firms that are a poor fit due to conflicts. 

Conflicts come in many forms

When lawyers hear the word “conflict,” they are likely to think first of legal conflicts. Obviously, if a litigation partner’s current firm represents Samsung, it would be unwise to pitch that candidate to a firm that represents Apple, given the history of claims and counterclaims between the two companies. Client waivers can sometimes be a solution to legal conflicts, but companies vary in their willingness to grant a waiver. Savvy recruiters know which clients notoriously refuse to waive conflicts and will apply that knowledge in constructing the target list. Good luck sourcing a conflict waiver if you are adverse to Chevron.    

Although legal conflicts are critically important, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Conflict considerations also extend to broader business issues. Firms typically do not represent two companies that are fierce competitors in the same sector, whether or not there is a formal legal conflict based on recent litigation. If a material client of a lateral partner practice directly competes with an institutional client of another firm or even a major client of an important decision-maker at that firm, the candidate is most likely not a fit for that firm. Think Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Apple and Samsung. American Airlines and United. Or even the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox.  

Even where there is no legal conflict or direct competition between the candidate’s book and a firm’s current clients, it is important to consider whether future conflicts are likely to arise. For example, if the candidate represents clients that have a track record of suing banks, a firm that represents a major bank as an institutional client is a poor strategic fit. Similarly, a candidate with a book that includes insurance policyholders will not be a fit for a firm that regularly represents insurers. Over time conflict considerations become more apparent but it’s not a subject where Cliff Notes has a special edition.     

The rise in partner mobility has increased conflicts 

In decades past, when partners were lifers at their firms and clients were more likely to concentrate their business with a single outside law firm, conflicts were less prevalent. Needless to say, the industry has changed, with partners switching firms more frequently than ever before. Partners who lateral tend to bring their clients with them, as a client’s loyalty to the relationship partner often exceeds its loyalty to the firm. This has contributed to a broader trend of clients spreading work among a larger number of outside firms. And unfortunately, that makes conflicts an ever more important factor in the conversation that should be addressed upfront.  

As a consequence of rising partner mobility and more fragmented use of outside counsel, conflicts are arising with increased frequency. Some partners have sought to avoid conflicts headaches by decamping to [boutique firms](https://laterallink.com/why-leave-biglaw-to-form-a-boutique/). But for those lateral candidates who prefer a traditional full-service firm, it is critical to anticipate likely conflicts as part of a well-managed search. A sophisticated recruiter will proactively address this issue and ensure that a candidate does not waste time on firms that are nonstarters due to conflicts.

# Am Law 200 Firm Pinched For Labor Law Violations
## If you're going to breach labor laws, at least don't put it in writing.

And then right here is the part you can’t tell the feds about….

With the Supreme Court running roughshod over decades of labor law precedent, one may forgive an employer for thinking they might be able to pull a fast one while the NLRB seems asleep at the switch. But 400-attorney law firms aren’t supposed to have this much trouble following the law.

Goldberg Segalla has roughly 1000 employees overall and the firm spent a considerable amount of effort trying to convince them that they couldn’t share details of their salary with each other. As you might recall, silencing salary talk is how Lilly Ledbetter’s employer managed to systematically rob her of fair wages for years. It’s an effective tool for suppressing labor’s power to stand up for itself. It is, for these reasons, entirely illegal to squelch salary talk.

That said, employers do it all the time, subtly and not-so-subtly suggesting to employees that they shouldn’t be getting together to uncover what the firm’s doing. And it’s super ill-advised to put this in writing, but shockingly that’s exactly what Goldberg did, forcing employees to sign a “confidentiality agreement” that pledged to terminate any employee who shared information about his or her salary with another employee.

The NLRB was not amused.

Pursuant to a settlement with the NLRB, the 28 office firm had to put out a flashy disclaimer walking back their confidentiality agreement and reminding employees that they have basic labor rights and that, no, they will not be enforcing the confidentiality agreement they made everyone sign.

It sounds as though all’s well that end’s well as far as the firm and the NLRB are concerned, but seriously how does something like this happen? Goldberg has an NLRB practice — they release client alerts on NLRB opinions all the time. Yet no one was in a position to veer the firm away from this practice? Perhaps it’s time to loop those lawyers into firm administration….

# Eric Adams Crowdfunds Legal Defense As If Raising Money Isn't Exactly How He Got Here
## Maybe bragging about fundraising isn't the right move at this point.

NYC Mayor Eric Adams [turned to WilmerHale](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/nyc-mayor-lawyers-up-biglaw-style/) to help him out of his whole “federal corruption probe” problem, after the FBI raided a top campaign staffer’s home and then stopped the Mayor on the street to seize his electronics. The investigation of a sitting NYC Mayor puts Adams in uncharted territory — namely a problem that he can’t [glibly blame on teenagers having dirtbikes](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-city-bulldozer-destroys-illegal-dirt-bikes-mayor-eric-adams-safety-plan/). But Biglaw representation isn’t cheap and Adams needs to pay those bills somehow… hey, why not raise the money from donors?

What’s the Turkish government’s Venmo handle?

From [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/politics/eric-adams-legal-defense-fund/index.html):

“The Eric Adams Legal Defense Trust has drawn strong support in a short amount of time, raising more than $650,000 since it was formed just two months ago,” Vito Pitta, counsel to the fund, told CNN. The fund is required to disclose its first round of donations to the city’s Conflict of Interest Board by Tuesday.

While a significant amount of money, it’s not nearly enough to get a Biglaw legal team through a trial.

Moreover, the upcoming disclosure requires releasing the names of anyone who gave the fund over $100, which the FBI will happily cross-check with their list of suspicious campaign donors.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Some of the allegations being investigated involve a Brooklyn-based construction company owned by a Turkish American businessman who sources said gathered employees and others to write checks to the Adams campaign and then allegedly paid the donors back in full, skirting campaign finance laws.

Obviously Adams needs funds to pay legal bills, but why posture to the press about drawing “strong support in a short amount of time” in a case about fundraising? It’s not exactly the right time to be issuing statements saying: man, we’ve been delighted by the generosity of the Mayor’s highest-profile backers.

# Some Clients Aren't Worth The Risk For Biglaw... And, Yes, We Mean Donald Trump

For most major law firms, the prospect of representing Donald Trump and stamping the firm’s name on his nutty pet arguments is a non-starter. Over at Nixon Peabody, the firm jumped right in, bringing on the former president as a client and filing a brief complete with the zany “Brandenburg means it can’t be an insurrection” argument that Trump’s been having all his lawyers make. Partners [don’t seem happy about this turn of events](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firm-adds-donald-trump-as-client-rest-of-the-firm-may-not-be-too-happy-about-it/). But, since we recorded, we’ve learned that [firm leadership doesn’t really care that partners are concerned](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/after-nixon-peabody-hitched-itself-to-donald-trump-blindsided-partners-told-to-get-over-it/). We also discuss [Sam Bankman-Fried’s absurd courtroom sketch](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/sam-bankman-fried-courtroom-sketch-becomes-metaphor-for-crypto-industry/) and the aesthetic brilliance of Jane Rosenberg’s dark and brooding courtroom sketches. Finally, a number of [Biglaw firms sent an open letter castigating law school deans for campus antisemitism](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firms-tell-law-schools-to-pls-hndle-thx-antisemitism/).

# Billion Dollar Firms Highlight DC's Am Law 100 Presence
## How did DC firms fare on the Am Law 100?

Four firms with “a strong center of gravity” in the DC market managed to clear the[ billion dollar revenue hurdle](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/which-biglaw-firms-joined-the-billion-dollar-revenue-club-in-2017/) in 2017. WilmerHale and Akin Gump both clocked just over one billion to remain, respectively, 24th and 29th on the new Am Law 100, while Sidley Austin and Hogan Lovells both raked in over two billion to move up to 6th and 7th.

We looked at the [New York firms earlier this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/am-law-100-news-elite-new-york-dominate-in-profits-and-revenue/), so now it’s time to focus on Washington. The [full DC breakdown](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/04/24/how-dc-firms-stack-up-in-the-am-law-100/) from the National Law Journal features 11 firms making the list, topped by Sidley Austin:

7 Sidley Austin
8 Hogan Lovells
24 WilmerHale
29 Akin Gump
36 Arnold & Porter
37 Covington
52 McGuireWoods
64 Venable
78 Williams & Connolly
82 Crowell & Moring
96 Steptoe & Johnson LLP

If there’s anything to take away from this list, it’s the relative stability of this year’s Am Law 100. All of these firms made the Am Law 100 the year before and they all remain ranked roughly where they were on the last list. The lone exception, of course, is Arnold & Porter, whose merger with Kaye Scholer catapulted the firm from 55th to 36th. It’s a strange quirk of the modern legal market that in an age of [increasing volatility](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/volatility-is-now-a-fact-of-life-for-americas-biggest-firms/) rumbling below the surface, the year-to-year rankings paint a picture of constancy, sweet constancy.

In any event, another good year for the Washington firms.

# A Harvard Law Professor's Call To Derail The Trump Train
## Professor Larry Lessig argues that there's no good reason for electors to veto the people's choice: Hillary Clinton.

Conventional wisdom tells us that the electoral college requires that the person who lost the popular vote this year must nonetheless become our president. That view is an insult to our framers. It is compelled by nothing in our Constitution. It should be rejected by anyone with any understanding of our democratic traditions  — most important, the electors themselves.

— Professor [Lawrence Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/about/), arguing in a [Washington Post op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-constitution-lets-the-electoral-college-choose-the-winner-they-should-choose-clinton/2016/11/24/0f431828-b0f7-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_opinion-card-f%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.6300fe0bc081) that the electors are not required to, and have no good reason to, override the people’s choice for president: Hillary Clinton, winner of the popular vote.

# Prior COVID Illness Probably Won't Get You Out Of Your Law Firm's Vaccine Mandate

I haven’t heard any say an exception to the mandate is if you’ve had COVID. Not one has said that to me.

— Kent Zimmermann, a law firm consultant for Zeughauser Group, commenting on the [accomodations that law firms have offered](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/09/02/its-going-to-be-difficult-law-firms-wrestle-over-unvaccinated-covid-survivors/) to their COVID-19 vaccination mandates. Those vaccine accomodations include exclusions for employee health reasons and their sincerely held religious beliefs. Prior COVID infections are not a common or widely accepted reason to be exempted from vaccine requirements.

Ed. note: This is an installment in the “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists. [Read the prior installments here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/wolters-kluwer-lists/), and feel free to download your copy of the complete eBook using the form below.

You know what’s fun? 

Using #legaltech to [frustrate and confuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/e8x2ba/deceive_inveigle_obfuscate/) your friends and neighbors. 

It turns out that there’s room for you to be a complete jerk outside of your 9-5, where you can only really infuriate your staff, coworkers, clients and referral sources. 

So, if you want to step up your game and learn how to terrorize just about everybody — while using your existing legal software technology to do it — this list is for you, my friend.

1. Contractual Obligations.

So, let’s say you’ve put in a new pool, and, naturally, everybody in the neighborhood wants to use it. 

But you’re a lawyer, and that means that you’ve got the right insurance in place, you’ve got a fence put in, and you’ve also probably got the solution that makes the water turn a dark blue when someone pees. You’re a total savage. 

But you’re probably not making people sign formal disclaimers and a contract for use, before you let them dip a toe in your new swimming hole. 

However, you can remedy that. 

Send out those contracts for signature via [case management software](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/law-practice-management-software/id1557663598?i=1000512589297), customer relationship management software, or an e-signature tool, and button up those local relationships. 

I mean, do you want to get sued by the parents of some kid who stubs her toe on your filter? (No, you do not.)

2. Govern Yourself Accordingly

Allow me to throw out another scenario for you: Your neighbor ever so slightly crosses into your yard while mowing his lawn. 

Well, that’s a potential lawsuit, baby! 

What if he trips on an exposed tree trunk and shatters his leg? Now, that’s on you?!  C’mon! 

How do you keep a dude like that in line? 

It’s pretty easy actually: You simply generate a threatening letter from a template you have in your document assembly software, and let your fingers do the walking. 

Let’s see if Cletus tries that ever again, once threatened by the power of the (virtual) pen.

3. Drip, Drip, Drip

Everyone secretly kind of hates drip campaigns. You know what I mean, right? 

The constant messages you’re getting from Dick’s Sporting Goods, to buy new goalie gloves for soccer, and such. (Wait . . . Just me? OK.) 

Try this one out: Once you get your friends and neighbors to sign your pool usage disclaimer, how about opting them into some truly inane drip campaigns at the same time.   

How about a biweekly message about various treatments for ear wax? (Looking at you, Geri.) Or, what about an updated list of live polka concerts in the tri-state area? You get my drift. 

Now, let your mind wander. Get your [CRM](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/customer-relationship-management-software-with-erik/id1557663598?i=1000524057409) or email marketing tool set up — and, you, too, can be this informative!

4. Auto-Replies for All!

You want to know a good way to get people to stop emailing you? 

Build some micro auto-replies. 

Literally, create graphic auto-replies for everything you do during the day, and set them for specific, shortened time frames. 

Like, “I’m sorry I can’t respond to your email right now; I’m currently in the bathroom reading the Wall Street Journal on my phone. I will return in 7 ½ minutes.” Or, “I’m making myself an egg salad sandwich right now, but I should be back in about 10 minutes — incidentally, should I use paprika? Message back, and let me know soon — so you can get this autoresponder again!”  

Your email volume will go down pretty precipitously. Trust me.

5. Formal Payment Systems

You know how everybody’s going all-in on Venmo, and all these simplified payment apps? 

So, you get a pizza with somebody, and they’re making you pay for your portion via the CashApp. Awful, right? Especially if you want to weasel your way out of paying for stuff. 

I have an alternate plan to suggest. 

Next time that pizza order comes up, pay for the whole thing yourself; then, send a payment request via your law firm case management system client portal. 

Force your frenemies to create a password to log into your system to view a formal invoice. 

Make them set up a payment plan, for, like 50 cents/month. Build a follow-up architecture, to remind them about the invoice if they don’t pay. 

Now, you’re probably not gonna get paid the instant expenditure, but, I guarantee you, no one is going to ask you to pay for anything, ever again.

6. Document Drama

Guess what else you can send through your client portal? [Documents!](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/document-management/id1557663598?i=1000570321293) So, if you’re coaching your kids’ soccer (and, if you want to be really annoying), send the team schedule and additional information out via your document portal in your case management system or productivity software.

(Actually, scratch that one: All those youth sports organization digital interfaces are way harder to use. Just keep doing what you’re doing.)

7. But, Mommy — My Allowance Is Only $20 per Month?!

So, yeah: you could use your reporting tools within your case management software to check on realization rate, or something like that.

But that seems like underutilizing the tool. 

What if, instead, you used those features to develop KPIs around gifting. 

You could track how much individual people spend on you for your birthday each year. 

Or, you could do a deep dive into the average spend for each night of Hanukkah, and whether the eighth night is truly your most profitable. 

I mean, imagine the next time you’re sitting down in front of the Christmas tree, and you’re like: “Sheila, last year, your gifts to me averaged $32.47 (which is, frankly, pretty weak) – let’s see how you did this year!”  

Who said [data analytics was noneventful](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kpis-and-reporting-for-law-firms-with-mary-juetten/id1557663598?i=1000599411200)?

8. On a Scale of 1-10 How Likely Would You Be to Recommend Me as a Potential Father-In-Law?

Of course your daughter’s new boyfriend is a sketchy character. 

I mean, how could that not be true. 

But, how do you know for sure? 

This is a great time to use the intake form feature in your LPM software, CRM software or marketing automation program.  Get your question set fired up now:

-What annoys you the most about my daughter?  (A required question, of course.)

-List every website you’ve visited for the past three days. Name each one, along with your searches.

Of course, you can send the results directly to your daughter, as well.

Ain’t technology grand!

9. Survey Course

The good news is that the same technology that allows for intake form management will also allow you to create surveys. 

What that means is that you can release surveys to your entire neighborhood, and publish the results. Imagine the potential opportunities:

-Does anyone else think Aaron is awful for not covering his recycling bin?  Y/N

-Does Barry’s dog defile anyone else’s manicured lawn, while Barry just walks off, LIKE I DON’T HAVE A RING DOORBELL, BARRY?  Y/N

The possibilities are endless, as are your opportunities to cause havoc using the very same technology you use to manage your law firm each and every day.

Come May of next year, Shearman & Sterling as we know it will cease to exist as the firm will merge with Allen & Overy, [creating A&O Shearman](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/ao-shearman-merger-approved-poised-to-become-third-largest-firm-in-the-world/). The forecast for the soon-to-be combined firm seems pretty optimistic — the new entity will be the third largest law firm in the world. That means plenty of cash to spread around to associates and match the new associate salary scale sweeping the top of Biglaw, and the powers that be at Shearman have announced just that — associates at the firm will be getting a raise come January 1. Something their [counterparts at Allen & Overy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/good-biglaw-firm-encourages-charitable-donations-bad-biglaw-firm-reminds-associates-they-havent-gotten-raises/) have to feel good about.

The new salary grid at Shearman is as follows:

Class Year	2024 Annual Salary
Class of 2023	$225,000
Class of 2022	$235,000
Class of 2021	$260,000
Class of 2020	$310,000
Class of 2019	$365,000
Class of 2018	$390,000
Class of 2017	$420,000
Class of 2016+	$435,000
Plus they announced bonuses. The bonus scale at the firm is as follows:

Year-End Bonus
Class of 2023	$15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2022	$20,000
Class of 2021	$30,000
Class of 2020	$57,500
Class of 2019	$75,000
Class of 2018	$90,000
Class of 2017	$105,000
Class of 2016+	$115,000
“Enhanced” bonuses are available for associates who exceed expectations. Bonuses will be paid January 31, 2024.

You can read the full memo on [the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/shearman-compensation-23/2/)

# The Real Threat To Biglaw's Business Model
## The call is coming from inside the firm!

Biglaw has a talent problem. It’s not that more recent law school graduates aren’t capable of doing the work that the industry demands of them, it’s that they are unwilling — or at least, less willing — to put themselves through the ringer of Biglaw for the benefits that Biglaw is currently willing to give them (namely, prestige and money). That’s a big problem for Biglaw.

Earlier this year, Major, Lindsey & Africa and Above the Law [reported on a survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/making-their-mark-how-millennial-lawyers-could-reshape-the-industry/?rf=1) that detailed what priorities are most important for millennial lawyers, and money is only top for ~17 percent of respondents. And ~29 percent said they would trade compensation for more time off, plus ~ 25 percent said a they’d swap money for a more flexible work schedule. Neither time off nor flexibility are traditional strengths for Biglaw, and that’s feeding the talent crunch.

The scarcity of associate talent means the lateral market [is fire right now](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/). And, in an effort to keep home grown talent right where they are, Biglaw is throwing money (see, e.g., the raises and bonuses that swept through the upper echelons of the industry earlier this year) at the problem, with [super hot/busy practice areas](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/the-new-practice-area-blowing-up-the-lateral-market/) getting some [extra love](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/). But what is a boon for associates’ pocketbooks actually threatens the Biglaw business model.

Randy Kiser of DecisionSet [told](https://www.law.com/2021/10/04/leaking-talent-a-growing-threat-to-law-firms/) Law.com the problem is twofold, with firms struggling to recruit and retain folks to log the needed billables and potential stagnation in the leadership ranks if these younger attorneys aren’t folded into leadership roles.

“And at this point, it looks like that is a growing threat to the law firm business model,” said Kiser, who published a book in 2019 on law firm trends, strategies and threats. “As long as you’re selling time, you have to be very careful about retaining the people who are delivering that profitability.”

And the strain caused by 18 months of pandemic life — and the blurring of work/home boundaries that has come with it — has caused burnout, leading to folks exiting:

“Are people actually leaving because of burnout? The truth is that yeah, they are,” said Michelle Fivel, an MLA recruiter who specializes in placing associates. “What’s going on right now is sort of unprecedented. The hours associates are pulling are just really mind-boggling, and some of them just don’t see another way out.”

“At some point it will subside,” said Joe Krasovec, managing partner for Schiff Hardin, about the competition for young lawyers and corresponding pay increases. “I’ve been through a couple of these cycles, where salaries and compensation goes up, and the market or demand turns, and you see—compensation never comes down, but it flattens for a while. So, I think we’ll hit that at some point. But I think the competition for talent is still very robust.”

But Tom Fitzgerald, managing partner for Winston & Strawn, says the problem keeps him up at night:

“It’s serious, it’s significant and at some level—and this is not unique to Winston & Strawn, it’s any firm with great fortune and great clients—it’s going to affect us long-term,” Fitzgerald said.

“Every great law firm is built on a cadre, a cohort of home-grown people that you get out of law school. We want them to stay and be partners. And those are our building blocks. And so it’s the combination of homegrowns and laterals that build the best law firms. And I don’t care what firm you’re talking about—the Wall Street firms, Kirkland & Ellis, or other great law firms—they hire both. They train them and bring them up, and they have that glue. They’re part of the fabric of the firm. They help attract the right laterals. And if we start losing an undo amount of those associates, we lose that glue, that firm culture. It worries me every single day.”

It wasn’t that long ago that work/life balance was [an actual joke in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/biglaw-firm-makes-big-joke-out-of-worklife-balance/), and now they’re reaping the consequences of that attitude. The truth is firms have to get serious about making Biglaw a long term career for more folks. Hopefully the tide has turned. More and more we’re seeing firm recognize they have to do more than just throw money at the problem — with perks [like Peleton](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/the-new-hotness-in-biglaw-perks-peloton/), a [curated selection of high-end items and experiences](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-tells-associates-thank-you-with-extra-special-gifts/?rf=1), and [$15k towards vacation](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-best-bonus-of-all-this-biglaw-firm-will-pay-associates-to-take-a-vacation/) on the table. But my guess is it’ll take some time before Biglaw culture truly starts to change.

# Circuit Court Nominees In The Trump Administration: A Nationwide Round-Up

(President Donald Trump by Ali Shaker/VOA)

UPDATE (5/8/2017, 11:44 p.m.): Many of the predictions in this post have come to pass. See [More Judicial Nominations From The Trump Administration](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/more-judicial-nominations-from-the-trump-administration/).

In my admittedly biased opinion (as a legal nerd), the greatest success of President Donald Trump’s first 100 days was his nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch to serve on the United States Supreme Court. It was a wise decision by President Trump, and it was executed almost flawlessly. Regardless of what happens to the rest of the Trump agenda, he has already made his mark on government and fulfilled one important campaign promise.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
But as we all know, the Supreme Court is [far from the only game in town](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/lower-court-judicial-nominations-by-the-trump-administration/). Because SCOTUS hears around 80 cases a Term, compared to the[ 50,000 new cases](http://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/federal-judicial-caseload-statistics-2015) that get filed in federal appellate courts each year, these [13 circuit courts](http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure) — the D.C. Circuit, the Federal Circuit, and the regional circuits (the First Circuit through the Eleventh Circuit) — wield YUGE amounts of influence.

On Friday, I wrote about possible nominees to the [Ninth Circuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/some-possible-nominee-names-for-the-ninth-circuit/?rf=1) (for which I have special affection, as a former Ninth Circuit clerk and author of a [novel](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/books/david-lats-supreme-ambitions-is-a-thriller-for-lawyers.html?_r=0) set in that court). I also mentioned that I’d be writing a longer story talking about potential nominees to all the other circuit courts. This is that story.

You’ll note that I didn’t waste much time in putting together his piece. Why? As [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/25/donald-trump-us-attorney-positions-appointments-237588) reported last week, the Trump administration plans to announce at least 10 judicial nominees in the next two weeks — meaning any day now.

My sources confirmed this intelligence and added some additional information. Taking a page from President George W. Bush’s playbook, later this month President Trump will announce multiple judicial nominees in one big press conference in Washington, D.C. (just as President Bush announced eleven nominees as a group, on May 9, 2001, in what Professor Carl Tobias [described](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1346&context=wmborj) as “a White House ceremony which chief executives traditionally reserve for United States Supreme Court designees”). The messaging to accompany President Trump’s announcement: this is the next generation of great federal judges, the bench (pun intended) from which future Supreme Court justices will be recruited.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Let’s now turn to the specific circuits and name some names. In subsequent stories, we will discuss possible nominees for district-court seats and for U.S. Attorney positions. (The White House has already started moving on those jobs as well; see, e.g., Zoe Tillman’s [BuzzFeed piece](https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/the-white-house-is-interviewing-candidates-for-the-dc?utm_term=.qenox9Bmv#.ueKlWJd05) on interviewees for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.)

I communicated with many sources for this report, including potential nominees, people close to potential nominees, and individuals involved in the selection process. I sent requests for comment to every possible nominee mentioned below for whom I could find contact information; they all did not get back to me or declined to comment.

All of my sources insisted on strict anonymity, given the sensitivity of the subject and the fact that the appointments discussed herein have not yet been officially announced. So this story will contain very few direct quotations and be told from the perspective of an omniscient narrator, to preserve anonymity, but rest assured that it reflects extensive reporting.

Of course, reporting is only as accurate as the sources consulted, and sometimes sources are misinformed or misleading. The list below of potential nominees is a work in progress; it will look different in future iterations, after I hear from more readers and sources and as events unfold. So please share with me all comments, corrections, additions, and removals — plus thoughts on possible district court and U.S. Attorney nominees, for future stories — [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Judicial%20Nominations) (subject line: “[Judicial/U.S. Attorney] Nominations”) or by text message (646-820-8477).

Because this story is an omnibus report, it will be a bit long — apologies. Most of you are lawyers, so you are used to reading lengthy pieces. And of course you can just skip ahead to the circuit(s) of interest to you.

At the current time, there are 20 vacancies on the federal appellate/circuit courts. Current judicial vacancies are listed [here](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/current-judicial-vacancies), and anticipated vacancies are listed [here](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/future-judicial-vacancies); do a “find” on the page for “CCA” (“Circuit Court of Appeals”) to find the circuit seats.

As of now, there’s just one nominee: Judge [Amul Thapar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amul_Thapar) of the Eastern District of Kentucky, [nominated for elevation](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/who-will-president-trump-nominate-to-the-circuit-and-district-courts/?rf=1) to the Sixth Circuit. So the Trump White House should — and apparently will — get cracking very soon on lower-court nominations. Given the procedural roadblocks that Democrats are putting up these days, such as requiring cloture votes even for non-controversial nominees, there’s no time to waste.

Folks involved in Trump administration judicial selection want the confirmation process to move faster than the traditional pace of maybe one Senate Judiciary Committee hearing a month (say, a panel hearing featuring one circuit nominee and some district court nominees). But if the administration doesn’t announce nominees soon, they don’t have much standing to complain about delay.

Without further ado, let’s run through the circuits. You’ll note in the discussion below references to certain judicial seats as “belonging” to a particular state. Although this allocation of circuit seats by state is not official, i.e., required by statute — the relevant statutes merely state the total number of authorized judgeships for a circuit (see, e.g., the [Judicial Improvements Act of 1990](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/5316/text)), remaining silent as to which state within a circuit a nominee can come from — it is rare to see a circuit judgeship “move” from one state to another. Disputes between states and senators over allocation of circuit-court seats can get [pretty ugly](http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/th-circuit-nominee-creates-battle-between-idaho-california/article_1341eb0b-c41d-537a-8d0b-b99627825979.html), so the White House and Senate tend to stick to the established allocations and not rock the boat.

D.C. Circuit

The D.C. Circuit is, as judiciary junkies know, first among equals when it comes to the circuit courts. It hears some of the most important and high-profile cases in the country, and it’s the unofficial “farm team” for SCOTUS (the former court of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg). It currently has no vacancies — but the names I’ve heard mentioned as possible D.C. Circuit nominees for the future are all superstars, entirely in line with that court’s high standards.

Federal Circuit

There are currently no openings on the Federal Circuit. Because of its focus on patent cases, it tends to be somewhat less ideological than the regional circuit courts.

First Circuit

With [just six judgeships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_First_Circuit), the First Circuit is the smallest federal appeals court (and also one of the more collegial, because the judges see each other so frequently). It also has no vacancies.

Second Circuit

The Second Circuit has two vacancies, both New York seats. One possible nominee: Judge [Richard J. Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Sullivan), a well-regarded judge on the Southern District of New York, to which he was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2007. Judge Sullivan is young (53) and has a great résumé; he’s a graduate of Yale Law School and a former assistant U.S. attorney in the vaunted S.D.N.Y.

Third Circuit

The Third Circuit has three open seats — two for Pennsylvania, and one for New Jersey. A leading contender for the New Jersey seat is [Paul Matey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-matey-77a705103/), senior vice president and general counsel at University Hospital in Newark. A graduate of Seton Hall Law School, Matey is a former Third Circuit clerk himself. He’s also a former associate at super-elite Kellogg Hansen ([née Kellogg Huber](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-500-million-man-is-now-a-name-partner-at-this-litigation-powerhouse/)), a former AUSA in New Jersey, and former deputy chief counsel to Governor Chris Christie (which might not be a plus right now in the Trump administration — but it doesn’t seem to have been held against Matey).

Fourth Circuit

The Fourth Circuit is currently full, but here’s an anticipatory “bonus” pick: if and when a vacancy arises, one likely candidate is [Elbert Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elbert-lin-0358a86/). A rising star in conservative legal circles, Lin is a Yale law grad, former SCOTUS clerk (for Justice Thomas), and current solicitor general of West Virginia. He was reportedly [interviewed by the White House](https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/the-white-house-is-interviewing-candidates-for-the-dc?utm_term=.qenox9Bmv#.ueKlWJd05) for a district judgeship in D.C. (where he previously practiced, at the Wiley Rein law firm).

Fifth Circuit

So, how much time do you have? I haven’t seen this kind of Texas-sized drama since the soap opera Dallas. There are two open seats in the Lone Star State plus one Louisiana seat. [UPDATE (11:55 p.m.): And there will be an open Mississippi seat as of October 2017, when Judge E. Grady Jolly [takes senior status](http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/judicial-vacancies/future-judicial-vacancies).]

The competition over the Texas spots is fiercer than [Bodacious the Bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodacious_(bull)). I suspect that the White House would have already announced its big slate of circuit-court nominees but has been held up by the wrangling over Texas.

I could write a whole separate post about the Fifth Circuit battle; heck, books have been written about the quest for a Fifth Circuit seat (or at least a book — Judge Leslie Southwick’s [excellent](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/give-this-man-a-federal-judgeship-a-review-of-the-nominee-by-leslie-southwick/) memoir, [The Nominee](http://amzn.to/2p1Wc2x) (affiliate link)). But let me give you the abridged version, both in the interests of time and avoidance of saying anything erroneous. (I’ve heard so many conflicting accounts about what’s going on here, so the less I write, the lower the chance of error.)

Earlier this year, the Texas Lawyer [named](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/legaltimes/id=1202779124278/6-Candidates-Trump-Wants-to-Place-on-the-Fifth-Circuit-Set-for-Vetting?kw=6%20Candidates%20Trump%20Wants%20to%20Place%20on%20the%20Fifth%20Circuit%20Set%20for%20Vetting&et=editorial&bu=National%20Law%20Journal&cn=20170214&src=EMC-Email&pt=Legal%20Times%20Afternoon%20Update) six possibilities:

The Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee (FJEC), a standing by bipartisan committee of lawyers named by Texas U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, is set to meet Friday in Houston to vet Trump’s candidates.

According to four people who are familiar with the process but who declined to be named, the candidates being considered include: Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Willett; U.S. District Court Judge Reed O’Connor of Fort Worth; former Texas solicitor general James Ho; Andy Oldham, a deputy general counsel to Gov. Greg Abbott; Michael Massengale, a justice on Houston’s First Court of Appeals; and Brett Busby, a justice on Houston’s Fourteenth Court of Appeals.

Note that these potential picks emerged from the senatorial committee, not the White House. One apparent flashpoint relating to the Fifth Circuit seats is the allocation of decision-making authority between the senators and the Trump administration. Note also that there might be additional possible candidates, whether for a current or future vacancy (Judge [Edward Prado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_C._Prado) has entertained the thought of going senior), who are not among the senatorial six. (For example, one name on the administration’s radar is Baker Botts partner [Evan Young](http://www.bakerbotts.com/people/y/young-evan) — a Yale Law grad, former law clerk to Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson and the late Justice Scalia, high-powered DOJ lawyer, and overall superstar.)

Assuming the Fifth Circuit nominees come from the senatorial six, who has the edge? I’ve heard very divergent reports (reminiscent of how, in the days preceding President Trump’s big SCOTUS announcement, supporters of both then-Judge Gorsuch and Judge Thomas Hardiman of the Third Circuit swore up and down to me that their guy was getting it).

It’s safe to say that of those six, the top four are Justice Willett, Judge O’Connor, Jim Ho, and Andy Oldham (although the usual caveat applies: with the Trump administration, nothing is final until announced — and sometimes [not even then](http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-another-trump-nominee-withdraws-1488158549-htmlstory.html)).

As reported in [Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2017/03/02/texas-conservatives-send-three-judicial-picks-trump/), leading Texas conservatives (including attorney general [Ken Paxton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Paxton)) have thrown their support behind three: Judge O’Connor, Justice Willett, and Jim Ho. I would add Andy Oldham to the top four because of his powerful backer, Governor Greg Abbott (whom he currently serves as deputy general counsel).

It’s also safe to say that one of the two seats is going to Judge [Reed O’Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Charles_O%27Connor) (N.D. Tex.). Sitting district judges tend to fare well in seeking open circuit seats, and Judge O’Connor has another big advantage: he’s a former counsel to Senator Cornyn, the current Senate Majority Whip. Word on the street is that Senator Cornyn pushed hard for O’Connor, who otherwise might not have gotten the spot (his White House interview wasn’t the greatest), and the administration gave in (because, well, you don’t want to tick off the Majority Whip if you’re in the White House).

Judge O’Connor’s confirmation hearing will be interesting. The South Texas Law grad has a solid range of experience — private practice, state and federal prosecution experience, work on the Judiciary Committee with Senator Cornyn — but he does have at least one controversial ruling on his record: the [nationwide injunction](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/22/490915833/u-s-judge-grants-nationwide-injunction-blocking-white-house-transgender-policy) he granted that blocked the Obama administration’s Title IX interpretation in a transgender bathroom case.

Of the remaining three finalists — Jim Ho, Andy Oldham, and Justice Don Willett — who will get the second seat? Right now, that’s anyone’s guess. Here’s a quick recap of the strengths and weaknesses of each.

[James Ho](http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/jho). Pros: he has a sterling résumé: Stanford, U. Chicago Law, Fifth Circuit clerkship (with Judge Jerry Smith), Supreme Court clerkship (with Justice Clarence Thomas), varied government service (Senate Judiciary Committee, Department of Justice, Texas solicitor general), and private practice (Gibson Dunn, where he’s currently a Dallas-based partner and co-chair of the appellate and constitutional law practice group). He has strong support from Senator Ted Cruz, a predecessor of his as Texas SG and also a personal friend. He’s diverse — Taiwanese by birth, and an active member of the Asian American community.

Cons: some conservatives question whether he is “solid.” I’m not sure where this comes from — Ho is a longtime member of the Federalist Society, former Thomas clerk, and former Republican staffer on Capitol Hill — but that’s what some sources say. (Perhaps it comes from him not having a judicial record like Judge O’Connor or Justice Willett.)

[Andy Oldham](http://www.law.uchicago.edu/audio/andy-oldham%C2%A0-texas-plan-amending-constitution-and-restoring-rule-law). Pros: he too has a fabulous résumé — UVA, Cambridge, Harvard Law, a clerkship with Justice Samuel Alito, service in the Justice Department’s prestigious Office of Legal Counsel — plus youth (he’s a 2005 HLS grad). This is totally the nominee profile that the White House Counsel’s office falls for. He has strong backing from Governor Abbott, and he’s very well liked (“a prince of a guy”).

Cons: he doesn’t have the backing of either Texas senator (each senator sent his two top names to the White House, and Oldham made neither list). Because of his service in the Abbott administration, he’d be recused for years on a number of major issues (e.g., voter ID, abortion, affirmative action, transgender issues, redistricting, etc.). He’s young — so some suggest he should replace Justice Willett on the Texas Supreme Court if Willett goes to the Fifth Circuit, and then get a federal appointment later.

[Justice Don Willett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Willett). Pros: he also has great credentials — Duke Law, Fifth Circuit clerkship (for Judge Jerre Stockton Williams), private practice (at Haynes and Boone), federal government experience (in the George W. Bush White House and DOJ), state government experience (as chief counsel to then-AG Greg Abbott), and judicial experience (on the Texas Supreme Court since 2005). He has a [powerful personal story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Willett): he’s a native Texan, raised by single mom after his father passed away at 40; his mom worked as a waitress to make ends meet; neither of his parents graduated high school; and he was the first college graduate in his family.

More pros: Justice Willett is [famous on Twitter](https://twitter.com/justicewillett), where he has almost 85,000 followers. He has a national profile, as both a [Trump SCOTUS shortlister](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/?rf=1) and one of the [six finalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-trump-kept-gorsuch-nomination-a-secret-until-the-clock-struck-8/2017/01/31/c745c23c-e828-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html?utm_term=.299cf23d4d4a) to replace Justice Scalia.

Cons: turning [51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Willett) later this year, he’s a little older than Ho and Oldham (but still well within the good range for a judicial appointment). Some might find his social media activity to be a bit much (but this is the administration of [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump) — and since Justice Willett already made the top six for the seat that went to Justice Gorsuch, the Trump administration probably doesn’t have a problem with the judicial tweeting).

Where does this leave us? As between these three, your guess is as good as mine. In fact, I’d like to get your guess — take this poll, dear readers:

Of these candidates, who is most likely to be nominated to the Fifth Circuit?

- Jim Ho
- Andy Oldham
- Don Willett

# How Can You Access Litigation Funding? A Primer
## If you'd like to get your litigation funded, here's what funders seek.

Litigation finance is transforming the fields of both law and finance. Anyone who follows either area needs to understand how litigation funding works, its [pros and cons](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/6-virtues-of-litigation-finance/), and its [past, present, and future](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/current-and-future-issues-in-litigation-finance/).

Understanding litigation funding can have practical advantages as well. If you’re a litigator, whether at a law firm or corporation, you might want to use litigation finance for one or more of your cases. So what are litigation funders looking for when they evaluate claims for possible backing?

Earlier this month, at a [litigation finance conference](https://litigationfundingconference.com/) in Delray Beach, Florida, I attended a most interesting panel featuring two experts from leading funders: [Robin Davis](https://woodsfordlitigationfunding.com/about-woodsford/meet-the-team/robin-m-davis/), Senior Investment Officer at Woodsford Litigation Funding, and Chris Hagale, Managing Director at [Lake Whillans Litigation Finance](http://bit.ly/2RwCSZG) (which kindly sponsored our conference coverage). They offered a behind-the-scenes look at the underwriting process, shedding insight on what claimholders should do — and not do — if they want funding.

Lake Whillans focuses on commercial litigation finance, typically cases involving business torts or contract breach, where the plaintiff seeks damages in excess of $20 million. Hagale offered this concise explanation of what his firm seeks in cases: “We want a strong evidentiary record showing that the plaintiff is substantially in the right and will win damages that will make the investment make sense.” He’s looking for robust evidence, nothing speculative or conclusory, showing that the defendant committed a wrong and that the damages are substantial.

Interestingly enough, according to Hagale, many funding opportunities break down at the damages phase. The damages claim needs to be sizable — one rule of thumb is a 10:1 ratio, where “hard” damages are 10 times the amount of the funder’s investment — so the funder feels it can get a decent return (after the claimholder’s lawyers and the claimholder get paid, of course).

From a funder’s perspective, the best damages are out-of-pocket damages, actual conflicts imposed upon the plaintiff because of the defendant’s wrongdoing. Less attractive are consequential damages like lost profits, which can be speculative. And least attractive of all are punitive damages, which aren’t easy to get and can be very hard to predict.

A huge damages award doesn’t mean anything if it can’t be collected. Robin Davis emphasized that funders care about collectability: how hard will it be for the funder to actually get paid? This sometimes comes up in the context of funding international arbitrations, where the defendant could be some foreign entity or government, and it also arises in domestic cases, especially when the defendant is having financial difficulties. If the defendant declares bankruptcy, that will greatly complicate the collection process.

Funders also evaluate the mindset of the claimholder, Hagale explained. Funders want claimholders with reasonable expectations about the resolution of a case, expectations that are in line with the funder’s own views. Because the claimholder controls the course of the litigation, including the decision of whether to settle, it’s important that the claimholder and the funder be on the same page about damages. To be avoided: a situation where the funder wants to accept a given settlement, which it views as offering a reasonable return on its investment, but the claimholder refuses to accept the settlement and wants to hold out for more (or go to trial).

The quality of the claimholder’s counsel matters as well. Funders look for cases where they feel the lawyers have the ability to litigate the case effectively. In situations where the claimholder has not yet retained counsel, the funder might help in terms of making sure the claimholder has quality representation. Indeed, one of the pluses of funding from the claimholder’s perspective is the ability to pay for lawyers that the claimholder might otherwise not be able to afford.

Another issue that funders consider (which hadn’t occurred to me): what about counterclaims? As Davis pointed out, patent cases frequently involve two competitors suing each other, with patents being asserted by both sides. Needless to say, a funder doesn’t want to back a case that could end up a wash, or where the funded claimant ends up owing money instead of being owed.

As the old saying goes, time is money — which is why funders pay attention to the likely timeframe for an investment. Funders want to get their investment (plus a return) back as soon as possible, so they can deploy that financing on another case — so the longer the funder expects its money to be tied up in a given case, the greater return it will expect on the back end. This can be tough to predict, although certain data analytics products and platforms can be helpful in estimating case duration based on factors like the type of case or the judge who’s handling it. (Woodsford does a lot of work in the patent area, where platforms like [Lex Machina](https://lexmachina.com/patent-litigation/) have been providing analytics for years now.)

On the issue of timing, at what stage of the case do funding opportunities typically get presented to potential financiers? According to Davis, most of Woodsfords’ cases get presented for funding prior to the filing of an actual lawsuit. This offers the advantage of the funder being able to contribute insight into strategic questions such as where to file, what claims to assert, and similar issues. But sometimes the funder will take a case midstream, which provides the benefit of seeing the lawyers’ track record in the litigation so far.

As for the funding process, it’s highly selective — not unlike admission to elite colleges (without the [alleged bribery](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/)). Woodsford funds around 3 percent of the cases it’s presented, and Lake Whillans is similarly selective. If you want financial backing for your litigation, it needs to be compelling.

Hopefully you’ve found this primer on litigation finance to be helpful — because when it comes to actually getting funded, claimholders and their counsel need all the help they can get.

# 5 Tips For Having A Long And Successful Legal Career
## Good career advice for lawyers everywhere.

A legal career is a marathon, not a sprint — and whether you’re a law student, associate, or partner, you always need to be thinking about the next turn in the road. You might have achieved a major career goal — getting into a top law school, landing a job as a Biglaw associate, making partner — but you can’t rest on your laurels (unless, well, you’re ready to retire). There’s always a new achievement to be unlocked.

In my new career as a [legal recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/a-departure-memo-from-david-lat-leaving-abovethelaw-joining-lateral-link/), I have broadened and deepened my knowledge of the legal industry and job market. Based on my experience as a recruiter so far, as well as my 20 years as a practicing lawyer and then a legal journalist, here are five pieces of career advice. They’re most germane to Biglaw associates, but some of them apply to law students, partners, and even non-lawyers. I hope you find them helpful.

1. Be open to opportunity.

The job I held from 2006 to 2019, as founder and managing editor of Above the Law — “legal blogger,” “online journalist,” “digital journalist,” or whatever you might want to call it — didn’t exist when I was in law school. And when I was in law school, I certainly had no idea that I would wind up in it.

Careers take unexpected and surprising turns, often driven by luck. And you can “make your own luck” by keeping abreast of industry news (by reading ATL and other Biglaw-focused publications), networking (in person and online), and being receptive to possible opportunities (even if an opening might not initially seem like your dream job).

When in doubt, hear the pitch or take the meeting. It’s not like [Persephone eating the pomegranate seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone); going to an interview doesn’t obligate you to take the job. But going to an interview, even for a job you ultimately decline or don’t get, could help you learn about a job that you do accept, make a valuable new professional contact, or land a client.

Going to a callback never killed anyone. You might get [stuck in an elevator for a few hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/law-school-students-locked-in-elevator-3-hours-during-worst-callback-ever/), but that’s very, very rare.

2. Always be learning.

To paraphrase the old motivational phrase [“always be closing”](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/always-be-closing.asp) (made famous by Alec Baldwin’s [star turn in Glengarry Glen Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk)), you should always be learning, especially in a knowledge-driven field like the law. Laws change, industries change, and the only way to remain relevant is to stay on top of the changes.

If you no longer feel challenged or stimulated in your current job, or if you find yourself working on the same types of matters or performing the same types of tasks over and over again, then it might be time to start exploring. If you’re no longer learning from your job, then you’re just collecting a paycheck — and while collecting a paycheck is nice, you can do that while improving your knowledge and skills at the same time. (I can relate; a desire to take on new challenges and develop new skills drove my own [recent career switch](https://www.law.com/2019/05/07/qa-david-lat-on-moving-from-legal-industry-writing-to-recruiting/).)

3. It’s no longer all about the benjamins (or prestige).

When picking where to start their careers, many law students go for the firm offering the biggest paycheck and greatest prestige (which often just boils down to prestige, since most of the top firms pay on the same market/Cravath scale). This is an admittedly crude way to pick a firm, but it’s the approach of many students, including myself back in the day, and it has a certain logic: if you don’t know what type of law you want to practice, you might as well “start at the top” and keep as many doors open as possible.

But a few years into your career, armed with a better sense of what you actually want to do, it might be time to move to a platform that makes more sense for your specific interests. The uber-prestigious firm you picked for starting your career might not be the best place for you to build a practice based on the particular type of work you’ve selected as your specialty or the particular industry you’ve decided to focus on — perhaps with an eye to moving in-house in a few years.

4. Don’t go in-house too early.

Speaking of moving in-house, it’s the promised land for many Biglaw associates (and even some partners), and many can’t wait to make the jump. But don’t make the jump too early.

As Dan Cooperman, former general counsel of Apple, said on the [Legal Speak podcast](https://www.law.com/2019/05/17/tips-from-the-top-8-gcs-share-how-to-get-ahead/)(around the 5:30 mark), the best time to go in-house is after four or five years at a firm. That’s the amount of time you typically need to become fully confident in at least one area of the law, which will serve you well as corporate counsel and help you get the best work.

(Speaking of the Legal Speak podcast, I recently appeared on it, speaking with host Leigh Jones about how Biglaw has changed over the past 13 years, the role Above the Law played in covering (and promoting) that change, and my new work as a [legal recruiter](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/team/david-lat/). Check out the episode [here](https://www.law.com/2019/07/12/what-david-lat-learned-about-big-law-and-himself-at-above-the-law/).)

5. Don’t leave Biglaw too late.

The conventional wisdom is true: there’s a sweet spot for leaving Biglaw, falling somewhere between your third and sixth years. If you know that you don’t want to stick around to make a run at partnership, either because you don’t want or don’t think you’ll make partner, then figure out a good time to leave.

If everything is going reasonably well, it can be tempting to just stick around your current firm and collect a nice paycheck. And as long as you’re making money for them, your firm will be more than happy to keep you.

But beyond a certain point, your marketability will drop. If you search for jobs based on the desired year of law school graduation — one of countless searches I have been able to run with the resources I have at my disposal working at [Lateral Link](http://www.laterallink.com/) — you’ll find a bell-curve distribution: not many jobs for lawyers with under two years of experience, lots of jobs for lawyers with two to six years of experience, and then fewer jobs for lawyers with six or more years of experience (although this will vary based on a number of factors, including your credentials and practice area).

(Beyond a certain point of seniority, you ideally want to be a partner with a big book of business. Partner hiring doesn’t rely as much on public job postings; instead, recruiters play a major role.)

**********

These tips are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg; the best career advice is individualized.

# David Boies Loses More Work Over Weinstein Debacle
## The hits just keep on coming.

David Boies has been fired… again. Hot off the heels of the [explosive New Yorker piece](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies) which detailed the lengths Harvey Weinstein went to to avoid his alleged history of sexual harassment and assault from becoming public, and famed litigator [David Boies’s role](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-takes-responsibility-for-enabling-harvey-weinstein/?rf=1) in the whole sordid affair, comes word that clients no longer want to be associated with Boies.

Part of the exposé revealed that Boies contracted with investigators on behalf of Weinstein to spy on the women who might make allegations against the Hollywood mogul — and to look into the journalists who might report on it. The investigation actively sought to halt the publication of the [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html) which blew the lid off of Weinstein’s pervy history — at the same time Boies was working for the Times on other matters. As one might imagine, this didn’t go over too well with the Times, and they [severed their relationship](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/new-york-times-fires-david-boies-over-the-whole-grave-betrayal-thing/) with Boies. Now the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, has also ended a potential relationship with Boies.

Katie Ledecky (Photo by Clive Rose/Getty)

If you’ve been watching the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, you know that Stanford-bound freshman Katie Ledecky hopes to win a total of four gold medals. She already won her first on Saturday night when she broke her own world record in the women’s 400-meter freestyle, swimming it in in 3:56.46, and finishing five seconds ahead of those who won the silver and bronze medals in the event.

Ledecky is a natural-born competitor who is always striving to clinch her next win. Where does she get her urge to win at all costs? It may come from her father, who was once a fierce litigator with ties to one of the biggest law firms in the country.

[David Ledecky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-ledecky-55a377a), a 1986 graduate of Yale Law school, served as an of counsel attorney in the Kirkland & Ellis litigation department for six years before leaving the firm to help his daughter in her competitive swimming career. Her brother, Michael Ledecky, a former swimmer himself, currently serves as a litigation specialist at Bancroft PLLC.

According to the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202764598714/Ledecky-Shattering-Records-and-Winning-Gold-Has-Big-Law-Ties?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=2), a Kirkland spokeswoman had the following message for the Ledecky family: “We are proud to call David a Kirkland alum, and thrilled to see Katie continuing to win gold medals and break world records!”

Congratulations, Katie! We can’t wait to see you win more gold medals in Rio!

It’s the Friday before Christmas. Even if you don’t celebrate the holiday yourself, there’s a slow down in the air at work today — if you’ve bothered to actually go into the office. So there is no better time to dish on some more bonus news.

On that front, the New York office of Morrison & Foerster announced their end-of-the-year bonuses yesterday. (UPDATE (12/26/17): Non-New York bonus memos have yet to go out, and last year, they were sent in February, according to a source.) And, to the surprise of no one, they’ve met the Cravath scale across all class years:

Class of 2017 – $15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2016 – $15,000
Class of 2015 – $25,000
Class of 2014 – $50,000
Class of 2013 – $65,000
Class of 2012 – $80,000
Class of 2011 – $90,000
Class of 2010 (+ prior years) – $100,000

Bonuses will be pay on the late side — along with the February 15th paycheck. Plus there is extra money for associates that have a particularly tough year (read: over 2500 hours).

So, MoFo associates, how do these dollars stack up and when you’ll eventually see your money? It might be what you were expecting, but the bonus stagnation over the years has certainly left [others at big firms frustrated.](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-match-is-here/)

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

# Should There Be A Requiem For The Billable Hour?

I’ve been thinking a lot about the billable hour and how some people are trying to drive a stake through its heart, while others champion the continued use of the billable hour from now until whenever. When I was in private practice, I hated having to keep written time sheets (in dinosaur days) and now there are better, smarter ways to capture time.

Not having to keep time is a real sales clincher for going in-house, at least it was for me.  I know, I know, some corporate legal departments keep time records, but we never did. Since we didn’t, clients were never fearful of being billed for time spent talking with an in-house attorney.  Preventive law at its best.

When in-house, I hated having to review bills from outside counsel, as there was always some issue with the bills, spending too much time on something of little or no value, not alerting the client (me) in advance about unforeseen (and unbudgeted) time spent. I know that my friends in Biglaw and elsewhere hate being evaluated on hours billed and collected, rather than the value provided to a client.

What if the billable hour went the way of the dinosaur? Dinosaur lawyers are not dead yet, but we’re closer to the end than to the beginning. What if the legal work was appraised not for the hours billed and collected, but for the value added, the value to the client for the results, client service, and other markers? Should there be a requiem for the billable hour?  Maybe not right now, but perhaps sooner than we think.

University of California Berkeley professor of management, Morten Hansen, has written a book, [“Great at Work: How Top Performers Do Less, Work Better, and Achieve More,”](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Work-Performers-Better-Achieve/dp/1476765626/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521483763&sr=1-4&keywords=great+at+work+how+top+performers+work+less+and+achieve+more)

which indirectly challenges our absorption with the billable hour and our refusal to let it go.

(Full disclosure: I have not read the book yet, but I did read Hansen’s lengthy essay in a recent issue of the Wall Street Journal, which sets forth some of his ideas that I think we should consider.)

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Hansen says that it’s not simply a matter of talent or hard work (i.e., hours worked). It’s more than that. Top performers have mastered the art of selectivity, in other words, they can’t do everything and they don’t even try. They do less, but they apply intense, targeted effort on whatever their priorities are in order to excel. Hard work is not always the praiseworthy endeavor that people think it is. Working smarter is better.

That’s the first characteristic of top performers that Hansen found. The second? This is not going to be the easiest thing to do: “say no to your bosses.”  Uh-oh. Talk about awkward. What junior puppy can screw up the courage to say no to the senior associate, partner, or whoever is higher up on the lawyer food chain?  A “career limiting move” or even a “career ending move,” at least at that job? Your guess is as good as mine.

Hansen says that acknowledging that how one says “no” to a boss can make all the difference; it’s a matter of gentle pushback. Discuss with the boss what you have to do and ask the boss how s/he wants to reprioritize your workload.  In other words, put the decision back on the boss; it’s who you’re working for and that person should be able to articulate, even if inartfully, what’s most important to get done and the timetable. You can’t do it all, and you shouldn’t even try, says Hansen. Besides, it’s good practice to learn how to push back internally, because you do it with opposing counsel and your clients.

So, how does the billable hour fit in to Hansen’s repertoire of themes?  The practice, he says, should be to orient work around its actual value, rather than toward internal goals. Internal goals: bill X numbers of hours per year if you want to keep your job. Changing that mentality will not be easy, but it has to happen.

What is “actual value?”  Hansen says it’s the value that the work brings to clients and others, and not for those doing the work. The test is what value is being created.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
What about bonuses?  A relic of 20th century thinking is [this firm’s approach](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/facing-mounting-pressure-over-shortchanging-attorneys-baker-mckenzie-doubles-down-and-blames-associates/).  How many firms, when doling out bonuses, do it in lockstep without client consultation? Would client consultation make a difference? I think it should, as some lawyers provide more value than others, and it’s not just a matter of blizzarding the client with paperwork. It’s being smart, savvy, understanding client needs and goals and the most efficient way to get there at the most economical cost.

We need to redesign work to make us work smarter and make it better serve the clients. The billable hour serves no purpose for the client, except in limited circumstances where the goal is to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks, and notice I said “limited circumstances.” Not every case deserves that nor should it. Spending sprees should be saved for Nordstrom’s twice yearly sale.

Alternative fee arrangements, fixed fee agreements, and other billing methods are here and now, not just on the horizon, given that alternative legal providers, eDiscovery vendors, and other creative methods of lowering legal costs are [chomping at the billable hour buffet](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/billable_hour_pricing_is_effectively_dead_because_of_budget_caps_report_say/). Who here hates leftovers?

It’s up to us, especially millennials, who will be in the legal work force way longer, to figure out how best to provide legal services so that clients feel that they are getting value for what they pay. If we don’t do it, then someone else will.

As the control freaks we are (yes, admit it), we hate not being in control. The issue of fee arrangements is one area we can control, if we have the fortitude to do so and are willing to make necessary sacrifices. We all consider ourselves “top performers,” but are we really? When reviewing legal bills, I don’t think clients would necessarily agree.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

The term “metaverse” is one of the hottest buzzwords in tech today. Despite all the attention it’s received, however, many attorneys are still confused about what exactly the metaverse is and how it’s actually used.

It might be tempting to dismiss the metaverse as simply a world for gamers and other internet enthusiasts, but when any technology starts to be used in business, its involvement in litigation is only a matter of time. 

The volume of business-related metaverse data is already increasing, as major companies like JPMorgan, CVS, and Walmart are using the metaverse to host meetings and more. The metaverse will continue to develop and attract more corporate users, and virtual real estate in it will soon come at a premium. The next logical step will be companies and their lawyers seeing metaverse-related data requested and offered as evidence in eDiscovery.

Both companies and lawyers need to be prepared for the metaverse to play a real role in litigation. To that end, PLI is offering a one-hour program, [Metaverse eDiscovery – Reasonable Anticipation of Challenges Ahead](https://www.pli.edu/programs/metaverse-ediscovery--reasonable-anticipation-of-challenges-ahead?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), where expert lawyers will cover some of today’s most pressing legal issues related to the metaverse, including:

- The types of litigation and regulatory actions that might arise from the metaverse
- Possible triggers for the duty to preserve metaverse-related data
- The types of electronically stored information (ESI) that might be relevant and discoverable
- The types of data that might be subject to production and in what formats
- Whether the process for identifying an avatar might be similar to the process for obtaining the identity of an email account
- Whether litigation can be reasonably anticipated if certain virtual conduct is not yet recognized as a crime or tort
Register for the program [here](https://www.pli.edu/programs/metaverse-ediscovery--reasonable-anticipation-of-challenges-ahead?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2). If you’re interested in learning even more about the legal implications of the metaverse, PLI has several other programs available on demand, including [Misconduct in the Metaverse: Can Your Avatar’s Actions Get You Arrested?](https://www.pli.edu/programs/misconduct-in-the-metaverse--can-your-avatars-actions-get-you-arrested?t=ondemand&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), [Regulating the Metaverse](https://www.pli.edu/programs/regulating-the-metaverse?t=ondemand&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), and [Cybersecurity in the Metaverse](https://www.pli.edu/programs/cybersecurity-in-the-metaverse?t=ondemand&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

# 'The Tone Deafness Is Astounding': An In-House Hot Take On The $190K Salary Scale
## Some in-house leaders think the new Biglaw pay scale is absurd.

I find it unfathomable that not just one but many law firms believe that a first-year associate coming out of law school would command such a high starting salary.

The tone deafness is astounding. We as purchaser of legal services keep asking our firms to bill based on value because that is what we want to buy, not hours. They respond by raising rates across the board. It is no wonder that the largest-growing segment in the legal industry over the past few years has been the role of in-house counsel. You can keep living in your ‘reality distortion field’ and pay a first-year associate $190,000. You certainly will attract lawyers to come work for you but we are firing you everyday….

— An anonymous in-house legal operations director, commenting quite candidly about the new [$190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/) for first-year Biglaw associates, in an interview with [Corporate Counsel](https://www.law.com/2018/06/08/the-tone-deafness-is-astounding-clients-unhappy-about-milbank-associate-raise-announcement/).

We invite you as Axiom will debut its 2nd annual diversity report and unveil its newfound mission and mandate: Diversity by Design, a programmatic framework for addressing systemic representation, retention, and advancement inequities.

- What Diversity by Design means and why it can fundamentally influence
and drive performance, innovation, and productivity.

toward increasingly larger and more substantive change for everyone in the legal ecosystem and beyond.

It’s the Monday after Thanksgiving and Biglaw bonus season has kicked into high gear! The annual tradition lets associates at Biglaw firms know just how big their bonuses will be and this year, in addition to year-end bonuses, the elite of Biglaw have also thrown in special “2020 was awful” bonuses to add to the joy of the season.

Today, Fried Frank announced year-end bonuses, in line with the prevailing market rate. The bonus scale is as follows ([you can read the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/fried-frank-bonues/2/)):

It’s nice to see that Fried Frank has done right by their associates by (finally) ponying up the money for special bonuses. Back in the fall, Fried Frank was [among the Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/fried-frank-no-bonuses/) to delay [COVID appreciation bonuses.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) But now all is right with the world as associates will receive market rate special bonuses starting at $7,500 and increasing to $40,000, depending on class year, which are in addition to the year-end bonus numbers.

The year-end bonuses are subject to the firm’s standard criteria (2,000 hours comprised of billable hours, firm matter hours, pro bono hours — including 20 mandatory — and qualifying non-billable hours), but the good news is that the special bonuses are free from any productivity requirements. Also, all associates “are again eligible to receive a premium of 15% or 30% above the year-end bonus amount for their class.” Though the requirements for this extra money aren’t set out in the memo, one imagines extra high billers are those in the front of the line for them.

All bonuses will be paid on December 31st.

Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match! Which top Biglaw firm is the latest to match the now prevailing Cravath salary scale?

It’s Ropes & Gray. Hot on the heels of the announcement of its [enhanced parental leave program](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/elite-biglaw-firm-offers-up-to-22-weeks-paid-leave-with-its-enhanced-parental-leave-program/), the firm had another major announcement. (Told ya so!)

Last Wednesday, the firm [matched the Davis Polk salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/ropes-raise-2022/), and this Wednesday, it’s matching the Cravath salary scale. Here’s what that looks like:

Class year	New 2022 base salary
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$295,000
2017	$345,000
2016	$370,000
2015	$400,000

# Navigating ESG Questionnaires: A Strategic Approach For B2B Companies
## This challenge is not going away.

In the rapidly evolving business landscape, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations have become a focal point for companies across industries. The surge in ESG questionnaires, especially for B2B companies, is indicative of a larger trend — sustainability is no longer an option; it’s a business imperative. If your company isn’t equipped to respond to these inquiries effectively, you risk more than just a missed opportunity; it could impact your competitiveness, client relationships, and even pricing negotiations.

The Rising Tide Of ESG Questionnaires

B2B companies find themselves grappling with an ever-increasing number of complex ESG questionnaires. Whether they arrive with a Request for Proposals (RFP) or as an unexpected request from an existing client, these inquiries are a testament to the growing importance of sustainability in the business world. The challenge intensifies when companies lack a structured system for responding to these questionnaires and, subsequently, fail to provide compelling answers.

This challenge is not going away. If anything, it will escalate. Companies (including your prospects and clients) are collecting data on their supply chains to bolster their sustainability reports — driven by both market demand and impending regulations. In this landscape, having robust answers to ESG questions is not just about compliance. It’s a strategic move to stay competitive.

Turning Challenges Into Opportunities

Smart, strategic choices can transform the ESG questionnaire conundrum into an opportunity for growth and differentiation. Focus on building a sustainability program that aligns with your company’s maturity and risk profile. If you are just getting started, here are a few actions for 2024:

The first step is crucial — training your leadership team on ESG fundamentals. Leaders need to have a solid understanding of ESG and sustainability to effectively communicate with investors and clients. This step not only fosters internal commitment but also positions your company as one that takes these issues seriously.

- Climate Action
Climate is at the forefront. Complete a high-quality carbon footprint measurement that can be shared publicly. This not only provides valuable data but also sets the stage for tangible actions to reduce your environmental impact. And without this, any ESG program you start will lack credibility.

- ESG/Sustainability Policies
Formalizing your commitment to ESG through policy documents will check a lot of boxes on most questionnaires. It demonstrates that you have thought about the issues and committed to addressing them. Policy documents do not have to be long, but they should cover key topics like ethics, climate, human rights, and DEI. These documents can become a reference point for internal decision-making and an asset when clients inquire about your sustainability practices.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
- ESG/Sustainability Governance
This is not a temporary blip. You won’t be able to “solve ESG” with a one-time push. Companies have made commitments in this area extending to 2050, and sustainability measures are becoming mandatory for the private sector under emerging regulations. Your company needs a permanent sustainability leadership approach to ensure that you keep pace as this area continues to evolve. Identify an executive who is responsible for reporting to the leadership team and the board on ESG issues and progress and provide a budget. Ensure this executive has cross-functional support. Setting up proper ESG governance will help ensure transparency and facilitate a systematic approach to addressing ESG concerns and tracking improvements.

The Road Ahead

If you start now and take consistent steps, you will be amazed at what you can accomplish in a year. Incremental progress, guided by a clear commitment from leadership, can lead to long-term positive impacts on your company’s reputation, stakeholder relationships, and overall sustainability.

In a business landscape where ESG considerations are becoming a competitive differentiator, your ability to provide thoughtful, meaningful responses to ESG questionnaires is critical. It’s not just about compliance; it’s about demonstrating your company’s commitment to responsible and sustainable business practices. So, equip your team, measure your impact, document your policies, and establish oversight — these steps will not only prepare you for the current wave of ESG questionnaires but position your company as a leader in the evolving landscape of sustainable business.
