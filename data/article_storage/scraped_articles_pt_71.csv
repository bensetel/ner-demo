# Biglaw Firm Apologizes For Embarrassing Redaction Error
## Oopsie!

This technical weakness in the redaction process was caused by the method of redaction, which involved Microsoft Word and printing to Adobe Acrobat, rather than the redaction software our law firm has in place that is specifically designed to avoid such issues. The failure to use this software was inadvertent oversight….

We very much regret that this incident occurred and can assure the court that it will not happen again.

— Jones Day partner [James Wooley](https://www.jonesday.com/en/lawyers/w/james-wooley), in an apology letter written to Judge Pamela Meade Sargent of the Western District of Virginia, after the firm was ordered to explain how it[ exposed secret grand jury information in a court filing](https://www.law.com/2019/09/13/jones-day-apologizes-for-botched-filing-that-revealed-grand-jury-info/) lest its attorneys face sanctions. Though Wooley claimed the original filing looked redacted on its face, a reporter was able to simply copy and paste the text of the blacked-out boxes into a new document to read what was supposed to be redacted.

# Stats Of The Week: San Antonio To $462K!
## That $180K goes a looong way in some of the markets affected by the MoneyLaw increases.

Last week, our friends at Lateral Link [pondered the implications](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/is-ny-to-180k-hurting-the-new-york-market/?rf=1) of the MoneyLaw arms race, finding that the new $180K standard “could soften the market as starting salaries are pushed up in other major markets, making New York’s compensation comparatively weaker when adjusted for inflation.”

One imagines that, outside New York, the legal community’s reaction to this possibility involved pretending to play a very small violin and wiping away imaginary insincere tears. Using this [CNN calculator](http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/) (based on the [C2ER cost of living index](https://www.c2er.org/)), it’s fun and somewhat astonishing to see what the new standard means in non-NYC terms. Here’s a sampling of the comparable value in some other MoneyLaw markets:

- $180,000 in Wilmington, DE (e.g., Paul Weiss) is equivalent to $382,712 in Manhattan
- Providence RI (Weil Gotshal): $329,635
- Charlotte, NC (Winston & Strawn): $422,056
- Houston, TX (Baker Botts): $415,158
- San Antonio, TX (Akin Gump): $462,916

Here, let’s use this picture instead.

Hughes Hubbard partner [Steven Hammond](https://www.hugheshubbard.com/attorneys/steven-hammond) is due in court today, but not on behalf of one of his top-shelf complex litigation clients, but to answer a public lewdness charge that he allegedly masturbated in the steam room at the Wall Street Equinox gym while staring at a health club employee.

The employee claims Hammond leered at him while working the little litigator. Hammond calls the accusation “a complete fabrication” [according to the NY Post](https://nypost.com/2018/08/25/lawyer-accused-of-masturbating-in-gym-while-staring-at-employee/).

The employee called the cops, which makes sense if you thought a dude was trying to masturbate in public, but here’s the rub: the cops nabbed Hammond at 4:30 a.m. That seems like a dick move. Not to downplay public lewdness but non-violent crimes can wait until the morning. Hammond’s effort to clear his name and prove he wasn’t “scolding the junior associate” in public begins in earnest today.

Personally, I don’t see the purpose of a steam room. It seems like a way to pretend you’re working out while actually sitting down. The whole thing is an exercise in poserism drenched in oppressively muggy conditions. It’s basically “Florida: The Ride.” If it’s also just an old man jack off chamber that… only makes it more like Florida.

# White Professor Who Wore Blackface Teaching About Race Because There Are No Consequences For Anything Anymore

In 2016, an Oregon Law School professor, [Nancy Shurtz,](https://law.uoregon.edu/explore/nancy-shurtz) surveyed the wide panoply of Halloween costume ideas and decided her [best bet was to go in blackface](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/its-after-halloween-so-of-course-we-have-to-talk-about-law-professors-wearing-blackface/). Shurtz, apparently, enjoyed a book titled “[Black Man In A White Coat](https://amzn.to/2K8Shw2)” (affiliate link), an account of racism in the medical profession and, without noting any possible irony, decided the appropriate way to honor this work would be to caricature the author with Amos & Andy-level precision. It’s hard to claim that this was an innocent homage to the author and not an effort to play with stereotypes when she topped the costume with an afro wig.

It was a transgression so bold that one wondered if she was engaged in a George Costanza drive to walk away from Oregon Law with people saying, “Wow, now that woman got canned.”

In the immediate aftermath of the event, 23 of her faculty colleagues called upon her to resign, noting that, however innocent she envisioned her intent, such a reckless breach of basic decency and community respect required her stepping down.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

She didn’t. Now she’s teaching a class about race because we really do live in a consequence-free society. The Oregon Law community is less than pleased.

Nancy Shurtz is returning to Oregon Law. Oregon hired outside counsel who concluded she did violate school policy, but they opted to not fire her. The law school did not inform the students of her return, and we only learned because her name was back on the schedule. Furthermore, she is teaching Women and the Law, a passive way for the university to say female students of color don’t matter.

Oh, I don’t know if it’s all that “passive.” It seems like a pretty active statement to me.

Frankly, it’s impressive that the school determined that Professor Shurtz [violated school policy](http://projects.registerguard.com/rg/news/local/35107648-75/university-of-oregon-professor-who-wore-blackface-found-to-have-violated-anti-harassment-policies.html.csp). Throughout this ordeal, the fact that she wore her costume only at an off-campus, unsanctioned party seemed like a slam dunk for avoiding official repercussions. But she did invite students to the party and that crosses the line into racial harassment.

But that finding — which gave the school all the cover in the world to take action — wasn’t enough apparently. So now she’s back teaching about intersectionality:

Women and the Law description:
This seminar examines the effects of law on women and women on the law from historical, doctrinal, and theoretical perspectives. It explores feminist method; the difference dilemma; the omission of women’s voices with a focus on intersectionality with race, class and sexual orientation; equality analysis; pregnancy and the workplace; fetal rights; rape; and battered women who kill and are killed.

I thought a bit about Professor Shurtz’s story over the weekend after reading Kevin Williamson’s laughably bad Wall Street Journal piece, “[When the Twitter Mob Came For Me](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-the-twitter-mob-came-for-me-1524234850).” Williamson, the professional troll fired from the Atlantic when people pointed out that he has a soft spot for promoting violence against women, carried on at length about how journalism has failed because reporters had the audacity to hold a professional writer to the words he wrote. The nerve!

Williamson and Shurtz likely have very little in common, but Williamson’s ode to white male fragility highlighted the one thing ever-present in these stories: there’s always an excuse. It’s always a joke, it’s always “not what it looks like,” it’s always “not a big deal if I can just explain myself.” Sometimes there actually are innocent explanations, but there’s a big difference between “yeah, but” and “no, because.” There’s just no end to the deferral of that responsibility.

And no wonder, when there are institutions like Oregon Law more than willing to enable this cycle.

# Biglaw Firm's Southern Expansion Strategy Now Includes A Merger
## The firm is adding 130 lawyers.

Fox Rothschild is getting bigger — to the tune of 130 additional lawyers. As [reported](https://www.law.com/2018/09/20/fox-rothschild-to-merge-with-north-carolina-firm-gaining-130-lawyers/) by Law.com, they’re acquiring Smith Moore Leatherwood, a North Carolina-based firm.

Taking on the additional overhead is part of a larger strategy for Fox Rothschild. The Philadelphia-based firm has been looking to grow down south for a while now:

“Expanding our footprint in the Southeast through this merger is an important milestone for the firm,” Fox Rothschild chairman Mark Silow said in a statement. “We have explored opportunities in this region for many years and are delighted to have found in Smith Moore Leatherwood a firm with a superb roster of talented attorneys who share our values, our approach to client service and our entrepreneurial focus.”

As for Smith Moore, they believe combination makes sense as Fox Rothschild has a wider range of services it can now offer to their client base:

“Now, as part of a prominent Am Law 100 firm, we can offer a broader range of services while continuing to deliver the personal touch and dedication that are the hallmarks of our firm,” Smith Moore managing partner Julie Theall Earp said in a statement.

Over the last few years, Fox Rothschild has expanded through a series of mergers including the 82 lawyers they picked up from Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly, a merger with 39-lawyer Riddell Williams, and they added 23 during the Shaw Fishman Glantz & Towbin acquisition. Though, obviously, the size of this merger outpaces the others.

Biglaw firms across the country are implementing all manner of initiatives to bring attention to the importance of diversity and inclusion among their ranks. We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/5-concrete-steps-law-firms-can-take-to-advance-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-25-biglaw-firm-offers-bonus-eligible-diversity-inclusion-billable-hours/), [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-5-biglaw-firm-raises-the-bar-on-billable-diversity-inclusion-hours/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/top-biglaw-firm-offers-associates-100-billables-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), [Locke Lord](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-75-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/), and [Foley Hoag](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-offers-associates-unlimited-billable-hours-for-diversity-inclusion-work/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We just received word that yet another Biglaw firm has rolled out a similar program to show just how dedicated it is to furthering diversity and inclusion within the legal profession.

K&L Gates — a firm that brought in $1,019,674,000 gross revenue in 2020 — recently announced that all attorneys across its global offices would be able to receive up to 50 hours of billable credit for their qualifying internal and external diversity and inclusion work. Here’s an excerpt from the firm’s press release on its new policy:

Any lawyer, regardless of their background, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, gender, gender expression, gender identity, or sexual orientation, in any of the firm’s offices can earn diversity hours under the new policy.

Lawyers can receive credit for their participation in a broad range of diversity and inclusion activities, including, among others, assistance with recruiting diverse or women candidates; involvement in mentoring/pipeline activities for diverse or women law students; engagement in external programs specifically aimed at the mentoring, training, or recruitment of diverse or women law students; presenting at internal diversity and inclusion professional development activities; participating on firm diversity or [Women in Profession] WIP committees; presenting or participating in external diversity or WIP-focused seminars, conferences, or publications; leadership or other substantive work in diversity or WIP programs; and involvement in activities aimed at connecting with diverse client contacts.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Jim Segerdahl, K&L Gates Global Managing Partner, emphasized that having a diverse and inclusive workforce was “critical” to the firm’s success and the success of its lawyers. “Investing time in activities that further promote diversity and inclusion at our firm and within its surrounding communities is an integral part of sustaining these important core values of the firm and helping to make us a stronger organization,” he said. “So it only makes sense that we allow lawyers engaging in these activities across the globe to be credited for some of their hours in this arena, recognizing their efforts and importance of this work.”

Congratulations to K&L Gates on its commitment to diversity, and for offering its attorneys a way to create a better workplace. What an admirable way to support diversity and inclusion efforts.

## The gunman was killed by law enforcement, and no other serious injuries were reported.

On Monday, a heavily armed man opened fired on the Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse in Dallas, Texas. Law enforcement shot and killed the assailant, and no one else was seriously injured in the incident. The shooter was later identified as 22-year-old Army veteran Brian Isaack Clyde. Images from the incident were captured by Dallas Morning News photographer Tom Fox, who was at the courthouse to cover a trial, and posted on Twitter.

Fox was waiting to enter the building to cover a trial when the attack took place. [https://t.co/y8fWYYuKjs](https://t.co/y8fWYYuKjs) [pic.twitter.com/fE1kFlEy9j](https://t.co/fE1kFlEy9j)

Also at the courthouse that fateful morning was Thompson & Knight partner [Rich Phillips](https://www.tklaw.com/people/rich-phillips). As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/06/18/thompson-knight-partner-saw-bullets-hit-the-building-as-shooter-attacked-texas-courthouse/) Law.com, Phillips had a trial scheduled at 9:30 a.m., and was heading into the parking garage at 8:40 a.m. when the shooting began.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“I saw bullets hit the side of the building. I could see puffs of smoke from the stonework,” Phillips said. “Then he got to the door and started firing into the glass.”

None of it seemed real as Phillips ducked behind his dashboard. When he peeked back up moments later, the view was terrifying.

“He had turned from the door of the courthouse and crossed the street and was coming in the parking lot and was basically coming right towards me,” he explained. “For a second, I didn’t know what to do. He didn’t take but a few steps into the parking lot when he hit the pavement and dropped down. He kind of hit the ground and then rolled. I didn’t know if he had been shot and that’s why he hit the ground, or that he was trying to avoid getting shot and was going to crawl around and use the cars as a shield.”

Phillips’ fight or flight response then kicked in.

“I put the car in reverse and backed out of the driveway and took off down Wood Street. I remember feeling it took forever to get the car into gear, although I’m sure it was half a second or so. I was breathing hard and still trying to figure out what just happened,” he said.

Phillips returned to give police his statement. He then had to walk to the Thompson & Knight offices, as his car was within the established police perimeter.

Also watching the incident was paralegal Julianna Gravois, who watched the incident unfold from the window of her firm’s offices:

“I watched the whole thing,” she recalled. “It was just like 10, 15 or 20 shots, something like that, just in rapid succession. … Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.”

An Army spokesperson confirmed Clyde served as infantryman from August 2015 to February 2017. He’d recently graduated from Del Mar College with an associate’s degree in nondestructive testing technology, and was recognized for his outstanding academic performance.

Law enforcement have not yet revealed the motive behind the attack.

# Biglaw Partner Intervenes After Witnessing Police Assault A Motorist
## Once the lawyer showed up, the officer went from kicking the driver to shaking his hand.

Deborah Baker-Egozi

When cops started preaching “if you see something, say something,” this is pretty much the opposite of what they intended. The slogan was rolled out as part of the country’s terrorism response and meant to increase white America’s surveillance of people of color. But in this story, when [Deborah Baker-Egozi](https://www.gmlaw.com/attorneys/deborah-baker-egozi/), partner at Am Law 200 firm Greenspoon Marder, witnessed police violently kicking a motorist with his hands up, she used the advocacy skills she’d honed as a seasoned litigator to intervene and defuse the situation.

Baker-Egozi was leaving a courthouse in Miami when she says she heard someone screaming. She says she saw a traffic stop, one where a police officer was screaming in the face of the motorist — of course it was a person of color. The officer was getting increasingly irate, and Baker-Egozi describes the driver as calm and compliant with his hands in the air. According to a [report](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/09/i-saw-you-kick-him-greenspoon-marder-partner-intervenes-in-alleged-police-abuse/) by Law.com, when the encounter transitioned from verbal to physical assault, she felt she had to intervene:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“The kid was totally complying. His hands were in the air, his back was to the officer, and the officer kicked him — hard,” Baker-Egozi said. “He had to gear up to do it.”

She began recording the encounter and, as she describes in a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/deborah.baker.5811), she offered to represent the driver. Once police became aware a lawyer had watched what happened, the entire tenor of the encounter changed. Suddenly friendly and accommodating, the officer went from kicking the driver to shaking his hand:

I witnessed a police officer’s traffic stop walking back from court today. Brown driver, black passenger. The driver had his hands on his head, was following orders and was silent. The cop kicked him and screamed at him for over a minute an inch away from the kid’s face.

I yelled to the kid who got kicked that I would be his attorney if he said yes, and he did. The cop then screamed at me to tell me the kids had only been detained for a routine traffic violation and asked me if I observed them being arrested. I told him that I observed him kicking the driver and that the criteria for hiring counsel is not an arrest. He didn’t know an attorney witnessed his unjustified violence and backed off these poor kids and then started being really nice. He canceled his reinforcements, and by the end was shaking hands being nice to the kids. What if I wasn’t there?

What could have happened if Baker-Egozi had chosen apathy instead of advocacy? The families of Sandra Bland, Philando Castile and far too many others know all too well that a traffic stop can turn deadly when you aren’t white.

Baker-Egozi says there was no option to ignore what was happening in front of her. She calls it her duty as a lawyer:

“Advocacy has always been part of my M.O.,” or modus operandi, she said. “If a lawyer is walking by and can offer assistance to victims of police violence … it’s our duty to do something about it.”

This shouldn’t be taken as a narrative of a white savior swooping in and saving a person of color. Instead, Baker-Egozi acted the way any human with the skills and experience to stop a bad situation from getting worse should behave. It shouldn’t be that hard or something we need to applaud when someone does the right thing. But here we are — welcome to 2018.

# Making A Lateral Move Without A Recruiter? Beware Of Conflicts
## Ideally, you will sail through the conflicts check. But if you hit a snag, having a credible recruiter on your side can be critical to bringing the process to a successful conclusion.

“Susie” is a midlevel Biglaw associate who has worked at the same firm since she graduated law school. She’s had a good run, but a few months ago she decided it was time to move on. Her practice area is in demand, and she’s acquired solid experience at her current firm, so she figured it shouldn’t be too hard for her to get a lateral offer without help from a recruiter.

In the months since she decided to make a move, Susie has drafted her materials, researched and applied to potential new firms, prepared for and completed three rounds of interviews at her top-choice firm, and received an offer. All good, right? But there’s a catch. The new firm needs a list of every matter Susie has handled at her current firm. She now has to gather all of that information (preferably without tipping off her current firm). Fingers crossed there isn’t an unresolvable client conflict!

Identifying past matters

The first thing Susie should do is go back in time and set up a running tab of clients/matters she has worked on. If Susie had kept such a list throughout her current firm tenure, her task now would be considerably easier. She would be able to submit the conflicts form quickly, speeding the new firm’s review process and (assuming no conflicts were found) making it possible for Susie to give notice at her current firm sooner.

(Incidentally, a running tab of matters is useful for many purposes beyond lateral recruiting: updating your firm bio, future networking, aiding in conflicts checks for your group, impressing partners in your group with institutional knowledge…. It’s never too late to start assembling your list!) 

Because Susie doesn’t have her list at hand, she will need to consult other sources. The most precise method is to scan through billable hour reports, which some firms give out monthly as a matter of course. Note, however, that accessing the reports through a firm database can be risky because some firms have alerts set for when associates pull this information. Given the risk of tipping off the current firm, lateral candidates tend to default to scanning through old emails to identify clients/matters. This is easier said than done, particularly for more senior associates who have worked on dozens of transactions (100+ matters is not uncommon!).

Wait time for a conflicts check

The duration of a conflicts check depends on both the candidate and the firm. The sooner the candidate returns the conflicts form, the sooner the firm’s process can begin. A recruiter likely would have advised Susie to start identifying all of her clients for conflicts purposes at latest after she passed the second interview with the new firm. By waiting until after she received an offer, Susie has introduced an unnecessary source of delay.

On the firm side, Susie will be at the mercy of her new firm’s conflicts department. These departments are often short-staffed, with frequent turnover. They must juggle competing priorities: in addition to clearing lateral associate conflicts, the department will be responsible for clearing conflicts for a partner’s potential new business. The partners are typically prioritized. The upshot is that Susie’s wait time is hard to predict: it could be 3-4 days, but it could also be two weeks. Clearing conflicts almost always takes longer than a background check.

Getting a waiver

Let’s imagine the conflicts department identifies a conflict between one of Susie’s former clients and an important current client of a partner at the new firm. What now?

There are various ways this can go. One factor may be Susie’s jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions allow a firewall to be created without notifying the potentially conflicted client, but still give that client the ability to object later. Firms tend to be wary of this situation, requiring that the affected partner grant approval before proceeding with the hire. Other jurisdictions require an actual waiver from the client in question. Where a waiver is necessary, the new firm will most often contact the client to request it. But not always.

We have occasionally seen cases where firms ask candidates to seek a waiver themselves.  Do not do this without talking to your recruiter first! It might not even be necessary. In this worst-case scenario, the hiring firm asks the candidate to go to the current-firm partner responsible for the client, admit their intention to leave the firm, and seek the partner’s help in contacting the right person at the client to request the waiver. In one particularly extreme case, it took over two months for the client to make its decision to grant the waiver.

In these situations, having a recruiter on your side can make a real difference. Sometimes conflicts supervisors aren’t fully informed about the nuances of ethics rules in every jurisdiction — we have occasionally helped draw their attention to exceptions that helped smooth the process. More broadly, we know what standard practice looks like, and when a firm makes an unreasonable request, we are in a strong position to push back.

Special considerations for partners

If Susie were a partner, the conflicts question would be even more consequential. Successfully clearing conflicts can make or break a lateral partner’s ability to port over business. It’s critical that lateral partner candidates get accurate advice, with full documentation, before committing to a new firm. If there is any uncertainty about conflicts, waivers, or any other ethics matter, the wisest course is to talk to your recruiter; if needed, they can refer you to a skilled attorney for advice. (This likely will not be expensive: often the cost is below $1000.)

For example, “John” was negotiating a lateral move without the assistance of a recruiter. He took the word of someone at his new firm who assured him that a conflict would not be an issue — unfortunately, he didn’t get that assurance in writing. Lo and behold, it became an issue, and John was not able to port over his client. The situation didn’t prevent him from practicing at the new firm, but it did hinder his ability to hit his promised numbers.

A recruiter would have advised John not to make a move without formally documenting the mutual understanding that he could serve this client at the new firm. In the absence of such written assurance, the recruiter would have recommended John consider alternative firms.

The value of having seen it before

An individual lawyer will make, at most, a handful of lateral moves in his or her career. Given that context, it’s entirely understandable that a candidate would be unaware of common conflicts pitfalls. If you are considering a lateral move, don’t assume the best-case scenario. Issues can easily arise. When they do, an experienced recruiter will be well-positioned to help you navigate the situation. We know what is normal, the traps that can be avoided with advance planning, and how to manage unexpected complications. Ideally, you will sail through the conflicts check. But if you hit a snag, having a credible recruiter on your side can be critical to bringing the process to a successful conclusion.

# Our Misunderstanding Of New Technologies
## We don't always guess right about technology.

In the early 1900s, at the dawn of the age of automobiles, horseless carriages were supposed to be a godsend. Horse-drawn carriages were long; automobiles were short; the advent of the automobile would thus decrease urban congestion. And horse-drawn carriages left real, tangible pollution on city streets; automobiles sent off only a whiff of smoke into the air; the advent of the automobile would decrease pollution.

Less urban congestion and less pollution! The automobile would be a godsend indeed!

We don’t always guess right about technology.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
When Robert Moses was first thinking about his plan to develop New York City, automobiles puttered along at about 20 miles per hour, and drivers loved to look around and enjoy the views. So Moses put the Riverside Drive and other roads along the waterfronts, where drivers of the 1920s could enjoy their outings. (If you live in the Midwest, think about Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. Same deal.) In 2021, with cars that travel 70 miles per hour, we feel as though we’ve wasted the waterfronts, and no one in the cars is enjoying the view.

In the 1990s, at the dawn of the age of the cellphone, many people were certain cellphones wouldn’t catch on: Surely, when people made phone calls, people wanted privacy. People would insist on the confines of a phone booth; there’s no way they’d sit in public and talk on phones.

We don’t always guess right about technology.

So, too, with the internet. At the dawn of the internet age, people were certain that the internet would permit anyone to speak directly to large audiences. The intermediaries were gone. Without those intermediaries, a wealth of diverse viewpoints would emerge, to the betterment of all.

But we didn’t realize that algorithms run by artificial intelligence would cause many of us to hear only our own thoughts reverberating constantly in the echo chambers of our computers. Nor did we realize that one way to attract a readership in the highly competitive internet world would be to become increasingly shrill, insisting that those who disagreed were not just wrong, but evil.

We don’t always guess right about technology.

But we do often recover from those early missteps.

Here’s hoping.

# Pickleball, Pancakes, And PhDs – Balancing Law And Life
## Think you need to sacrifice one thing for the other? Think again.

There is much to be said for a career in law: the intellectual stimulation of operating at the cutting edge of corporate America, helping big businesses overcome challenges that matter, all while being handsomely rewarded for your efforts. But many of us have to make sacrifices to enjoy those upsides, managing long hours in a high pressure environment that might take us away from our family life and other interests more than we would like it to.

There is another way though, and the truth is you don’t have to sacrifice your life for your work or put your dreams on hold in order to climb the career ladder. Are there things you’ve always wanted to do or places you’ve always wanted to visit? Do you wish you could scale that mountain, perfect that sport or smash that new side hustle?

[Peerpoint](https://bit.ly/3sZTctu), international law firm Allen & Overy’s flexible resourcing business, has been helping lawyers all over the world to build exceptional careers alongside fulfilling lives for almost a decade. Peerpoint has hundreds of top-tier attorneys on its panel, many of whom are finding ways to pursue their passions in addition to their legal careers. By stepping away from the traditional career track in favor of consulting assignments and project work, it is possible for attorneys to get the buzz and challenge of the law without the less appealing sacrifice and daily grind.

Picture things differently

For David Slade, a senior projects and infrastructure attorney based in Washington DC, working with Peerpoint has been an opportunity to get the best of both worlds. “I have always loved my career as a lawyer,” he says, “but there’s a lot of pressure, and at times the legal side of my brain can get a bit heavy. The only way to keep that in check has been to find time for the other side of my brain to pursue its passion, which in my case is art.”

As well as painting landscapes in oil, David has recently retired and started stretching his artistic skills to create whimsical pancakes for his grandchildren, publishing a book about their fun exploits called Puppy’s Pancakes. Despite being busy marketing his oil paintings to a wider audience and conducting his first art exhibition, he has also re-engaged as a lawyer on a part-time basis after the legal side of his brain got twitchy. “A life dedicated solely to the arts can lack some of the buzz and excitement that can only come from the continued pursuit of my legal career,” he says.

Second time around

Ruth Karfiol Glazer is an experienced corporate lawyer based in New York and Connecticut who worked at international law firms and as general counsel at a major corporation before stepping back to raise her children full time.

“As I became an empty nester, I decided I wanted to relaunch my legal career,” says Ruth. “However, my outlook had changed since I was younger and I wanted to continue to find a work-life balance so that I could practice law and also have time to enjoy my hobbies and travelling with my husband.”

On her first Peerpoint assignment, Ruth worked on secondment to an international bank, advising on innovative commercial transactions and grappling with challenging negotiations. She loved teaming up again with highly intelligent and skilled attorneys who were enjoyable to work with every day, but she also relishes time spent away from being a lawyer. Ruth says: “In addition to spending time with my family and traveling, I enjoy playing pickleball and ping pong – so far neither has ruined my swing for the other! I also love performing in community theater.”

No sacrifice

There are plenty of other examples on Peerpoint’s books of hard-working, brilliant legal minds finding time to do other things as well. One real estate lawyer has just completed a part-time PhD about mediating whistle-blowing, while also finding time to volunteer at a legal advice clinic.

Peerpoint has another attorney who, when not on assignment, is training and competing in Brazilian jujitsu, hoping to make it to the world championships. Others find space to practice as yoga instructors or undertake advanced tailoring courses.

And then there are the international opportunities as well – just ask Lauren, an experienced capital markets lawyer who, when not lawyering, has recently travelled to Korea to learn the language and also built a publishing business, or [read about](https://bit.ly/3PlTzGf) Vanessa, who does Wall Street work remotely while living by the beach in Australia. Since Covid, Peerpoint has seen its clients become much more open-minded about working with top talent that may be based far away from city zip codes but can nevertheless meet their needs remotely.

Pursuing interim opportunities with Peerpoint also comes with the wrap-around resources and support you’d expect from a top tier global law firm. Being independent doesn’t mean going it alone.

If you’re ready to get your priorities in order and want to find that perfect balance then contact Peerpoint at [talent.us@peerpoint.com](mailto:talent.us@peerpoint.com?subject=Above%20The%20Law%20-%20Connecting%20with%20Peerpoint%20) or find out more [here!](https://bit.ly/3rbHmfo)

# West Coast Firm Bumps Salaries In All Offices
## A little more cash in some smaller markets.

It’s not a match of the top Biglaw salary scale, but no one expected that. Am Law second hundred firm Stoel Rives has DC and Minnesota offices, but the heart of the firm is out West. So when Stoel speaks about compensation, it’s giving us a window into where smaller markets like Portland and Salt Lake are going.

And the answer is: up a tad.

In an email from managing partner Melissa Jones, associates were informed that they’d be seeing a bump at all levels.

Are you getting tired of constantly refreshing your inbox to see if your firm has announced bonuses yet? For associates at firms that were early adopters of the Cravath bonus scale, it’s much the same as they wait and wonder when they’ll see a match of Davis Polk’s special bonuses.

That seems to be what’s happening at Morrison & Foerster, which came in at No. 34 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, with $1,165,000,000 gross revenue in last year. The firm announced its Cravath match way back on December 3, and its bonus scale should look awfully familiar:

MoFo is once again offering its client service awards to associates who went “above and beyond” when it came to serving the firm’s clients. These awards take the form of over-market bonuses for those with 2500 legal service hours or more, calculated as a percentage of class-year bonuses. Last year, these bonus awards generally ranged from 30% to 55% of class-year bonuses for those who billed a lot.

Congratulations to everyone at MoFo on their bonuses! Hopefully you won’t have to wait too much longer for a Davis Polk special bonus match.

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Morrison & Foerster.)

See the answer on the next page.

# Managing Maternity Leave As Managing Partner
## There's a double standard when it comes to female lawyers having children -- and this managing partner knows it.

There’s still these leftover views in society that once a woman has children … she’s less serious about her career. But when a man has children, the assumption is that he’s more serious about his career. Until we shake these underlying views and that bias, women are always going to be seen as less invested in their careers.

— [Kim Buffington](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/kimberly-buffington.html), managing partner of Pillsbury’s Los Angeles office, commenting on the double standard that exists in the legal profession when it comes to childrearing and work/life balance. Buffington was asked to become her office’s managing partner while she was [out on maternity leave](https://bol.bna.com/returning-from-maternity-leave-as-managing-partner/) last summer.

Prosecutors in New Mexico announced today that Alec Baldwin will be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Halyna Hutchins, 42, cinematographer of the film “Rust.” The movie’s armorer, who handled and loaded the gun, faces similar charges.

“On my watch, no one is above the law, and everyone deserves justice,” said New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies.

If you’re not familiar with the case, let’s take a step back and do a rewind on our prior coverage. In October 2021, Baldwin fatally shot Hutchins with a prop gun while on the movie’s set. As we [previously noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/cinematographer-shot-by-alec-baldwin-was-wife-of-latham-watkins-associate/), Matt Hutchins, Halyna’s husband, is a corporate associate in the Los Angeles office of Latham & Watkins. The widower quickly lawyered up, hiring Panish Shea Boyle Ravipudi, an L.A.-based plaintiffs’ firm specializing in wrongful-death litigation. He officially [filed suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-widower-of-halyna-hutchins-hires-firm-specialing-in-wrongful-death-suits/) last February. Hutchins reached a [confidential settlement](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-widower-of-halyna-hutchins-reaches-settlement-with-alec-baldwin-in-wrongful-death-suit/) in October 2022 with Baldwin, the film’s production companies, its producers, and other key members of the crew.

The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/arts/rust-shooting-charges-alec-baldwin.html) refers to the new criminal charges as a “remarkable development” in Baldwin’s career. Luke Nikas, a lawyer for Baldwin, offered this statement on his client’s behalf:

“This decision distorts Halyna Hutchins’s tragic death and represents a terrible miscarriage of justice. Mr. Baldwin had no reason to believe there was a live bullet in the gun — or anywhere on the movie set. He relied on the professionals with whom he worked, who assured him the gun did not have live rounds. We will fight these charges, and we will win.”

One of the professionals Baldwin worked with, Dave Halls, the film’s first assistant director, who handed the actor the gun, plans to plead guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon, in exchange for a suspended sentence. Jason Bowles, a lawyer for armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who loaded the gun on the day of the shooting tragedy, had this to say of the manslaughter charges against her: “Hannah is, and has always been, very emotional and sad about this tragic accident. But she did not commit involuntary manslaughter. These charges are the result of a very flawed investigation, and an inaccurate understanding of the full facts. We intend to bring the full truth to light and believe Hannah will be exonerated of wrongdoing by a jury.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In New Mexico, involuntary manslaughter is considered a fourth-degree felony that carries with it up to 18 months behind bars as well as a $5,000 fine. A firearm enhancement on the charges would mean that if convicted, Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed would face five years behind bars.

Brian J. Panish, a lawyer for Matt Hutchins, released this statement on his client’s behalf:

“It is a comfort to the family that, in New Mexico, no one is above the law. We support the charges, will fully cooperate with this prosecution, and fervently hope the justice system works to protect the public and hold accountable those who break the law.”

We will continue our coverage of this case as new details emerge.

# American Lawyer Wonders Why More Men Don't Take Paternity Leave Days After Advising Lawyers Not To Take Parental Leave

Consider this a new application of that classic slice of legalese, “asked and answered.”

In an [article earlier this week](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/24/rate-of-men-taking-paternity-leave-falls-again/), Vivia Chen wrote an interesting article pointing out that statistics show that men everywhere are turning down paternity leave, even as firms are increasingly expanding family leave policies to provide men with more opportunities to bond with a new child. Data collected in the UK paint a typically bleak picture when it comes to paternity leave usage:

Recent statistics suggest men aren’t jumping on the paternity leave wagon with enthusiasm. Here’s the news coming out of the U.K.: [Less than one in three (31%) new fathers take paternity leave](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/paternity-leave-new-fathers-less-third-not-taking-a8992086.html), reports The Independent, based on data from HMRC [Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs], collected by British law firm [EMW Law](https://www.emwllp.com/).

Chen also points out that studies show that men who go on paternity leave are also less likely to want more kids and posits a theory for why men are keeping on the clock:

So staying home for an extended period of time to change diapers, clean up puke and cater to a fussy child isn’t what it’s cracked up to be? Ha!
…
I’m not quite sure what this all means, but it seems to suggests (again) that men aren’t quite as woke and evolved as we had hoped they’d be at this point in human evolution.

But tell me if I’m drawing the wrong conclusion.

You’re drawing the wrong conclusion.

And to back up that claim, one need look no further than Chen’s article from last Friday, “[Take a Long Parental Leave and Make Partner? Dream On, Baby](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/19/take-a-long-parental-leave-and-make-partner-dream-on-baby/)“:

Though unlimited parental leave is still pretty rare, there’s evidence that people are unlikely to take extended vacations. A company “[can safely offer bottomless holidays knowing most employees will never take them, especially in the U.S.,](https://www.ft.com/content/ca935b70-bf14-11e7-9836-b25f8adaa111) [which is] the only major advanced economy in the world that does not guarantee workers paid vacation time,” writes Financial Times’ Pilita Clark, noting that “American workers took an average of 16.8 vacation days last year” and often don’t use up their vacation because of their fear of “returning to a mountain of work.”

And we all know how lawyers fear falling behind on work—which is what the profession is betting on. Pity, then, the poor fool who believes he or she can take those long, fabulous leaves and stay in good graces.

Repeat after me: Firms want to make moolah. And if you’re costing them moolah, you better move it.

This right here is why men aren’t taking paternity leave! As long as law firms aren’t viciously savaged — [if not sued](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/more-plaintiffs-added-to-astonishing-pregnancy-and-gender-discrimination-case-against-mofo/) — for trampling on parents for having the audacity to be human beings then new parents will be heavily disincentivized to take their leave at all. Given that women have just been through a much more physically grueling experience and — if they choose to breastfeed — have reason to be physically close to the baby for its early months, the mother basically has to take leave and the father… doesn’t. So when making the rational decision as a family unit knowing that there’s a sentiment — so engrained in the machismo of the legal industry that it’s asserted as a no-brainer by the legal press — that attorneys all but deserve to have their careers derailed for taking leave, then dad’s going to be the one to keep working.

Until this mindset is thoroughly undermined by peer pressure, [legal action](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/pregnancy-discrimination/), or guillotines, men just aren’t going to be taking advantage of paternity leave. Because let’s be very clear — poop and puke are always going to be better than doc review.

# Biglaw Bonus Announcements Are Coming In Like Magic

It was only this morning Above the Law was busy [touting Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/first-magic-circle-firm-matches-associate-bonuses/) as the first Magic Circle firm to announce their end-of-the-year bonuses (on a schedule that matches those [set by Cravath last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/)), but it seems another firm beat them to the punch. The ATL tipster network was apparently a little slow on this one, but, as always, our amazing readers come through.

Last week Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer announced they were giving associates in the New York and Washington D.C. offices market bonuses. Those numbers are again:

That’s pretty good news for associates (and [better PR for the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firm-raided-by-authorities-for-second-time-in-connection-with-financial-scandal/)).

# Biglaw Firm Offers Paid Compassionate Leave Program For Miscarriage And Failed Fertilty Treatments
## All firms should have benefits like this.

Here at Above the Law, we know how difficult it can be to have children and successfully return to work, so we make it a habit to applaud the expansion of Biglaw firms’ parental leave programs — especially if they’re gender neutral and applicable to all firm personnel, from staff members to associates. What we rarely have the opportunity to praise are firms that offer health benefits that include fertility treatments and family-planning services — not because these benefits don’t exist, but because they’re not publicized as often as parental leave plans are. Even rarer than that are the firms that offer leave for would-be parents who have experienced a pregnancy loss or a failed surrogacy, adoption, or fertility treatment. We now know of at least one Biglaw firm that’s offering such a new policy.

Mintz Levin recently announced that it would be expanding its compassionate leave program for attorneys and staff to include 15 days of consecutive paid leave in the wake of a miscarriage, as well as five days of paid leave every 12 months following a failed surrogacy, adoption, or fertility treatment.

The firm’s new policy was inspired by Natalie Groot, an associate who had experienced two miscarriages in just six months’ time, and went to management with her concerns. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/01/28/mintz-to-provide-paid-leave-for-miscarriage-and-failed-surrogacy-adoption-or-fertility-treatment/) has additional details:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Mintz managing partner Bob Bodian … noted that the firm empowers associates to speak up and share their ideas on policies.

“We provide a high level of communication from management to the rest of the firm, and that tends to ease mental anguish to a large extent. We’re also mindful of mental health challenges, and we try to provide employees as many resources as possible to help ease these challenges,” Bodian said.

Employees at Mintz will no longer have to “suffer this type of loss alone” thanks to management taking Groot’s suggestion to heart. The firm will also offer 15 days of paid leave to employees who lose a spouse, spousal equivalent, children, or step-children. Up to five days of leave will also be offered for the loss of other close relatives.

On top of that, Mintz now offers a ramp-up and ramp-down policy for employees who are preparing to take parental leave or are returning to work after leave, including up to 30 hours for doctors appointments. According to Bodian, this is all part of the firm’s commitment to the mental health and well-being of its employees.

Bodian said he hopes all the policies that Mintz is implementing will lead to an industrywide change toward addressing mental health and moving the needle forward.

“I’ve been practicing the law for 40 years, and I’ve always enjoyed it. But I would like to see more people enjoy it, and feel like they have a balanced life. Having people who feel good about themselves is a worthwhile goal,” he said.

Kudos to Mintz on its new suite of benefit offerings for bereaved parents and parents-to-be. This is something we’ll keep an eye on as firms continue to cater to work-life balance requests. Hopefully your firm is will decide to offer important benefit policies like these soon if it’s not doing so already.

Does your firm offer compassionate leave for attorneys and staff members who have experienced miscarriage or failed surrogacy, adoption, or fertility treatments? We know of just one firm other that offers time off for miscarriage (Goodwin). Please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or text us (646-820-8477) to let us know where your law firm stands when it comes to this important type of leave.

Yesterday [Kenneth Freeling](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/kenneth-freeling/), a former Dewey & LeBoeuf partner who was currently of counsel at Covington & Burling,[ reportedly](http://nypost.com/2017/03/02/man-jumps-to-his-death-from-park-avenue-building/) committed suicide by jumping out of his Park Avenue apartment. He landed on the second floor terrace of the apartment building and was pronounced dead on the scene.

Throughout his career, Freeling made stops at a number of Biglaw firms, aside from the aforementioned Dewey and Covington, as [noted by the American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202780434831/ExDewey-Partner-Covington-Counsel-Commits-Suicide?slreturn=20170203084516):

[Freeling] specialized in a broad range of cases, including antitrust, commercial and intellectual property matters for clients in the construction, financial institutions, industrial, media, pharmaceutical and telecommunications sectors. He joined Dewey & LeBoeuf predecessor [Dewey Ballantine in June 2007](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=900005484205/Three-Robins-Kaplan-partners-decamp-to-Dewey) from Robins Kaplan. He previously worked at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, [a firm he joined in 2001](http://www.thelawyer.com/issues/21-may-2001/cadwalader-builds-litigation-and-corporate/), and Kaye Scholer.

[Dewey Ballantine merged](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=900005489667/Dewey-Ballantine-and-LeBoeuf-Lamb-Set-to-Merge) with LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae in late 2007. For a time, [Freeling served as managing partner](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202425444905) of the combined firm’s office in Doha, Qatar. In March 2011, [Freeling joined K&L Gates](http://thelegalintelligencer.typepad.com/tli/2011/09/kl-gates-opens-qatar-office.html) in Washington, D.C. Six months later he [helped the firm open an office](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2011/09/07/kl-gates-opens-second-middle-east-branch-with-qatar-launch/) in Qatar.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In 2013 Freeling’s son,[ Samuel, committed suicide](http://www.campustimes.org/2013/10/17/ur-remembers-sam-freeling/). The New York Post is [reporting](http://nypost.com/2017/03/02/man-jumps-to-his-death-from-park-avenue-building/) that police indicated Freeling’s history included mental illness and drug use.

A Covington representative made this statement:

“We are deeply saddened by the news of Ken’s passing,” a Covington spokesman said in a statement provided to The American Lawyer. “He made important contributions to the firm and was a good, earnest colleague who cared deeply about the firm.”

Our thoughts go out to the friends, family and colleagues of Freeling.

# Order To Force Opposing Counsel To Stop Taking Depositions In His Dining Room
## This was... unorthodox.

We firmly believe the legal profession should embrace the idea of [working from home](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/working-from-home/), but this is ridiculous. In the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, attorneys from Ballard Spahr representing Temple University Hospital filed a motion for a protective order to force plaintiffs’ counsel William T. Coleman to finally stop holding depositions in his dining room.

Wait, what?

Two depositions noticed by plaintiffs have already been taken in plaintiffs’ counsel’s dining room. According to defense counsel, the attendant conditions were totally unsatisfactory. The dining room was open to the kitchen and living room. During the two completed depositions it was possible to hear family members in the house when they were speaking on the telephone or to each other. When the sounds became particularly loud, plaintiffs’ counsel, at the request of defense counsel or the court reporter, had to intervene to restore quiet. The ringing of the telephone with incoming calls and announcements occurred. Family members passed through the dining room and at times interrupted plaintiffs’ counsel about evening plans or to ask the court reporter and defense counsel to move their cars. The movement of people in the adjoining kitchen was visible, and noises and smells emanated from the cooking that was taking place. A dog wandered throughout the house and came and went through a dog door behind the chair where the witnesses sat. Not surprisingly, the examination of witnesses came to a halt on a number of occasions as a result of all this extraneous activity.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Plaintiffs’ Counsel: We’re back on the record.
Defense Counsel: On the night in question, where were–
Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s Wife: Did you take out the garbage?
Plaintiffs’ Counsel: What?
Defense Counsel: Excuse me…
Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s Wife: The garbage.
Plaintiffs’ Counsel: Oh. No, not yet.
Defense Counsel: I’m trying to…
Plaintiffs’ Counsel: I thought that was Wednesday?
Witness: Where was I on Wednesday?
Defense Counsel: No, on…
Plaintiffs’ Counsel: This guy thinks it’s Wednesday.
Witness: What?
Plaintiffs’ Counsel: Huh?
Dog: Woof

According to Coleman, he needed to do the depositions from his house so he could access his complete files at any time during the deposition. He also said one witness liked his dog so what’s the big deal, anyway? Judge Harvey Bartle was not swayed by this reasoning:

Depositions, absent compelling reasons such as the illness or incapacity of a witness, should be taken in a professional setting devoid of domestic or other distractions. While plaintiffs’ counsel’s dining room is undoubtedly and rightly a place of commensal conviviality and canine companionship, it is not an acceptable forum for lawyers to examine and defend witnesses under oath. There will be no more dining-room depositions.

I presume we’ll be taking the dog to Ballard Spahr’s offices now.

# Massachusetts Bar Exam Results Reveal Worst Passage Rates In Almost 25 Years

“Passachusetts” no more?

The results for the July 2016 administration of the Massachusetts bar exam are out, and they really aren’t pretty. In fact, save for the tiniest glimmer of hope found in the state’s first-time passage rate, they’re downright ugly.

While 79.8 percent of examinees passed the exam on their first try this past summer, the overall pass rate for the July 2016 administration of the Massachusetts exam was 70.8 percent. This is the worst overall passage rate Massachusetts has seen in almost 25 years, since 1993 — and possibly beyond, but we were unable to find any other data published online.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
On top of that startling fact, the state’s passage rate for first-time takers has been on a steady decline since 2010 (save for what seems to be an anomaly in July 2013), when 91.0 percent of first-time takers passed the exam. This year’s passage rate for first-time takers increased by 0.8 percentage points since the July 2015 exam. See for yourselves:

- July 2016: 79.8 percent passed
- July 2015: 79.0 percent passed
- July 2014: 82.3 percent passed
- July 2013: 87.7 percent passed
- July 2012: 85.3 percent passed
- July 2011: 88.2 percent passed
- July 2010: 91.0 percent passed
Below, we’ve listed the overall passage rates for July exams in Massachusetts since 1993:

Year	All Candidates
July 2016	70.8 percent passed

Were there certain law schools to blame for the damage that’s been done to the Massachusetts bar exam passage rates? Based on statistics from the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners, it looks like at least two law schools have been dragging down the results for the entire state. Allow us to present the [July 2015](http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/bbe/statisticsjul2015.pdf) and [July 2016](http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/bbe/ma-bar-exam-statistics.pdf) bar exam passage rates for UMass-Dartmouth Law and the Massachusetts School of Law.

When barely half or fewer than half of all of your graduates are capable of passing the bar exam, you know your law school has problems it needs to remedy — immediately.

On a lighter note, three cheers for Harvard, Boston University, and Boston College, as all three law schools had first-time passage rates that fell within the 90th percentile.

Congratulations to you if you were able to pass the bar exam in Massachusetts. If you didn’t, at least you had a lot of company. Better luck next time!

Law firms and businesses are sitting on mountains of valuable data that can help drive better, more informed decision-making that leads to greater efficiency and profitability.

AI tools are key to making use of that data, and you’re likely already using them whether you realize it or not.

This increased use of data raises a whole host of legal considerations, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance.

Please take our flash poll below to help us benchmark how the industry is performing, and stay tuned for the results.

Also this month, Practising Law Institute is offering a one-day course, [Data Law 2022: Lessons from the Near Future](https://www.pli.edu/programs/data-law-2022-lessons-from-the-near-future), covering everything you need to know to be ready to use data in your legal practice.

They’re also featuring a half-day program, [Artificial Intelligence and Data-Driven Business Models 2022: Navigating Regulation, Risks and Compliance Issues in Leveraging AI](https://www.pli.edu/programs/A/artificial-intelligence-and-data-driven-transactions), that provides even more information on best practices for using data and AI.

Ed. note: Welcome to the second installment of [Better Know A Practice Area](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/better-know-a-practice-area/), a new series introducing readers to different practice areas. Each post is written by an editor at [Practical Law](http://us.practicallaw.com/) who previously practiced in that area and currently writes about it. In case you missed it, you can read the first installment [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/10-things-to-know-about-capital-markets-and-corporate-governance-practice/) (discussing capital markets and corporate governance practice).

Today’s topic: securities litigation and enforcement.

- What do you do in a typical day?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A typical day of a securities litigation and enforcement associate might involve:

- Interviewing custodians of documents potentially responsive to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) request for information.
- Meeting with a client to prepare her for upcoming testimony before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Department of Justice.
- Conducting review of a client’s potentially privileged documents, preparing a privilege log, and coordinating production to the SEC.
- Drafting a portion of the brief in support of a motion dismissing a securities fraud complaint against a client.
- Strategizing with a joint defense group on coordinated discovery and oral argument on a motion in a case asserting claims under the federal securities laws.
- Preparing a deposition outline for a witness in a securities fraud case.
- Who do you work with?
Junior associates mostly work with senior associates and sometimes partners. As associates grow more senior, responsibilities increase and associates have more direct contact with clients and the opposite side. In the securities litigation and enforcement practice, the opponents include plaintiffs’ lawyers, enforcement counsel of securities regulators, such as the SEC and FINRA, and often prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s Office or the DOJ.

Associates in this area are often tasked with coordinating collection, review, and production of documents, which usually requires collaborating with e-discovery vendors and the clients’ IT and legal departments and working with the opposite side. Associates may also be tasked with preparing witnesses for depositions or meetings with regulators, which usually requires multiple meetings or teleconferences with client representatives.

- What does a common career path look like?
It’s common knowledge that there is a revolving door between the government and private practice for securities litigation and enforcement lawyers. With increased regulatory oversight in recent years, this is now as true as ever. Lawyers practicing in this area often move to the government after a few years in private practice. The most common government positions are state and federal prosecutors or enforcement counsel at the SEC, CFTC, or FINRA (a non-governmental securities industry regulator). Some lawyers make a career in the government, and others return to private practice as counsel or partner.

Besides government, lawyers in this practice often move to the financial institutions’ in-house litigation teams or compliance departments, or pursue judicial clerkships. Securities litigation and enforcement lawyers are mostly based in major financial centers, such as New York, Chicago or San Francisco.

This practice area offers a good degree of variety. Regulatory matters can concern different subject matters, from compliance with securities laws’ technical requirements, such as retention of electronic communications, to propriety of corporate disclosures, to allegations of securities fraud. Lawyers involved in these matters often conduct investigations of alleged misconduct, which is perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the practice. Investigations include review of electronic communication, witness interviews, communication with the government, and presentation of findings to the board of directors.

Handling private securities lawsuits most often involves motion practice and voluminous document discovery and depositions. Motions frequently filed in these cases include motion to dismiss, motion to decertify class, and motion for summary judgment.

- How much wear and tear?
The work is fast-paced and demanding because the stakes can be high, involving large fines or settlements, industry suspensions and bars, and possibly criminal convictions. Associates are expected to be able to master large amounts of facts quickly and think strategically. Partners are not always able to commit enough time to learning all the facts and regularly rely on associates to supply details and recommendations, especially in large and complex matters.

Associates also invariably review very large amounts of documents and are expected to do so thoroughly and accurately because mistakes can be costly. For instance, making an incorrect privilege call and including a privileged document in the production can result in the assertion of a privilege waiver and have a dramatically negative effect on the case.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
Lawyers practicing securities litigation and enforcement tend to like the practice. That said, handling matters involving some of the securities laws’ more technical aspects may be a less than exciting experience. As for most litigators, coordinating and conducting the review and production of large amounts of documents is probably the most tedious part of the job. Most securities litigators also don’t enjoy having to become familiar with the fine print in the documentation supporting fraud claims, such as the often massive offering documentation for a security or a company’s annual filings.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
Most lawyers practicing in this area enjoy being involved in cases with high stakes, often accompanied by media coverage and publicity. Some of the most exciting parts of the practice are conducting internal investigations to uncover potential wrongdoing and battling prosecutors on the admissibility of wiretap evidence, propriety of search warrants and other devices available to the government.

Lawyers in this area also tend to be smart and competent. So, whether an attorney is on a joint defense team or across the table from them, working with good lawyers is a privilege. In addition, the world of securities litigation and enforcement lawyers is relatively small, so people are mostly courteous and professional because they know that they will likely meet again.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
Securities litigation and enforcement lawyers who don’t want to continue practicing in this area often make a move to securities regulatory agencies, or become federal or state prosecutors or in-house compliance officers.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
Volatility of financial markets has a great impact on securities regulation and litigation. On the one hand, financial crises bring about litigation and increased regulatory oversight. On the other, bull markets result in increased transactional activity (mergers, IPOs, etc.), which give rise to litigation and changes in regulatory landscape. In general, the more market activity, the more work for securities litigators and enforcement lawyers.

Currently, the legal matters concerning the 2008 mortgage crisis are winding down and markets have largely recovered. Many practitioners think that the next wave of work in the securities litigation and enforcement area will be in lawsuits concerning a large number of IPOs that took place during the last several years. In addition, the securities regulators and the DOJ appear increasingly focused on enforcing compliance with securities laws and holding individuals responsible for misconduct, which will likely result in an uptick in the enforcement matters.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
Beside genuine, demonstrated interest in financial markets, a good candidate would have all the usual qualities of a good litigator: thoroughness, attention to detail, good judgment, and ability to express herself clearly both orally and in writing.

Also, handling a large regulatory matter or representing a defendant in a securities class action can be a protracted and often frustrating experience. So, patience and an even-keeled demeanor will also be helpful to attorneys practicing in this area.

Dorsey & Whitney, a firm which made $387,184,000 in gross revenue last year making it 98th on the [Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#), has joined the ranks of Biglaw firms making COVID-19 austerity moves. The firm is taking a variety of cost-cutting measures, but, so far, salary cuts and layoffs are off the table.

So what is going on? The firm has capped their monthly equity partner distributions. They are also furloughing staff that cannot perform their jobs remotely, estimated as less than 4 percent of staff. The firm’s contributions to its employees’ retirement plans are taking the biggest hit, with a 33 percent cut.

According [to Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/08/dorsey-caps-partner-draws-furloughs-a-fragment-of-its-workforce/), the firm said it will “reevaluate its measures from time-to-time and is intent on limiting disruptions to its workforce as much as possible.”

# Biglaw Partner Calls Out Former Partner Turned Trump Appointee To The Ninth Circuit
## The judicial appointment was 'a source of deep embarrassment and sadness.'

A Biglaw firm is, well, big. And that means that, as much as we like to talk about a singular culture or politics, there are actually a bunch of divergent opinions within the firm. And sometimes, those disagreements become public.

That’s what happened at Perkins Coie. An email from partner [Marc Elias](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/marc-e-elias.html), chair of the firm’s Political Law Group, is making the rounds for the way it calls out a former partner of the firm, [Eric Miller](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/eric-miller/?rf=1). Miller left the firm in 2019 to take a seat on the Ninth Circuit. But, as with many Trump judicial nominees, it was not a smooth process.

Miller [made history](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-ninth-circuit-nominee-eric-miller-advances-in-senate-2) by being the first circuit court judge confirmed without the consent of the senators from his home state, known as blue slips. This led to some frankly accurate concerns about the increasingly partisan nature of the federal judiciary. And in a recent decision, those chickens have come home to roost.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[In the decision, ](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/28/court-lifts-order-against-feds-portland-404397)Miller wrote for a 2-1 majority (both judges in the majority were Trump appointees) overturning the district court’s injunction which banned federal law enforcement agents in Portland from forcing journalists and legal observers off the scene of protests. Though the case is ongoing, (the lead attorney on the matter, Matthew Borden of BraunHagey & Borden LLP, which is co-counsel for the plaintiffs along with the ACLU, said, “We disagree with the court’s order, which is only temporary and not the final word. We look forward to having a chance to brief the issue on the merits,”) there were many who took issue with the decision.

Like Elias.

The case has particular meaning for Perkins Coie, as the trial judge Michael Simon is a firm alum as is the dissenting judge in the Ninth Circuit’s decision, Margaret McKeown. But, as Elias notes, there’s a particular infamy in having the firm associated with this decision. In his email he says:

[A]s lawyers, we take a unique pride in seeing our own out on the black robes of justice — where they meet the highest calling of our profession.

A decision from the 9th Circuit this week shows the best and worst of what we as a firm, have given in this regard.

And Elias isn’t above some well placed “I told you so’s” now that such a problematic decision is out there:

Why am I sending this email — because all too often we assume that because we know someone personally or professionally that they share our values. It is too easily [sic] to celebrate our firm’s “successes” regardless of the price on society.

On the day Eric Miller was confirmed, I sent an email to management that read:

No doubt you have seen the news that Eric Miller has been confirmed to the 9th Circuit over the objection of the entire Democratic caucus and in violation of long standing rules regarding “blue slips” and home state senators (one of whom is running for president and an important client). I would asl that the firm avoid any display of support or pride in Miller’s elevation. It is, for my group at least, a source of deep embarrassment and sadness.

He is gone from the firm, or will be shortly, and we should leave it at that. I do not wish to debate him or whether he is “nice.” It is enough that his elevation is an affront to our many clients, and he will now vote as a judge against civil rights, voting rights, gay rights, women’s rights, immigrant rights and will otherwise seek to harm the most vulnerable in society. I ask that we not compound this by acting as if this is a point of pride or happiness for the firm.

My request was not granted. Miller was feted by many at the firm, including many on this email, who now stand in horror at his ruling in Portland.

I stand by those words today. Actions and inactions have consequences.

Black Lives Matter.
Marc

Now Elias’s politics are literally part of his practice, and a long line of Democratic politicos call him their attorney, so he has more freedom in voicing his opinions, as they’re shared by many of his clients. But it is still refreshing to see a Biglaw partner call out the hypocrisy of the firm. We know that a firm’s [pretty words on social justice matters can often ring hollow](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/when-biglaws-statements-on-racial-justice-ring-hollow/) to those who’ve actually worked at the firm. Good for Elias for pointing out the cognitive dissonance needed to celebrate Miller’s elevation, then a year later be shocked at the decision you knew — or at least should have known — he’d make.

# How Litigation Finance Can End The Partisan Practice Of Law
## It's an important tool that firms can use to get opportunities to work on the other side of the 'v.'

No, I’m not talking about politics. I’m talking about a different partisan divide: the division in the legal-services market between so-called “plaintiffs’ firms” and “defense firms” and how litigation finance can mitigate the division.

Plaintiff and defense-oriented firms historically have had very different business models as it relates to risk taking. Defense-side firms — as most Biglaw firms are characterized — have typically relied on a fee-based business model; clients pay hourly rates and the client bears the cost risk of the litigation (and retains all the upside if the litigation is successful). This model hasn’t always been able to meet the needs of plaintiffs who are unable or unwilling to bear all the costs and risks of litigation. This led to the establishment of firms that employ a risk-based business model, attracting as clients those plaintiffs with whom the firm could share the risk and reward of litigation through contingency fee arrangements. As litigation costs grew, and plaintiffs flocked by necessity or practicality to the firms that were able to share litigation risk, the divide between the plaintiff and defense firms deepened.

But does the legal world need to remain bipartisan? We think not.

Biglaw is already under pressure to compete for clients by offering alternative fee arrangements. Billable-hour-modeled defense firms without an established risk-based practice (like many Biglaw firms) may find it difficult to tolerate the new risks that alternative fee arrangements bring to the firm or individual partners. Enter the litigation funder, whose business model is to take risk on litigation. A funder like Lake Whillans can offer the client a transaction structure that is economically equivalent to or, in some cases, more advantageous than a contingency fee arrangement. We can also provide capital directly to the client company for other corporate purposes, providing immediate returns from a litigation finance transaction. The result is a win-win for the firm and client, allowing the “defense-oriented” firm to take the representation without compromising its fee-based business model or current risk-tolerance level and the client to share the cost risk of the litigation (or unload it entirely) with a third-party.

Lake Whillans can meet the needs of firms with all sorts of different business models, from the firm that prefers to maintain its fee-based model and have the funder pay all fees and expenses, to firms that are evolving towards a more risk-based model where it takes some risk but is also paid some portion of its fees by the funder, to pure risk-based firms that could benefit from a steadying capital source secured by a portfolio of its cases that can smooth cash flow.

While litigation finance unfortunately can’t solve the bipartisan political divide, it is an important tool that firms can use to evolve or maintain their business model while gaining new opportunities to work on the other side of the “v.” and increase competitiveness.

# Biglaw Managing Partner To Entire Firm: STFU On SCOTUS
## Is expressing your opinion on current events bad for Biglaw business?

Peter Kalis, the [outgoing chair](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/peter-kalis-wont-run-for-re-election-as-chair-of-kl-gates/) at [K&L Gates](http://www.klgates.com/peter-j-kalis/), is not one to mince words. The former Rhodes Scholar and Supreme Court clerk is both brilliant and blunt, and you can see that when he’s [smacking down his adversaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/everything-is-great-kl-states-peter-kalis-comes-out-swinging/) or exhorting his partners to [bring home the bacon](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/the-two-faces-of-kl-gates/).

But this outspoken firm leader seems less enthusiastic about his lawyers expressing themselves. From a firm-wide memo he just circulated:

My colleague Joe Patrice’s take: “Want to have an opinion at K&L Gates? All you need to do is serve as [Attorney General!”](http://www.klgates.com/dick-thornburgh/)

The scope of Kalis’s request is unclear. He wants lawyers to “refrain from any public comment on the nominee,” so that would cover, say, writing op-eds for or against confirmation, or speaking to a reporter if called for comment. It would not cover private discussion, such as a conversation with friends over dinner.

But what about the grey area of social media? A K&L Gates lawyer on Twitter or Facebook could certainly generate “quotes that could be used against us and our clients in some perverse way.” On the other hand, asking lawyers to censor themselves about a major legal and political issue seems a bit extreme.

Here’s what one K&L Gates tipster told us:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Grumpy Ol’ Pete is (a) impugning our attorneys’ collective intelligence; (b) seemingly tipping that it is going to be Hardiman (because he’s from Pittsburgh, and we’re Pittsburgh-headquartered); and (c) stifling the expression of free speech, by some of the few people educated and qualified on whether a nominee should or should not be appointed. #JustKalisThings

Ouch. It seems this source is not a fan of the Kalis memo.

In defense of Kalis, maximizing profit might call for minimizing opinion and controversy. Note how another Biglaw firm, Greenberg Traurig, recently [distanced itself](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/greenberg-traurig-distances-itself-from-rudy-giuliani/) from the polarizing outside activities of cybersecurity practice head [Rudy Giuliani](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/Rudolph-W-Giuliani).

Here at Above the Law, it’s tough for us to dodge controversy. We get complaints from conservative readers about our [liberal writers](https://abovethelaw.com/author/elie-mystal/), and complaints from liberal readers about our [conservative writers](https://abovethelaw.com/author/kayleighmcenany/). Given that we’re in the media business, we can’t avoid speaking our minds; it’s our job (which is why it’s hard for us to accede to Steve Bannon’s [request that we shut up](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/business/media/stephen-bannon-trump-news-media.html)). But if we sold a more apolitical product — like bananas, or billable hours — I could see the argument in favor of not ticking off a significant portion of the customer base.

As a K&L lawyer in the Seattle office (coastal elite bubble!), several of us have remarked that a similar memo was not distributed to all lawyers for any of Barack Obama’s SCOTUS nominees. This has been making the associate rounds, and we can only intuit why….

# Irony Alert: Ken Starr Should Lose His Job For Not Investigating Real Sex Crimes

UPDATE (5/26 12:19 p.m.) Baylor has reportedly [fired head coach Art Briles](http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2016/5/26/5253866/art-briles-baylor-fired).
UPDATE (5/26 2:02 p.m.)… And now the other shoe falls. [Ken Starr removed as President of Baylor University](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ken-starr-fired-can-still-teach-conlaw/).

The next big fish is still Baylor President… for now.: Few moments in history really speak to the heroic ideal of American democracy quite like watching a former federal judge testify to Congress about blowjobs so they could invoke their constitutional power to bring the President of the United States to trial. The 90s were a special time, y’all. That’s how most non-law nerds know Ken Starr — not for his tenure as a judge on the D.C. Circuit or his years as Solicitor General or the fact that he is credited/blamed — depending on your conservative convictions — [for the nomination of Justice O’Connor](http://joshblackman.com/blog/2015/02/27/calabresi-on-the-inside-dirt-behind-the-appointments-of-justices-oconnor-kennedy-and-souter-and-non-appointments-of-starr-posner-and-wilkinson/). No, most only remember Starr as the face of the hard-charging investigation into how hard Bill Clinton charged.

Which is why there’s a tragic, horrifying irony to the mounting speculation that Starr — now, as fate would have it, a president himself — could at any point be [terminated with extreme prejudice](http://www.rotoworld.com/content/playerpages/playerbreakingnews.asp?sport=CFB&id=132847&line=56867&spln=1) from his current post for not investigating real sex crimes in what’s shaping up to be the biggest college football scandal since the Penn State coverup. And he should.

For those not following college football, Baylor University, where Starr serves as president, spent decades as the conference doormat until the last few years, when coach Art Briles installed an uptempo spread offense that earned the school a Heisman Trophy (Robert Griffin III) and a consistent place in the top 10 teams in the nation. The team is an offensive marvel to behold. Basically no one can cover these guys.

Except, apparently, the Baylor and Waco Police Departments, who reports suggest were just great at covering up Baylor football. Here’s what’s [surfacing](http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/college-sports/collegesports/2016/05/22/mark-schlabach-reporting-baylor-scandal-sexual-assault-problem-unique-waco):

In addition to the eight allegations of sexual assault that have already been levied against five Baylor players, we found three more allegations of violence against women against three players, as well as a 2011 incident which was a fight at a university-sponsored fraternity party in which at least six Baylor players assaulted a group of students, one of whom ended up in the hospital with facial injuries and three or four displaced teeth.

One would assume such serious charges resulted in police records and investigations, but… something happened. Regarding the fight outlined above, here’s what Mark Schlabach of ESPN found in his investigation:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
When that incident happened [a fight], during the investigation a Baylor police officer called a Waco police officer. After that conversation for whatever reason the Waco police officer asked his supervisor to remove the case from the department’s computer system so it wouldn’t be accessible by the public or other officers. The incident report was locked in the supervisor’s office.

Waco police claim they do this to “protect the integrity” of high-profile cases and not to keep incidents involving the newly successful local football team free from public scrutiny. That may well be, but can’t explain Baylor’s internal foot-dragging. Like how it didn’t look into a police report filed in 2013 [until September of 2015](http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/15191102/baylor-investigate-sex-assault-claim-football-players-more-two-years-lines).

As the stories leaked and picked up steam following ESPN’s coverage, Baylor engaged Pepper Hamilton to review the school’s handling of the process, which is usually the last step before someone — or everyone — gets fired. The report is now in the hands of the Board of Regents, who are [not releasing it to the public](http://www.wacotrib.com/news/higher_education/baylor-officials-not-commenting-as-regents-receive-report-on-rape/article_5a7b31fc-ff63-5d1d-aadd-0dc06be98f00.html), which fuels speculation that the report displays the sort of complete organizational breakdown one would expect when campus police, the athletic department, and the Title IX process all seemingly fall apart under the same circumstances. [CORRECTION: Actually the report isn’t in the hands of the Regents, they’ve merely been briefed on its contents but not given physical copies to keep, apparently to bolster the school’s efforts to deny journalists seeking a copy.]

Now Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has landed in the middle of this controversy, as reporters from the Waco Tribune fight Baylor for access to police documents. Paxton’s lukewarm opinion in favor of the paper on a few limited claims only intensified concerns that authorities are bending over backward to [protect Baylor from scrutiny](http://www.wacotrib.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-baylor-legal-moves-in-sexual-assault-saga-raise-questions/article_85f17db9-c0c1-5ce7-aa72-7476a95a1040.html?mode=jqm):

In response to a request by the Tribune-Herald for all reports received by the Baylor Police Department regarding sexual assaults and improper sexual conduct and Baylor’s resistance to this request, Paxton’s office said last week that, yes, Baylor must release portions of some reports because of the Texas Legislature’s new law. But it left open questions of whether Baylor must release other portions of reports. Bizarrely, the opinion doesn’t sharply differentiate any of this.

Because Baylor claims some records must be withheld under the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the university did not submit actual examples for Paxton’s office to consider, the state attorney general’s office simply didn’t rule on them. At least, so Paxton’s office says in its muddled May 17 opinion. In fact, the attorney general’s office suggests its own inspection of documents supposedly covered by FERPA is inappropriate. If so, such deference to federal authority by that office must rank as a first, given how many times the attorney general has challenged the feds.

Which brings us [back to President Starr](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a44641/ken-starr-baylor-clinton/). Two decades ago, Starr spent millions in taxpayer money to figure out if a consensual blowjob between adults took place.[1] Today he runs an institution that, from what journalists have uncovered, turned a blind eye repeatedly to sexual assault and domestic abuse allegations. Obviously there are heads that should roll at many levels of the university, but with Starr’s unique background his has to be the first. Regardless of what the Pepper Hamilton report reveals about his involvement or lack thereof in these investigations, having a man whose dogged investigative skills are his primary claim to fame continue to sit atop a university after this sort of scandal is a public relations nightmare the institution cannot afford as it seeks to rebuild its reputation.

It’s a horrible irony and the final confirmation that the sanctimonious talk about investigative integrity and the rule of law was all a smokescreen for an up-the-gut, expensive political witch hunt.

[1] And I’m actually one who thinks Bill Clinton’s liaison probably could support a sexual harassment charge, but in the absence of the other party bringing that claim, it’s not a characterization we should waste money forcing upon that relationship.

# Biglaw's Hiring 'Frenzy' Has Ended, And Signing Bonuses Have 'Evaporated'
## But things seem to be getting back to a pre-COVID normal for the lateral market.

It’s just not at the rate that it was last year and the year before. It’s definitely not 2021, but it almost feels like it’s going back to what it was like pre-COVID—it’s more of a steady pace. It’s definitely not a frenzy anymore. But there’s still a steady need for lateral partners, so we still see a bit of musical chairs happening between firms.

Business has not died. So I don’t think there’s cause to panic just yet.

— [Katherine Loanzon](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/katherine-loanzon/), managing director of Kinney Recruiting in New York, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/02/24/compensation-for-attorneys-flush-with-cash-or-pulling-back/) on the current state of the lateral recruitment market. As far as signing bonuses are concerned, Loanzon says they’ve “almost completely evaporated” for associates. “Whereas in the last year or year before, where every associate was asking for a sign-on, that’s definitely not happening this year. We do not have associates expecting one,” she said.

# 3 Makes A Trend: New York Market Really Is $180K

It’s official: with our third New York market match, we have a trend! After [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/) and [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-another-big-new-york-firm-matches-cravath/) officially moved over to the new [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) earlier today (both of which did so after California litigation boutique [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-firm-bumps-associate-salaries-to-match-180k-scale/) ponied up the big bucks), we have our third major Biglaw firm making it rain for associates: Cahill Gordon & Reindel.

The move doesn’t come as much of a shock to Biglaw followers, Cahill has been known to beat the going market rate on end-of-the-year bonuses (though this past year they [only met the market rate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-a-former-bonus-leader-takes-a-tumble/)), and they provide associates with [special summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/associate-bonus-watch-biglaw-summer-bonuses/?rf=1) — one of the few firms to do so. Given the compensation bump associates are seeing this summer, one wonders if Cahill will continue their summer bonus tradition?

According to our tipsters at the firm, Cahill made a complete match of the Cravath scale, which has to make everyone there pretty happy. Once we have a copy of the memo, we will update the story.

UPDATE (3:05 p.m.): Here it is, the memo codifying the new pay scale at Cahill:



UPDATE #2 (6/8/17 1:01pm): Good news for Cahill summer associates! They were informed today at 11:30am that they’ll be getting a raise as well. This will bring their paycheck to $3,500/week.

With the first major associate pay raise in nearly a decade, this is an exciting time to be in Biglaw. We’ll be covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

D. Casey Flaherty

The wheel of legal tech conferences turns on two main events every year: Legal Tech New York, in February, and ILTACON, usually in August. These conferences draw both vendors and clients together in a whirlwind of meetings, keynotes, panels, and demos.

On some nights, drinks are involved.  Like last night, for example. And on nights when drinks get involved, a spirited discussion with Casey Flaherty is just around the corner.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

For those who may not recall, Casey, of House Flaherty, First of His Name, is Uber Nerd of the Lawyers and Transformer of the Legal Realm. He runs a [consultancy](http://www.procertas.com/) that helps corporate legal departments assess the competencies of their outside counsel and improve their relationships using metrics.

I really like hanging out with Casey at conferences. It’s hard to do justice to our conversations in these recaps, and my note-taking skills tend to degrade a little after the fourth round of drinks. Back in February, we sat in the lobby of the New York Hilton, poured some brown liquor, and [talked about how law departments are making changes](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/alt-legal-casey-and-the-case-for-change/) — and how slow those changes are to advance.

This time around, we sat in Ri Ra, an Irish pub nestled in the walkway that connects the classy Mandalay Bay to the depressing pyramid they call Luxor. A Celtic-influenced band featured a lot of mandolin in their songs, and off to the side, there was a comfy room with throwback furniture and vintage shelf adornments. We were not alone—the room was filled with a host of the most interesting players and voices in legal technology, like my old boss and mentor, the esteemed [Greg McPolin](http://www.kenyongroupllc.com/principals.aspx); the original legal blogger and AboveTheLaw columnist, [Kevin O’Keefe](https://abovethelaw.com/author/kevinokeefe/); [Matt Homann](http://www.thefilament.com/matthew-homann/) of Filament; and several others that dipped in and out of the room.

We ordered a couple of Guinesses, and I started by asking Casey about the topic du jour at ILTA: AI. “What are your thoughts on AI?”

Everyone rolled their eyes and groaned. Casey said, “I am very tired of robot magic silliness. It sucks up the oxygen in conferences like this. You have people sent here to investigate AI, wasting their time when they could be learning about something more useful. You have vendors that are doing good work with real value, but they are wasting their time talking about AI to people that aren’t really buying it.”

Matt added, “The quicker people realize what these tools are, the quicker that we can be done talking about AI.”

Casey said, “Look, I like some of the platforms out there, and I try to go out of my way to say so.  But really, the question comes down to whether it’s better, whether the outcomes are actually improved.”

We all agreed that there was too much hype about AI, and at a place like ILTA, which can sometimes become an echo chamber, perhaps there’s already too much hype around pointing out that there’s too much hype about AI. I know, we’re real meta.

The next Guinness came as a boilermaker—beer with a side of whisky. Greg noted that we really should be doing car bombs, which are whisky and Bailey’s with beer, instead of boilermakers. (Later, we would get several rounds of car bombs.)

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I switched topics. “So we talk about change, about law firms and legal departments improving around process and technology. Have you seen it get any better?”

“Yes, it’s getting a little better, but it’s not really scaling,” said Casey. “People have gotten better in recognizing that while technology can be essential, it’s not a quick fix. Some people are looking at process and trying to be better.”

“But,” Casey noted, “finding people who are doing this is hard, and you can find some people doing this well from within that group. It’s still a minority of a minority.”

Casey went on to explain that in the process of consulting and evaluating firms on some of their basic technology skills and capabilities, some respondents are shockingly behind the times even in their affirmative responses. “One of the questions on my list is about what innovation initiatives are happening at the firm. Sometimes firms will mention the fact that they changed their website! One firm actually dropped in this long description of ways they were using ROSS, an AI tool on the market. Well that’s great, except that ROSS’s main use case is in bankruptcy, and this firm does zero bankruptcy work. None at all.”  He chuckled and shook his head. “They just put some stuff in their answer because, I don’t know, they think I’m an idiot?”

Casey explained that a lot of law firms will push back on his queries, claiming that he was focusing on areas that aren’t really the real work. “If it shows up on the bill, it’s real enough to me. What they are really saying is that some of those areas are where lawyers don’t add value, which is where we agree. But in those areas, so much time is wasted.”

(And if you’re wondering what types of skills we’re talking about here, check out the website for Casey’s firm, Procertas ([www.procertas.com](http://www.procertas.com)). One example is using the right functions in Word so that an attorney is not billing hours of time just re-numbering sections in an agreement. Procertas has a legal technology assessment that tests whether lawyers have basic proficiencies in the tools of their trade, like Word, Excel and PDF.)

We dropped some car bombs to Greg’s satisfaction, knocked them back, and continued the conversation.

“Why aren’t corporates driving more change?  Why don’t they start asserting pressure on their law firms to be better?” I asked.

Casey said, “Clients are just as change- and risk-averse as their law firms. We have some serious agency problems. The data shows that in-house counsel are growing their headcount like crazy. But that growth is almost purely labor arbitrage, without any thought towards how the services are being delivered. As Bill Henderson points out, we think we have a cost problem when we actually have a productivity problem. When you think of it as a price problem, you aren’t addressing the real issue.”

I pondered this silently. Casey took a swig of his beer and continued.

“Pricing has inherent problems in law, because legal practice is a credence good. The value is almost impossible to measure, so we tend to base our view on reputation and other proxies. And in a credence good market, the higher the price, the higher the perceived value.”

Now he was getting into his zone, and the ideas were flowing. “The fact that some clients have started to do something is reflected by how they are working with alternative legal services and technology. But it’s still not close to being mature. Think about Pangea3 or Axiom. These businesses are really successful, but they should be way bigger. They aren’t as big as they should be.”

I asked, “So who holds the keys to solving this? Do law firms need to get pushed by a new model disrupting their space? Or do the corporate counsel need to be the ones to push change?”

“Well,” Casey said, “I work with the corporates, so that’s my focus. I’m trying to change the buy-side. Sellers don’t really respond to me. There really needs to be action, but it’s been a buyer’s market for a decade now and not much has changed. The buyers have the power, and the bad behavior is coming from them too.”

“And how does that change really happen? What do you need to really make those changes take hold?”

“You need a mandate for that change, from the top. Look, not all of my consulting engagements go well. We have some failures. The difference between those that went well and those that didn’t is always a person in a position of authority, saying ‘this is happening, we have to do this.’”

I pressed harder. “But if you had two magic steps that would make the difference, two things that could really spark a lot of change, what are they?”

“First of all, find someone where a reasonable part of their job description is to improve. This person needs to dedicate real time to solving this.  Then, the second thing is whatever that person believes is the right action.  I present options in menus, but I don’t have a mindset of being prescriptive.  It’s different for everybody.”

The night spun on into a blur of brainstorming, lively discussion, and a considerable amount of drinking. These nights are my favorite part of ILTA. Like I said at the top—it’s hard to capture how great these conversations are. It’s not idle chatter, it doesn’t have the feeling of waxing eloquent without substance. It doesn’t feel like we’re just gabbing about cockeyed ideas.

It feels like we are the fraternity of challengers, conspiring to solve the problems of the legal ecosystem with every car bomb we drop.

# This Biglaw Firm Is Giving Out Mega Bonuses, Putting Their Total Compensation Ahead Of The Market
## Big bonuses at this Biglaw firm.

Everyone loves to see eye-popping bonus numbers! And that’s exactly what associates at Irell are being treated to.

The firm, which made $142,000,000 in total revenue last year, announced bonuses (and only bonuses) for their associates. The impressive scale puts them ahead of the market on compensation.

Below are the market-busting bonuses at Irell, ranging from $45,000 to $175,00 (compared with the industry average of $20,000 to $115,000).

Class	2023
December Bonus

New Associate (pro-rated for start date)	$45,000 (pro-rated)
1st year (2022)	$45,000
2nd year (2021)	$55,000
3rd year (2020)	$95,000
4th year (2019)	$115,000
5th year (2018)	$135,000
6th year (2017)	$160,000
7th year (2016+)	$175,000
That’s great news! As firm leadership notes in their memo, “while the exact ratios vary by class level, our total bonuses across the associate classes this calendar year (spring plus end of year 2023) average more than twice the total market bonuses being paid by most other high-end firms this year.” And adding the bonus numbers to the existing compensation scale puts Irell ahead of the market on total compensation even at firms that have raised base compensation. (And that’s not even accounting for the firm’s spring bonuses, which are confirmed for April/May of 2024.)

That’s wonderful news for associates. (UPDATE: Irell announced associate raises back in November.)

You can read the full memo on the [next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/irell-bonuses-23/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Supporting Gender Diversity: Carly Alameda's Perspective
## For gender diversity, although the statistics are heading in the right direction in the in-house community, the same can’t be said for our counterparts in the law firm world.

In today’s legal profession, the focus on diversity, and the evolving relationships between in-house counsel and outside law firm counsel are front of mind. For gender diversity, although the statistics are heading in the right direction in the in-house community, the same can’t be said for our counterparts in the law firm world. To tackle this problem head on, Carly Alameda, a business litigation partner at Farella Braun + Martel in San Francisco handling high stakes disputes, co-founded [WISE: Women In-House Support Equality](http://www.wiselawyers.org).

Alameda is fiercely competitive. She is also the quintessential team player. Carrying herself with a poise and confidence resulting from years of leading teams through the demands that come with being an NCAA Division I student athlete, both on and off the volleyball court, Alameda now uses her ability to strike the balance of competition and collaboration with ease in the courtroom as well. “I am driven to personally perform at the highest level, but I also believe success is usually best attained working well with the team around you. The preparation, the work, the strategy – it’s more productive with a team that trusts and supports each other.”

Alameda believes the practice of law needs both, competition and teamwork.  “As a litigator, these are not mutually exclusive traits. I need to be competitive on my client’s behalf, while ensuring my client’s internal team is highly effective. I am of course a competitor in the market for work, but I’m committed to supporting and helping my network as well.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

This balance is also at the heart of WISE – an alliance of women law firm partners in their first few years of partnership and women (and some men) in-house counsel who have joined together with the express purpose of building relationships and establishing a platform to help increase the number of women lawyers in positions of leadership and influence across the profession.

Alameda explains, “For WISE, my co-founders and I sought out members who are driven for their own success and for that of others. We want our members to look for ways to lift each other up, help others pursue opportunities and tackle challenges, and advance in all of our paths. I know we are all busy and driven people, so we sometimes have a tendency to put our heads down and just work on our own, but I’ve found it always yields better and more enjoyable results when I’m also collaborating with others.”

Alameda adds, “WISE brings together a highly-accomplished group of in-house women and law firm partners from the great companies and firms in the Bay Area. I know we are all competitive.  And that’s okay. I know we can each be out there competing and at the same time find ways to support each other, push each other, learn from each other, and inspire each other. I am very excited to help lead this team.”

Founding WISE was also a natural step stemming from Alameda’s background before joining Farella. After law school, Alameda accepted a clerkship with Justice Mark Simons of the California Court of Appeal, First District. The California appellate system does not typically have annual clerkships like the federal court system does, but Justice Simons made it a point to create a position.

“My clerkship with Justice Simons was transformative. I recognized that he went out of his way to create this opportunity, and I was a beneficiary. I formed lasting relationships with him and several other judges and staff attorneys that set the direction for the start of my career and continue to help shape it. I regularly appreciate the value of the network Justice Simons helped me start, and for the substantive knowledge I gained working with him that year. For example, although I spend a lot of time litigating in federal court or ICC, AAA, or JAMS arbitration, I can also say I truly love my cases that are heard in California state court because I have a relatively unique perspective on the system having seen it up close for a year. I know not every litigator shares my love of the California state court system. Justice Simons provided the foundation for many aspects of my career.”

As Justice Simons created an opportunity for Alameda, she hopes that in co-founding WISE she can help create opportunities for others, many of whom are her peers. “The creation and organization of WISE has taken a lot of time, effort, and thought by my co-founders and myself. But it is worth every bit of work. I want to see this group of women on the cutting edge of the evolving legal marketplace, coming up with new ideas and models for how law firms deliver better value to in-house counsel. I want to see the key voices and positions of power within law firms more balanced between men and women partners. That all starts with the opportunity to form closer relationship and have more regular and direct communications between in-house counsel and women partners, and that is what we are going to do in WISE.”

Have ideas about other ways the in-house community is helping bring diversity and equality to the legal profession? Are you involved in a particular effort? We’d love to hear your thoughts — email or tweet us!

Olga V. Mack and Katia Bloom are startup enthusiasts who embrace the current disruption to the legal profession. Long gone are the days when in-house legal departments simply manage outside counsel or provide services. Today’s legal department is a sophisticated business unit that co-manages the company’s bottom line, embraces technology, and analyzes risks constructively. Mack and Bloom love this change and are dedicated to improving and shaping the future of the legal profession. Together they passionately collect and share inspiring stories of legal leaders who are thriving through the ongoing tectonic shift. Mack and Bloom are convinced that the legal profession will emerge from this revolution even stronger, more resilient, and inclusive than before. They are currently co-authoring a manual of the skills and traits lawyers need to succeed in — and even enjoy — today’s rapidly evolving in-house legal departments.

# Biglaw Firm Tries To Force Summer Associates To Arbitrate Sexual Harassment Claims
## This is absurd. Time's up, Biglaw.

Which Biglaw firm was trying to get its incoming summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements — agreements that would have required them to arbitrate all employment-related claims, including sexual harassment claims?

That would be Munger Tolles & Olson, a preeminent Am Law 200 firm that we’ve likened to the Wachtell of the West for attracting top talent. Munger’s proposed arbitration agreement for summer associates — meant to cover all Title VII claims, including sex and race discrimination — was [leaked on Twitter this weekend](https://twitter.com/isamuel/status/977699755605274629) by Harvard Law lecturer [Ian Samuel](http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11599/Samuel/), whose tweets racked up hundreds of likes and retweets amid much criticism of the firm.

“You would have to be willfully ignorant not to get what this is about,” Samuel said. Summers who signed this agreement would not only have to arbitrate sexual harassment claims, but they’d also be held to a confidentiality clause, wrapping their allegations in the shroud of privacy. Mandatory arbitration and nondisclosure simply don’t mix anymore when it comes to sexual harassment claims. We’ve combined the separate parts of the agreement Samuel posted on Twitter after receiving it from an anonymous friend. Take a look:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


As [noted](https://twitter.com/amandamwhiting/status/978008966973227009) on Twitter by [Amanda Whiting](https://twitter.com/amandamwhiting) of the Washingtonian, Munger hires the most summer associates in its Los Angeles office, a place where the #MeToo movement has had the biggest impact in the post-Weinstein world.

Following the mass outrage that was lodged against the firm on social media, Munger was pretty quick to backtrack on its proposed arbitration agreement for summers:

Munger, Tolles & Olson is committed to the highest standards of conduct. In this case, we were wrong, and we are fixing it. We will no longer require any employees, including summer associates, to sign any mandatory arbitration agreements.

Thanks to social media, no employees at Munger Tolles — from summers to staffers to associates to partners — will be forced to arbitrate sexual harassment claims. But what about those at the firm who previously signed agreements like this? Time may be up, but those who did will still be bound to the firm’s ways of the past.

How many other Biglaw firms are forcing law students to sign agreements like this, sending disputes into private tribunals beyond the prying eyes of the media or courts? How many law students have been bound to suffer in silence in the face of sexual harassment? If you know of any other law firms that require their summers to submit to antiquated agreements like this, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) at or text us at (646) 820-8477.

# How In-House Counsel Are Raising The Bar For Law Firm Diversity
## Companies and general counsel have an important interest in seeing law firms increase diversity.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Danielle Lackey](http://laterallink.com/about/team/190) is the CEO of Lateral Link’s partner, [Cadence Counsel](http://www.laterallink.com/cadence_counsel). A women-owned business, Cadence provides variable staffing solutions to law firms and in-house teams. Danielle leads all facets of the business, from recruiting top talent to consulting with law firms and legal departments to identify and fulfill their fluctuating business demands. Prior to forming Cadence Counsel in 2013, Danielle practiced as a white-collar litigator at Latham & Watkins. She holds a J.D. with distinction from Stanford Law School and B.A. from Brown University, magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa.

Law firms have [increasingly prioritized](https://bol.bna.com/big-law-gender-parity-initiative-picks-up-momentum/) what we can all agree is an important goal: meaningful improvement in the diversity of their ranks. Beyond the positive human and workplace impetus behind this push, firms are experiencing a growing trend of external pressure to increase parity through all levels of hiring and promotion. This pressure comes from their clients — and rightly so. Companies and general counsel have an important interest in seeing law firms increase diversity.

Superior Corporate Performance: A near [causal relationship](http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/2/208.abstract) exists between diversity and bottom-line corporate performance. There is an 80% [improvement](http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/au/Documents/human-capital/deloitte-au-hc-diversity-inclusion-soup-0513.pdf) in business performance when levels of diversity and inclusion are high. Fortune 500 companies with the highest representation of women board directors attain significantly [higher financial performance](http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/bottom-line-corporate-performance-and-womens-representation-boards), on average, than those with the lowest female representation. And racial and ethnic diversity has an even [stronger impact](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) on financial performance in the United States than gender.

Superior Law Firm Performance: Though a company’s lawyers work separately from the business and outside the corporate benchmarks and performance indicators described above, the analysis is equally meaningful within the firm. Clients see diversity as a [key performance indicator](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/639/1/71.abstract) to discern the quality and prestige of a law firm.

Why is this? First, heterogeneous teams produce more nuanced and [innovative solutions](http://cursos.itam.mx/sastre/casos%20y%20ejercicios/diversidadrobinsonydechant97.pdf) to problems. The more perspectives you have in approaching a challenge, the more cross-pollination of ideas, and the better your chance of creative resolution. Since innovative problem solving is the very reason companies hire outside counsel, it is rightly a fundamental factor in their selection of a law firm.

Furthermore, [by 2040](http://workforcediversitynetwork.com/docs/business_case_3.pdf), an estimated half of the population will be made up of groups now considered minorities. The U.S. population of young adults, college students, and graduate students has never been more diverse. Companies are [more profitable](http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/2/208.abstract) if their ranks reflect their client demographic, and law — a service industry — will undoubtedly observe this same trend. A law firm with no African-American partners, for example — of which there are currently twenty in the Am Law 200 — will come under increasing scrutiny by discerning general counsel.

Raising The Bar. In-house counsel and law firms are employing some noteworthy means of improving the diversity of their legal teams. Many general counsel have come to rely heavily on minority- and women-owned law firms, and prioritize doing so wherever possible — as I recently observed at an inspiring [NAMWOLF](http://www.namwolf.org/) conference. Relatedly, and as suggested by Showtime General Counsel Gwen Marcus in a recent [keynote address](http://www.namwolf.org/?page=2016NOLABusMtg), Biglaw firms can bolster their diversity commitment through strategic relationships with women- and minority-owned law firms to whom they refer smaller matters.

As a women-owned business, Cadence Counsel is proud to play a role in deepening these types of relationships. General counsel now engage diverse firms on larger matters knowing the firm can ramp up as needed with our [Ad Hoc Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/the-new-frontier-for-law-firm-profitability-ad-hoc-counsel/). They use Cadence lawyers to bring diversity [directly to the in-house workplace](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/why-are-in-house-legal-departments-turning-to-temporary-attorneys/?rf=1). And they direct their outside firms that have not yet reached their diversity goals to partner with Cadence as a way to infuse a diverse resource into their legal spend.

More diverse companies and firms are [better able to win top talent](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters) and attract and retain diverse talent. Law firms have a big job ahead of them in an industry where women make up [18%](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202740896546/Women-in-Big-Law-Are-Losing-Ground?slreturn=20160210201926) of equity partners, and ethnic minorities represent 6% of partners — but many are up to the challenge. Close strategic collaboration between in-house law departments, law firms of varying compositions, and alternative service providers can be a powerful tool in advancing these goals.

[Danielle Lackey](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/190) is the CEO of [Cadence Counsel](http://www.laterallink.com/cadence_counsel). Now a Lateral Link partner, Cadence provides experienced, highly-credentialed Ad Hoc Counsel® to join legal teams for variable engagements. Danielle can be reached at dlackey@cadencecounsel.com.

How often do you think about the meaning of double-spacing? If you’re like most people, the answer is never. But, if you’re the lawyers from any of the 15 law firms in Jones et al v. Bain Capital Private Equity et al, an antitrust suit in the Western District of Tennessee, the subject has occupied every moment of your existence since mid-October. That’s when the defendants, represented by Cleary, Baker Donelson, Locke Lord, and Butler Snow filed their [Motion to Require Adherence with Formatting Requirements of Local Rule 7.1](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/11/Motion.pdf), charging the plaintiffs with the dastardly act of gaming the double-spacing mechanism!

But, the plaintiffs would counter, what does “double-spacing” even mean anyway?

A full 66 pages of digital ink will be spilled on this question and this is why lawyers can’t have nice things.

The defendants note:

Local Rule 7.1 requires that, in papers presented for filing, “[l]ines must be double- spaced, except that quotations may be indented and single-spaced and headings and footnotes may be single-spaced.” LR 7.1(b). All widely-used word processing programs, including Microsoft Word, Google Documents, and Apple Pages, use 28 “points” of spacing when set to double-space lines.

They forgot Word Perfect, which still — somehow — [exists!](https://www.wordperfect.com/en/product/office-suite/?sourceid=wpo2021-xx-ppc_brkws&x-vehicle=ppc_brkws&trial=big&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=wper-dd-all-adwordsppc&utm_content=132628854692&utm_term=word%20perfect&utm_id=14666095356&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAvJarBhA1EiwAGgZl0DHA79HrjOhxVAkrb7VCeV9PI73xCIyaomVSPhY-LKJ5e1psbyvL0BoCTEYQAvD_BwE)

In the process of preparing replies in support of Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Defendants discovered that Plaintiffs have with regularity overrode the standard double-space setting and instead spaced lines 24 points apart. This has enabled Plaintiffs to have approximately 27 lines on each page, rather than the approximately 23 lines per page that would result from formatting using standard double spacing. By doing so, Plaintiffs gained approximately 7 and a half additional pages for their statement of additional facts and approximately 17 additional pages for their legal memoranda opposing summary judgment.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Despite the alarmist rhetoric of the motion, attorneys for the [plaintiffs responded](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/11/response.pdf) by getting literal:

Plaintiffs’ Opposition brief employed 12-point font and 24-point line spacing. That is double-spacing. Plaintiffs complied with the rule requirement as that requirement is widely and broadly understood.

Ideally, the response would end there. Instead, plaintiffs provided 58 pages of material. Probably would’ve been shorter if they used 28 points.

They even threw in some originalism to bolster the textual argument:

But as Plaintiffs’ typography expert explains, “double spacing” has an objective meaning, derived from the historical precedent of the typewriter: it means line spacing that is double the size of the typeface font. That interpretation makes common sense, finds historical support, and does not require litigants to purchase a license to specific commercial word-processing products or to be subject to the vagaries of the software over time.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The brief backs up the vagaries over time point by noting that Microsoft even expanded its spacing before the 2007 version release and that the company’s “double spacing” is not even consistent across fonts.

There’s not been a historical account of typography this thrilling since that Helvetica movie!

Not content to leave well enough alone, plaintiffs pile on with policy arguments for their interpretation of double spacing.

Second, Defendants’ interpretation of the rule would provide for significant formatting gamesmanship, because there are numerous word-processing programs, and each may (and often do) apply a different “double” line spacing formula….

Third, and perhaps must fundamentally, the Local Rules of courts should not require the use of any specific commercial product, such as Microsoft Word.4 Access to courts is a fundamental right. And access to courts should never be conditioned on using a particular commercial product. If courts mandated line-spacing based on the behavior of any specific word- processing program, access to courts would be conditioned on purchasing a license to that program.



They even found a case imposing sanctions on a party for trying to argue that double spacing means the Microsoft default:

At least one court has granted sanctions against a party for raising such an argument. See Focally LLC v. Win Elements, LLC, No. EDCV 21-2105 JGB (KKx), 2022 WL 19827474, at *6-8 (C.D. Cal. 2022) (holding that a defendant’s motion to strike a plaintiffs’ opposition for using 24-pt spacing rather than Microsoft Word’s proprietary “double” line setting was subject to sanctions, because not only was it “objectively baseless” since 24-pt spacing is double-spacing, but also because “the real problem with Defendants’ filing is . . . the sheer audacity of advancing such a meritless argument”).

I’ve not seen a case more magically back up one side’s argument on a completely bonkers, hyperspecific set of facts since Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co.. Ltd. And that case [doesn’t actually exist](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/chatgpt-bad-lawyering/).

[YET THIS DOUBLE SPACING SANCTIONS CASE ABSOLUTELY EXISTS!](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/11/Sanctions.pdf)

Still, Chief Judge Lipman wasn’t in the mood to impose sanctions as much as she just wanted everyone to shut the hell up. After denying the motion without taking a definitive stance on double spacing, Judge Lipman writes:

The Court further notes that the last thing any party needs is more words on a page. [FN: Indeed, Plaintiffs’ twelve pages worth of prose, two declarations, and multiple other exhibits filed in opposition to this Motion, while interesting, displays both sides’ tendency toward overkill.]… Moving forward, the Parties are encouraged to spend their valuable time focusing on the merits of this case, and certainly not figuring out how many sometimes-useless words will fit on a page.

Hear, hear. Now we can put aside the needless sniping over the meaning of double spacing and get back to an important issue: plaintiffs correctly only using one space after periods while the defendants use two like it’s 1957 or something.

# The Day The Lawyer Jokes Died
## The administration's immigration moves have made people appreciate lawyers more than ever.

Protestors at JFK Airport (photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images).

For the past two weeks, across the country, lawyer jokes have fallen silent. For the past two weeks, as attorneys from around the nation have poured into airports to assist immigrants caught in the crosshairs of a quickly implemented executive travel ban, people have been proud of their lawyers, families have been grateful for them, strangers have been feeding them. And none of those lawyers did what so often is the foundation of jokes and derision — they did not charge a fee to anyone, in any amount. Out of the chaos and panic that erupted, there has grown great appreciation for the legal community.

When President Trump issued his Executive Order on January 27, attorneys responded. From every corner of the profession, a remarkable show of justice burst forth. This was not a showing of partisan politics, but rather a devotion to justice from lawyers across the political spectrum. Devotion not to ideology but to equity. Yes, most who showed up at airports to lend their expertise to isolated travelers likely opposed the President’s action. But who they cast their vote for, or whether they had voted at all, no longer mattered. They arrived to make sure our adversarial system of justice was going to work for those who needed it most.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This was not the first time lawyers have responded to the urgencies created by executive polices on immigration. In 2014, there was a mobilization of attorneys who banded together to resist the Obama Administration’s family detention policies. Then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris, later elected to the U.S. Senate, convened a meeting of lawyers, issuing a call to action to ensure that no immigrant child be allowed to face the Immigration Court system, risking deportation to an often hostile country of origin, without legal representation. She asked the assembled counsel, essentially, to leave their politics at the door. No matter their views on prevailing immigration laws, they had an obligation to make sure that these children had lawyers, that children should not go into court alone to face a complex judicial process that perplexes and intimidates even most U.S. citizen adults. She said that, without counsel, the promise of our democracy, the fairness of our system of justice, was just a dream.

In 2017, with even more divisive politics at stake, the legal profession gave itself that very same kind of speech, honoring our democracy, reveling in the confidence they have in a system that only lawyers can make fair. Attorneys from major law firms, small law firms, immigration attorneys, non-immigration lawyers who just wanted to help, seasoned pro bono counsel, legal aid lawyers, law students, and professors of all backgrounds converged on major airports to help those who were confused and frightened. The lawyers came from across the political spectrum. They shared a belief that navigating the immigration legal system, especially at a time of massive and urgent need, was near impossible without the help of the legal profession.

Make no mistake about it, the response, while admirable, was chaotic. Without time to create infrastructure, the flood of volunteer lawyers and avalanche of communications sometimes overwhelmed efforts to organize and build the mechanics of coordination. But communication networks and systems were quickly established by those on the ground. At the end of the beginning weekend, more than 900 lawyers were connecting via email and social media. They jumped into action as families were being separated, young children being isolated from their parents. Their efforts had concrete results. For example, lawyers helped find safety in this country for the aging, sick parents of a U.S. citizen, enabling him to provide for them the care they need. Attorneys secured passage to the U.S. [for an Iraqi interpreter](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-38885611) who had risked his life to help American troops. These were people who already had endured an arduous, years-long vetting process. These were the people for whom the gargantuan pro bono efforts were being launched.

Legal aid organizations began to assume the role of convenors and repositories of assignments and collaboration. Immigration lawyers were thrust into mentorship roles, litigators became problem solvers, corporate attorneys became avid learners. Lawyers flocked to airports, though some were asked to leave because too many volunteers had overwhelmed the sites. Many arranged to have equipment delivered, food provided, and technology set up. Committees were formed to deal with the press, government officials, and airlines.

Some attorneys began to file habeas petitions. Others engaged in legal research, interviewed and provided support to family members, or worked together on legal issues and policies. Translators were summoned, conflict checks were performed, everyone moving rapidly, sometimes appearing to be moving randomly, battling the volume and the urgency. A volunteer manual was quickly drafted, teams of firms worked on coordinated issues, and intake forms were created and distributed. Information and advice was exchanged by the minute, with everyone working toward the common goal of providing access to justice for those most in need.

That first weekend was an exercise in chaos and the Constitution. While protests erupted at airports, lawyers worked feverishly to help vulnerable clients in ways that only lawyers can do. Knowing that their purpose was justice, and that the processes depended on fairness, hundreds of lawyers worked impossible hours throughout the weekend. They knew that amid the cacophony they had to make the system work. No detained immigrant would be left alone, for our democracy does not work when the vulnerable are unaided and alone.

As arriving immigrants were slowly released from detention, tears flowed, cheers erupted, and the lawyers kept at it, continually learning how to deal with the next moment of urgency. Lawyers who spoke Arabic, lawyers who were angry, lawyers who were apolitical, lawyers who were Muslims, Jews, African Americans, Latinos, Republicans and Democrats lived a lawyer’s highest calling. They were serving those in need, serving an overloaded system, and making sure the tools of democracy were available and working. And as the emergency waned, ever so slightly, and the wheels of just turned as they should, not a single lawyer joke was to be heard.

UPDATE: An earlier version of this story suggested the order was signed on January 30 — the order was signed the 27th, and the outpouring of attorney response began on the 30th.

Our nation is going through difficult times, as the coronavirus pandemic worsens, millions of Americans remain unemployed, and racial injustice and inequality persist. The need for us to help our fellow citizens runs especially high.

During a period like this, it’s heartening to see how the legal community has stepped up to the plate. For example, during the recent [National Pro Bono Celebration](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2020/11/pro-bono-2020--lawyers-respond-to-covid-19-and-more-with-free-le/), thousands of lawyers and law students across the country participated in volunteer events.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Some lawyers go even further, doing not just occasional pro bono work but dedicating their entire careers to working in the public interest. And hundreds of these lawyers — [more than 900 of them](https://www.skaddenfellowships.org/#section-nav-anchor), to be more precise — have started their legal careers doing public interest work with the support of Skadden Fellowships.

As we’ve [explained in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/congratulations-to-the-2019-skadden-fellows/), these prestigious fellowships, the public-interest world’s version of Supreme Court clerkships or Rhodes Scholarships, allow their recipients to pursue public interest work on a full-time basis for two years. Skadden Arps started the program in 1988 to commemorate its 40th anniversary as a law firm, and more than 30 years later, it continues to provide its generous support.

Shortly before Thanksgiving, Skadden announced its 2021 class of fellows. These 29 graduating law students and judicial clerks will work in 18 cities in 14 states across the United States, focusing on such issues as education equity, gender-based violence, housing, immigrants’ rights, LGBTQ+ rights, police accountability, voting rights, and workers’ rights.

For the 2021 class of fellows, Harvard led the way with nine fellows, UC Berkeley produced five fellows, and UCLA minted three. The remaining law schools each placed one graduate into the program — including [one newcomer to the list](https://www.law.com/2020/11/25/harvard-law-dominates-2021-skadden-fellow-class-but-kansas-marks-a-first/), the University of Kansas School of Law.

How is Biglaw dealing with the economic upheaval surrounding COVID-19? Well, there have [been layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/) and salary cuts ([10 percent pay reductions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [25 percent pay cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/), and partners who’ve [slowed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-back-partner-compensation-amid-covid-19-economic-upheaval/) or [eliminated](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/) their payday) and [benefits have taken a hit](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-retirement-matching-in-effort-to-avoid-layoffs/). Now we’ve heard that one Biglaw firm has taken a slightly different approach.

Pryor Cashman has furloughed associates amid the economic downturn. Though the difference between furloughs and layoffs [is fuzzy at best](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/furlough-vs-lay-off), the implication of a furlough is that the employee will be re-hired at some point. Tipsters at the firm haven’t been told a specific date or timeframe that the now out-of-work associates will be hired back.

According to a statement by the firm, they furloughed associates whose work has dried up because of coronavirus. And they didn’t provide a specific time table for bringing back the associates, only saying they’d do so once the work is back:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We have furloughed some associates whose workflow has been interrupted by the COVID-19 crisis.  We are hopeful and expect that we can reinstate them as soon as their work levels approach norms again.

Hopefully for those impacted, the furlough will be relatively short. But given the lack of certainty surrounding the virus, it doesn’t look great.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

When Richard Posner [abruptly retired from the federal judiciary](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/richard-posner-is-retiring/), he left a giant hole in the Seventh Circuit. Despite the [whining about “Democrats holding up nominees](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/when-you-hear-whining-about-judicial-vacancies-dont-get-played/)” that Republicans keep complaining about, the Senate managed to confirm his replacement — Skadden partner [Michael Scudder](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/s/scudder-michael-y) — by a vote of 90-0 on Monday. See, this is actually easy to do when you nominate someone qualified.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/05/14/skaddens-michael-scudder-confirmed-to-7th-circuit-succeeding-posner/) Law.com, Scudder, who has been a partner at Skadden since 2009, has a practice focused on tax-related matters, accounting, and white-collar disputes. The financial disclosure forms, released as part of the confirmation process, reveal he’ll be leaving quite a bit of money on the table by moving to public service — he took home $3.06 million in partnership income for 2017 and $2.55 million for 2016.

But Scudder is no stranger to public service. After clerking for Justice Anthony Kennedy and Fourth Circuit Judge Paul Niemeyer (and a brief stint at Jones Day), he worked at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. And he gets rave reviews for his time there:

Then-U.S. Attorney James Comey hired Scudder. Comey said of Scudder in a 2010 Chicago Lawyer [profile](http://www.chicagolawyermagazine.com/elements/pages/print.aspx?printpath=/Archives/2010/01/01/012010scudderprofile&classname=tera.gn3article): “He is somebody who can easily be overlooked in a crowded room of loud lawyers because he is so quiet. But once you get to know him, when Mike Scudder speaks, you shut your mouth and you listen. He’s not going to talk often, but when he talks, he’s going to say something that’s worth saying.”

Colleagues are looking forward to seeing Scudder’s tenure on the bench, citing his commitment to equal justice:

“He is an inspired choice for the Seventh Circuit, not just because of his intellect and experience—which are unparalleled—but because of his commitment to equal justice under the law,” Gregory Craig, [formerly of counsel](https://at.law.com/fPASjk?cmp=share_twitter) at Skadden, said in March. “Mike was born to be a judge, and we—as Americans—will all be better for his being on the bench.”

Gregory Craig now has [plenty of time](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/amid-mueller-probe-prominent-skadden-counsel-disappears-from-website/) to give out quotes to the media.

At Skadden, Scudder has been a big proponent of pro bono work and has been the lead partner defending University of North Carolina’s affirmative action admissions policy in a lawsuit.

Also confirmed on Monday, by a vote of 91-0, was Seventh Circuit nominee Amy St. Eve, who was elevated from her current district court position.

# Biglaw Bonuses Come Complete With Punitive Measures For Naughty Associates
## It stings for those taking the hit to their pocketbook.

The good little associates at Ropes & Gray are getting delightful bonuses for being on the “good” list. In an announcement Tuesday, the firm said that junior associates — Class of 2016 and more recent — will be receiving market scale bonuses ($15,000 – $25,000) assuming they’ve hit their billable hours target of 1900. For more senior associates, they’ll receive individualized bonuses that are promised to take into account the market standard. And high billers or otherwise extraordinary associates can expect a little extra in their stocking this year.

For those who failed to make their billable hours this year, the firm will dock their bonuses, but they will get something. Which might suck if you’ve just barely missed the threshold, but it’s better than being iced out of the bonus pool entirely.

For these reasons, adhering to our diary standards is absolutely crucial. As previously announced, lawyers violating our diary standards have received an automatic bonus reduction.

If your law school is less than practical and your summer clerkship strategy is to do as few projects as possible, it seems like clairvoyance is a must-have skill for a successful future lawyer. Maybe they should add a section for it on the LSAT!

When it comes to summer clerkships and internships, which is a better strategy – doing a few things exceptionally well or many things 95% there?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Sean Rayani, commercial contracts senior manager at Twilio, said, “As a lawyer or legal professional, you will not have the luxury to just do a few things when you start practicing (especially if you start in-house at technology companies in their infancy).  There will be times where you will have the kitchen sink thrown at you, and you will have to get it all done.”

He explained, “Inevitably, you can not do everything perfectly if you have an overflowing plate, but you will have to do the best you can. Reenacting what you will experience once you start practicing during a summer clerkship, in my opinion, serves as a really good training and expectation setting for the legal profession generally.”

Likewise, Sarah Feingold, co-founder of the Fourth Floor and former GC of Etsy and Vroom, advised, “I say — try a lot of things, talk to a lot of people, and then prioritize, focus on doing a few things well, and periodically take a step back to reevaluate how your career is proceeding.”

The Go-Getters

Jamie Szal, Maine state and local tax attorney at Brann & Isaacson, said, “My law school was structured on a co-op model: normal 1L year, then switch to 4 alternating quarters each of class and internship. That model spat out graduates with literally twice as much experience as most new law grads, because we had to do 4 full-time 12-week posts to graduate.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
She continued, “I highly, highly recommend pursuing not only summer positions but also internships, externships, clinics, and other practical skill-building opportunities throughout law school to maximize exposure to different practices. For those like me who had a good sense of what we were interested in, use those opportunities as a finely honed tool: explore different work environments within the same field of practice.”

The Learn-As-You-Goers

Lisa Lang, general counsel of Kentucky State University, said, “I never set out with a plan in terms of the practice area. I initially gravitated toward whatever opportunity I found.” She continued, “After several years of practice, I realized where I was strong and where I was weak. That realization helped guide my choices and made me more selective in terms of the opportunities I pursued (and later enjoyed). My choices, at the time, did not appear to make sense.  Looking back now, everything makes complete sense.”

Rachel Coll, lawyer and certified life coach at Rachel Coll Coaching, observed, “I’m a big believer in sampling what you might like, and making decisions as you go. I was always a ‘learn by doing’ kind of lawyer. That’s just me. I loved treating the practice of law like a buffet of practice areas that I just sampled until I was full, and I think this experience helps me look back at my legal career as something that I thoroughly enjoyed.”

The Strategic Type

Anjie Vichayanonda, founder and CEO of Leg Up Legal, explained, “We have to constantly try new things, see if they work, and fail A LOT. If you’re not failing, you’re not growing. Do more. Fail more. Fail hard. Fail fast. And you will learn better. For young lawyers, I would urge you to find a firm with a culture that allows you to explore, challenge yourself, and fail in a safe space. I know it’s extremely difficult to find, but in the long run, it will make you a better lawyer.”

Neil Greenbaum, partner at Greenbaum Law Firm and a former general counsel, said, “As a law student, it would certainly make sense to learn as much as you can in various areas of law. That way, you can actually have some idea of what you might like over what you might not like. However, as a seasoned practitioner, you do want to do a few things as possible exceptionally well.”

The Formulaic Type

“80-20 rule — Pareto rules all the way. Do multiple things 80% [then] focus on a few things with 100%. Use the same rule to pick what 20% of those projects you are working on that will likely drive 80% attention from management or provide you learning experience, and provide extra focus on these projects, and less focus on the others.” Yosr Hussein Hamza, director, legal and ombudsman affairs, Middle East at Gartner, explained.

She continued, “You never know which chance at this age can help you know which area of law you’d like to practice. And this rule helped me so much to date. Perfectionism leads [nowhere] eventually.”

This is a question for which there is no universal answer. As demonstrated by the diversity in answers, it’s a dynamic that each person must be mindful of for themselves, in shaping their own career and balancing learning more with doing good work. But it’s also not a question that is settled once you’re a few years in. Careers are constantly changing, and with more and more opportunities to adapt, lifelong learning is part of what it means to be a modern lawyer. We should all, then, stay intentional about how we can learn new skills while continuing to do our current job well.

And finding that balance is its own skill to develop.

# Making SCOTUS Even Greater: Trump's Supplemental Supreme Court Shortlist
## A closer look at the ten new names on Donald Trump's SCOTUS list.

As you have [probably](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/morning-docket-09-26-16/) [heard](https://twitter.com/NinaTotenberg/status/779404383092088832), Donald Trump recently issued a list of ten more people that he would consider for the U.S. Supreme Court if elected president. This list can be seen as a supplement to the SCOTUS slate that he [released in May](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/), making his shortlist… not that short.

To a cynic, the new list could be viewed as a desperate attempt by Trump, ahead of [tonight’s big debate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-tonights-presidential-debate-and-drinking-game/), to remind conservatives that despite all their misgivings about him, at least he will appoint justices more to their liking than [President Hillary Clinton](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/hillary-clintons-supreme-court-shortlist-11-scotus-possibilities/). In his [press release](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-adds-to-list-of-potential-supreme-court-justice-picks) announcing the names, Trump declares, “This list is definitive, and I will choose only from it in picking future Justices of the United States Supreme Court.” But given Trump’s constantly shifting positions, one can [question the wisdom](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438736/donald-trump-supreme-court-constitution-promises-are-fantasy) of relying on his promises.

For what it’s worth, it’s a solid list for conservatives. When Trump released his first list back in May, I [noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/?rf=1) that his potential picks seemed to reflect input from the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. In his press release for this second list, Trump explicitly thanks the two groups, bellwethers of the legal right, for their contributions.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Trump’s first list was almost evenly divided between federal and state judges — six federal, five state — and the second list is similar, with five federal judges and four state judges (plus one U.S. senator). The first list was heavily male — eight men, three women — and the second list is even more skewed, with just one woman and nine men.

I previously [pointed out](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/?rf=1) the lack of racial and ethnic diversity on Trump’s first list, and the second list seems to address that concern. As noted by [Nina Totenberg](http://www.npr.org/2016/09/23/495216645/donald-trump-unveils-new-more-diverse-supreme-court-short-list?live=1), the new list “is more racially and ethnically diverse — [it includes] one African-American state court judge, a Venezuelan-born federal judge, and another federal judge of South Asian descent.”

Who are those three judges, as well as the seven other lucky individuals to make it onto Trump’s new and improved SCOTUS shortlist? Flip to the next page for the names….

# Biglaw Firm's Got A Case That's A Dilly Of A Pickle
## There are allegations Whole Foods stole a pickle recipe.

Don’t let their traditional role as a supporting character for sandwiches fool you — pickles are big business. And when there’s a legal dustup in the industry, Biglaw gets the call. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, on behalf of Grillo’s Pickles, filed suit against Patriot Pickles, repped by Jones Day, in a lawsuit that could send ripples through deli counters everywhere — or at least at Whole Foods.

The companies are former pickle packaging partners (say that five times fast) and, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2023/07/17/big-law-engaged-in-legal-pickle-over-allegedly-stolen-recipe-for-sale-at-whole-foods/) Law.com, Grillo alleges Patriot used that arrangement to steal its recipe and formulation process.

Patriot operates a substantial amount of its business with “co-packing” agreements that involve it being contracted to package, label and ship foods for brands owned by others. Patriot was in a co-packing agreement with Grillo’s from 2012 until the summer of 2021. Patriot then began manufacturing Whole Foods 365 pickles this May, according to the company’s complaint.

In the complaint, Grillo’s argued that it and Patriot signed a mutual nondisclosure agreement as part of the co-packing agreement, which forbid Patriot from disclosing Grillo’s “formulas” and “processes” until termination of the agreement.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Grillo claims it did testing which “illustrate[d] a nearly identical profile” between the pickles and say they have “virtually identical nutritional information and are made from precisely the same ingredients as Grillo’s pickles.”

Also worth noting — these similarities are pretty recent:

Whole Foods 365 previously used Hermann Pickles as a co-packaging partner before working with Patriot. Grillo’s claimed the formula and packaging for the Whole Foods 365 pickles when Hermann was its co-packer was “completely different.”

Plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief as well as damages.

The persons who did this are criminals who should be brought to justice. And if they thought they were going to intimidate me, they picked the wrong guy.

— Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher partner [Randy Mastro](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/mastro-randy-m/), offering a statement after his [townhome was vandalized](https://www.law.com/2020/10/24/nyc-home-of-gibson-dunns-mastro-vandalized-amid-spate-of-attorney-harassment/) following his representation of the West Side Community Organization in its bid to remove homeless people from a hotel on the Upper West Side. Some of the things spray-painted on the walls of Mastro’s building and sidewalk include “SHAME” and “F*CK YOU RANDY.” Mastro’s family wasn’t home when the vandalism occurred.

# Big Money For Most Offices... Smaller Money For One

If we said, “all U.S. offices are matching Cravath except Charlotte,” you’d assume we were talking about a firm with offices in NY, DC, and Charlotte, or something like that. You wouldn’t expect it from a firm with 11 offices nationwide in places like Irving and Austin.

And yet here we are.

Now admittedly Katten Muchin maintains very small offices in Irving and Austin, with only one or two associates, and maybe they don’t feel the need to put such a small cadre out. Or maybe those offices are just doing more profitable work.

Whatever the reason, most of Katten’s U.S.-based attorneys are very happy this morning with the announcement of Cravath raises.



So what happened to Charlotte? Well, they’re only kind of happy. They’re still getting raises, just not the same haul the lawyers in Biglaw hotbeds like Austin are getting.

Remember, it takes around $76K in Charlotte to live a NY $180K lifestyle. [Not every office should be getting the full match](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/) that Cravath’s laying out there. That said, Charlotte has just about the same cost of living as Austin, so if Charlotte associates feel slighted it’s understandable.

And it’s really easy to feel slighted when you consider we’ve gotten a number of full Cravath raises in Charlotte (from the likes of [Dechert](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-finally-joins-the-moneylaw-club-raising-associate-salaries/), [Cadwalader](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/with-profits-per-partner-this-high-it-was-only-a-matter-of-time-until-associates-got-raises/), [Mayer Brown](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/chicago-based-biglaw-firm-ponies-up-the/), and [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/leading-biglaw-firm-raises-salaries-for-all-u-s-associates/)). You’d have thought that would set the market down there, but I guess you’d be wrong.

Congratulations anyway! Wherever you live, you’re making a lot of money so be thankful.

When your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Well that was exciting, [eh?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eh#Canada) Our 2016 holiday card contest went right down to the wire, and the top two contenders — who blew away the rest of the field — were separated by a mere five votes.[[1]](#f1)

Our newest winner joins the distinguished company of previous holiday card contest winners:

2015: [Wolf Greenfield](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-winner-6/)

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Congratulations to [Gowling WLG](https://gowlingwlg.com/en/global/global-reach). This international powerhouse, a product of the merger of Canada-based Gowlings and UK-based Wragge Lawrence Graham, narrowly edged out [Wolf Greenfield](http://www.wolfgreenfield.com/), the distinguished IP boutique that came this close to defending its title. You can check out Gowling’s winning card — which makes up for what it lacks in edginess by being really, really nice (recall that they’re Canadian) — over [here](https://sites-gowlingwlg.vuturevx.com/14/2647/landing-pages/gowling-wlg-video-all-lang.asp).

It’s nice to see a 2016 election ending on happy and harmonious note. Congrats to all the worthy finalists, and thanks to everyone who nominated a card or voted in the contest. We can’t wait to see what cleverness comes our way in 2017.

[ [1]](#reff1) As in the past, we did receive reports of technical issues, including the poll not closing on time for some readers. Alas, as we’ve explained in the context of prior contests, we unfortunately lack the ability to prevent all technical problems or to conduct recounts when problems do occur. So we have no choice but to go with what the WordPress poll tells us, relying upon that technology and the honesty of our readers.

People often ask where I get my column ideas. My editor, Staci Zaretsky, cites the late Nora Ephron for the sentence “Everything is copy.” Never has that been truer than reading the story in the Los Angeles Times about how the City of Los Angeles will have to cough up [a million bucks](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-26/lawyers-for-city-atty-mike-feuer-badmouthed-a-colleague-now-hes-getting-a-1-million-payout) to a former veteran deputy city attorney because of disparaging emails about him among colleagues in the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office. I am not making this up.

Haven’t we all told clients not to send any emails that could end up in print or elsewhere? Haven’t we all preached the issue of discoverability and what could and does happen? Just about everything is discoverable these days and apparently neither work product or attorney-client privileges were available. I wonder what these lawyers learned in law school about discovery.

Moral of this story: don’t badmouth a co-worker. And for crying out loud, if you absolutely must badmouth a co-worker (never a good idea), don’t do it in writing.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Let’s stipulate that we are all stupid, all of us, from time to time, and for some people, more often than they’d like. We lawyers make all kinds of stupid mistakes, from screwing up on court filing deadlines, forgetting to calendar something, or trying to put the blame on support staff (don’t ever do that). We all have stupid moments, judges and lawyers alike.

I don’t know why judges think that they can get a pass on being stupid. Judges can and do make stupid rulings, which is why there are appellate courts to tell them when they have been stupid, and higher appellate courts to tell the intermediate appellate courts when they have been stupid. But right now, I’m not talking about legal issues, I am talking about judgment, or lack thereof, and how judges get themselves into trouble when they “ready, fire, aim.” The same holds true for lawyers. We think we should know better, but we don’t. We open mouth and insert foot; we tweet without thinking.

Why is there any difficulty in [understanding what the N-word means](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/judge-being-investigated-over-use-of-the-n-word/)? A judge in Washington state said she used the word because she thought that court employees in a Zoom meeting might have been confused as to what she was referring to. Really? How could there be any confusion by any sentient person about the meaning of that word? And yes, she’s still on the bench, but it’s not clear whether she will run for re-election. She did have the decency to resign her position as chief presiding judge.

In fairness, it’s not just judges who are stupid when they open their mouths, it’s lawyers, too. A lawyer who [called a judge an a-hole at a holiday party](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/lawyer-who-called-judge-an-a-hole-at-holiday-party-disciplined/) is being disciplined for what amounts to “conduct unbecoming.” The woman lawyer was intoxicated, a polite work for “drunk as a skunk.” Apologies to all the skunks out there. Is there any First Amendment issue being chilled by the discipline? Nope, not according to the majority opinion by the Ohio Supreme Court which meted out a stayed six-month suspension with some terms and conditions attached.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Moral here: if you are going to use such descriptive language about a judge, and we all have been either tempted to do so or have done so, do it privately. No PDOD, no public displays of derision.

A “seasoned” lawyer in the 7th Circuit failed to convince the court to set aside $17,000 in sanctions against him for arguing baseless personal jurisdiction claims and for discovery jerking around (I just made up that term, but I like it) [by providing evasive answers](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/seasoned-litigator-fails-to-persuade-7th-circuit-that-sanction-was-demeaning-and-too-harsh?utm_medium=email&utm_source=salesforce_525491&sc_sid=04744929&utm_campaign=weekly_email&promo=&utm_content=&additional4=&additional5=&sfmc_j=525491&sfmc_s=83087486&sfmc_l=1527&sfmc_jb=29020&sfmc_mid=100027443&sfmc_u=15182960) to what the court considered reasonable discovery requests.

The attorney claimed that the sanction was demeaning and too harsh. If he’s that “seasoned,” then he should have known that his conduct would have consequences.

The public often sees lawyers as “gunslingers,” duking it out at the O.K. Corral, aka the courthouse. That may become a reality for lawyers in Kentucky, as Kentucky lawmakers have approved a bill that would allow lawyers licensed in the state and who have concealed carry permits [to carry guns in court](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyers-could-carry-guns-in-court-if-kentucky-governor-signs-bill?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email). Swell. Just what we need. A Kentucky state senator said that lawyers should have the same right to protect themselves as prosecutors and judges. Will rulings on evidence be greeted by pistol brandishing or worse?

And while some corporate clients remain joined at the hip to their Biglaw lawyers, that may not always be the case going forward, and, as a result, the reluctance of clients to sue their Biglaw firm lawyers may be dwindling. A partner at a Biglaw firm pointed out that it’s not just a matter of less loyalty, but more client expectations, even unreasonable ones, especially in transactional matters. If there’s no long-term relationship, then clients may well be willing to roll the dice in a malpractice matter.

The old advice still holds true. [The lawyer-client relationship is a relationship](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/its-a-perfect-storm-for-attorney-malpractice-claims/), but it’s our job as lawyers to temper expectations with realities. And the reality is that today, loyalty doesn’t pay the malpractice insurance premium.

Hour-and-a-half lunches and long memos are great for the billable-hour structure, but I don’t have that luxury in house.

—Edward T. Paulis III, vice president and senior assistant counsel for Zurich North America, [speaking to Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1166469/gcs-dish-on-why-they-drop-outside-counsel) about his biggest pet peeves (the kind that lead to firms getting fired) with outside counsel. He also went on to emphasize why his time is so valuable, “I don’t bill by the hour, I just have to get through a lot of stuff quickly, so give me the executive summary. Get to the point quickly.” So note to Biglaw lawyers: Stop wasting time, even if you get to bill for it.

# Biglaw Growth Is Back In A Big Way

After several years of tepid growth, global Biglaw has finally broken through and enjoyed the sort of solid financial performance that usually presages a horrific collapse.

That’s perhaps too cynical. But having been through one of a Biglaw boom and bust cycle before it seems things are always at their best right before the fall. It’s when mergers and acquisitions work gets a bit too frisky and the underlying economy starts to look a bit too reckless. Maybe this time we’ll buck that trend. Stranger things have happened.

After years of solid, if unexciting, 2 to 3 percent revenue growth, the [American Lawyer’s Global 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/09/24/the-2018-global-100/) experienced 6.4 percent growth, amassing $105.7 billion.

Of the top 100, 40 have revenue over $1 billion, further evidence that the rich keep getting richer in the legal market. By 85th place on the Global 100, firms aren’t even cracking half a billion. Roughly a quarter of the top 100’s revenue is locked up in the top 10. What’s the significance of that kind of wealth concentration? Hard to say, but it seems to me that there’s a clear dividing line between firms set

What about profits per equity partner? Oh, well they have those too! Here are the top 10 there.

# This Is Why You Shouldn't Date A Lawyer
## Some, but not all, lawyers are terrible partners in relationships.

Lawyers operate … with a very high level of urgency. What that can mean is that they can become impulsive. They can become irritable [and] argumentative because they’re always operating at 11. … It can also cause somebody to be a very poor listener, because you’re just trying to get to the point.

We’re the ones to whom people come for answers. Asking for help becomes very difficult. Strong relationships are reciprocal by definition. If you can’t show vulnerability or ask for help, then it can make a relationship very one-dimensional.

— [Stacey Dougan](https://www.staceydougan.com/about-me) of Stacey Dougan Counseling & Consulting in Atlanta, Georgia, commenting on [why some lawyers “suck at relationships.”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/08/argumentative-and-self-sufficient-ever-wonder-why-some-lawyers-suck-at-relationships/) Dougan is a former Greenberg Traurig shareholder who became a therapist, and she now counsels attorneys and law students.

# IT Professionals Deserve More Respect
## IT professionals are critical to the money-making drive of law firms since they help lawyers stay efficient and engaged in client work for as much time as possible.

Over the past few months, I have written several articles about how administrative professionals in the legal industry deserve more respect. The legal profession can only operate with the help of numerous nonlawyers, and the contributions of these professionals is often overlooked. I recently received an insightful email from an information technology professional at a law firm, and the exchange made me remember how grateful I was for all of the IT professionals I interacted with throughout my career. IT professionals definitely deserve more respect in the legal industry for a number of reasons.

The first time I encountered IT professionals was when I was a summer associate at a Biglaw firm. Summer associates need to be trained on a variety of law firm technologies quickly, and since they only have eight to 10 weeks at a firm to make an impression, they need to hit the ground running when they start their positions. Fortunately, the IT professional at the firm was extremely helpful to me and my colleagues. This person ensured that I was up to speed with how to use a BlackBerry, which was pretty clutch since I had no prior experience using this device. In addition, this person also ran the office lottery pool, which was an added service she contributed to our firm.

As I moved throughout my career, I encountered IT professionals at every firm at which I worked. One of the firms outsourced some of its IT work to a vendor and had professionals in the office to handle immediate concerns. Another one of the smaller firms I worked at had one dedicated IT professional that kept our firm’s servers running and answered any technical questions. Even my own practice right now, which comprises my partner/brother and me has an IT person we can call if something technical needs to be addressed.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
IT professionals deserve more respect since they often operate in stressful environments when things need to be addressed immediately. Usually, IT professionals operate in the background and passively ensure that the firm’s technology is running smoothly. However, when there is a software outage or another issue, IT professionals need to swoop in and try their best to save the day.

One time, I worked at a firm that had all of its time entries deleted for an entire month due to some glitch in the system. This was a huge issue since people would need to spend an incredible amount of time reconstructing their time entries if the IT people did not find this data. Our firm eventually had to reconstruct most of the time entries, but I had a lot of respect for the IT professionals who had to deal with angry lawyers struggling to understanding why their time entries had been deleted.

IT professionals also deserve more respect since they can make an attorney’s life much easier. Any time that an attorney needs to contend with a technology issue is time that cannot be spent on billing. When systems go down, attorneys cannot perform work, and the firm loses money. As a result, IT professionals are critical to the money-making drive of law firms since they help lawyers stay efficient and engaged in client work for as much time as possible.

Moreover, IT professionals can also help lawyers be more effective at their jobs. IT professionals can often empower lawyers to use technology to take less time to do chores that are not billable, or to have more ease and confidence when performing billable tasks for clients. For instance, I was once working at a law firm with a solid IT department, and one of the IT professionals walked by my office and saw me scrunched in my chair squinting at my computer screen. He suggested that I use a long and skinny computer screen for certain tasks, and he helped me set up this device. It might sound crazy, but that monitor was a game-changer for me and made it so much easier to review documents and make edits to papers. This is just one of the small ways how IT professionals can empower attorneys to do better work.

Despite all of the good work they do, attorneys do not always respect IT professionals or even treat them well. Whenever there is a technological outage, IT professionals oftentimes get the wrath of firm management, and sometimes, it might be deserved. However, lawyers should definitely realize that IT professionals have an important and difficult job within the legal profession. If IT professionals and attorneys work together, they can help ensure that firms are as profitable as possible and that lawyers can perform their best legal work for clients.

# Global Biglaw Firm Expands Recruiting Efforts With Technology
## Looking beyond the on-campus interview.

The on-campus recruiting game has always carried a bit of capriciousness to it. There are lotteries and scheduling conflicts and just the bad luck of hitting a distracted interviewer who just got a bad email about a deal. Law students can’t guarantee they’ll manage to get in front of the firm that really suits them and firms can’t guarantee they’re seeing the complete pool of ideal candidates.

The on-campus recruiting team from White & Case is introducing a new video interview platform this year called Launchpad with an eye toward casting a wider net in recruitment efforts by untethering the process from scheduled on-campus interviews from specific schools. And, of course, this frees up the student’s scheduling options too. This isn’t a replacement for the traditional in-person interview — if students are lucky enough to score one they can go for it — but it allows those who might not be able to meet in-person to get themselves in front of White & Case.

The way Launchpad works, a student records the interview at any time, from any device, which is then uploaded to the White & Case recruiting site. It mirrors a successful process the firm has employed in the UK for awhile now.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This doesn’t replace the full hiring process. Obviously there will still be callback interviews at the office and everything. But it’s a good way of getting a look at a broader pool of interviewees. And, importantly, it provides a measure of consistency that in-person interviews can’t always match because every candidate is responding to the same questions asked in the same way allowing reviewers to make apple to apple comparisons when deciding upon callbacks.

This isn’t the first technological fix White & Case has offered law students. Last year, we wrote about a tool the firm unveiled allowing students to [get a handle on Biglaw work assignments with InsideSherpa](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2019/06/17/technology-allows-law-school-students-to-work-on-a-deal-before-joining-biglaw/?rf=1). That platform offered students a virtual access to the day-to-day work of a young attorney.

Once again, White & Case is thinking outside the box when it comes to getting an advantage over its peer firms when it comes to winning the talent war.

I’m sure many of our readers have been transfixed by the coverage of the tragic [partial building collapse](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/miami-florida-building-collapse-07-01-21/index.html) in Surfside, Florida. While search and rescue teams are still at work following the events of last Thursday, as of this writing, 18 people have been confirmed dead and 147 are still missing.

With so many impacted by the events, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the legal community counts several among the missing. As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1399285) Law360, three attorneys — Nicole Langesfeld, 26, Edgar Gonzalez, 45, and Linda March, 58 — still have not been located.

[Langesfeld ](https://www.reedsmith.com/fr/professionals/l/langesfeld-nicole)is an associate at Biglaw firm Reed Smith. She was a summer associate at the firm and started full time in 2019. According to colleagues, she got married in January — her husband, Luis Sadovnic, is missing as well — and they only moved into the Champlain Towers South two months ago.

Partner Hugh Lumpkin describes Langesfeld:

“She was a delight to work with,” Lumpkin said. “Highly intelligent, high energy and a great personality and a great person.”

During the pandemic, he and Langesfeld had worked closely together on several business interruption suits seeking coverage for COVID-19 closures.

And Doug Cameron, Reed Smith’s managing partner for the Americas, noted the firm continues to hold out hope for a positive outcome, saying:

“Nicky is not only an amazing professional, she is a lovely, talented, compassionate, energetic person and a great friend to many of us,” Cameron said. “We are missing her presence every single day.”

Gonzalez is a partner in Hidalgo Law Firm, with a practice that focuses on real estate and construction litigation as well as commercial contract disputes. Partner Marlin Muller describes the tight bond at the firm:

“It wasn’t just business,” Muller said. “Can you imagine having a job where every day you’re hanging out with your best friends all day?”
….

“I know every firm says ‘we’re family,’ but we really were,” Muller said. “We had Thanksgivings together. I mean everything. I got a birthday present in the mail yesterday from Edgar.”

One of Gonzalez’s daughters was with him the night of the collapse, however, she and her mother were rescued.

March is a New York native and moved to Florida during the pandemic. And alum of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, she’s a former administrative law judge at the New York City Environmental Control Board. Her practice is built on representing building owners, tenants, contractors, architects, developers, and others before New York City agencies.

# A Challenge For The Gatekeepers

I have a message for the gatekeepers of the legal industry: change is coming—with or without you.

In my work, I deal frequently with librarians, research and knowledge professionals, and other law firm managers, but I am addressing this message to ANYONE who manages the relationships between a law firm and those who provide innovative services to attorneys. My recommendation is that you get on board and facilitate this change. If you don’t, the world is going to pass you by. I say this because I have seen it happen—to me.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I served as vice president of business and legal affairs for Monster.com, the job-search site, during its heyday at the turn of the century. Its share value crossed $90 while I was there in 2000. But as early as 2002, Monster’s leadership could see that the world was changing—Web 2.0 was on its way. We knew that in order to keep up, we would need to adapt. Specifically, we needed to seize the opportunity to make Monster a job-networking platform. We took steps in that direction, even hiring executive talent from successful network-based companies to build out our networking business.

But that business never became a reality. When the moment for change came, Monster flinched. The introduction of our networking platform would have been uncomfortable to the paying clients that posted open positions on our site. Our senior leadership balked at the idea of upsetting them, and let the networking opportunity go in favor of business as usual.

Monster recently sold itself for $429 million (about $8 billion less than it was worth at one time). LinkedIn, a job-networking platform, meanwhile, is being acquired by Microsoft for more than $26.2 billion.

All too frequently, the gatekeepers of the legal profession act like Monster of the early aughts. In my experience, they are smart people. They see that the world is changing, and, in fact, many of them want to be seen as innovators themselves. However, initiating something innovative takes chutzpah – the term in Yiddish used to describe the courage or ardor that an individual possesses.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As an enterprise provider, we are constantly being asked by our law firm clients to develop and demonstrate new tools, new technologies, and new products, especially in light of all the start-up activity in the legal industry. Not a week goes by without us being asked about a new idea, new company, or new technology that a client has read about – and how that can help lawyers and law firm staff. In fact, I attended a session at AALL where librarians were brainstorming how to be more relevant or get lawyers to pay more attention to them. But when the moment comes to actually introduce change at law firms, they flinch out of fear. Afraid that the attorneys they work for will find change uncomfortable, they balk—just as Monster’s executives balked at upsetting the site’s customers.

I see examples of this on a weekly basis. In the time that I have been drafting this column, I received an email about our new Bloomberg Law: Tax product, one we developed to meet the specific needs of tax lawyers and which we market tested. In the email, one of our representatives summarized a meeting with a national firm about the new product: “The librarians provided positive feedback,” but declined to demonstrate the product for their lawyers because “the tax group is slow to change and would not quickly adopt the ‘bells and whistles’ of the new platform.”

This column is not about our tax product. It is about a culture that pervades law firms in which gatekeepers tiptoe around the perceived sensibilities of lawyers, or accept at face value that the status quo is immutable, to the detriment of all.

On countless occasions, I have heard gatekeepers complain about the lack of respect given to them by lawyers, or the fact that they are not given a seat at the proverbial table. But the hard truth is that genuine innovators and agents of change within their firms do have all that status—and more. But when the opportunity to innovate is before most, all too often they defer to that old boogeyman: lawyers’ supposed resistance to change. I remember sitting in a conference room of my then-employer in the mid 1990s and having a technology committee member proclaim that he would never communicate with his clients via email!

The same was true with legal outsourcing. Someone at nearly every major law firm told me that outsourcing wouldn’t work, that his or her firm would never change.

Yet change came. Via email. Via smartphones. Via iPads. And outsourcing thrived, along with the myriad of other new resources and resource providers. Those changes benefitted the firms, the clients, and, of course, the people who championed change.

Ultimately, that gatekeeper deference—that fearful attitude—can be explained as a job-preservation strategy. If you push change too forcefully, and make people too uncomfortable, I suppose you might find your job in jeopardy. But acting in response to that fear is a mistake. In the first place, it’s overblown. Whatever truth there is in the myth that lawyers are set in their ways, it’s equally true that lawyers will respect those who challenge their thinking and attempt to modernize their businesses. Lawyers are constantly seeking innovation in their services models, and that change more often than not starts with foundational resources.

More to the point, there is no time to remain stagnant out of fear. The world moves much faster today than it did even in 2004, when I left Monster. If you keep innovation at bay in order to preserve your job, it won’t be long before there is no job left to preserve.

Change is coming whether we like it or not. Gatekeepers: be one of those who embraces it, champions it, and reaps the rewards from it. Because those who don’t are going to get left in the past.

# Financial Data: Here's How Lawyers Get Paid

Running a profitable law firm isn’t easy, even in the best of times. During tumultuous times, it’s even more challenging.

As we head into a possible COVID-19 surge and what many believe may be a recession, even seasoned lawyers may be wondering how to build resiliency into their firms that will provide protection from the many uncontrollable external factors that affect revenues. While it may seem like a pipe dream, rest assured that you can take steps to help your firm withstand the effects of volatility while also providing a foundation for long-term success.

Sound too good to be true? It’s not. There’s actually data that backs this claim up, and you’ll find it in a recently released report.

The Benchmark Report

A few months ago, financial benchmark data was obtained from the MyCase law practice management platform. The data was anonymized and then analyzed to understand how different legal professionals used the legal and billing features available to them. The goal was to ascertain which features have the most significant impact on the day-to-day activities and the financial viability of law firms.

The end result is [Part 2 of the 2022 MyCase Benchmark Report](https://www.mycase.com/guides/benchmark-report-how-lawyers-get-paid/). The final Benchmark Report will be a three-part series. In [Part 1](https://www.mycase.com/guides/benchmark-report-how-work-gets-done-in-law-firms/), which I wrote about [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/productivity-data-heres-how-lawyers-get-work-done/), we analyzed productivity data to determine how work gets done in firms and by whom. Part 2 is discussed in this post, and Part 3 will offer insights from the financial and lead generation data.

Part 2 of this report was released last month and is focused on financial data related to law firm revenues during the pandemic, collection rates, payment time frames, and practice area hourly rates by geographical region. This data, which I discuss below, provides actionable information that lawyers can use to set competitive rates, ensure higher collection rates, and increase revenues.

The Many Benefits Of Offering Payment Flexibility

From the data, we learned that one key way to increase law firm revenue is to offer clients increased payment flexibility. When you make it easier for clients to pay legal bills on their terms, they’re more likely to pay in a timely manner.

One approach is to accept more forms of payment by permitting clients to pay legal bills online using credit or debit cards. If your firm isn’t yet accepting online payments from clients, you’re in the minority according to the results of a survey recently conducted for the 2022 MyCase Legal Industry Report that will be released later this year. Over 2,300 lawyers were surveyed, and the results showed that the vast majority of law firms (84%) now accept online payments via credit cards and ACH payments from their clients.

Increase Collection Rates

When law firms accept online payments, legal bills are more likely to be paid in full. Data from the [2021 MyCase Legal Industry Report](https://www.mycase.com/guides/industry-report/) showed that more than half of the legal professionals surveyed (61%)  agreed that they collected more money by accepting online payments.

Survey results from Part 2 of the MyCase Benchmark Report support this finding. A comparison of data showed that the collection rates for the firms that accepted online payments were nearly 10% higher than the rate of those that didn’t.

Specifically, in 2021, lawyers who accepted online payments invoiced $3.5 billion and collected $1.8 billion, which resulted in a collection rate of 51%. In comparison, law firms that did not accept online payments invoiced $2.4 billion and collected $1 billion, a collection rate of only 42%.

Get Paid Faster

Data from that same report showed that when lawyers offer clients multiple ways to pay invoices, they receive payment significantly faster. How much faster? According to 2021 data, lawyers who accepted online payments received invoice payments 32% faster than law firms that did not.

The data indicated that law firms that accepted online payments from clients were paid within 25 days after an invoice was sent. Law firms that accepted only checks and cash received payment nearly two weeks later, 37 days after an invoice was sent.

Set Competitive Billing Rates

Another way to increase revenues is to ensure that your firm’s billing rates are competitive. That’s where the regional billing rate data from Part 2 of the Benchmark Report comes in. By reviewing the rates charged by other similarly situated lawyers in your region, you can better determine whether your firm is charging competitive fees, and if necessary, increase your rates.

With the rate data from this report, you can compare your law firm’s billable rates for different types of matters with anonymized data of other lawyers in your geographic region who handle similar cases. You can view the [hourly rates of lawyers in your area here](https://www.mycase.com/blog/general/average-lawyer-hourly-rate/).

Once you have a handle on what other lawyers in your area are charging for similar services, you may want to consider increasing your law firm’s rates, which will in turn increase your firm’s long-term profitability.

Managing a successful, profitable firm can be a challenge. The good news is that you’ve got hard and fast data available that you can use to take actionable steps to increase long-term stability and viability. By pricing your firm’s services appropriately and investing in technology that streamlines your firm’s billing and collection processes, you can rest easy knowing you’ve laid the groundwork for a resilient, revenue-generating business.

As companies continue to expand their reach around the world, lawyers advising them should stay attuned to developments in the evolving emerging markets. 

To help illuminate the latest issues — from the impact of political developments in Latin America to COVID challenges in Asia, from FCPA to ethics considerations — PLI is offering a one-day program, [Doing Business in and with Emerging Markets 2022](https://www.pli.edu/programs/doing-business-in-and-with-emerging-markets?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2). 

Featuring an expert panel of international dealmakers, the program will provide a comprehensive overview of the most critical legal and business issues that arise in international deal making both in and with emerging markets, including: 

- How to facilitate inbound investments from emerging markets, including negotiating with the emerging market investor, dealing with the most common impediments, and clearing regulatory hurdles
- An overview of recent developments in anti-corruption enforcement and compliance for investments in emerging markets
- Insight into general counsels’ perspectives on emerging markets
The program’s experienced, international faculty will draw on decades of combined experience to share with attorneys and other professionals in the field the best practices and most effective strategies they have learned and successfully employed. With an option to attend in-person or stream online, the program also offers attendees the opportunity to network with leading attorneys with global expertise in the area of emerging markets. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/doing-business-in-and-with-emerging-markets?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

# Biglaw Firm Sets Up Sexual Harassment Whistleblowers Hotline, Wants Lawyers Who Kiss To Tell HR
## This firm is very interested in its lawyers' and staff members' office couplings.

From overbilling obnoxious clients to romantic rendezvous with coworkers, everyone knows that there’s a little hanky-panky going on behind closed doors at Biglaw firms. With that in mind, one firm wants to know exactly what its employees are up to when it comes to their workplace relationships (never mind the overbilling).

Thanks to the rise of the #MeToo era in the legal profession, [RollOnFriday](http://www.rollonfriday.com/TheNews/EuropeNews/tabid/58/Id/5655/fromTab/36/currentIndex/5/Default.aspx) reports that Linklaters is now interested in its lawyers’ and staff members’ office couplings — not for the purpose of gossip, but to make sure that conflicts between people with unequal bargaining power don’t interfere with employee performance.

Under new guidance issued by the firm, staff are expected to tell HR or a department head about office romances so that they can be “properly managed in the interests of all of those involved in the relationship.” The global policy was not seeking to ban consensual relationships, said a spokeswoman, or about “prying into personal information.” Instead, it was “about acting as a responsible business by supporting our people.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In a related initiative following a former partner’s [conviction for sexual assault](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/former-linklaters-partner-gets-jail-time-for-sexually-assaulting-student-intern/), Linklaters has set up “SpeakUp,” an anonymous whistleblowing hotline that will allow employees to report inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature. According to the firm, all claims left on the “SpeakUp” line will be investigated thoroughly, and no one named in a complaint will be permitted to serve as an investigator.

Congratulations to Linklaters for instituting progressive programs like these to balance power for women in the workplace. Though we can’t imagine that many people will be willing to report their sexual relationships to HR, the “SpeakUp” whistleblowing hotline is a tool that could prove to be extremely useful.

# West Coast Biglaw Leader Hands Out Market Bonuses -- If You Bill Enough
## Failing to hit your hours threshold comes with a financial penalty.

At this point in the Biglaw bonus season, it’s the little things that make all the difference. Since bonus amounts are generally the same at Biglaw firms, we pay close attention to things like billable hour requirements, disbursement dates, or any other differences in how a firm is doing bonuses.

At Wilson Sonsini they’re giving out full market bonuses — inclusive of special bonuses. Back in the fall, WSGR was mum on the trend of[ handing out COVID appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/willkie-announces-fall-bonuses-blowing-off-cravath-followers/). (Those special bonuses range from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year, and are in addition to the year-end bonus numbers.) But in their year-end bonus announcements, they account for the special bonus money.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
There is, however, a catch. To get the full special bonuses associates have to bill 1,950 hours (the same hours requirement for the regular, year end bonuses). There are smaller bonuses available for those that fail to hit that billable target, which is something at least. We should also note that bonus-eligible hours can include up to 40 hours of pandemic-related emergency paid time off, which, given the state of the world seems like the least they can do.



Bonuses will be paid on January 29th. You can read the[ full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/wsgr-bonus/2/)

Remember, we depend on ATL tipsters when it comes to bonus news at other firms.

# All By Myself
## Is everyone lonely in Biglaw?

Ed. note: This post is by [Will Meyerhofer](http://www.aquietroom.com/), a former [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/sullivan-cromwell/) attorney [turned psychotherapist](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/02/biglaw-attorney-turned-psychotherapist-analyzes-the-legal-profession/). He holds degrees from Harvard, NYU Law, and The Hunter College School of Social Work, and he blogs at [The People’s Therapist](http://thepeoplestherapist.com/). His new book, [Still Way Worse Than Being A Dentist](http://amzn.to/2bfN82j), is available [on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2bfN82j), as are his previous books, [Bad Therapist: A Romance](http://amzn.to/2bfX54N), [Way Worse Than Being A Dentist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193760022X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=193760022X&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=3SNNCUMQINDUQ7MP), and [Life is a Brief Opportunity for Joy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936400782/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1936400782) (affiliate links).

Isolation is a popular topic with my lawyer clients. There are so many varieties of Biglaw loneliness I hardly know where to start explicating the phenomenon. One client summed up his particular variant:

They stuck me on a matter that had gotten lost in the shuffle — some rainmaker too busy bringing in business neglected it, so we lost a critical preliminary motion. After that, everyone knew the case was hopeless, and since I was low man on the totem pole, it became mine. Now everything that’s already gone wrong is officially my fault, and no one’s around to help — as in, if you ask for ideas, you hear crickets. I sit in my office, staring at documents, unable to motivate. A calendar on my wall at home has hundreds of tiny boxes I check off each day until November 12th, 2018. That’s when I pay off my last loan — my final day in law.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

To add to the festive ambience, this guy’s firm is in the midst of endless renovations, which they’re taking in stages, floor by floor. Some floors are left mostly renovated, others barely renovated, and the stragglers still untouched. My client was assigned to a half-renovated half-floor, nearly empty except for some staff attorneys who toil down the hall in an unrenovated former conference room.

It’s creepy. And according to firm gossip, theirs is one of those “sick buildings” where the ductwork is clogged with black mold or toxic dust or something insalubrious, especially on the as-yet-not-renovated floors. Those could be unfounded rumors. Or not. He hunches beneath fluorescent lights and stained acoustic ceiling panels, trying to breathe through his nose.

Law firms are lonely places by design, or at least Biglaw firms are, since they’re typically located on multiple floors of sterile glass towers. One partner client was assigned to her office renovation committee. The new philosophy, she says, encourages walls of glass, to bring light in and cheer the place up. So now, as a Biglaw attorney, you work in a fish bowl, with everyone looking in as you pretend to review something while surreptitiously playing Candy Crush, or merely ride out an anxiety attack. In a “modern” glass-walled law office, lawyers retreat to the bathroom if they need to cry.

A relatively recent factor contributing to Biglaw alienation derives from the fact that Biglaw firms aren’t really “firms” anymore — they’re closer to conglomerates or loose federations.

# You're Billing Fewer Hours Now Than You Did 10 Years Ago
## Billable hours are down.

Are lawyers getting lazier? Perhaps just more efficient? Less work to go around?

Whatever the reason, a recent[ report](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/2018-legal-market-report/) on the legal industry reveals the average attorney is billing 156 fewer hours than they were a decade ago. The loss law firms are taking on that decrease in productivity is calculated to be $74,100 per attorney.

The study from Thomson Reuters Legal Executive Institute and the Center for the Study of the Legal Profession (CSLP) at the Georgetown University Law Center contains many interesting insights about the status of the legal profession. As we’ve previously covered, the authors see it as a[ wake-up call for law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/new-warning-for-biglaw-firms-not-that-theyll-listen-anyway/) to break out of their stagnant ways. But also in the data is the drop in productivity across the industry.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As reported by [Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/lawyers-bill-fewer-hours-than-a-decade-ago-report/), study author James Jones puts the blame squarely on the heads of non-equity partners and counsel:

While associates and equity partners rank “reasonably well” in their level of productivity, “it really falters below that,” Jones said.

The lower performers would include non-equity partners and of counsel attorney, the report found. As a result, Jones said that when comparing hours billed in January 2007 to those billed in November 2017 (the latest figures available when the study was being written), he calculated that a typical firm attorney billed 156 fewer hours by the end of that ten-year period.

The calculation was based on a rate of $475 per hour, a figure that comes from averaging the rates of lawyers ranging from associates to equity partners, Jones said.

Overall, Jones concluded that based on those figures, a 300-lawyer firm “would be experiencing an annual loss currently of $22.2 million.”

It just goes to show that, while the per attorney decrease in hours billed may not seem like a lot, the cumulative impact on the firm is significant.

Maybe if firms stopped [stiffing counsel on bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/whats-going-on-with-counsel-bonuses/) they’d see a spike in their billable hours.

# Law Firm Billing Rates Reveal Ingrained Racial And Gender Disparities
## Billing equity is the first step to equity partnership.

For all the laudable efforts firms make in improving diversity and inclusion, the scoreboard still shows a massive deficit.

The relative dearth of diversity among equity partners — and the troubling trend of using the income partner moniker to [disguise attorneys as “partners” without affording them the actual benefits of the title](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/yup-nonequity-partnership-is-used-disproportionately-for-minorities/) — remain pernicious obstacles in law firm culture. And obstacles that compound upon themselves by limiting mentorship and support from up-and-coming candidates among the associate ranks. Firms by and large haven’t shown much capacity to address the issue and when a behemoth corporation tried to get at the problem from the client-side, [he was ousted within months](https://www.ajc.com/ajcjobs/with-top-lawyer-out-coke-reviewing-diversity-mandate-for-law-firms/M3ESQZ2FIZB7RI2GPDLIRYTV6Y/).

But the problem is actually much deeper than just who ends up in the corner suite.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Because law firms — mostly — aren’t trying to hamstring women and minority attorneys. They’re making “business decisions” that just keep working out to the detriment of these specific lawyers. Funny how that happens when firms and clients set those lawyers up to fail.

LexisNexis’ CounselLink held a webinar this morning looking at the trend lines in attorney billing rates over time. The conclusions weren’t promising.

Compiling data from more than 20,000 attorney profiles in CounselLink and invoices from January 2020 to September 2021, the study found that attorneys generally start off as first-years with comparable billing rates regardless of race or gender. But over the course of a career, the gap gets bigger and bigger in ways that shouldn’t surprise anyone monitoring the partnership gap.

By the 4th year, male and female attorneys are starting to see a little daylight when it comes to rates. It may not seem like much at that stage, but $20-$30 over the course of 2100 hours amounts to real money. And that gap continues to grow from there. As these attorneys move into partnership, the gap tightens at the lower end of rates with no noticeable difference among partners billing in the lower 50th percentile of rates, but as rates go up so does the gap with men billing around 10 percent more at the 75th percentile.

When it comes to racial disparities, the associate gap is even more stark:



A 23 percent gap for associates billing at the 90th percentile (which we read as a combo of seniority and Biglaw status). The partner gap is, again, slim at the lower levels but as much as 18 percent at the 50th percentile and even more at the 75th. The tightening at the 90th percentile is a testament to the rates that high-profile Black attorneys demand in Biglaw. But this may have less to do with enlightened law firms and more to do with the upward access available to Black attorneys in government service. For example, former federal cabinet members are, on balance, demanding higher rates than lawyers who never left the law firm silo.

The gap for Hispanic/Latinx attorneys is even more pronounced at both the associate and partner levels with a 32 percent differential at the 90th percentile among associates. Asian lawyers eke out advantages over White attorneys, though the gaps are much closer than those White folks are holding over other ethnicities.

Bringing us back to the fundamental problem: traditionally underrepresented groups aren’t going to get access to the upper levels of partnership when they aren’t putting receivables on the page. And they aren’t putting receivables on the page because they aren’t being billed out at top dollar. Which means that even if they become partners they’re not going to be billing at the upper end of rates. Meaning they’re unlikely to be in the decision-making positions where they can correct the associate billing disparity in their firms in the first place.

# Top Biglaw Firm Will Require 4 In-Office Work Days Each Week, Starting In 2024
## For Biglaw firms, four days spent working in the office is a trend that's slowly building momentum.

One week ago, we suggested that in the future, associates may need to brace themselves for [four days spent working from the office](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/associates-may-need-to-brace-themselves-for-4-days-spent-working-in-the-office-each-week/) again. Now, another leading Biglaw firm is making four in-office days a requirement for associates, following up on its May 2023 edict that [office attendance may impact their compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/simpson-thacher-bonus-attendance/).

Simpson Thacher & Barlett — a firm that brought in $2,150,365,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it in 15th place in the latest Am Law 100 — recently announced that all of its U.S.-based employees must work from the office at least four days a week, starting in January 2024. Simpson now joins several firms that require four days spent in the office each week, including [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/); [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/davis-polk-4-day-office/); [Weil](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/weil-gotshal-4-days-in-office/); [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/ropes-gray-4-day-office-policy); and [Vinson & Elkins](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/vinson-elkins-4-day-office/).

Sources previously told Above the Law that Simpson’s enforcement of its Tuesday through Thursday attendance policy had been lax. We’ve yet to hear from associates as to how their attendance impacted their [year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/simpson-raises-23/), which are scheduled to be paid at the end of the month.

Best of luck to associates at Simpson Thacher as they adjust to their new lives next year, which will be mostly spent at the office.

As soon as you find out about office attendance plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Stroock To Dissolve, Close Its Doors After Nearly 150 Years In Business

After months upon months of [failed merger talks](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-merger-effort-crumbles/), partners [leaving the firm in droves](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/partners-associates-staff-flee-biglaw-firm-after-merger-efforts-crumble/), a [round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/stroock-layoffs/), and [reduced hours and pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-reportedly-cut-pay-hours-as-it-struggled-to-find-merger-partner/) for senior staffers, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan is calling it quits. The firm plans to dissolve.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/31/stroock-planning-dissolution/) has the scoop:

In an email sent to the firm Monday evening and obtained by Law.com, firm co-chairs Jeff Keitelman and Alan Klinger said they anticipate the executive committee will soon implement an Oct. 24 vote of the partners authorizing the “committee to dissolve the firm at the appropriate time.”

“We plan to give you advance notice of that,” the email said.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Stroock has known of these plans to dissolve since last week on October 24. The firm’s co-chairs noted that their conversations with Hogan Lovells started in early September, and that a “large-scale lateral group acquisition, not a merger” was always on the table. Was this one of the “options” — a future dissolution rather than a merger — that led Stroock to [step away from its talks with Pillsbury](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/yet-another-firm-ends-merger-talks-with-stroock/)?

In their email, Keitelman and Klinger said they were “excited” that so many Stroock lawyers are [headed to Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/the-end-may-be-near-as-stroock-loses-more-than-half-its-partners-to-hogan-lovells/). “We are confident that this move will offer the best opportunities and growth potential for the most members of our firm,” they wrote.

We know that Stroock’s remaining partners are likely to do just fine, but what about its associates and staffers? We certainly hope that they will be able to move on to other firms without too much trouble. Stay tuned for coverage on what the anatomy of Stroock’s dissolution may look like.

# Biglaw Associate Is Advocating For Therapeutic Use Of Psychedelics -- And The Firm Is Backing Him Up

Winston & Strawn associate Brett Waters has a lot more than just Biglaw on his plate these days. The antitrust associate has launched a nonprofit — Reason for Hope — to advocate for the legalization of psychedelic-assisted therapy in the United States.

The advocacy is personal for Waters — he lost both his grandfather and mother to suicide. Since those experiences, he began working with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and he learned about research suggesting psychedelic-assisted therapy can make a difference for folks experiencing trauma-related suicidal ideation and treatment-resistant depression. Waters [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/10/26/psychedelics/) these treatments can “facilitate real meaningful healing and the sort of healing that traditional therapy struggles to provide. I believe there’s a huge potential for effectiveness for people who feel isolated and a lack of connectivity.”

And it’s something he wishes were available for his mother:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“If I had made this connection sooner, there’s no doubt I’d have taken my mom out of the country or found of a way of doing it legally. I didn’t make that connection early enough; now I have a pretty serious level of regret,” he said. “Until I get this done, get this changed and get everyone access, I’m going to continue to punish myself.”

But those treatments are not available in this country, hence the need for the Reason for Hope’s legal advocacy. But before Waters began the work, he ran it by Winston & Strawn, in was he characterizes as “one of the more nerve-wracking emails,” but the firm was happy to support him:

“Winston & Strawn has a long and proud history of supporting public interest endeavors both on a firmwide basis and by encouraging our attorneys to pursue individual matters,” a spokeswoman for the firm said. “We support Mr. Waters’ efforts to promote research aimed at helping veterans and others suffering from mental health challenges.”

Seems like Winston & Strawn is stepping up to support the mental health efforts of its attorneys.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The last three years has taught firms some pretty hard lessons in regard to how to go about building up the associate ranks. They grew at an exponential rate in 2021 and, as work went down, they no longer needed the number of attorneys that they had.

If you look at all of the factors at play—that corporate work is down, compensation increased—all of these things together just results in lateral hiring just being very conservative.

— Summer Eberhard, a California-based legal recruiter at Lateral Link, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firm-hiring-plummets-35-amid-layoffs-slow-corporate-demand) on new report by the National Association for Law Placement, which concluded that lateral hiring had fallen by 35% over the course of 2023, with associate hiring nosediving by 43%, while partner hiring dropped by 10%.

Roberta Kaplan

Big news in Biglaw: [Roberta A. Kaplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_A._Kaplan) — the legendary litigator whose history-making Supreme Court win in United States v. Windsor toppled the Defense of Marriage Act, helped bring about nationwide marriage equality, and rocketed her to fame (and Above the Law [Lawyer of the Year honors](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/above-the-laws-2013-lawyer-of-the-year-competition-the-winner/)) — has left the storied partnership of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. Kaplan and three other high-powered lawyers have launched what should soon become one of the nation’s leading litigation boutiques, [Kaplan & Company LLP](https://www.kaplanandcompany.com/). (Christine Simmons of the American Lawyer [broke the news](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202792487159/Roberta-Kaplan-Champion-of-DOMA-Fight-Leaves-Paul-Weiss-to-Start-New-Firm) over the weekend, and Stephanie Russell-Kraft had a [Big Law Business story](https://bol.bna.com/roberta-kaplan-leaves-paul-weiss-to-launch-her-own-firm/) on it earlier today.)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Robbie Kaplan’s new firm consists of four lawyers at the current time: partner [Julie Fink](https://www.kaplanandcompany.com/our-talent/julie-e-fink), who worked with Kaplan at Paul, Weiss and rejoins her now after working in-house at Pfizer; senior counsel [John Quinn](https://www.kaplanandcompany.com/our-talent/john-quinn), coming from Sullivan & Cromwell; and associate Rachel Tuchman, who just graduated from Yale Law School.

But Kaplan & Company will soon have more company. Kaplan said she expects to have a dozen or more lawyers onboard by the fall. The firm will be based out of offices just a short walk south from Paul, Weiss, in the Empire State Building (featured prominently in cool artwork on the new firm’s [website](https://www.kaplanandcompany.com/)).

I spoke yesterday by phone with Kaplan, Quinn, and Tuchman (whom I’ve all had the pleasure of meeting before). The trio overflowed with enthusiasm for their new venture — especially impressive coming from Quinn and Tuchman, who were spending a beautiful Sunday afternoon in July not at the beach, but with their Biglaw-alumna boss.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
John Quinn, who joins Kaplan & Company after six years at Sullivan & Cromwell (meaning he’s no stranger to working on weekends), said he had a great experience at S&C — taking depositions as a second-year, working on big-ticket antitrust and securities cases — but that the chance to work with Robbie Kaplan, “a personal hero,” was “a dream opportunity.” He discussed the move with mentors at S&C and his alma mater, Harvard Law School; detecting his excitement, they all urged him forward.

“Everything here feels like it’s moving in a great direction, in terms of both clients and recruits,” Quinn told me. “We’re confident this is going to be an incredible thing.”


Rachel Tuchman

Rachel Tuchman might be the least experienced member of the team — she worked with Robbie Kaplan as a summer associate at Paul, Weiss last year, then graduated from Yale Law earlier this year — but her zeal for the new venture matched that of Kaplan’s and Quinn’s. Tuchman has already had the chance to work on a headline-making case, helping Kaplan and Paul, Weiss lawyers prepare the [petition for rehearing en banc](http://www.southernequality.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/CSE-v.-Bryant-En-Banc-brief.pdf) in Campaign for Southern Equality v. Bryant, the challenge to the Mississippi “religious freedom” law that some regard as the [most extreme anti-LGBT law in the nation](http://www.southernequality.org/mississippi-update-appeal-full-5th-circuit-hb-1523-challenge/). Tuchman’s name on the brief of course bears the obligatory asterisk, noting that she’s not yet admitted to the bar and working under the supervision of counsel.

Tuchman graduated from YLS this year, and we’re now well into July, so of course I had to ask: are you taking the bar exam? And are you worried about the test given how hard you’re already working on cases like Campaign for Southern Equality?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“I’m feeling good — my bar prep has been a team effort,” Tuchman said. “John and Robbie have been quizzing me about Property and Evidence. I’m hopeful that I can pass the bar after having Evidence explained to me by Robbie Kaplan!”

And of course I spoke to Roberta Kaplan herself. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

DL: Congratulations on your new firm! But some might wonder: you had what many would regard as a legal dream job, partnership at Paul, Weiss, which came with power, prestige, and gigantic [profits](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/2/) per [partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-peek-inside-paul-weiss-10-secrets-to-biglaw-success/). And you also got to work on great pro bono cases like Windsor, with the full support and huge resources of PW. So why are you making this move?

RK: I will cherish my time at Paul, Weiss as long as I live, and I revere my mentors there. What I learned at the firm made me the lawyer I am today and helped me to get to where I am now.

[Ed. note: And the warm feelings seem to be mutual. As Brad Karp, chairman of Paul, Weiss, told the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202792487159/Roberta-Kaplan-Champion-of-DOMA-Fight-Leaves-Paul-Weiss-to-Start-New-Firm?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), “Robbie will always be a part of the Paul Weiss family. We are proud of her accomplishments.”]

I’m now 50. I spent the first 25 years of my life outside of Paul, Weiss, and then the next 25 years of my life at Paul, Weiss. So I had to ask myself: what do I want to do for the next 25 years?

Was this turning point like my “midlife crisis”? Maybe — but instead of having an affair or buying a fancy car, I started my own law firm.

DL: Paul, Weiss is, of course, one of the world’s greatest law firms. What are you hoping to achieve at Kaplan & Company that might be different from what you were doing at PW?

RK: I had been sensing over the past several years that the kind of litigation I focus on — business-to-business, commercial litigation, incredibly fun work that gets you into court a lot — was becoming increasingly hard for the big firms to handle. It’s not a Paul, Weiss issue, but an issue facing large firms more generally.

Paul, Weiss still works on, and is a leader in, bet-the-company cases — and I hope to handle such cases myself at my new firm. But there are a lot of cases that, while not “bet the company,” are incredibly important — and at current Biglaw rate structures, making some of these cases work economically is just impossible.

So I started thinking that it would be nice to have a practice where I could have more flexibility on billing rates and fee arrangements. It would be nice to have a rate structure where I could get back into that game — and back into court, which is a great way for associates to learn how to litigate, and how I learned to litigate at Paul, Weiss.

I worked on a number of such cases at Paul, Weiss. Many of those cases and clients are moving with me, or will be represented jointly by Kaplan & Company and Paul, Weiss, going forward.

DL: There are many virtues to boutique practice, such as the flexibility with fees that you mention. But Biglaw does have its advantages, including tremendous resources and staff. Take giant, document-intensive cases that are the bread and butter of many large law firms. Do you expect to do many of those?

RK: One of my pending cases at Paul, Weiss falls into that category, and I will not be working on that case. At least right now, those types of cases — the ones with gazillions of gigabytes of data, and dozens of staff attorneys — are not the ones we are looking to do. There are firms that can do that work much better. We’re looking for cases where lawyers can get into court.

Q: How would you describe the culture and structure of Kaplan & Company?

RK: As explained on our [website](https://www.kaplanandcompany.com/about-us), I like to think of us as a “new-fashioned” and “old-fashioned” firm. We’ll reflect the values that I grew up with at Paul, Weiss of collaboration, teamwork, and giving everyone a voice. We will deliver the highest quality of representation to our clients. We will be extremely efficient, innovative, and lean, not unnecessarily drawing out litigation or overstaffing cases.

We will have a major public interest and pro bono component. Our goal, as stated on our site, is “to fuse together a private commercial practice with a public interest practice for the mutual benefit of both.” I have always treated pro bono clients just like all my other clients, and that will continue. Pro bono work makes you better as both a lawyer and a person.

We expect people to work hard — but on the other hand, one thing that has been lost somewhat in firms is quality of life. I want our lawyers to be able to balance their firm work with personal life and family life, as well as with professional life outside the firm, such as bar association and pro bono work.

Finally, I can’t change the fact that I am a woman with many great women as colleagues. We will be, aside from a few prominent exceptions — such as Beth and Alex’s shop [[Wilkinson Walsh + Eskovitz](http://wilkinsonwalsh.com/), the elite boutique launched by Beth Wilkinson and Alexandra Walsh, two other star women litigators from Paul, Weiss] — one of a small number of women-run top law firms.

[Ed. note: Like good colleagues keeping a senior colleague on her toes, John Quinn and Rachel Tuchman reminded Kaplan that, well, she could change the fact that she’s a woman — which of course she realizes, as a crusader for transgender as well as gay and lesbian rights. But as a cisgender woman, Kaplan is not inclined to change the fact that she’s a woman.]

DL: I know you’ll be very busy over the next few months, launching the firm and working on the many cases and clients that have moved with you. But as someone who loved your memoir, [Then Comes Marriage](http://amzn.to/1kHR552) (affiliate link), I have to ask: are you working on a second book?

RK: No [laughing], God forbid! That was so difficult to write.

DL: I can see why — it was a deeply personal book, covering some painful periods in your life. But your next book could be very different. Maybe a novel? Or a book of career advice for young, diverse lawyers?

RK: First let’s wait to see if they make a movie out of Then Comes Marriage. I’m happy to report that there has been some interest.

DL: Excellent! It would be a great movie, as an inspiring story of both personal and professional triumph, against long odds. Who would you want to be played by?

RK: Hmmm…. I’ll have to think about that. But I will say that Mary McCormack did a great job portraying me in [When We Rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_We_Rise) [the ABC miniseries about LGBT rights created by Dustin Lance Black, the Oscar-winning writer of Milk].

DL: Final question. There are a lot of young lawyers who have gotten involved in pro bono work and political activism in the past few months — for example, the Biglaw associates who [went to the airports to aid immigrants](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/the-day-the-lawyer-jokes-died/?rf=1) affected by the travel ban. But, as readers of Above the Law well know, there are also a lot of young, debt-saddled, unemployed or underemployed law school graduates out there.

Say a young progressive came to you and said, “Robbie, I admire your career, and I want to do what you do. I want to go to law school to fight on behalf of social justice.” What would you say to this person?

RK: Absolutely! Absolutely go to law school. One thing we have seen under the current administration is how the courts and the Constitution have endured.

Judges might disagree over results in particular cases, such as the travel ban litigation. But there has been no disagreement about the respect that must be paid to the courts and to the constitutional values of our system.

DL: Values that you have been standing up for, and vindicating, for the past quarter century. Congratulations on the launch of Kaplan & Company, and good luck in the years ahead!

White & Case is facing a discrimination lawsuit filed by a former senior legal assistant. In the lawsuit, filed Thursday in Manhattan state court, Hannah Kim alleges violations of New York City Human Rights Law for pregnancy, gender, and disability discrimination, hostile work environment, failure to accommodate, retaliation, and constructive discharge. She also seeks unpaid wages pursuant to New York labor law.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/06/19/ex-legal-assistant-levies-bias-harassment-claims-against-white-case/) Law.com, Kim alleges a pattern of harassment that began before she went on parental leave in 2016:

“Plaintiff was subject to severe harassment by the individual defendants as a result of her need to express milk while at the office,” Kim said in the complaint. “This harassment was continuous and ongoing until Plaintiff stopped expressing milk for her child at work in approximately the fall of 2018.”

Rita Masino, one of Kim’s managers and a named defendant in the lawsuit, allegedly made repeated comments about breastfeeding, including that the plaintiff’s son was a “grown-ass boy,” that breastfeeding was “hink,” and that “formula was invented for a reason.” The complaint also alleges Masino made comments about Kim’s breasts and nursing bras.

According to the complaint, Kim was also prevented from using the firm’s lactation room. Plaintiff further alleges that when she latched her own door for privacy while pumping Carol Grajeda, another supervisor and named plaintiff, repeatedly tried to open the door while she was mid-pumping. Additionally, Kim alleges Masino interrupted her by telephone for seemingly minor issues.

The complaint alleges both supervisors repeatedly told Kim she should “keep her legs closed” to prevent additional pregnancies. Kim also alleges Masino told her she “better not be planning on getting pregnant anytime soon,” because Grajeda would “not put up with that shit.”

The plaintiff also says Grajeda and Masino harassed her following a car accident when she sought a part time work schedule to accommodate her recovery.

Kim says she voluntarily left the firm in February of this year after she was denied a bonus for 2019 and her year-end review was repeatedly put off, which she says are signs she was going to be fired. She also alleges she has not received her last paycheck and unused vacation days.

White & Case has not commented on the lawsuit.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Cleary Gottlieb
## A new managing partner, new partners and counsel, and a new bonus memo (on a familiar scale).

What’s new at Cleary Gottlieb? Several things. A new [managing partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/morning-docket-09-14-16/) (Michael Gerstenzang, who takes over from Mark Leddy on January 1). New [partners and special counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cleary-gottliebs-new-partner-class-where-are-the-women/) (also effective January 1). And a new bonus memo, as of this morning.

The scale is not exactly new; it’s the one [announced yesterday by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/), and used by much of Biglaw in 2015 and 2014 as well. “No surprises,” said one of our sources. “As expected,” said another.

But people are not complaining. When combined with the raise news from the summer, total compensation is up.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“People seem pleased,” one tipster told us. “Nobody expected a bump after the salary raise, and I think we’re all just happy firms aren’t using the raise as a reason to cut back on bonuses.”

So far, at least. But of course top-tier firms like [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-matches/), [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-matches/), [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/simpson-thacher-announces-bonuses/), [Debevoise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-its-raining-cold-hard-cash-at-debevoise/), and Cleary would match Cravath. It will be interesting to see how deep into the Am Law and Vault 100 this bonus scale will go.

Please help us track that. When your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

# Am Law 100 Firm Extends Its Successful Remote Work Policy Until 2021
## Which firm will be the next to keep employees out of the office until the new year?

It was just yesterday that Reed Smith announced that in light of the pandemic, its employees would be [working remotely until at least January 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/am-law-50-firm-extends-mandatory-work-from-home-policy-though-january-2021/). At the time, noting that Reed Smith was the first firm we knew of to announce it would remain remote for the rest of 2020, we wondered whether policies like this would become a trend among Biglaw firms.

As it turns out, another Am Law firm had already quietly announced a similar policy.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Schulte Roth & Zabel — which brought in $465,177,000 in gross revenue in 2019, putting in in 84th place in the Am Law 100 rankings — informed its employees on August 19 that the firm would be maintaining its remote work policy until at least January 1, 2021. Here’s an excerpt from the memo (available in full on the next page):

SRZ transitioned remarkably well to working remotely and we as a Firm are working effectively together to serve our clients and grow our business. However, as the pandemic continues the challenges continue. Many of our people are facing significant logistical issues. Parents with school-age children are navigating new schedules along with uncertainty as to how the coming weeks and months will unfold. People with elderly parents or other relatives needing care are facing new challenges created by Covid. Housing is presenting challenges for other people.

We have taken these circumstances into consideration, as well as the concerns of many people about their personal and family health circumstances. We have also consulted with our medical expert and our internal task forces. Based on all of this, the Executive Committee has decided that no one at the Firm will be expected to be in the office until January 1, 2021 at the earliest.

If you recall, Schulte Roth is a firm whose leadership made assurances there were no plans for furloughs or layoffs, and stayed true to that commitment to employees. We do not believe that SRZ made any salary cuts during the height of the coronavirus crisis. Associates describe the firm as having been “very supportive during a difficult time,” and this announcement — taking family and housing matters into account — furthers that sentiment even more. Kudos to the firm for its kindness.

Will your law firm follow in Schulte Roth’s footsteps? Please get in touch with us via email or text — [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or (646) 820-8477) — and let us know.

An ex-Biglaw paralegal was indicted in 2022 for stealing more than $600,000 from the Am Law 200 firm where she worked, and earlier this week, she was sentenced for her six-figure financial heist.

Becky Louise Sutton, formerly of Saul Ewing’s Chicago office, was accused of transferring bankruptcy estate funds meant for creditors to her own accounts. She did this from 2009 to 2018, taking a total of $682,980. According to the indictment, Sutton used the money to pay credit card bills, mortgage bills, and student loan bills, also setting some cash aside in her personal bank account and a PayPal account.

After reversing her original not-guilty plea, Sutton pleaded guilty in late 2023 to one count of wire fraud. On Tuesday, she was sentenced to two years in prison. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/ex-paralegal-gets-2-years-prison-embezzling-law-firm-funds-2024-04-02/) has additional details:

U.S. District Judge Mary Rowland in Chicago also ordered Becky Louise Sutton, 67, to pay $611,263 in restitution. A spokesperson for the Chicago U.S. Attorney’s Office confirmed the sentence but did not comment further.

Gal Pissetzky, a Chicago lawyer who represented Sutton, said his client “apologized for her actions and is very sorry for all the damage and suffering she caused. She also wants to thank the court for a very fair sentence.”

Earlier in the investigation, a Saul Ewing spokesperson said that the firm had “cooperated with law enforcement and ensured that any impacted client did not suffer any losses.”

Sutton was originally charged with three counts of wire fraud and three counts of embezzlement, for which she faced up to 75 years in prison.

## Did your law firm make the cut this time around?

Last week, Vault released the [2022 edition](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2022/) of its closely watched law firm rankings, proving that money — in the form of Cravath’s perennially competitive pay scale — can buy prestige.

But can that money buy happiness?

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to their overall quality of life, including satisfaction; firm culture; hours; compensation; quality of work; business outlook; career outlook; associate/partner relations; transparency; formal and informal training; pro bono; and overall diversity. Fifty firms were ranked for Vault’s 2022 Best Law Firms to Work For survey, which was conducted from March 2021 through May 2021, so we’re getting a bird’s eye view of “post-pandemic” life at these firms. Once again, and this may be surprising for some, but none of the firms that made the Top 10 list for being the most prestigious made the Top 10 list for being the best firms to work for.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Best Law Firms to Work For](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-to-work-for) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2022:

- McDermott Will & Emery
- O’Melveny & Myers
- Clifford Chance US
- Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe
- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
- Ropes & Gray
- BakerHostetler
- Proskauer Rose
- Paul Hastings
- Dechert
We’ll say it again: none of the firms that listed here made it into the Top 10 of the Vault prestige ranking. Can you name 10 firms that have been overworking their associates? We can!

This time around, McDermott stole O’Melveny’s chance for a history-making threepeat as the first firm to ever earn the No. 1 spot in the overall ranking for each major category (Overall Best Law Firm to Work For, Overall Diversity, and Overall Best Summer Associate Program) for three years in a row. The firm will just have to settle for a two-year run, because McDermott took each of those titles this year. That said, here are the No. 1 and No. 2 firms in each Quality of Life category (and you’ll soon see why we’re including second-place finishers as well):

This is the first time that McDermott has taken the No. 1 spot. “This past year was a difficult one for everyone in the legal industry, but it appears that McDermott responded in all the right ways,” said Mary Kate Sheridan, Vault’s senior law editor. “Associates rave about the firm’s culture and say the firm continued to foster connections virtually throughout the pandemic. They also feel the firm is supportive of associate wellness, offering—among other perk —25 hours of billable credit for mindfulness, and believe the firm is invested in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Clearly, the firm’s efforts have bolstered associate satisfaction.”

Congratulations to each of the Biglaw firms that made the latest edition of the Vault Best Firms to Work For rankings, and a huge congratulations to McDermott for completely sweeping the rankings.

For those that forgot this story, about a year ago, Teresa Burchfield, then the wife of King & Spalding’s [Bobby Burchfield](https://www.kslaw.com/people/Bobby-Burchfield), was pinched — by the cops I mean but… whatever — in the back seat of her Maserati with a guy from the county lockup. According to court documents from the inmate, 23-year-old Garrett Portela, Madame Burchfield would bring him cigarettes and then she’d bang him in the back of the car. A bold feat, because Maseratis aren’t known for roominess.

Yesterday, she [pleaded no contest](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Wife-of-Trump-Lawyer-Fined-After-Jailhouse-Rendezvous-491838441.html) and will pay a $2500 fine.

Her now-ex-husband Bobby Burchfield — hard to say how these two drifted apart — is a known quantity in right-wing legal circles, having served as counsel to George W. Bush in the Florida recount debacle and was appointed independent ethics advisor to Trump’s trust. In the latter role, he was charged with making sure Trump isn’t profiting off his office so… he’s doing a bang up job.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In a world where the White House is [treating the American flag as a yo-yo](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/27/politics/white-house-flag-john-mccain-tribute/index.html) to satisfy Trump’s petty beef with the man who spent years getting tortured while the president pretended his feet hurt, a story about a Trump entity lawyer’s bizarre domestic situation may not register. Yet, it’s the metaphor that defines life in these United States in the Year of Our Trump 2018.

It begins with a prominent conservative professional. The definition of the elite, the establishment, the Swamp, if you will. It begins with this guy mortgaging his reputation to provide a fig leaf of ethical cover to what almost everyone — on both sides — recognizes as a dubiously legal side hustle only to sit by and watch as the partner he’s trusted cavorts with known criminals in the car that his efforts probably bought. And when it’s all said and done, the straying spouse pleads out of all the crimes and walks away with a fine that amounts to pocket change and the inmate who thought they would get something out of this deal returns to jail with nothing but a couple cigarettes and cougar scratches.

When this chapter of American history draws to a close, this is where the GOP will find itself. Staring at an empty house and broken reputations while Trump skips into the sunset having trashed the office they gifted him and the MAGA hats will go right back to living hardscrabble lives and wondering why they never got anything out of this deal but 5 or 6 fleeting moments of excitement as they served as blowup dolls for the old rich people on the other end.

The storybook of our nation isn’t always best written in the halls of power. Sometimes it’s laid out in the backseat of a sports car.

But, [as reported by ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/paul-weiss-houston-launch-stalled-as-top-rival-partners-stay-put)Bloomberg Law, that has not gone the way partner Scott Barshay hoped. The firm is looking to H-town for its private equity and oil and gas proximity — something that only really works with partners to populate the office.

And that’s where Paul Weiss has struck out.

Partners at firms including Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, Sidley Austin and Baker Botts ended talks about joining the [Paul Weiss] office, five people familiar with the matter said. Some turned down guarantees of $10 million to $15 million for multiple years.

The partners were comfortable at their current firms, which have established presences in the Houston market, said three of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss the private talks.

But that doesn’t mean Paul Weiss is giving up! Remember the firm recently adopted a[ black box partner compensation system](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/paul-weiss-goes-dark-on-compensation/) to lure lateral partners. So, yes, Houston is an increasingly popular location for Biglaw, with lots of firms looking to make their mark in the city, and Paul Weiss is committed to the idea of a Houston office, so it’s really only a matter of time.

# Salary Movement Trickles Down To Midwest Mainstay
## Raises coming to a bunch of offices across the middle of the country.

Over the last few weeks, many firms from the middle of the country decided to role-play as a drunk insurance adjuster from Omaha making it rain at the Vegas strip club with money he almost assuredly can’t afford. The frenzy became so intense, it’s not even controversial to say that the Dallas and Houston markets are officially set at $180K now by the sheer inertia of it all.

But what we’d actually expected to see out of these firms that are not actually Cravath dopplegängers is upward movement to reflect the changing market, but coming in respectably below the Cravath scale. There’s no shame in a firm recognizing that it isn’t doing Cravath business, as long as it also realizes that market movement at the top requires adjustments all the way down the line.

Husch Blackwell, an Am Law 200 firm with [PPP just north of $600K](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202751696999/The-Am-Law-100-Husch-Blackwell-Revenue-Head-Count-Decline?slreturn=20160626100558), has joined this more sober group of attendees at Cravath’s proverbial bachelor party.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Husch Blackwell’s offices in Austin, Chicago, Dallas, and D.C. moved to $160K (UPDATE: Chicago was already at $160K, so they didn’t get anything new), bringing them to what was the old New York normal. Denver is at $135K. The firm’s headquarters in Kansas City, along with St. Louis and Phoenix, move to $130K, while the firm’s offices in Wisconsin (Madison, Milwaukee, and [crucial Waukesha County](http://www.businessinsider.com/political-reporter-twitter-jokes-2013-7)) move to $120K.

# Associates Should Not Be Responsible For Business Development
## Associates who sign new clients should be rewarded with origination bonuses.

Most attorneys understand how the division of labor typically works in the legal industry. Partners are responsible for developing business, and associates are responsible for doing a majority of the work brought into a firm. Many firms have lower billable hour requirements for partners and allow partners to spend a substantial amount of money on business development so that they can fulfill their business-development function. However, some law firms hold associates responsible for business development on top of billable hour requirements, pro bono expectations, and other job responsibilities. Although it is fine for associates to work on pitch letters and contribute to marketing efforts, it is unfair in many instances for associates to be responsible for originating business.

Sometimes, partners push the responsibility of developing business onto associates in order to cover up for shortcomings of the partners. [Before I started my own practice](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com), I worked at a firm that was going through tough financial times. Many of the partners and associates in my office had worked on a number of related matters for years, and the work dried up almost immediately due to settlements. Since the partners had dedicated themselves to that one line of work for an extended period, their in-house contacts had grown stale, and the partners had difficulty finding work to keep people busy at the firm. As a result of that huge work shortage, attorneys who were once busy had little to do and were under constant threat of being axed.

While that firm struggled financially, the partners held a meeting with all of the associates about business development. Several of the partners said that each attorney had the potential to develop business, and the firm could no longer rely solely on the work generated by a few senior partners. As a result, management of the firm said that they would hold each associate responsible for developing business, and the firm had a number of follow-up meetings so that every associate could be trained and guided about business development.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It was fine for the partners to provide business development support to associates, but it was unfair for the partners to hold associates responsible for developing business. Many associates could not help but think that partners were deflecting blame for the financial state of the firm onto associates, who were victims to the partners’ inability to generate business.

The partners should have turned their attention inward and devoted their resources and energies to improving their own business development acumen. Not only was it unfair to burden associates, but partners are more capable at developing business than associates due to their experience and contacts in the legal industry. To think that a bunch of associates in their 20s and early 30s would be able to have enough in-house contacts and other connections to originate a significant amount of business at that firm was somewhat ridiculous.

At other points in my career, I worked at firms that decided to hold associates responsible for business development for other, mostly selfish, reasons. As mentioned in a few prior articles, I worked at a few shops that did not provide origination bonuses to associates who brought clients into the firm. Although it might make sense for Biglaw firms to forgo origination bonuses (since they pay associates enough as it is!) most other firms should have such bonuses out of fairness and to incentivize associates to develop professionally.

Firms where I worked that did not have origination bonuses justified that decision by expecting associates to originate business as part of their normal job responsibilities. Those firms said that originating business may factor into discretionary bonuses at the end of the year, but since signing clients is a normal responsibility of associates, there would be no extra bonus.

Such an understanding is extremely flawed, and developing business should not be an ordinary job responsibility of associates. Partners are given more leeway with billing and more resources so that they can develop business. Expecting associates to bill an insane amount of hours and to fulfill other firm obligations — while simultaneously hustling for more business — is very unfair. As a result, associates who sign new clients should be rewarded with origination bonuses.

In the end, associates at many firms are under enormous pressure, since they are forced to bill an ever-increasing number of hours and meet other employer expectations. Partners are best situated to develop business, and associates should simply be tasked with doing the work that partners originate. If firms want to pay associates a bonus for originating business or consider rainmakers for partnership, that’s fine. However, signing clients should not be a normal job responsibility of associates at most firms.

# Firm Finally Announces Raises... Some Offices Miss The Cravath Scale
## After a long delay, raises are coming, but not quickly and not in the amounts some may expect.

‘Can I have this?’
‘No, not just yet…’

UPDATE (6/28/2016 10:27 a.m.): Some offices may really have missed the cut… despite incredibly detailed raise info from tipsters in other offices, a tipster from another major office just said they’ve heard nothing. Perhaps the firm that employs [a well-oiled machine](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/bakerhostetler-hires-a-i-lawyer-ushers-in-the-legal-apocalypse/) isn’t a well-oiled machine.

Last week, we received some [pointed complaints](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/angry-associates-ask-wheres-my-money/) from associates at BakerHostetler. To recap, one tipster suggested that BakerHostetler was so tight with its money that it may pretend not to know there are raises even happening.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Apparently that specific fear was unfounded — at least for associates in the major offices — because the firm just announced that it would be raising salaries for young associates to the $180K scale in Houston, New York, Washington, and Los Angeles. For associates in any of its nine other domestic offices, the firm will be boosting salaries to $150K.

But those tipsters complaining about BakerHostetler’s miserly nature may well have been on to something. From our understanding, the firm has specifically not offered raises to the summer associates, making them the first firm to skimp on recruits in awhile. The firm also maintains lockstep compensation only for the youngest associates. More senior associates will have a new scale dependent on profitability, with higher-producing associates likely receiving the full Cravath scale match, while others receive smaller salaries. On the one hand, senior associates can see this as a swipe. On the other, senior associates who desire flexibility can take advantage of managing their time as they see fit with the understanding that they’re not taking from the firm if they choose not to bill 2,100+ hours that year. But in either event, it’s money the firm is saving on associate compensation.

We also don’t quite know when the raises will take effect. Given that the firm isn’t raising summer associate salaries, it’s a good bet the firm has no intention of meeting the July 1 target set by most matching firms. When it comes to timing, one tipster wrote:

The firm is having another meeting in July to determine the details on the pay raise, which will go in effect before the end of the year. We have been told that more details will follow.

# Plowing Through Associates, And Proud Of It
## ""Human resources"" is a very different concept at law firms and corporations, as in-house columnist Mark Herrmann explains.

I spend my life rooting around for material for this silly column. (See? I do it all for you.)

So, over lunch last month with several partners at a big international firm, I mentioned that “human resources” is a very different concept at law firms and corporations. (I’d broached that topic [in this column](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/do-you-manage-projects-or-do-you-manage-people/) before, but apparently my lunch dates weren’t intimately familiar with ATL.)

I explained that, as a partner at a big law firm, if an associate gives you crappy work, you just pluck the associate out of your life: You never again ask that associate to help you. There’s no need to train the associate, or work with him, or even speak to him again. You just eliminate him (from your life).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In contrast, as a senior lawyer at a corporation, you have six or eight “direct reports” assigned to you. If one of your direct reports hands you bad work, you can’t pluck the person out of your life: The person will continue to be your direct report until you (or she) is fired, promoted, quits, retires, or dies. You can’t pluck the person out of your life, so you’re forced either to fire the person (which seems pretty merciless, if it can be avoided) or do some “coaching.” You must actually train people.

Thus: Lawyers at big law firms can abandon their young; in-house lawyers must educate their young.

Where’s the justice in that?

One of my lunch dates explained why this dichotomy makes sense: “At a corporation, you’re hiring employees for the long haul. If you hire a new lawyer, you’d like that person to stay with you for many decades. At our firm, we don’t work on that type of retention model; we work on an attrition model. After four or five years, it’s pretty obvious which associates are good; after eight or nine years, we promote those people to the partnership. We affirmatively want everyone else to leave. We count on attrition.”

Ha! My lunch date paid off: I got a blog post out of it (not to mention a fine Cobb salad).

What this fellow said is of course true: A typical big firm will promote one out of ten (or 20, or 50) new associates to partnership after a decade with the firm. And the firm will rely upon the remaining 90 percent of folks to move on (or be pushed out). But isn’t that insanity?

On the one hand: No, it’s not insanity. It’s terribly hard to tell from an interview whether a recent law school graduate will be a great lawyer. Big firms use law school grades to sort the wheat from the chaff, but grades are a mediocre reaper/thresher: People with great grades are not consistently great lawyers, and folks with bad grades are not uniformly terrible. Grades may be a helpful predictor of future performance, but they’re no more than that. If you believe (as I do, because I’m a [curmudgeon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Curmudgeons-Guide-Practicing-Law/dp/1590316762)) that most lawyers are mediocre, and that it’s very hard to find great ones, maybe there’s no easy selection process to tell who will be good and who bad. Maybe you really have to work with lawyers for several years to get a sense of this.

That might explain operating on an attrition model: Hire a bunch; keep a few; discard the rest. It’s the only way to build a great firm.

If that’s true, however, then other things make no sense: Why are big firms hiring lateral partners based on a day or two of interviews? Do the firms no longer care about quality at the partner level, because a big book of business offsets a presumed lack of talent? Or perhaps lawyers at the firm actually worked with the lateral over the course of a long case, and those lawyers can vouch that the inbound lateral is great? (Even if that’s true for some lateral hires, I guarantee you it’s not true for all of them. Look at the number of lawyers moving between firms these days.)

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The illogic doesn’t stop there: If it’s not possible to tell a good lawyer from a bad one at the hiring stage, then how do corporations hire good lawyers? Corporations do not run on the attrition model: Corporations hire a relatively few folks and expect them to hang around. Does that mean that all (or many) in-house lawyers are terrible, because it wasn’t possible to distinguish the good from the bad during the hiring process? Does it mean that corporations can’t tell the difference between good lawyers and bad ones? That in-house law departments generally suck?

And what about other hiring processes? Big law firms are hiring finance people, and IT folks, and librarians, and many other “support” personnel. Law firms don’t run through those people on the attrition model. Are firms really able to tell good finance people from bad during an interview, even though firms can’t do the same for lawyers? What’s unique about lawyers that explains this? Or do firms not care about the quality of their non-lawyers? (“The IT guy sucks, but that’s life. Maybe all IT guys suck. Anyway, we’ll just live with it.”) In any event, firms are not hiring 10 IT guys, firing 9, and then retaining only the one good one. Firms apply the attrition model to lawyers alone.

(I suppose law firms aren’t alone on this score. The big management consultants hire the masses as baby consultants and promote only the few to partnership. And the big accounting firms are the same. But it does seem a little odd, doesn’t it?)

Maybe big firms don’t care that they’ve hired a bunch of incompetent lawyers: “Someone has to do routine discovery, conduct legal research, and otherwise bill time on inconsequential tasks. We need a bunch of incompetents around here; otherwise, how would we bill enough time to generate a million a year in PPP?”

I don’t believe that for a minute. (I know that the preceding paragraph was red meat for the “commenters,” who will say that big firms don’t care about the quality of their associates. Those comments prove only that commenters at ATL were never partners at big firms.) When I was a partner at a big firm, I cared dearly about the quality of associates handling discovery or legal research on my cases. If we botched discovery responses or misanalyzed cases, we’d lose matters that we should have won. Clients don’t pay you 15 bucks a minute to lose.

Curiously, unlike the large firms, many small law firms don’t rely on the attrition model. Small firms often hire a relatively few lawyers who the firms believe will be good, train those lawyers, and promote many of them up through the ranks.

What’s up with that? Are the small firms uniformly terrible, so it doesn’t matter that they’ve hired and promoted incompetents? Or have the small firms found some secret sauce that hasn’t yet made its way to their larger brethren?

I understand that big firms have been hiring and promoting on the attrition model for decades, and very few are trying to break that mold. But maybe a clever firm could think harder about this. As a pure thought experiment, it sure seems that a law firm could profit by (1) identifying stellar lawyers during the recruiting process, (2) hiring those stellar lawyers and nurturing them over time, (3) promoting those stellar, well-trained lawyers to partnership, and (4) relying on other, cheaper outfits — e-discovery vendors, document management firms, and the like — to handle the tedium.

That sounds like a pretty good law firm, giving its lawyers interesting professional lives and its clients good value for their money.

Or maybe not.

Either way, I sure did like the Cobb salad.

# And The Award For Most Tone-Deaf Coverage Of 'Lawyer Arrested For Assaulting Fiancée With A Frying Pan' Goes To...

The arrest of Connecticut land-use attorney Dwight Merriam, of Am Law 200 firm [Robinson+Cole](http://www.rc.com), on domestic violence charges should prompt a number of stories from a publication like the Connecticut Law Tribune. A matter-of-fact account of the allegations and Merriam’s side of the story could be one. Or perhaps a thought-piece on the history of domestic violence in the legal profession, an issue that receives far less coverage than the often related subject of substance abuse surrounding the job. Given the nature of Merriam’s case, maybe even a discussion of the ethics of dating a student.

One story that it probably shouldn’t prompt is an exploration of how he can mount a comeback that ends with the line “that is why God made erasers.”

First of all, Edward Nairne invented the eraser. Second of all, what the hell? Either this is the most tone-deaf article of the “believe women” era or an act of supremely subversive journalism to end this account on such a retch-inducing description of abuse. But whether this article earnestly approached domestic abuse allegations — roughly 48 hours after the fact — as an opportunity to wonder about the man’s future career prospects or the publication simply managed to slyly relay that a large swath of the legal community had already decided they’d rather move on from her story, the article shines a light on something deeply troubling about the profession.

Merriam, who is 72, was engaged to be married to a woman of unspecified age, but…

The police report states Merriam met his fiancee at the University of Connecticut Law School, where he was a professor. It does not name the woman, but notes she is Russian.

The pair started dating in 2013, and he “paid for all of her school tuition,” according to the arrest report.

The report paints a picture of a relationship in which money was instrumental.

You don’t say?

According to the police, the woman says the argument arose over the prenuptial agreement. She claims she was prepared to sign an agreement protecting his broader assets in the event of the relationship turning sour if he would agree to give her a $50,000 payment. Merriam says the argument remained verbal, while the police say this led to a physical disagreement:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Simsbury Police charged Merriam with disorderly conduct and simple assault. They charged Merriam after his fiancee accused him of chasing her around his house, assaulting her with a frying pan, and leaving a softball-sized red mark with purple overtones on her hip.

To its credit, Robinson+Cole approached this issue with the appropriate seriousness, accepting Merriam’s leave of absence while this matter is dealt with and reiterating the firm’s commitment to supporting the victims of domestic violence. Others missed that boat:

Merriam serves on the Connecticut Law Tribune’s editorial board. His arrest will not affect that position, according to Joette Katz, who chairs the board.

Starting to wonder if maybe this isn’t the right publication to be offering a robust defense of this guy’s future prospects. Still others took their full-throated support of Merriam to another level:

Jamie Sullivan, a legal ethics expert and partner with Howard, Kohn, Sprague & FitzGerald in Hartford, said he does not believe Connecticut’s Statewide Grievance Committee will address the matter.

“This has nothing to do with the practice of law,” said Sullivan, who co-authored “Connecticut Legal Ethics and Malpractice” with attorney Mark Dubois. “In order for the Statewide Grievance Committee to be interested in criminal conduct, the crime or infraction has to be very serious…. This does not even come close to rising to that level. The bar simply will not be interested in this.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Putting aside the implication that domestic violence is not a serious crime, this analysis seems to be a stretch. We’re a little over a month removed from Connecticut’s Grievance Committee [diciplining a guy who punched a random dude over a Little League game](https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2018/03/21/personal-injury-attorney-reprimanded-for-punching-man-in-face/). Connecticut probably doesn’t want to get in the business of saying a punch in the face is categorically more serious than chasing a woman with a frying pan. That would be a dubious distinction.

But, again, even if this analysis turns out to be right, the immediate aftermath of serious allegations of abuse is not the time to be musing about his career. Is there any other category of crime — besides crimes against women — where that’s the first response? No one read about the indictment and said, “Gee, I wonder if Martin Shkreli will ever trade again?” There’s a time and a place for career rehabilitation and moving on toward the future. That time is at least more than a week.

Sullivan, as it happens, is also the attorney who provided the article’s money line:

Meanwhile, Sullivan said Merriam’s case “is definitely being talked about” in legal circles, but he expects colleagues to support the attorney.

“They will stand behind him because ‘There, but for the grace of God, go I,’” Sullivan said. “That is why God made erasers.”

I’m pretty sure God’s saying, “hold on there, don’t bring me into this.” But in all seriousness, consider the extraordinary abdication of responsibility required to make those comments. It’s one thing to say, “I don’t believe these allegations” it’s another to say, “hey, domestic violence charges just come right out of the blue… can happen to any of us really.”

Sadly, he might be right that this accurately describes the community’s thinking whenever they hear allegations like this.

Kellyanne Conway, George Conway, and their twins (via Kellyanne Conway’s Twitter feed)

Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager turned senior adviser to President Donald Trump, is now one of the most famous lawyers in America. A graduate of the George Washington University Law School and member of the D.C. bar, Conway is a regular subject of [Saturday Night Live skits](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/gw-law-grad-and-her-biglaw-partner-husband-get-the-saturday-night-live-treatment/). How many lawyers can make that claim to fame?

Interestingly enough, Kellyanne Conway hasn’t always been Kellyanne Conway. The prominent pollster was known as Kellyanne Fitzpatrick — until she married another high-profile lawyer, longtime Wachtell Lipton partner [George Conway](http://www.wlrk.com/GTConway/).

George Conway is no stranger to these pages. The Yale Law grad was a [finalist](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/an-exciting-new-entrant-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/) for the post of solicitor general — a plum post that [ultimately went to](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/and-the-nominee-for-solicitor-general-is/) his fellow Filipino American, Noel Francisco — and Conway should be [nominated to lead the Justice Department’s civil division](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/a-wachtell-lipton-partner-joins-the-trump-administration/) any day now.

But who is George Conway really? I shared some [personal recollections](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/an-exciting-new-entrant-in-the-solicitor-general-sweepstakes/?rf=1) about him based on our working together at Wachtell Lipton, but that was quite some time ago. Fortunately, Ben Terris of the Washington Post just produced a detailed profile of this influential attorney, [George Conway Is the Man at the Center of Everything](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/george-conway-is-the-man-at-the-center-of-everything/2017/05/13/e0720ad6-366b-11e7-b412-62beef8121f7_story.html?utm_term=.0cf67811839b).

Terris goes back to the very beginning. George Conway’s mother was an organic chemist from the Philippines, and his father worked for defense contractor Raytheon. Conway grew up outside of Boston and graduated from Marlborough High School, where there’s no photo of him in the yearbook; his name appears near the end, under the “Camera Shy” section. (And it looks like he’s still camera shy; note the lack of a photo in his [Wachtell Lipton bio](http://www.wlrk.com/GTConway/).)

After graduating from Harvard College, at age 20, and from Yale Law School, where he was active in the Federalist Society, Conway clerked for Judge Ralph Winter of the Second Circuit and then joined Wachtell Lipton. By his mid-thirties, he was a partner at the [uber-profitable](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/) and [prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/?rf=1) firm, taking home a seven-figure paycheck.

But representing major corporations in high-stakes litigation wasn’t enough for Conway. As I told Terris for the article, “George is somebody who likes to be in the mix, where the action is.”

And back in the 1990s, the action surrounded President Bill Clinton. Terris recounts Conway’s behind-the-scenes role in assisting lawyers for Paula Jones, the former Arkansas state employee who famously sued President Clinton for sexual harassment — and set into motion the chain of events that would culminate in [Clinton’s impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton). But talking to Terris, Conway discounts or minimizes these events and his role in them:

“If you told me in 1994 that this would lead to the impeachment of the president, I would have said you are a certifiable lunatic,” he said. “It was just a civil case. It was popgun. It was nothing, and nobody took it seriously.”

As for claims that Conway shared damaging information about President Clinton with Matt Drudge:

George says now he has no recollection of sending emails to Drudge and denies he was “out to get” the president.

“The notion that it was some sort of long-term conspiracy to destroy Bill Clinton is ludicrous,” he said. “It was mystifying to me that they never settled.”

This is good practice for Conway’s confirmation hearings, where his involvement in the controversial litigation might be the only major sticking point. As a longtime litigator with an impressive track record, including a win before the U.S. Supreme Court in an important securities case, Conway’s clearly qualified for the job.

The WaPo profile also contains some fun tidbits. For example, how did George and Kellyanne Conway meet? They were introduced by another celebrity of the conservative world:

[I]t took time for George — pudgy, soft-spoken and borderline shy — to find love. Not that he didn’t have a type. He became friends with Laura Ingraham, often inviting her to the ski slopes or the beach. And while nothing ever happened between him and [his good friend Ann] Coulter, she was responsible for him meeting the other blond Republican It Girl, who would become his wife.

He was familiar with Kellyanne from her television punditry spots. But inspiration struck one day in the late 1990s when he spotted her on the cover of a society magazine. He called Coulter and asked for an introduction.

He courted her with trips to his Hamptons beach rental and tickets to baseball playoffs. And at some point, Kellyanne remembers telling a friend: “I find that his near-constant presence doesn’t annoy me.”

That might not sound very romantic, but I think it’s a good sign that someone is marriage material. (I’ve said something similar to my husband: “Many people start to annoy me if I hang out with them long enough, but not you.”)

So that’s how George and Kellyanne met. What about Kellyanne and the Donald?

[George and Kellyanne Conway moved into] an apartment in Manhattan’s Trump World Tower. There, [George] caught the future president’s attention by arguing to the condo board against stripping Trump’s name from the exterior. The speech earned him an appreciative call from the mogul and an offer to join the board. He declined, but Kellyanne said she’d do it.

“My laziness led her to meet Donald Trump,” he said in a recent interview.

And perhaps contributed to Trump’s surprising election victory? Trump’s campaign was viewed by many as floundering before Kellyanne Conway took over. George took great pride in his wife’s role in Trump’s election:

George spent election night nervously watching returns with his wife’s team at the Midtown Manhattan Hilton. When the networks called it for Trump, he couldn’t hold back his pride. Tears streamed down his face, and he shouted to anyone who would listen: “She did it! She did it! She made history.”

Said Kellyanne: “He’s always been the more emotional one.”

And also, since Kellyanne got sucked into Trumpworld, George is the spouse with primary responsibility for their four children. It’s impressive to see a high-powered (male) Biglaw partner taking the lead in raising the kids.

Part of this has to do with the New York/D.C. issue. But with the school year winding down and with George set to take a Washington job — subject to Senate approval, of course — the family can be together again in one city. And in an $8 million house that the Conways expect to close on this month. (For a deeper dive into their finances, see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-lawyers-in-the-trump-white-house-how-much-are-they-worth-part-1/).)

Why should Kellyanne Conway get to have all the fun? Good luck to George Conway in the confirmation process. He’s already made his millions, so now he can make his mark in a different way. Standing up in court to represent the people of the United States is a nice follow-up to representing its major corporations.

[SolarWinds just received a Wells notice from the SEC](https://www.reuters.com/technology/solarwinds-executives-receive-wells-notice-us-sec-2023-06-23/) following the cyberattack launched through exploiting the company’s software.
