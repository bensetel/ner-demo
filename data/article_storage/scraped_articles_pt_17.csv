# Biglaw’s Blockbuster Moment
## Biglaw needs to get over itself and start looking to the larger business world for ideas.

Back in 2005, [Blockbuster’s CEO](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2014/09/05/a-look-back-at-why-blockbuster-really-failed-and-why-it-didnt-have-to/2/#31f16d70be4a) John Antioco wasn’t thinking about other retail video rental stores. iTunes had already begun decimating the brick-and-mortar music industry, and Antioco saw a similar looming threat from video industry disrupters Netflix and Redbox. Antioco decided to radically reinvent his company to survive. He proposed eliminating late fees and heavily expanding the company’s digital offerings. Antioco theorized that these moves, combined with Blockbuster’s existing retail footprint and other structural advantages, might help the company survive the assault and even defeat or absorb the competition. The board disagreed, ousted him, and fell back on what worked well for all of those years: more of the same.

To take a line from Rick Perry, “Oops.”

Biglaw partners raking in big bucks might feel safe, but the world of large law firms now finds itself barreling toward the same decision point Blockbuster stumbled over a decade ago. The economic stagnation plaguing much of the legal industry has been well documented. [Last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/saving-biglaw/?rf=1), I wrote about how Biglaw needs to take a page out of the playbook of the pro-business plaintiffs’ bar by using innovation and discipline to thrive instead of running in the hamster wheel like so many large law firms are currently doing.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Both concepts have proven difficult for Biglaw to implement, but the latter — the need to innovate — is probably the bigger challenge. On top of innovation being a difficult process generally, large law firms seem endlessly reluctant to make changes unless their counterpart large law firms have already made the same one. Look at the world of associate bonuses. Most of the world’s largest firms continue to emulate Cravath, Simpson Thacher, Davis Polk, and other firms that give lock-step bonuses in lemming-like fashion. Similar phenomena can be found in the world of staffing, billable hour expectations, benefits and more. It’s an endless loop of hesitation and copycatting that gets the industry nowhere, because the only ideas are coming from within the same small pool of players.

Looking to imitate other Biglaw competitors can’t be a large law firm’s only move. Over and over again, law firms have obsessed over themselves and their closest competitors while ignoring the larger business world. This is a problem because, let’s be honest, looking for innovation in Biglaw is like shopping for igloos in Palm Springs. The Biglaw business model is decades old, and showing its wear and tear. Law firms need to pull their heads out of their own field if they want to survive in the coming economy.

With so many industries innovating their hearts out, why does Biglaw keep focusing on the mirror and ignoring the larger business world? In a word: ego.

Lawyers like to think that their profession is special, that only other lawyers can understand and improve it. It is of course true that we occupy a protected niche in the marketplace, and no one without a bar card is going to be trying a case anytime soon. But law isn’t the noble, leather-bound, romantic profession of the past. We call it an industry because that’s what it is: industry. We produce and sell a good, be it our time, our advice, or our results. We’re subject to the same iron-clad rules that govern all businesses — keep expenses low, keep revenue high, keep clients happy, find an edge and exploit it to the hilt. We use the same technology as many businesses, including word processing, project management, and accounting software. So, when looked at through a business lens, maybe the legal profession isn’t so special after all.

Biglaw needs to get over itself. The industry’s self-obsession is not only a complete lawyer cliché, but it’s killing the bottom line. Instead of looking at what Latham or Skadden are doing, firms need to start thinking about how Amazon, Apple, or Google would handle it.

For example, what New York, Chicago or L.A. Biglaw firm can you name that doesn’t require most of its attorneys to do their billing from the posh floors the firm occupies in a Class-A skyscraper? Sure, the traditional in-office model can promote collaboration, but [research](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/millennial-survey-freelance-flexibility.html#trust) shows that most new lawyers would like to work remotely some or all of the time. Virtual law firms such as [FisherBroyles](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202784525264/?slreturn=20171001130648) are knocking on the door of the Am Law 200, and their low-cost, high-profit model is going to attract many budget-savvy clients and profit-minded rainmakers. Will any Biglaw firm give the virtual model a shot, or will they simply wait for the up-and-coming firms to steal their business out from under them?

Biglaw is also famous for burning out its attorneys and employees with grinding hours and brutal expectations. The universal solution in the legal industry seems to be throwing higher salaries at the problem, but why not look to how other businesses are tackling the challenge?  Tech and start-up companies all have similar reputations for brutal, grinding work, but manage to keep employees hooked with at-work perks and other benefits aimed at maintaining a sense of happiness and healthiness. When was the last time you saw a bowling alley in a Biglaw basement?

Heading in a different direction, what can Biglaw learn from Airbnb, Prosper, or the other big players in the new gig economy? Can a law firm successfully distribute its attorneys on an ad hoc, as-needed basis to the public at large? More and more everyday people are finding themselves in need of legal assistance, and fewer and fewer can afford traditional rates. Meanwhile, out-of-work attorneys in a market that remains oversaturated are looking for jobs, and willing to do it at affordable rates. When there’s so much demand not being met, and so much supply not being utilized, it’s only a matter of time before someone, maybe FisherBroyles or the other upcoming virtual Biglaw firms, threads the needle to connect those two groups and reap the rewards.

But there are a few bright spots in Biglaw. As I’ve previously written about, plaintiff commercial contingent-fee work has been a game changer at several large firms. Litigation powerhouse Quinn Emanuel is famous for using contingent fees to drive up its profits (currently clocking in at over $5 million per equity partner), and firm partner Dan Brockett even [has a framed photo of a $250 million legal fee award](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-partner-makes-it-rain-because-he-doesnt-bill-by-the-hour/) hanging over his desk. These plaintiff-based niche practices in Biglaw are a step in the right direction, but for most firms they aren’t a silver bullet.

Lawyers tend to be risk averse, and the radical changes necessary to survive the coming shifts in the legal economy would have most firm leaders sweating. But fear is a firm killer, and any firm that isn’t prepared to risk some pain to change and develop is instead risking being run out of business altogether.

Biglaw is at its Blockbuster moment. The question is whether it adapts and innovates by looking outside of the legal bubble, or just ends up busted.

# 5 Ways In Which The Business Of Law Is NOT Changing Anytime Soon

Journalists have a bias in favor of change. Something’s not “news” unless it’s new. Pronouncements of “seismic shifts” and “sea changes” generate more buzz and pageviews than saying things aren’t really changing all that much. This explains why we media types tend to go on breathlessly about “transformation” this and “disruption” that.

But picking up on the major theme of my story from yesterday about the [latest Am Law 200 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/the-2017-am-law-200-keep-calm-and-carry-on/), in which I argued that reports of Biglaw’s death (or even disruption) are greatly exaggerated, I’d like to provide more examples of how the practice and business of law aren’t changing as much as some might think. These all come from a great event I attended earlier this week, the third annual [Big Law Business Summit](https://www.bna.com/Big-Law-Business-Summit-2017/), hosted this year at the gleaming tower on Lexington Avenue that’s home to the Bloomberg empire.

1. Don’t expect a regulatory revolution, even if President Donald Trump talks a big game.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Dramatic regulatory changes could have major implications for Biglaw and the business of law — but don’t bank on such changes actually happening. Former SEC chair Mary Jo White, now back at Debevoise & Plimpton (this is her sixth stint at the firm, for anyone who’s counting), had [this to say](https://bol.bna.com/mary-jo-white-doesnt-expect-big-regulatory-changes-under-trump-admin/):

White said she doesn’t expect enforcement actions to dip significantly, and she predicted the Financial CHOICE Act, which aims to replace the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and roll back many of its provisions, likely won’t make it further than the House of Representatives….

“I think whatever change happens is going to come several years down the road by virtue of how the regulators carry out their jobs with a different kind of philosophy,” said White, now a senior chair of Debevoise & Plimpton. “But it’s both uncertain where the administration is actually going to land on policy, and then there’s uncertainty as to whether they can bring that about.”

Stephen Cutler, vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase and former head of the SEC’s enforcement division, echoed her sentiments, predicting that the Trump administration’s regulatory reform won’t be as sweeping as some hope (or fear): “I think we’re a long way away from accomplishing a significant change in the regulatory agenda even if one were to have that agenda.”

2. The separation of law and compliance, a major post-recession development, might actually get reversed.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Regulation of the financial sector increased dramatically since the Great Recession (and might not be going down as much as some might think, if White and Cutler are correct). One notable change in response to that regulation was the establishment at many banks of separate compliance divisions, distinct from the legal department, and with reporting lines not even going to the general counsel.

But this trend could be unwound — and that’s as it should be, as [argued by](https://bol.bna.com/top-morgan-stanley-lawyer-legal-and-compliance-belong-together/) Morgan Stanley’s chief legal officer, Eric Grossman:

During a keynote address at Bloomberg Law’s Big Law Business Summit in Midtown Manhattan Wednesday, Grossman told an audience of law firm partners and corporate legal officers that it’s “counterproductive” to separate a company’s legal and compliance functions, and that doing so does a disservice to clients, shareholders, employees, and regulators. “If you’ve built the right culture, the lawyers and the compliance professionals all share the same goal.”

…. Grossman said he expects other financial firms to [do what Morgan Stanley has done and] combine the functions again soon. “If they’re allowed to, they will,” he said.

3. Robots aren’t taking all your jobs.

Grossman noted that in his industry, they’re seeing the rise of automated investment advisory services (such as [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/)) — but there will still be strong demand for human financial advisors, for a long, long time. Baby boomers, who have a huge amount of investable assets, just aren’t there yet in terms of robot advisors. And it’s not just a factor of age, but also of issues; in Grossman’s view, if you have serious issues or problems, whether financial or legal or otherwise, you’ll still want to talk to a human.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
As general counsel to a bank, Grossman spends a good amount of time (and legal spend) on ediscovery. In that sphere, technology has made things more efficient, but it hasn’t eliminated the role of human beings: “Computers can reduce your universe of documents from 10 million to one million, but you still need humans to look at individual documents to see how they fit into a case.”

[Jamie Wine](https://www.lw.com/people/jamie-wine), global chair of the litigation department at Latham & Watkins, talked about how her firm is working with IBM (of Watson fame) to see how [artificial intelligence](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/bakerhostetler-hires-a-i-lawyer-ushers-in-the-legal-apocalypse/) can [improve the delivery of legal services](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/alt-legal-can-computers-beat-humans-at-law/). But AI is still not a total substitute for actual lawyers. For example, artificial intelligence can streamline the due diligence process, but it’s still not perfect; for example, it’s not great at detecting when key provisions are missing from a contract.

As [Stuart Ingis](https://www.venable.com/stuart-p-ingis/), chairman of Venable, added, “Computers aren’t yet able to advocate. We are being hired to advocate, whether in court or in a deal, and computers can’t yet do that.”

(A fun fact demonstrating how slow some lawyers are to adopt technology: Jamie Wine still uses a BlackBerry. The horror, the horror!)

4. The billable hour still reigns supreme.

As head of Capital One Financial’s legal department, Matthew Cooper is all in favor of trying out new approaches to the acquisition and pricing of legal services. His company has, for example, asked its law firms to farm out document review to lower-cost providers, instead of charging Capital One a small fortune to have it done by associates.

That said, the bulk of the company’s legal work is still done on an hourly basis. In Cooper’s view, “the death of the billable hour has been overstated.”

5. Diversity is still a challenge — and isn’t an easy problem to fix.

Jamie Wine of Latham said that law firms are making major efforts to enhance diversity, but “we aren’t seeing as much change as we’d like — and the reasons why are very complicated.” (For more on that subject, see this prior Above the Law column by David Perla and Sanjay Kamlani, [Diversity In The Legal Profession: The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same – Until They Don’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/diversity-in-the-legal-profession-the-more-things-change-the-more-they-stay-the-same-until-they-dont/).)

One factor is that young lawyers might not aspire to Wine’s life as a Biglaw partner (notwithstanding Latham’s [insane profits per partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/eye-popping-profits-at-latham-watkins/)). She suggested that women and diverse lawyers might look at her and say, “I don’t want that life — she works her ass off and she travels all the time.”

But for those lawyers who do want to go for the gold (or golden handcuffs?) of Biglaw, Wine offered words of encouragement: “I understand that you might be nervous about juggling work and family responsibilities. I get that. My main message to you is, stick with it, stick it out. These things have a way of working themselves out.”

In other words, [Lean In](http://amzn.to/2s3Sd6T) (affiliate link). Or to tweak another famous saying (of [disputed origin](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/opinion/falser-words-were-never-spoken.html)), be the change you want to be — in Biglaw.

# Women Of Color Face 'Silent Hostilities' In Biglaw Firms As They're Pushed Out Of Practice
## They often don't speak about these issues because to do so would be a ""complete career killer.""

When you find ways to exclude and make people feel invisible in their environment, it’s hostile. Women face these silent hostilities in ways that men will never have to. It’s very silent, very subtle and you, as a woman of color—people will say you’re too sensitive. So you learn not to say anything because you know that could be a complete career killer. You make it as well as you can until you decide to leave.

— Jenny Jones (a pseudonym), a fifth-year associate at a white-shoe Biglaw firm, who is trying to come up with an exit strategy to leave the place where [she feels “largely ignored” by partners](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/minority_women_are_disappearing_from_biglaw_and_heres_why). Jones feels as though she’s been “idling” in her career, and has been unable to meet her billable-hours requirements.

(According to studies conducted by the [ABA Commission on Women in the Profession](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/women/about_us.html) through the [Women of Color Research Initiative](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/women/initiatives_awards/women_of_color_research_initiative.html), 85 percent of minority female lawyers will leave Biglaw firms within seven years of being hired.)

# One Simple Way To Improve Your Recruitment Of Diverse Candidates
## Work with diverse legal recruiters to find diverse legal talent.

At the 2019 Lateral Link company retreat.

The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor are just the latest manifestation of profound injustice in our society. They have given rise to an urgent conversation about how to address longstanding, systemic inequality in our nation.

Law firms have responded in a forceful manner by [donating millions of dollars](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/) to support organizations that are battling inequity in the trenches. While we applaud their efforts, we believe that more needs to be done.

Law firms must actively increase their commitment to diversity and inclusion. With COVID-19 threatening the financial health of many law firms and in-house departments, we fear that, as was the case in the last economic downturn, diversity and inclusion initiatives will be the first to go as austerity measures are instituted.

We cannot let that happen.  Equality, the rule of law, and justice are at the core of who we are and the industry that we serve.

We embrace the words of [Arthur Ashe](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/arthur_ashe_371527): “Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.”

Our Commitment

At [Lateral Link](https://www.laterallink.com/), we commit to working with our law firm and in-house clients to bring them talented and experienced lawyers of color, women lawyers, and LGBTQ+ lawyers. It is a commitment that we don’t take lightly. Many of us are former practicing lawyers, so we know firsthand the importance of diversity in law firms and in-house departments.

We commit to having difficult conversations with regard to diversity and inclusion, even when it is uncomfortable — especially when it is uncomfortable — and to deal with the issues head-on. For example, we need to know if your lateral partner integration plan takes diversity into account. We need to understand the relationship between your firm’s origination credit and partner compensation system. We need to hear where you may have fallen short on diversity in the past — as well your success stories regarding women and minority partners.

Our commitment to diversity reflects our longstanding commitment to the broader legal community. In 2015, our founder, Michael Allen, established the [Lateral Link Scholarship Fund](https://hls.harvard.edu/alumni/honoring-donors/michael-a-allen-04-initiates-a-new-scholarship-at-harvard-law-school/) at his alma mater, Harvard Law School. Ten percent of the fees earned from Lateral Link’s placement of HLS alumni go into the fund, which supports scholarships at the Law School for financially disadvantaged students, many of them from diverse backgrounds.

Our Team

In order to help law firms and in-house legal departments recruit the best diverse lawyers, recruiting firms must embrace diversity themselves.

Lateral Link fields one of the most diverse legal recruiting teams in the industry. Almost three-quarters of our recruiters are women, minorities, or LGBTQ+. Women of color hold leadership positions and sit on our Executive Committee. Here are just four of our diverse leaders at Lateral Link (who are black, black and Latina, Asian American, and Asian American and LGBTQ+, respectively):

* [Monique Burt Williams](https://www.laterallink.com/team/monique-burt-williams/), CEO of Cadence Counsel, a Certified Women’s Business Enterprise, specializing in in-house recruiting;

* [Gloria Sandrino](https://www.laterallink.com/team/gloria-sandrino/), Global Chair of Partner and Group Recruiting and member of the Executive Committee;

* [Gloria Cannon](https://www.laterallink.com/team/gloria-noh-cannon/), Managing Director of the California Legal Recruiting Team and member of the Executive Committee; and

* [David Lat](https://www.laterallink.com/team/david-lat/), Managing Director, who will receive the Dan Bradley Award, the highest honor of the National LGBT Bar Association, at the [2020 Lavender Law Conference and Career Fair](https://lgbtbar.org/annual/).

Left to right: Monique Burt Williams, Gloria Sandrino, Gloria Cannon, and David Lat.

The stories of the candidates that we work with are our stories as well.  We bring credibility to our legal recruiting efforts because we understand the often difficult paths of diverse lawyers making a lateral move in the private sector or to an in-house department.

Our Call to Action

If you would like to work with a legal recruiting firm that walks the walk as well as talks the talk on diversity and inclusion, please reach out to us. You can contact [Monique Burt Williams](mailto:mburtwilliams@cadencecounsel.com) for in-house searches, [Gloria Sandrino](mailto:gsandrino@laterallink.com) for partner searches, and [David Lat](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com) for associate searches.

# Biglaw Partner Learns The Hard Way It's Probably Best If You *Don't* Forge Someone's Signature On Legal Documents

Sometimes when you’re studying for the MPRE, you get a hypo that is just too obvious — like the bar administrators are trying to give away points. Like, no, you can’t co-mingle personal funds and an attorney trust account. Or how about you don’t gossip at a church function about information you learned under the umbrella of attorney client privilege. You know, really easy, basic stuff. And you might have thought not forging a witness’s signature when the incompleteness of a mortgage deed is pointed out by the bank’s counsel would fall under the auspices of such a gimmie question. But at least one — now former — Biglaw partner would fail that one.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/ex-dla-piper-partner-suspended-forging-signature) Roll on Friday, Robert Arnison was a partner at DLA Piper leading the firm’s Manchester, England, real estate group. He had clients trying to buy property with the help of a mortgage. But those mortgage documents are apparently tricky little bastards.

But after he sent them across, the bank’s lawyer, Gary Shepherd, emailed Arnison with the dread words, “Robert, Just tried to call you. The legal charge isn’t correctly executed”.

The witness had not signed the mortgage deed, and Arnison, “suffering from anxiety and in panic”, and under pressure from his “particularly demanding” client, “applied a squiggle where the signature should have been”.

He then told Shepherd that everything was in hand, and within 25 minutes provided a copy of the executed document.

But, obviously, the forged signature did not match the signature on other documents.

A properly executed version of the deed was eventually procured. Arnison confessed what he’d done up the chain at DLA, and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) commenced an investigation. But even before that was completed, DLA took away his equity status and he was working as a consultant.

As part of the ethics investigation, Arnison pointed to several mitigating factors for his behavior:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[Admitting](https://www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk/sites/default/files-sdt/12437.2023.Arnison.pdf) all the allegations against him, Arnison told the SDT in mitigation that he had been working “extremely hard and, as he now understands, excessively hard”, particularly after a significant chunk of his team left the firm in 2013.

He typically worked 70 hour weeks and on Sundays and holidays. But he made “no criticism of the firm in this respect”, nor of his PA, explaining that he “plainly he took too much upon himself” and “was on the verge of burnout. Something had to give”.

The tribunal agreed that the former partner’s panicked scribble was “a classic ‘moment of madness’” which was “caused in large part by overwork for a period of about 10 years”.

Arnison was suspended from practice by the regulators for a period of one year, and will pay costs to the SRA of £17,250.

In response to the SRA’s decision, a DLA Piper spokesperson said, “We are aware of the SRA’s decision to suspend our former partner, Robert Arnison, following misconduct which was identified and reported jointly to the regulator.”

Only one of them will get a job…

If you’re trying to land a summer associateship at a Biglaw firm and you think listing some of your high-brow hobbies on your résumé will help you out, it most likely won’t — unless you’re a man.

According to a study conducted by Lauren Rivera (Northwestern University) and András Tilcsik (University of Toronto) and published in the American Sociological Review, résumés signalling privilege and wealth resulted in a 16 percent callback rate for men, which was more than four times the rate for privileged women, less-privileged women, and less-privileged men combined. In the first round of their study, Rivera and Tilcisk sent fake résumés to 316 top Biglaw firms in the hopes of receiving interviews for their fictitious job seekers. [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/privilege-helps-men-not-women-get-lucrative-jobs/504497/) describes the résumés that were created:

[A]ll the fake résumés indicated that applicants went to selective second-tier law schools, but were still at the top of their class. Their academic and professional experiences were identical, but there were a few variations that signaled their level of privilege. For example, higher-class applicants volunteered as mentors to first-year law students, while lower-class applicants volunteered as mentors to first-generation college students. One fictitious student won a university athletic award, while another won a university athletic award for students on financial aid. Then came the section of the résumé people often spend the least effort on, even though it reveals so much to employers: extracurricular activities and interests. In the experiment, privileged applicants listed expensive, exclusive sports like polo and sailing, and mentioned a penchant for classical music. Less-privileged applicants preferred country music and track-and-field sports.

Out of the 22 interview invitations received, Rivera and Tilcisk found that the air of belonging to a higher social class seemed to penalize female applicants, only benefiting male applicants. This seems to reek of inadvertent discrimination. In all, higher-class men got 13 invitations, higher-class women got three invitations, lower-class men got one invitation, and lower-class women got five invitations.

In a follow-up study, Rivera and Tilcisk surveyed 210 lawyers and asked them to evaluate the same fake résumés based on criteria including the applicant’s professional drive and fit with the Biglaw firm’s culture and clientele. Those lawyers were then asked whether they would recommend an applicant for a job interview. Here, higher-class men were viewed as being more committed to their careers and better fits for Biglaw culture than higher-class women, and were more likely to be recommended for interviews.

Still think this is mere coincidence as opposed to hiring bias? Read this:

[Rivera] and Tilcsik interviewed 20 attorneys who had direct experience hiring at some of the firms in their résumé audit, and found that this group held several assumptions about gender roles that shaped their decision-making. Almost all the lawyers interviewed perceived privileged women as less committed to legal practice, because of concerns that they would soon leave their careers to become stay-at-home mothers. The women were described as lawyers who were secretly “looking for a husband” or “biding time” before leaving their careers altogether. On the other hand, lower-class women were viewed as “hungry,” and were predicted to work hard for the money because they had “law-school debt to pay” and “mouths to feed.”

The group of attorneys also tended to believe that class background was an important determinant of whether an applicant would fit in. … [M]ore privileged male applicants were repeatedly commended for their extracurricular activities and were viewed as being a great fit for the culture of a large law firm.

It takes only a few seconds to scan a résumé, but it can take years to recover from a discriminatory hiring decision made by someone with preconceived notions about gender roles in a law firm setting. The legal profession can surely do better than this, and we must try our hardest to make sure progress is made.

Facing a court order to produce documents, a (now former) Jones Day partner told his client to “burn” an internal messaging app (3XC). Why would a Biglaw partner tell anyone to do something that seemingly contravenes every principle of litigation? He says it’s because he said some stuff of the app that could be embarrassing to his wife… who just happens to be a politician.

Raymond McKeeve, a private equity specialist and the former Jones Day partner in question, advised Jonathan Faiman, founder of online grocer Ocado, while developing a rival grocer, Today Development Partners, with another ex-Ocado employee, Jon Hillary. They used the aforementioned 3XC to communicate. But Ocado sued McKeeve’s client and, after a search order had been issued that would ostensibly include messages on the app, McKeeve contacted the head of IT and told him to “burn” the app.

And when McKeeve gave a reason for the bold destruction instruction, he pointed to his wife. As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/ex-jones-day-partner-facing-jail-burn-it-order) Roll On Friday:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
McKeeve [testified ](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/former-jones-day-partner-admits-ordering-client-burn-evidence)that he only sent the order to prevent exposure of his wife, Belinda de Lucy. Hillary had used her name as a pseudonym in the app, which was “a source of some annoyance to me, for a number of reasons”, said McKeeve. By the time of the search order, she had been elected as an MEP for the Brexit Party.

“I had been not a particularly supportive husband in the build-up to her election and found some of her campaigning irritating and thought it was a waste of time”, said McKeeve. “Then, when she was elected, I think to her’s and a lot of people’s surprise, the media attention to everyone in and around the Brexit Party dialled up significantly. It was really vitriolic”.

Given the destruction order, you’re probably not surprised Ocado’s attorneys weren’t given the heads-up about the app, but McKeeve also failed to mention it to his partners at Jones Day:

Neither McKeeve nor the TDP team initially mentioned the existence of the app to Ocado’s lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, or to anyone else at Jones Day. When [the IT professional] referred to the app in a conversation with a Jones Day lawyer a few days later, litigation partner Sion Richards immediately contacted McKeeve, who was at Wimbledon, and got him to come back to the office. Richards was “really angry”, said McKeeve. Jones Day then came clean to Mischon about 3XC’s existence.

Now that he’s been found in criminal contempt of court — and faces a possible prison sentence — McKeeve says he’s horrified at what’s he’s done:

“The idea that I would have committed a contempt of anything just horrifies me”, he said. “The immediate response was, somebody is handing over a phone, that phone has an app that has my wife’s name on it, get rid of it. It was that simple and that stupid”.

And the judge seemed to have little sympathy for McKeeve:

The judge rejected McKeeve’s claim that he did not know the search order encompassed the app, ruling that it was in fact “the very source of his concern and the inspiration of his stated motive to protect his wife”. He said McKeeve was “unduly defensive and unwilling to accept the obvious”, perhaps because of his “genuine sense of shame and embarrassment”.

McKeeve’s intention to undermine the search order was not “trivial or technical”, but “serious and adverse”. It represented a “wilful intention to interfere with the due administration of justice” which, “sadly”, crossed the threshold of criminal contempt, said the judge. McKeeve now faces the prospect of a fine and up to two years in prison.

All of which proves the lesson of Richard Nixon: the cover-up is worse than the crime. Because talking shit about your wife doesn’t carry a potential jail sentence.

# Salary Cut Rollbacks And Bonuses... With Special Bonuses On The Horizon
## H&K brings cheer.

The pandemic caused a lot of firms to make cuts this year and [Holland & Knight was very much among them](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/holland-knight-cuts/). But those austerity cuts have come to an end, with the firm announcing on a call right before the holiday that they would roll back the last of those cuts and give associates make-whole payments for 2020 compensation in January!

That’s exciting, but the firm sweetened the deal with the revelation that — in addition to annual bonuses — associates will receive special bonuses, though the amount of the special bonuses has not yet been disclosed.

The firm fiscal year begins in March so that’s when bonuses and salary increases for rising associates will go into effect (retroactive to January 1).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)

Associates seem happy with the news:

All in all, I don’t think many of us expected special bonuses and possibly even harbored doubts about potentially impacted year-end bonuses. I think most of us are thrilled that we’re being made whole for 2020, will receive a special bonus, and are on schedule to receive our usual annual raises and year-end bonuses.

Congrats.

# The Most Important Chart In The Legal Industry, And It Has Nothing To Do With The Law

Before Wednesday’s historic news that Justice Anthony Kennedy is [retiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/anthony-kennedy-is-retiring/) from the Supreme Court, a seismic shift in American jurisprudence that will likely filter down to all aspects of everyday life in ways that are both completely foreseeable and likely [impossible to fully fathom](https://www.thenation.com/article/democrats-must-stop-pretending-supreme-court-apolitical/) unless you have read every Federalist Society white paper for the last several decades, the biggest news in the legal world (or at least among Above the Law readers) was the ongoing [race to raise wages](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/?rf=1) in Biglaw, highlighted by the jump to $190,000 for first-year associates.  And while most law students with Biglaw aspirations are focusing on how they will spend that extra $10,000 — to say nothing of what sort of Thomas Piketty nightmare fuel eighth-year associates will be able to generate with $340,000 — there have been some speed bumps along the gold paved parade route.



Not only are [some firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/) failing to raise salaries despite rather large bottom lines, but as Staci Zaretsky [pointed out](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/sorry-law-students-but-your-starting-salary-will-not-be-190k/?rf=1) in these pages, the number of law students who will actually make top Biglaw dollar is a relatively small percentage of the overall law student population.  Staci illustrated her point by using the bimodal starting salary distribution slide put together yearly by the National Association for Law Placement.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  


While I am inherently loathe to praise anything PowerPoint related, the bimodal distribution curve is the single most important graph when discussing legal employment for multiple reasons.  First and foremost, it illustrates the unique economics of the legal industry.  As I have heard NALP’s Executive Director Jim Leipold say before, if you showed any economist the bimodal distribution curve, they would quickly conclude that the legal industry makes no real economic sense.  In an economically rational system, salary distributions fall along a standard bell curve.  Why pay a sizeable number of attorneys such a massive amount of money (i.e., $190,000) when the median salary is roughly half that amount and a plurality of recent graduates make a quarter of that amount?



Secondarily, as Staci notes in her article, the bimodal distribution curve shows that the top end Biglaw salaries that garner all of the Above the Law headlines were only earned by 16 percent of the Class of 2016.  However, as I recently mentioned to a 0L trying to choose which law school to attend — yes, I bring this graph up as much as I can with students to the point that if it did not change each year, I would probably get a framed version for my office that I could just point to when the conversation dictated — that 16 percent is a bit misleading as one’s chances of obtaining a $190,000 starting paycheck is going to greatly vary depending on which law school you attend.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I have [previously mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-best-way-to-pick-the-best-law-school-for-you/) in this space, there is a wide range of data available to prospective law students trying to make an educated choice about which school to attend, particularly the [American Bar Association Employment Outcomes](http://abarequireddisclosures.org/EmploymentOutcomes.aspx).  They are uniquely valuable when trying to calculate your odds of earning top dollar upon graduation as these reports not only tell you the type of positions students obtained for after graduation but for those students who are working in private practice, the size of the firm.  While not a perfect correlation, the firms which have at least 501 attorneys firm-wide are the most likely to be paying first year associates $190,000 (or at least $180,000).  There is a reason it is called “Biglaw.”  With that intuitive bit of information in mind, you can see that the 16 percent figure is routinely surpassed as you go up the law school rankings.  When you look at the all-school data, you see that the percentage of students who work at a 501+ firm after graduation ranges from 0 percent — more than 40 schools failed to send a single person into the largest firms upon graduation — to 67 percent.  As the one, and only, Meat Loaf taught us all:


Additionally, this ABA data tracks the first job a graduating law school has, but there is more than one avenue to make it to the $190,000 promise land.  The [value of clerkships](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/to-clerk-or-not-to-clerk-its-actually-not-much-of-a-question/) is something that I have spoken about before in this space and, especially at the federal level, often serve as a precursor to Biglaw.  The employment reports also provide the number of graduating students going off to clerk, so those numbers can be added into the analysis.  The all-school data shows that the percentage of federal clerks in a graduating class ranges from 0 percent to a rather remarkable 29.5 percent, or nearly one chance in three of clerking for a federal judge right after graduation.


Of course, when trying to best maximize your legal salary, the total amount is but part of the equation as cost of living must similarly be considered.  $190,000 is New York City is great if you are looking to buy a home in certain portions of Queens or Long Island, whereas any devotees of HGTV’s Fixer Upper knows that $180,000 in Texas can buy large swaths in Waco.

If you enter law school only to grow “rich beyond the dreams of avarice,” then you may well end up disappointed, for as the bimodal distribution shows, such levels of wealth are not the norm for graduates.  But reaching the top of legal salary heap, in this case the second peak in the bimodal distribution, is possible, especially if you use the tools available to be judicious in your law school selection.

# Venerable Firm Offers Bonuses Waaaaaaaay Below Market
## Not exactly a good haul.

Venerable law firm Venable LLP announced its bonuses for the year in an associate compensation meeting and the takeaway is that some younger lawyers are definitely going to be making more than their senior colleagues.

First things first, let’s remember how Venable [handles its salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/could-a-5th-year-make-less-than-a-3rd-year-maybe-according-to-this-firm/). For the first three years, associates are paid on the Cravath scale. After that it’s something of a crapshoot, with associates paid on an individualized basis within the following set “bands” of compensation (UPDATE: An earlier version of this story showed the salary ranges released during Salarygeddon — the figures below are updated for this year):

4Y – $210K – $230K
5Y – $220K – $250K
6Y – $235K – $270K
7Y – $240K – $285K
8Y – $247.5K – $300K

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Into that already contentious compensatory environment come some low-end bonuses. According to a tipster:

Must have 1950 billable and 250 non-billable to qualify for year end bonus. 4K (total) for years 1-3, 5k for years 4-6 and 6k for years 7+. No change from last year.

Perhaps that is no change, but it’s a far cry from the bonus schedule starting at $15K that Cravath and the gang are handing out.

UPDATE (2/2/17): Now, other tipsters have come in explaining that these are bonus floors and that associates get another $4K-6K for every 50 hours over 1950 they bill. Meaning a first-year who billed 2100 hours would get $16K and thus finally get ahead of what the rest of Biglaw gives as a matter of course. Still stingy, but not as draconian as the initial post made it sound.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This all reinforces the most important lesson a prospective hire needs to learn: when a firm says they pay “$180K,” that isn’t the end of the inquiry! Don’t take that as a Cravath scale match just because they match the entry point. Scrunching raises up the scale, black-box senior salaries, and discretionary ranges abound in this industry.

And so do below-market bonuses.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Above The Law’s 15th Annual Holiday Card Contest
## We look forward to seeing your submissions. Thank you, and happy holidays!

It’s the most wonderful time of the year! With Biglaw [bonuses (and raises?)](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) about to begin, the holiday season will soon be off to a great start. Law firm holiday parties will certainly get our readers feeling festive, but all of the celebrations and hefty paychecks pale in comparison to what’s about to get underway: Above the Law’s fifteenth annual holiday card contest. We’ve already received several emails asking about when this year’s contest would start. The answer: It starts today.

We are a legal website, so of course there are some rules to follow:

1. Because we are committed to the environment here at Breaking Media, we will consider ONLY E-CARDS. Please don’t send us paper holiday cards via snail mail this year — the Above the Law editorial team hasn’t been in our physical office much since March 2020.

2. To submit an e-card, please email either a link to the card or the card itself (as an attachment) — but note that WE PREFER LINKS, if available — to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest), subject line: “Holiday Card Contest.” The subject line is very important because it’s how we will comb through our inbox to collect the entries when picking finalists. If you don’t use the correct subject line, expect a lump of coal in your stocking.

3. Please limit submissions to holiday / Christmas cards that you view as WORTHY CONTENDERS. We’re looking for cards that are unusually clever, funny, or cool; we’re not interested in cards that are safe or boring (e.g., a beautiful winter landscape, a “Happy Holidays 2023,” and the law firm name). We’re seeking cards with some attitude, with that extra je ne sais quoi. If you send us a banal card, don’t be surprised if we make fun of it.

4. In your email, please include a BRIEF EXPLANATION of why this card is compelling — an explanation that we MIGHT QUOTE FROM if your nominee makes the finals (if you want to be anonymous, let us know). If you can’t offer an explanation, please rethink whether the card is a worthy contender (see rule #3, supra).

5. The deadline for submissions is three weeks from today: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, at 11:59 p.m. (New York time). No exceptions. If you’re reading this post after the deadline, then you don’t read Above the Law frequently enough.

# As If The Billable Hour Wasn't Hellish Enough, Get Ready For 'Billable Attention'
## Of course it can get worse.

The Law Society of England and Wales commissioned a report on [Neurotechnology, law and the legal profession](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/topics/research/how-will-brain-monitoring-technology-influence-the-practice-of-law). Neurotechnology is when a device interfaces with the nervous system and monitors and/or regulates neural activity. The paper’s author, University of Sydney’s Dr Allan McCay, spends a lot of time on scifi/Minority Report shit. Like what are the potential impacts on criminal justice if someone’s thoughts are being monitored, what are the human rights impacts of creating superheroes (enhanced individuals). But as a Biglaw observer, the line that really grabbed my attention was “billable hours vs ‘billable units of attention.’”

Say whaaaaa?

McCay prophesizes that the hellish reality of detailing your workday in six-minute intervals will give way to the hellish future of having a device monitor how much attention your brain is really paying to the work you’re doing before a client will pick up the tab:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Some lawyers might try to gain an advantage over competitors and try to stay ahead of increasingly capable AI systems by using neurotechnology to improve their workplace performance. Perhaps clients might provide pressure to do this, and one can imagine changes to billing that may be brought about by the attention-monitoring capacities of neurotechnologies. This might even prompt a move from billable hours to billable attention.

Well, let’s look at the bright side of this panopticon: if the chip tracks your “billable attention” units, at least your[ bonus won’t be docked](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/biglaw-firms-new-timekeeping-policy-may-screw-associates-out-of-bonuses/) for failing to enter your timesheets in a [timely manner](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/02/associate-bonus-watch-dechert-docks-associates-for-dilatory-billables/). SILVER LINING.

The report charts out how this dystopian timekeeping scenario could play out:

Perhaps the day might come when some clients prefer cognitively enhanced lawyers who only work on their matters when they are fully attentive. Whilst the legal profession currently has a variety of approaches to billing including forms that are responsive to the employment of technology in legal work, one metric that many lawyers will be familiar with (perhaps too familiar) is that of ‘billable hours’. In light of the development of attention-monitoring neurotechnologies, the billable hours metric might become too crude for some clients who might prefer to pay for ‘billable units of attention’. In this connection it is interesting to note that the practice of billing by the hour, which arose in the 1950s, was initially client driven, coming from inhouse legal departments. Maybe the inhouse legal departments of neurotech companies might one day drive the development of the billing innovation considered here. The shift to billable attention would involve the gathering of lawyers’ brain data, which could perhaps be reused for other purposes such as making inferences about things other than their states of attention. The mental privacy dimension of a firm’s brain-monitoring system seems unsettling to say the least and one may well see such billing practices as concerning for other reasons.

Of course, militating against this is that lawyers are stubborn luddites who cling to their established way of doing things. Seriously, clients have been pushing for alternative fee arrangements for forever. And while they’re increasingly common, the billable hour still has a chokehold on the industry. I just don’t see that changing any time soon.

I know, I know: It’s other people’s money. Who cares if you waste it?

You should.

Partners at Biglaw firms like to live high on the hog: Fly first class when you’re on the client’s dime, because it’s other people’s money. Fly first class when you’re on the firm’s dime, because you’re one of 500 partners, so it’s 99.998 percent other people’s money. And fly coach when you’re paying your own way, because do you look crazy?

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I’ve heard of a federal judge or two who liked to live high on the hog: “I know the government’s rules say that I’m required to fly coach. But I flew first class when I was in practice. And it’s much easier to do productive work if I’m in first class. And I fly an awful lot at the government’s insistence. I don’t think flying first class on government business is a high crime or misdemeanor, so I’m doing it.”

Corporate bigwigs like to live high on the hog: “I’ve worked hard to get to where I am today, and I’m not giving up any of the perks. I really don’t care what the corporate rules say; I drink good wine and I fly first class. That’s the price you pay for keeping me here.”

Not so fast, [Wilbur](http://www.shmoop.com/charlottes-web/wilbur.html). (Click through these links. I worked hard to entertain you today.)

Do you really think no one’s watching?

[Piglet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_%28Winnie-the-Pooh%29) is down at the end of the trough, and he sees you. He imitates you. And that costs you both your reputation and money.

It hurts your reputation because everyone sees that you’re a pig, and people talk about it, and they remember it. Eventually your swinish reputation may come back to bite you. If a client asked me, a litigator, to recommend one of my corporate partners to handle a project, am I really likely to recommend [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_%28Animal_Farm%29), who I know will spend the client’s money like a drunken sailor? Probably not. If I worked with you at our law firm and then went in-house, who am I more likely to retain — the person who spends the client’s money as though it were her own, or [Miss Piggy](http://poohadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Miss_Piggy)?

That’s one cost of piggishness, but it’s not the only cost.

Suppose all your associates know that you fly first class, hire fancy cars, and dine at the finest establishments when you’re on client business. Will you really be surprised when those associates follow your lead, driving up your client’s costs, forcing you to write down bills, and lowering your realization rate?

When one of your firm’s practices holds its annual meeting in Chicago (the costs of which will be borne by you and your partners), do you suppose your associates will opt for the 7 a.m. flight because the ticket is cheaper than the 10 a.m. flight? Don’t count on it: “[Old Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Major) would never get up early just to save a few bucks; why the heck should I?”

When those associates meet for dinner the night before the meeting starts, do you think they’ll go to a perfectly nice, but reasonably priced restaurant? I’m betting they’ll eat at the fanciest place in town — because it’s not their money, and you showed them how to spend it.

(Is it wrong to say that your associates are [having roast beef, and your competitors’ associates may be having none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Little_Piggy)?)

When some group at your corporation — the law department, or human resources, or a business unit — is traveling to an internal group meeting, are folks choosing between KLM and British Airways on the basis of price? Not if you’ve shown them do otherwise. Are they staying at a hotel that’s perfectly nice for the proletariat, when you’ve taught them to live like the bourgeoisie? They are not, and your department’s performance against budget will show the strain.

I’m not insisting that everyone live like paupers. Business travel is a pain in the neck, and there’s no need to make it even more punishing.

But there’s also no excuse for wasting money just because it’s not yours.

Be reasonable.

For reason’s own sake. And to avoid having some [big, bad wolf blow your house down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Little_Pigs).

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Makes Cuts Due To ‘Redundancy Issues’
## It seems that cost-cutting moves led to the layoffs.

Bonuses and raises may be trending among Biglaw firms, but news of layoffs is still sneaking in amid all the [fanfare concerning compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/biglaw-raise-bonus-tracker-2023/).

To that end, we’ve recently learned that Proskauer Rose — a firm that brought in $1,239,638,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 39 in the Am Law 100 — cut ties with more than 20 members of its business professionals staff back in August. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/12/18/proskauer-layoffs-underscore-string-of-big-law-cuts-in-2023/) has the details on the Biglaw firm’s layoffs.

Proskauer laid off 22 business professionals in August as part of a resolution of cost-cutting and redundancy issues, according to sources, noting that that’s about 3% of the firm’s business professional population. …

The law firm’s moves are consistent with a slew of large law firms making business professional cuts, often without any public announcement, as firms focused on efficiency, outsourcing and restructuring in the era of hybrid office arrangements.

# Former Kirkland & Ellis Summer Associate Files Pro Se Suit 
## There's a real defamation claim in there... and also a whole lot of random.

A former Kirkland & Ellis summer has filed a lawsuit pro se in the SDNY against “John Doe #1, a Reddit.com user, John Doe #2, A Top-Law-Schools.com user, John Doe #3 a current or former NYU Law student.” The plaintiff, Gideon Rapaport, alleges that the trio ran a systematic defamation campaign against him last year that saw him slagged on Reddit and TLS.

To the extent he thought filing a lawsuit would put a stop to the online ridicule, he was… [wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/15k7tjd/summer_at_ke_sues_prose/).

But the complaint does lay out a serious defamation claim:

6. On or about July 30, 2022, defendant Does 1 through 3 conspired to and did perpetrate a libelous internet hoax and character assassination against the Plaintiff accompanied by a word-of-mouth slander campaign. These posts were made on Reddit.com and Top-Law-Schools.com.

7. Defendants forged a document by affixing to it, without proper authorization or permission to so and outside of the scope of their employment, the name of their employer, Kirkland & Ellis LLP, which had employed Plaintiff at the same time as Defendants. This document was in the style of a “wanted” or “public enemy” poster as would be produced by law enforcement and consisted of the aforementioned name, a corporate headshot style photograph of the Plaintiff obtained from an internal website created by the employer to facilitate social interaction among employees, and the bolded and capitalized text “DO NOT ADMIT”.

According to the complaint, the defendants concocted a false sexual harassment allegation against this guy that ultimately required the Federalist Society’s James Kent Summer Academy — the organization’s camp to groom the next generation of goons — to call HR to figure out if the accusations were true.

They apparently weren’t.

A false claim of criminal activity blasted to a wide audience resulting in at least one demonstrated instance of a third party wondering if the claim was true is a perfectly colorable defamation claim.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
So that about wraps up this complaint and… wait, what’s this?

16. Although the anonymous internet posts centered on the false assertion that the Plaintiff was fired for sexual harassment and misconduct, the posts, digressed wildly into describing the purported personal opinions of the Plaintiff as to the correctness of judicial opinions published by the United States Supreme Court during the summer of 2022, his habit of dressing relatively formally in the workplace by wearing at least a two piece suit and a necktie every work day, his stylistic choices in menswear with a particular fixation on his occasional wearing of button suspenders, his rumored enthusiasm to participate in class discussions at law school, his extracurricular activities at law school, his general political views, his invitations as a formal escort in the debutante ball circuit of New York City, his acceptance into exclusive social circles and private social clubs in Manhattan, and baseless speculation about his family life and circumstances.

Oh no. Oh… honey, no.

It’s [increasingly hip](https://twitter.com/legalwritingpro/status/1677808178883379200?s=20) to draft complaints like briefs, throwing in all the persuasive flourishes that used to sit in reserve while the initial pleading remained a dry and perfunctory recitation of allegations. But that trend relies on the premise that laying out all the gory details might shame the defendant into a quick settlement.

This is where discretion is the better part of valor and you rest on the “false sexual misconduct” defamation claims and leave the “they mocked my button suspenders” claims out of it.

18. The focus of the anonymous internet posts on the personal opinions about the law and political views alleged to be held by Plaintiff also indicate an ideological or political motive for the attempt at character assassination, specifically revolving around the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization which Plaintiff was alleged to have celebrated.

It says a lot about the state of this Supreme Court that conservatives feel that being tied to a majority opinion constitutes defamation.

19. Although Plaintiff believed that Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was correctly decided, he did not celebrate it on or after June 24, 2022 in the workplace, as was incorrectly alleged and emphasized in the anonymous internet posts, for multiple reasons. Plaintiff already believed in the veracity of credible rumors he personally received in early February, 2022 that the opinion would turn out as it eventually did, and the widely reported leak of May 2, 2022 greatly supported that conclusion.

He knew back in February? Was Alito talking to him too?

It was also at this time that upon his reflection on the effective removal during the day prior of Paul Clement and Erin Murphy from the firm, the two partners who had successfully litigated the Bruen case, who were personally known to Plaintiff alongside some of the partners that orchestrated their effective removal, upon information and belief, in breach of contract and assurances made to Clement and Murphy upon their joining the firm that they would be free to litigate cases at the Supreme Court of the United States on a side that some may find controversial (presumably due to the necessity of having at least two sides to every case or controversy in the adversarial system, it would be almost impossible to litigate any matter without someone finding the position of one side controversial, if this principle were uniformly applied which Plaintiff does not believe that it was or is), Plaintiff decided that he would not want to continue his association with the firm after graduating law school.

Yes, [Paul Clement is a crybaby who doesn’t understand how the market works](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/paul-clement-laments-kirklands-cancel-culture-or-capitalism-as-the-case-may-be/). But how does this have anything to do with the claim that some internet trolls spread false sexual harassment claims?

FOCUS!

… Plaintiff suffered particular harm to his valued relationship with Professor Richard A. Epstein, of New York University and the University of Chicago… Plaintiff had first encountered the lectures and works of Professor Epstein in the field of law and economics on or about May, 2009 due to his childhood interest in economics. These lectures and works encouraged in Plaintiff an interest in law generally, the American system of government, Roman law and the common law of the 18th to late 19th centuries. It was at this time that Plaintiff set the personal goal of gaining admission to the University of Chicago Law School where Professor Epstein was tenured at the time. From that time until the present, Plaintiff has revered Professor Epstein above all other living academics or intellectuals due to his brilliant mind, extraordinary intellectual breadth, consistent commitment to first principles, comprehensive legal theory and kindness.

Or don’t.

At this juncture, we enter a lengthy diversion into Richard Epstein worship, the “brilliant mind [with] extraordinary intellectual breadth” who [publicly declared that only 500 Americans would die of COVID](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/remember-when-a-law-school-prof-said-only-500-americans-would-die-of-covid-whatever-happened-with-that/) and then kept doubling down on being wrong.

There’s seven pages of this! Seven pages charting how his relationship with the professor went from being a prized pupil to being cast out — which the plaintiff blames on a false Title IX complaint. By the time the complaint notes that “Plaintiff then told Professor Epstein that even if he will teach for many years to come he will not have another student like the Plaintiff, that because of his moral failure he does not deserve to have Plaintiff as a student,” the reader is left wondering if this is a pleading or an expensive, publicly filed pity party.

From a legal perspective, nothing would be lost if those seven pages became the single paragraph: “Richard Epstein had been helping me with fellowships and clerking opportunities and I professionally suffered when he stopped abruptly on account of the false allegation.”

Seriously, you had me at paragraph 15. This is why legal writers can’t go off on distracting tangents. It makes the pleading look like the actually coherent legal claim is of less interest to the plaintiff than tossing in personal insults about Ted Kennedy.

Which he also does in paragraph 46.

Again, if it’s true that folks invented and spread a sexual misconduct claim — going so far as to create false documents to support that fiction — and spread that story, then he’s got a defamation case. If all the rest of this is true… he’s going to Streisand Effect himself into a whole lot more non-defamatory online scorn.

# 'Fearsome Foursome' Is Exactly The Kind Of Name That Biglaw Attorneys Think Is Cool

Why do we have to inflate the egos of these people?

In lieu of a report that just identifies law firms that general counsel respect, [a new stab](https://www.bticonsulting.com/litigation-outlook-2020-highlights) at the same old ranking frames the question as the law firms that general counsel “fear” the most in litigation and then dubs the top tier of responses the “Fearsome Foursome” giving those nerds the sort of swagger that can only make them even more insufferable.

Certainly the four firms — Kirkland & Ellis; Latham & Watkins; Quinn Emanuel; and Skadden — are prestigious adversaries in any matter. But giving them this “fearsome” label seems like handing a bunch of paper pushers a leather jacket and letting them pretend they’re the Sons of Anarchy or something. It indulges the worst impulses of the legal profession to reward “fear” and incentivize people to act like unreasonable jerks in litigation. At least when labeled “most respected adversaries” firms aren’t encouraged to front.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
[From Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1199903/the-4-firms-that-scare-general-counsel-the-most):

“The things we heard about these law firms is that they have killer instinct. They go for the jugular,” Rynowecer said. “Not only do they understand complexity, but they relish complexity. And they all seem to hunt in packs. One client described them as endless teams of excellent people who all have the same killer instinct.”

Oh stop. This is the kind of talk that inspires a whole legion of TTT-trained potzers who mistake good lawyering with unethical harassment. This “killer instinct” begets a million baseless cease and desist letters from misguided fans. Don’t frame elite Biglaw firms as feral dogs — they’re highly competent professionals. They may want to think they’re badasses, but they’re bookworms with a talent for complex problem-solving not Tony Soprano.

And the worst thing about this whole story is that it worked. I’m now writing about this report because it’s tagline legitimately forced me to read it. This is why this profession can’t have nice things.

# Blowing Up The Legal Monopoly
## Arizona announces a bold experiment in law firm ownership and fee-sharing by nonattorneys.

Over the past few years, California, Utah, and other states have been quietly exploring allowing nonattorneys to provide limited legal services or share in attorneys’ fee arrangements. But while those states have been dipping their toes in the pool, Arizona just [shouted “cannonball” from the high dive](http://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/201/Press%20Releases/2020Releases/082720RulesAgenda.pdf). Starting January 1, 2021, Arizona regulations on who can provide legal services will be fundamentally reformed and opened up to nonlawyers. You can read the Arizona Supreme Court’s complete 91-page order and attachments [here](https://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/215/Documents/082720FOrderR-20-0034LPABS.pdf?ver=2020-08-27-153342-037).

As an Arizona-born and raised lawyer at a law firm founded back in our territory days, I’ve [long believed](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/dropping-a-bomb-on-the-legal-monopoly/) that, if done right, these kind of changes could spur innovation and provide wider access to the legal system. So, how did my home state do? Let’s take a look at the coming changes and their potential ramifications.

Same Bar, Infinitely Bigger Tent

Three major changes are coming down the pike for the Arizona legal industry. First, the state bar will begin certifying a new class of legal service provider called the Legal Paraprofessional. Requirements haven’t been set forth yet, but LPs will be certified in specific areas of the law and authorized to represent clients in certain matters before courts. The bar is characterizing the certification as akin to a nurse practitioner for law. Any certified LPs must pass a character and fitness review, and they will be subject to the same ethical rules and disciplinary procedures as a JD-holding attorney.

Second, the bar will also be charged with licensing a new class of entity, the Alternative Business Structure. An ABS is an organization providing legal services that is owned, operated, and/or managed by nonattorneys. ABS’s will again have to go through the bar to be certified, but they serve as a way for non-law-firm organizations to start offering legal services as part of their model.

Finally, the ethical rules barring fee-sharing with nonattorneys have been nuked outright. Firms no longer will need to engage in convoluted compensation agreements with their nonattorney managers and staff to allow them to share in the firm’s success.

Lawyers have held a professional monopoly for decades, with some justification, but monopolies lead to stagnation, decay, and inefficiency. It’s given us a legal system where the vast majority of the public can’t afford a lawyer when they need one. The time has long been right to try to correct that deficiency in access to justice.

A Peek Into The Crystal Ball

The potential ramifications from these changes are enormous, and if history is any guide, the biggest changes will likely come from an angle no one expects. Having laid out that caveat, here’s where I think the biggest changes will occur.

I initially thought these changes would lead to huge new competition on the more consumer-facing side of private law, but I’m not convinced many small or solo law firms will feel a huge increase in competition. Rather than compete for the customers who can already afford lawyers, I’d expect LPs and ABS’s to initially pursue the untapped hordes of people who’ve never been able to afford legal services. The companies that figure out how to service the clients the traditional legal profession has been missing out on for decades stand to make a mint, and their clients will be infinitely better off than they were before when they had no options on the table. If you want an example of what this could look like in practice, take a look at [my interview with DoNotPay.com’s CEO Josh Browder](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/the-dormroom-hacker-who-dropped-a-bomb-on-the-legal-industry/), who has developed the “world’s first robot lawyer” for consumers who have never been able to afford legal representation. Imagine a model like that with actual lawyers or perhaps LPs assisting consumers. It’s not difficult to imagine ABS’s utilizing a combination of technology and traditional lawyers to serve clients.

Likewise, I also don’t see there being a huge new competitive crush at the upper echelons of Biglaw. The major nonfirm players such as the Big Four accounting firms and the alternative legal service providers like Axiom have already been making advances on Biglaw’s turf. While lawyers like to point to the Big Four as the reason to fear changes like those in Arizona, most fail to note or understand that [Sarbanes-Oxley prohibits accounting firms from providing certain legal services to auditing clients](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/law_firms_competition_accounting/P1). So while the Big Four may try to make a play for their nonauditing clients, they will not have the ability to take wholesale chunks out of the legal market without doing the same type of marketing and business development as law firms. Yes, traditional law firms will have more competition, but it will be more of a level playing field than many expect.

While the fear of the Big Four may be overblown, one area that may be directly impacted by the rules is executive-level compensation. While traditional businesses can offer equity as an incentive to management recruits, law firms have historically been barred from doing that under the anti-fee-sharing rules. Firms have therefore been disadvantaged in efforts to attract a deep pool of nonattorney talent to their management ranks. With those rules vanishing at the start of 2021, Arizona-only firms suddenly have a new suite of incentives to offer the MBAs and CEOs they need to run the business side of their practices. Firms that invest wisely in management talent may find themselves well positioned in the coming years. Less clear at this point is what, if anything, firms with multistate presence can do on this or any other issue impacted by the rules.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
While those may be the first areas to see major change in light of these reforms, they won’t be the last. While LPs and ABS’s may start out experimenting on the edges of the current legal industry, as they mature, I fully expect them to begin eating into traditional law’s market share. 2021’s scrappy newcomers may end up 2030’s 500-pound gorillas.

A Bang Or A Whimper?

That said, maybe the excitement and trepidation over these rule changes is overstated on both sides. The UK deregulated its rules on law firm ownership over a decade ago, and the UK lawyers I’ve spoken about it to have responded that the change had less of an impact on the market than many thought.

James Knight, CEO of Keystone Law, a publicly traded law firm in the UK, [told me in an interview earlier this year](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2020/04/17/zooming-before-it-was-cool/) that “most law firms don’t need money for growth or to develop … if equity is sold off to investors then there’s less money to be shared amongst the partners.”

Similarly, John Croft, President of the UK-based ALSP Elevate, was also dismissive of the sky-is-falling crowd [when I spoke with him](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2020/03/06/peering-into-biglaws-crystal-ball/) several months ago. “A few years ago, all the headlines started saying ‘Look out, technology and AI are going to take your jobs.’ And that’s not the case … If you’re running an efficient business, this shouldn’t scare you at all.”

“If you’re not,” Croft continued, “maybe it should.”

Even if these changes do lead to a sea change in legal services, all is not lost for traditional lawyers by any stretch. This new challenge may be just the jump-start our industry needs to catch up to the larger business world.

We’ve long been the only game in town for legal services, and we believed we were the best ones to do the job. Time to put our money where our mouths are.

# Tips For In-House Counsel For Closing Out The Year
## As people slip away until the new year begins, take this time to square away 2023.

While this may depend on your company’s culture and size, the end of the year is usually always hectic. Even as I furiously try to close out projects and matters and clear through my to-do list and inbox, others are doing the same, which can add to (instead of take away from) my to-do list and inbox.

Regardless of the frenetic energy, here are a few things I try to do to close out the year so I can start fresh in January.

Constrain And Prioritize

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It is very tempting to try to do as much as you can before the year ends. But consider whether that’s the best or smartest use of the time left in 2023. As a natural list maker, I try to jot down all the things that I still have left to do — and then determine whether they absolutely have to be done by year’s end or whether they can wait until the new one. There are likely very few things that fit into this category. For me, reviewing pleadings or producing documents is a common example because these tasks have actual, hard deadlines.

The next level of prioritization — the “don’t have to but probably should” get done this year — is a bit harder to discern. Things that may fit here are likely specific asks or pet projects your leadership has tasked you with. It comes down to whether the deadline is arbitrary — and if not, what is reasonable.

Everything else can be pushed until 2024, and my strong suggestion is that you do so — especially if you are already on the verge of burning out. It can be tempting to knock off small tasks (even if they don’t have to be completed in 2023) to lessen your load in 2024 or for the dopamine kick. But if you can resist the siren’s call, your time may be better spent recharging or working on one of the tasks mentioned below. Pro tip here: if you will carry things over in 2024, consider whether you want to block off time during January to work on them, before others fill up your calendar with meetings.

This probably also depends upon your team and company culture, but I like to give my leadership and the clients I support at least a week or two of notice of when I will be out of the office for the holidays. I personally love how our team will share “out of office days” as a calendar invite (but be sure to mark it as free so you don’t inadvertently block off their calendar too). In my email to clients, I ask that if they need anything before end of year that they ask as soon as they can and clearly let me know the deadline.

Leverage The Out-of-Office Message
This is a tool that I use whenever I am out of the office. I craft an email that not only shares that I am out, when I will return, and if applicable, someone who can be reached during my absence, but I also include why I am out of the office, how to reach me, and under what circumstances to do so. For example, my current message is:

Hi!

I am currently out of the office on PTO and for the holidays and will not return until Tuesday, January 2nd.

During this time, I’m hoping to create a little magic for the littles and for myself — a lot of rest and restoration before 2024.

If you have something urgent that cannot wait until January 2nd, please give me a call on my cell (XXX-XXX-XXXX). I’ll have my ringer on, but may not check email or messages as often.

May you also find a little magic and restoration this season.

Happy Holidays!

I like to share why because I want to encourage rest and connection with loved ones. I also share why because I want to share what they will be interrupting such that I hope the sender will consider whether their reason to call me is important enough to do so.

Look, as attorneys, we are taught to prioritize client needs, and if something comes up that truly needs to be addressed urgently, I will rise to the occasion. But if it is not urgent, I am a better attorney when I am rested and connected to my family.

Tidy Up

This is not fun to most, but I love quiet, focused time to clean up my OneNote, my contacts in Outlook and files, both electronic and paper. I find that if I take the time to organize now, and purge what I don’t need, my life is easier in the future because I know where to find things when I need them and don’t have a lot of clutter in the way.

Update

If you aren’t swamped, this is an excellent time to spruce up your career information If you are going to take some time to reflect on what you’ve accomplished this year anyway, consider maximizing your reflection time by revising your resume, LinkedIn profile, and bio.

# Law Firm Leaders Are Completely Confident That They Don't Have Much Confidence
## Same story, different quarter.

Once again, the legal industry appears to be dominated by Eeyore. Every quarter there’s another market outlook survey, and every quarter law firm leaders express muted optimism. If they’re willing to admit the world is getting better, it’s getting better at a rate somewhere around 2 percent.

So it comes as absolutely no shock whatsoever that the latest Law Firm Leaders Confidence Index reveals that firms think things aren’t necessarily getting better and if they are, it’s going to be somewhere around 2 percent better.

How do they feel about the U.S. economy? Slightly worse than they did during the second half of 2017. How do they feel about the global economy? Slightly better than they did. What does that mean? Not much really. The majority of respondents thought both would be “the same.” Ho hum. At least zero respondents predict the climate to get “considerably worse.” That’s progress.

Despite this lack of enthusiasm for the market, most respondents think they’re personally going to see an upswing. Fully 70 percent of respondents predict an uptick in demand even though the last several years of data consistently paint a grim picture for demand. Headcount is likely to see an increase too, with 61 percent of respondents predicting an increase in associate FTE of greater than 1 percent. Still, forecasting a mere 1 to 3 percent bump in associate hiring is hardly a sign of unbridled confidence.

So we’ll slog on through this [year of blah](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/2018-looks-like-another-year-of-blah-for-the-legal-industry/).

“Who had Eminem on the first album? / Who had Kanye saying, ‘She a problem’? / Who came in the game, made her own column?”— [Nicki Minaj](https://genius.com/4534505)

Anusia Gillespie, founder and principal consultant of [Banava Consulting](http://banavaco.com/), recently wrote an article for Law360 titled [The Horrible Conflict Between Biology And Women Attorneys](https://www.law360.com/articles/871234/the-horrible-conflict-between-biology-and-women-attorneys). In her article, she cites the top two reasons why attorneys leave their law firms: (1) unsustainable billable hours and work/life considerations, and (2) a limiting culture.

Do you agree?

Gillespie was born and raised in Marblehead, a small town in the North Shore region outside Boston. It didn’t take very long for her to know that she wanted to be involved with the legal profession in some way, shape, or form. In third grade, she confidently declared, in a class project, that she was going to be a lawyer one day:



Gillespie had two powerful sources of inspiration. Her father didn’t attend law school until he was in his forties, and her aunt was the first woman to be promoted to partner at her firm.

Not to be outdone, Gillespie received her undergraduate degree from Tulane University’s A.B. Freeman School of Business in New Orleans, then went on to obtain her MBA and JD from Boston College. I recently had the opportunity to catch up with Gillespie. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

RC: You recently wrote a piece titled [The Horrible Conflict Between Biology And Women Attorneys](https://www.law360.com/articles/871234/the-horrible-conflict-between-biology-and-women-attorneys) — can you tell us more about this?

AG: As a woman attorney who has left a law firm, but is also deeply committed to the retention and advancement of women attorneys, I am often asked why women leave their firms. One significant reason is that women are “biologically encouraged” to have children at the same time that their careers command the biggest commitment of time and energy. A managing partner I discussed the issue with referred to it as a “horrible conflict.”

The article notes that this is not the end of the answer, however, because not all women want children, and many leave their firms before children are even a consideration. Other reasons fall under the umbrella of cultural headwinds, including (1) the well-documented old-boy networks that result in inferior deals and cases for women and less client exposure, and (2) the lack of a model for success that women attorneys can aspire to become.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
AG: As I embarked on my legal career, I assumed that the issues I watched my aunt navigate as she progressed in her career wouldn’t exist by the time I entered the legal profession. I was wrong in that assumption. Furthermore, it can take three to ten years for one company to implement a change effort. I realized it would take much longer for the profession.

I started a consulting firm to give attorneys more choice and voice in their careers on the individual level, while the profession works to implement change. I have developed a niche in working with women attorneys to build business as a way to become more valuable to the firm and combat the cultural headwinds to their advancement.

RC: Could you tell us about your firm’s Wellspring Process?

AG: I created the Wellspring Process as a framework to use in building a marketing and branding strategy for professional services providers. The framework draws on leadership, communication, and sales concepts, while infusing emotional intelligence principles to create an authentic marketing strategy that sets an attorney apart as a leader and generates buy-in and loyalty.

The process consists of four phases: Reflect, Research, Strategize, Arrive. As a grand example, an immigration attorney who:

- {Reflect} is continuously inspired by an aunt who started the first schools for girls in certain Afghan villages, and values supporting women as well as health and wellness;
- {Research} discovered she has an aligned target market with late-stage startups;
- {Strategize} enjoys creating events, which is an effective recognition strategy for her target market given that startups value perks,
- {Arrive} arrived in the market with “Vino & Vinyasa” on a Boston roof deck, inviting women in startups and non-competing attorneys for referral sources, and delivered a well-rehearsed and coached speech about the reasons for her immigration practice, support of women, inspiration from her aunt (who also attended the event), and proud participation in a firm with 42% female equity partnership.
Vino & Vinyasa is now an annual event.

RC: You practiced as a commercial real estate finance attorney for a while. What is your favorite aspect of being a lawyer?

AG: I did, and I do still practice as a pro bono attorney for the Women’s Bar Foundation. “Being” a lawyer encompasses a lot – education, practice, and standing. My favorite part about each aspect, in turn:

- I have the ability to research and find the answer to most legal and professional issues. And, I know when I don’t know.
- Practice. As an associate in a respected law firm, I had the opportunity to watch the minds of really smart people work. I also enjoyed tearing my hair out at the challenge of drafting my first construction loan agreement.
- As a barred lawyer, I have the privilege of being a member of the legal profession, which allows for a stronger voice in helping to improve it.
RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

AG:  Most people go to law school because they want to help clients. I realize now that I went to law school because I want to help lawyers. During the beginning stages in my consulting practice, when I experienced inevitable doubts, I looked out into Boston. I imagined all of the attorneys who were alone in their offices working the days (and nights) away. Thousands of them.

I created a motto that I still repeat to myself, “I’m going to help thousands of lawyers, they just don’t know it yet.” I still hold faith in that, and believe it to be true. What I’d like to share is, for any attorney experiencing doubts: find a guidepost, hold onto it, be active in effectuating it, be open to what form it may take, work hard, and trust the process.

RC: On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Anusia Gillespie for sharing her story with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

# Associates Should Be Careful When Badmouthing Partners
## Partners usually do not take kindly to being badmouthed, and this might have serious consequences on an associate’s career.

It is almost inevitable in a workplace that subordinates will complain about their jobs and possibly badmouth management. At pretty much every law firm I worked at before starting my own practice, associates routinely badmouthed partners about all types of issues, from unfairness in compensation to how each partner managed workflow. Usually, associates would badmouth partners in hushed tones in an office or common area, and sometimes associates would use messaging apps to badmouth superiors. However, associates need to be very careful when badmouthing partners, since partners usually do not take kindly to discovering the badmouthing, and this might have serious consequences on an associate’s career.

Associates need to be particularly careful when badmouthing partners to other associates while in an office. Law firm offices often have thin walls, and even if people are conversing normally, it is possible that people can hear associates from an office next door or out in a hallway. Indeed, I have frequently sat in offices at law firms and been able to hear conversations perfectly in the offices next door. At one firm, I sat next to a high-ranking partner, and this was useful in obtaining important gossip about what was going on in that office.

Even more dangerous is when associates decide to badmouth partners in the common areas of a law firm. At some of the law firms at which I’ve worked, associates would frequently complain about a law firm and management in the pantry areas where people would typically eat their lunches. However, these areas were easy to access, and partners would frequently come in and out of these spaces. Sometimes, people would need to stop talking or change the subject quickly when a partner approached so that the partners could not hear about complaints that were being conveyed.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A handful of times, associates badmouthed partners in office elevators, which is a risky proposition. People get on and off elevators all the time, and when a law firm has multiple floors in a building, it is possible for partners to enter elevators right when associates are complaining about firm management. One time, I heard a story about a partner who overheard an associate complaining about him on an elevator. Apparently, the associate was terminated as a result of this conduct.  Elevators are definitely not a safe space to badmouth law firm management.

Associates might think that it is safer to badmouth partners through messaging apps, and this might be the case. At some firms at which I have worked, many associates also exchanged emails containing disparaging comments about some of the partners at the shop. However, law firms may have the ability to check what is being sent through law firm email accounts, or such emails may be inadvertently seen by partners for any number of reasons. Moreover, many law firms have tracking software on law firm equipment, so associates who use messaging apps on law firm computers or phones may also have their messages revealed to partners.

Even if associates are using their own personal devices to badmouth partners, it is possible that such messages can be seen by management. Many law firms require associates to install software on their personal phones so associates can access law firm email accounts on their phones, and law firms can delete law firm data from phones after an associate is terminated. I am not entirely sure what such apps are capable of, but I would not be surprised if such apps gave law firm management the ability to track associates’ more personal data.

I guess the safest thing to do to keep partners from overhearing disparaging comments is not to badmouth partners. However, disparaging management is a normal part of many workplaces, and badmouthing partners can often build rapport among associates. Moreover, as detailed on the pages of this website, many partners deserve criticism. However, associates can take a few steps to badmouth partners more safely and help insulate themselves from negative consequences. Ideally, all badmouthing should occur in person and outside of a law firm office. Happy hours after work in areas distant from a law firm office are usually the best venue to badmouth partners, and it is always good for workers to meet up and bond outside of a work environment anyways. If associates really want to badmouth partners through messaging apps, they should use apps that are secure and preferably delete the messages after a time. Moreover, associates should use devices on which no law firm monitoring applications have been installed.

In any case, badmouthing partners by associates is inevitable, and in some instances, this can actually be useful to associates and law firms. However, associates should take a few steps to ensure that they are able to voice criticism of their bosses without partners being able to witness their badmouthing.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
President-Elect Donald Trump held his first press conference today since proving that America is a terrible country. Arguably it was to explain how he would extricate himself from his complicated business holdings. It wasn’t to deny rumors that he likes golden showers from Russian prostitutes (although he kind of did that), or praise Russia for hacking into the DNC (although he kind of did that), or suggest that the intelligence community was leaking classified information to embarrass him (although he actually did that), or to distract the media from the ongoing confirmation hearings of what is likely to be the most corrupt cabinet in American history (although that was in fact the whole point).

On the issues involving his companies and how he’d manage them while also being the leader of white America, Trump didn’t even speak for himself. Instead, he trotted out Morgan Lewis partner Sheri Dillon — behind a mountain of manila folders we learned were “parts of companies” he was letting his sons run — to do that heavy lifting.

Dillon didn’t take any questions.

If you are surprised that the Putin/Trump transition team tapped Morgan Lewis for this important work, maybe this little fact nugget will tie the room together:

Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP just scooped up the Russia Law Firm of the Year award [#ChamEuroAwards](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChamEuroAwards?src=hash) [@MorganLewisLaw](https://twitter.com/MorganLewisLaw)

— Chambers & Partners (@ChambersGuides) [April 22, 2016](https://twitter.com/ChambersGuides/status/723620084888010752)

After telling the media that conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the President and Vice President, Dillon eventually got around to “emoluments,” and made the entirely banal statement that the Founders who put the Emoluments Clause into the Constitution did not think “paying your hotel bill” was an emolument. I can only assume that this was a response to the criticism that foreign dignitaries with business before the government shouldn’t be staying in Trump hotels.

You see the sleight of hand that Dillon and MLB are confident Trumpkins are too stupid to notice? The issue is not the bill payment, it’s that Trump profits when foreigners with business before the government stay at Trump properties.

But Dillon went from “bill payment” to the larger point that the benefits the Trump brand receives because of Trump-President’s wishes are not emoluments to Trump-Donald, in the Constitutional sense of the word. And on that… she might be right. Or at least, she might be not-wrong.

Look, what Trump is doing might be the very definition of corrupt, but that doesn’t mean it’s unconstitutional. More than anything he’s done, Trump is a walking case study in the difference between “laws” and “norms.” The Constitution is a short, incomplete document that is silent about a lot of things. Here’s the actual Emoluments Clause, from Article I of the U.S. Constitution. Note how useless it is:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.

So the President of the United States cannot also be named the King of all England. Unless Paul Ryan agrees. Got it.

The mention of emoluments in Article 2 gets a little closer to the point:

The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.

And just to round out the discussion, here’s Alexander Hamilton explaining what that means [in Federalist 73](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/a2_1_7s3.html):

The third ingredient towards constituting the vigor of the executive authority is an adequate provision for its support. It is evident that without proper attention to this article, the separation of the executive from the legislative department would be merely nominal and nugatory. The Legislature, with a discretionary power over the salary and emoluments of the Chief Magistrate, could render him as obsequious to their will, as they might think proper to make him. They might in most cases either reduce him by famine, or tempt him by largesses, to surrender at discretion his judgment to their inclinations. These expressions taken in all the latitude of the terms would no doubt convey more than is intended. There are men who could neither be distressed nor won into a sacrifice of their duty; but this stern virtue is the growth of few soils: And in the main it will be found, that a power over a man’s support is a power over his will…

The Legislature on the appointment of a President is once for all to declare what shall be the compensation for his services during the time for which he shall have been elected. This done, they will have no power to alter it either by increase or diminution, till a new period of service by a new election commences. They can neither weaken his fortitude by operating upon his necessities; nor corrupt his integrity, by appealing to his avarice. Neither the Union nor any of its members will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at liberty to receive any other emolument, than that which may have been determined by the first act. He can of course have no pecuniary inducement to renounce or desert the independence intended for him by the Constitution.

“Power over a man’s support is a power over his will.” This is the issue the Emoluments Clause is meant to address. But “support” is simply not well defined by in the Constitution. “Salary,” okay, we know what that is. “Fee,” that’s a little more complicated, but still a fundamentally knowable standard. “Profit,” now we are fully in a gray area the Founders, in their wisdom, did not see fit to fully flesh out.

Can you give the president a slave? The Constitution doesn’t say. Can you bum the president a smoke? Can Congress? Can Russia? If I’m ever President, the person who slips me a cigarette without telling my wife will have a “power over my will.” The NCAA has more clear and more strict rules about what emoluments the third-string quarterback can receive than the Constitution does regarding the President.

The Emoluments Clause hasn’t been tested, because, up until now, presidents have understood that the appearance of improper benefits is more damaging than any legal proceeding over them. Think about Richard Nixon and [the Checkers speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers_speech). Then-Senator Nixon had been accused of setting up an improper fund to reimburse him for political expenses. The dog, “Checkers,” was one of those improper emoluments. Nixon dodged and weaved around the issue, then triumphantly declared he wasn’t giving the dog back, and saved his career. For all of Nixon’s obvious and terrible scandals, emoluments were not something he ever got near again. Even Nixon understood that the appearance of financial corruption was a deal breaker with the American people.

That norm does not apply to Donald Trump, because his supporters simply DGAF. They. Do. Not. Care. They don’t care if he uses the presidency to make himself rich, they don’t care if he’s being blackmailed by Russian oligarchs. As long as Trump makes them money or keeps brown people from making money, Trump supporters and the Republican Party don’t give two s**ts.

Anti-Trump forces have to stop acting like the Constitution is going to save them. They have to stop acting like “the law” is going to stop this man. Trump, like Mitch McConnell before him, knows what the Constitution says, and knows what it doesn’t say. And they’re entirely comfortable living and legislating in the gaps. There will always be a [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/) or a [Kasowitz Benson](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/donald-trump-chooses-biglaw-firm-to-fight-new-york-times-over-publication-of-tax-documents/) or a Morgan Lewis willing to debase themselves and provide whatever fig leaf of legal cover is required. And there is no will on the part of Congressional Republicans [to impeach](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/impeachment-primer-spoiler-congress-is-full-of-cowards/) this man anyway.

Trump is unconcerned with honor. He just wants to win, and “winning” for him involves making more money for himself. The “spirit of” the law means nothing to him. He’s already covered in filth; if you are going to fight him, you have to get dirty as well.

What are you prepared to do?

# Biglaw Firms Scared Of Losing Associates Are Making Them Partner
## It's a lot tougher to shed those golden handcuffs.

We have a bona fide Biglaw trend — more folks are getting their hands on the brass ring of the legal world, partnership.

The dominant story of 2021 in Biglaw, has been the [hot lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/). That pressure has led to [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) and [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2021-associate-salary-increase/), and retention bonuses on top of all that other money — if [you’re lucky enough to work in a super valuable practice area](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/), plus [signing bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/) and [referral bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-firms-in-search-of-attorney-talent-are-now-offering-up-referral-bonuses/). Basically there is all the money available for the right talent. And that talent crunch means more people got promotions this year.

Let’s [look at the facts](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/some-law-firms-are-promoting-record-numbers-of-associates-to-partnership), y’all.

• Latham & Watkins set a record with 44 lawyers making partner, up from 33.

• White & Case promoted 59 lawyers to partner — a record.

• Polsinelli also set a record, making 34 new shareholders.

• Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher promoted its “most diverse class ever,” as 27 lawyers made partner.

• Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld had “the firm’s largest partner promotions class in nearly two decades,” promoting 18 lawyers to partner.

Lisa Smith, a law firm consultant with Fairfax Associates, [told Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firms-tout-bumper-crops-new-partners-amid-talent-war-2021-11-11/), “Where they might have pushed somebody off for a year or two in previous years, that’s not happening as much.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Well, yeah. In previous years, there wasn’t[ nearly the demand](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/biglaws-throwing-around-500000-signing-bonuses-in-red-hot-lateral-market/) for experienced attorneys. So, to keep the talent they have, firms are finding they have to promote more folks. Because there are plenty of other firms out there that will be willing to do just that to get their hands on valuable laterals.

Congratulations to all those who made partner… now keeping associates at the firm is your problem.

# MoFo Hit With $100 Million Pregnancy Discrimination Lawsuit
## The complaint alleges a 'good old boys' club' at MoFo.

Biglaw giant Morrison & Foerster has been hit with an employment lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California. It’s styled as a putative $100 million class action, and alleges the firm discriminates against women who avail themselves of the firm’s “family friendly” policies by delaying their pay and advancement opportunities. This probably sounds very familiar to [other women in Biglaw.](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/pregnant-in-biglaw-heres-the-bad-news/?rf=1)

Three plaintiffs, all under Jane Doe designations, allege they took maternity leave but their careers stalled when they returned. The women say they were denied the same promotions and increases in compensation as their peers, and even though they didn’t get the benefits of a promotion, clients paid for their time as if they had been promoted. Yes, that’s right — the complaint alleges that despite being held back in their annual review cycles, their billing rates increased anyway. If you’re a MoFo client reading this, it can’t feel good.

The plaintiffs are represented by Sanford Heisler Sharp, the firm that seems to be [making a nam](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/sanford-heisler-llp/)e for themselves suing Biglaw firms over gender discrimination. A representative [had this to say](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sanford-heisler-sharp-files-100-million-gender-pregnancy-and-maternity-discrimination-lawsuit-against-am-law-giant-morrison--foerster-300639108.html) about the culture at MoFo:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“MoFo’s employment practices perpetuate the ‘good old boys’ club’ culture that has dominated law firms for decades,” said Deborah K. Marcuse, Managing Partner of Sanford Heisler Sharp’s Baltimore office.  “MoFo’s standard operating procedure of delaying the advancement of women who have taken pregnancy leave holds women back and promotes damaging stereotypes of women in the legal profession.”

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/lifesciences/articles/1038559/breaking-mofo-slapped-with-100m-pregnancy-bias-suit) Law360, the complaint also alleges the firm is aware of the impact their practices have on women at the firm:

“When a female attorney at MoFo is pregnant, has children, or takes maternity leave, the firm’s standard operating procedure is to hold her back from advancement with her peers, denying her opportunities for greater pay and limiting her progression,” the complaint said. “MoFo has long been aware of these problems but has failed to take remedial measures to prevent or correct them.”

The complaint alleges one of the plaintiffs was warned against taking leave when a partner told her “parents tend not to do well in this group.” [According to the complaint](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sanford-heisler-sharp-files-100-million-gender-pregnancy-and-maternity-discrimination-lawsuit-against-am-law-giant-morrison--foerster-300639108.html) when she got back from maternity leave she was told she needed to “ramp up” and actually bill in excess of the 1,950 billable hour requirement. But don’t worry, she also alleges she wasn’t given the assignments necessary to bill those hours.

Another plaintiff alleges a partner presumed she was no longer committed to her job, just because she was a new mother. The unnamed partner allegedly told her she had to “work really hard to prove [she was] committed and to get the best, most interesting work.”

Needless to say, we’ll be following the suit with interest.

# Amal Clooney's #MeToo Moment -- Will Biglaw Face Its Own Sexual Harassment Reckoning?

As the #metoo has only increased in its virality over the last week, one thing is for certain: no industry is above reproach. Stories from cis women, trans women, trans men, and non-binary folks recognizing the bizarre bond of all being on the receiving end of sexual harassment or assault have been passed around the internet, revealing this sort of abuse is only too common.

Now comes a report that one of the most famous lawyers in the world, human rights attorney Amal Clooney, has had the same experience. George Clooney [spoke to Entertainment Tonight](http://www.etonline.com/george-clooney-talks-positives-weinstein-aftermath-says-amal-has-faced-similar-situations-exclusive) about his wife’s own issues with sexual harassment at law firms:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“She’s faced those exact kinds of situations in law,” he said. “It’s everywhere and so it needs to be addressed as if it’s a problem for all of us. And we have to take it on full force because the kind of assault that we’re talking about now is … it’s so infuriating that this was allowed to go on as long as it did.”

It’s just more evidence that the legal profession is not immune from sexual harassment. It’s not about what you’ve done or what you wear, and [wrapping yourself in an elite law degree](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/metoo-no-a-law-degree-doesnt-insulate-you-from-sexual-harassment/) won’t stop the problem. It is a deeper, societal issue and a hashtag can only scratch the surface.

Vivia Chen at the [Careerist](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/20/ready-for-big-laws-metoo-moment/) doesn’t think that Biglaw will have its own “come to Jesus” moment. She argues that since Hollywood sells sex, there’s a difference in degree between the harassment experienced in the two industries:

Unlike Hollywood, the legal profession is not in the business of selling sex. The nice thing about law is that it’s a hopelessly nerdy profession. What counts in landing a job in Big Law—for a man or woman—are academic creds, not sex appeal. I’ll bet that even Angelina Jolie wouldn’t get a callback at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher unless she went to a T-14 law school and earned top grades. (Gibson is notoriously grade-obsessed.)

Angelina Jolie might not get a Biglaw callback without the grades, but once she gets the callback, she is sure as shit getting an offer.

There are obviously differences between a Biglaw firm and Hollywood, but academic creds don’t stop abusers. Look at what we are hearing about Clooney’s experiences. Or just ask Elizabeth Warren, who recently [detailed her own](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/elizabeth-warren-says-she-was-sexually-harassed-as-a-young-law-professor/?rf=1) #metoo moment as a young professor. If there’s something nerdier than Biglaw, it’s legal academia, and yet Warren still found herself being chased around a colleague’s office.

Chen also argues that Biglaw doesn’t see the worst of sexual abuse (though she rightfully acknowledges sex discrimination is widespread in the industry) because the power dynamic isn’t as severe between a partner and an associate:

And as intimidating as some partners might be, they don’t wield power over underlings as do movie fat cats who can instantly make or break careers. I can’t imagine that a young associate will feel she’ll be forever shut out of Big Law unless she submits to a powerful partner’s proposition. Sure, there’s a huge gender gap in power and position in law firms, but women with law degrees, generally speaking, have much more power than aspiring starlets.

First of all, there are more than just associates under the purview of a partner. Paralegals, administrative workers and secretaries can all find themselves vulnerable to a lecherous person in a position of power. And though power in a Biglaw firm can be more diffuse among a variety of seemingly equal partners than at movie studio, plenty of partners run their books of business as little fiefdoms, with almost no direct accountability to the partnership. Except for their [billable hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/could-the-worst-part-about-biglaw-life-actually-change/).

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Maybe a young associate says no, but then finds themselves getting less work from that partner. Perhaps it doesn’t even feel like retaliation, but an avoidance of an awkward situation. Of course a male associate still has the opportunity to work for the partner. It seems like she’s avoided a bad situation all the way around… until the end of the year, when that dip in billable hours is reflected in her bonus check.

Power works in lots of dynamic, complex ways. It isn’t an exact replication of the situation that makes #metoo viral, but seeing the similarities, not the differences, in all our stories. It may be true that no summer associate interview is being done with a partner in a bathrobe, but it still touches a nerve with a lot of women in Biglaw. And we [hear the stories](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/?rf=1) to back it up.

While no lawyers have yet been named as serial abusers anywhere near the level of Harvey Weinstein, it’s wishful thinking to assert there aren’t any lurking in Biglaw’s closet.

# 25 Things All Young Lawyers Should Know In Order To Not Screw Up Their Legal Careers

Ed. note: A version of this post from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors was originally published on February 20, 2014. Since this article was last published, those who were undergrads have begun law school, former 2Ls and 3Ls have entered the Biglaw fray, and those who were first-year associates are now setting their sights on partnership opportunities. Because of the positive feedback the article received, we’ve decided to share these tips with a whole new generation of aspiring and practicing attorneys.

[Abby Gordon](http://www.laterallink.com/about/team/113) is a Director with Lateral Link’s New York office. Abby works with attorney candidates on law firm and in-house searches, primarily in New York, Boston, and Europe. Prior to joining Lateral Link, Abby spent seven years as a corporate associate with [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cleary-gottlieb/), focusing on capital markets transactions for Latin American clients in New York and for the last five years for European clients in Paris. A native of Boston, Abby holds a J.D., cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center and a B.A. in government and romance languages, magna cum laude, from Dartmouth College. Abby also worked with the International Rescue Committee as a Fulbright Scholar in Madrid, Spain. She is a member of the New York Bar and is fluent in French and Spanish (and dabbles in Portuguese and Italian).

I was a paralegal before law school. I took four years between undergrad and law school, so I knew a herd of practicing lawyers when I was still applying to law school. I thought I had a leg up on everyone; I thought I had it all figured out. But in hindsight, I realize that there was a lot I did not know — not in law school and not as I made my way through seven years as an associate with a top international law firm.

Now as a legal recruiter, I see associates making the same mistakes over and over. I wish law schools would do a better job of preparing students for the practicalities of the legal industry and not just teach the substance of the law. But until they do, here is my list of key points to understand and mistakes to avoid…


Law School & Gearing Up for Practice

1. For the law students out there, first-year grades are what matter for securing a summer associate position that will hopefully lead to a more permanent associate position. But for anyone who may look to lateral to another firm or go in-house eventually (and that is most of you!), second- and third-year law school grades do count. This is especially true for litigators in today’s market. Firms and most companies will ask for your law school transcript when you apply as a lateral attorney. They even on occasion ask for grades from partner candidates. Grades have a tendency to follow you around, so finish strong.

2. Check out bar requirements in advance for any state you might want to waive into eventually. New York, for example, requires that you take the multistate portion of the bar exam at the same time as the essay portion. That means you cannot decide six months later to take only the essay portion — you will have to retake the multistate as well.

3. If you want to become a litigator, strongly consider doing a federal clerkship. This is especially important if you may want to work in a litigation boutique one day (though, of course, you can opt to do a clerkship as a break in your law firm career and not necessarily before starting). If you are a corporate associate, no one cares if you have done a clerkship.

Picking Your Law Firm

4. Law firm prestige does matter. It is certainly not the only consideration, but to lateral to another firm or move to a company, it is very important. You may get much better hands-on experience and training at a smaller firm, but prospective employers usually do not see it this way.

5. Pick practice area wisely, based on your personality:

- You have to like what you do! Do you enjoy the substance of the work in that field of law?
- Keep in mind lifestyle factors when picking your practice area. Some areas have a steadier and more predictable flow of work whereas others have a very unpredictable workflow.
- Certain practice areas attract certain personalities more than others. You may not want to go into litigation, for example, if you do not deal well with aggressive personalities.
6. …Based on your academic background: Be sure you have the right background to progress in your practice area. If you have no finance or accounting background or aptitude, corporate work may not be your best option. If you do not have a hard sciences/engineering/computer science background (preferably an advanced degree), think twice about doing science-related intellectual property work.

7. …Based on geographic factors: Do U.S. lawyers do this sort of work where I want to live? For example, if you want to move to a smaller city one day, do not go into finance. On the other hand, if you want to work overseas one day, strongly consider capital markets over other practice areas.

8. …Based on market considerations: Understand the current market and think about where you see the economy heading. I would hesitate to pick a specialty that is too niche or too dependent on market conditions.

9. …Based on your future goals: Some practice areas lend themselves better to going in-house one day, to going into the government, to setting up shop as a solo practitioner, or to working out a part-time arrangement one day. To the extent you know where you want to end up five, 10, or 15 years down the road, pick carefully today. It is extremely difficult to switch practice areas once you start.

10. Understand the various structures of law firms. It may not be a crucial factor for young associates, but you should at least be aware of the differences and the pros and cons of each. For example, lockstep firms may foster more cooperation and less competition among partners but tend to have more institutional clients and may not encourage the more junior associates to learn client development skills. If you enjoy the business side of being part of a law firm and you think you will have an aptitude for client development, you may want to consider a firm with a two-tier partnership track (income partners and equity partners), where you may have a better shot at proving your worth as a business-building partner.

# Risks Of Hiding Your CLO From The CEO
## Rather than dismissing legal issues as bothersome, companies need CLOs who make legal an integral part of the leadership team.

Does this sound familiar? A chief legal officer reported directly to a company’s CFO because the CEO didn’t want to be “bothered” with legal matters.

“The CEO refused to get to know me,” my CLO friend told me. “He left me out of key meetings, didn’t cc me on emails, then ignored my advice, saying I hadn’t considered all the facts. We had zero rapport, and I got so frustrated seeing all my hard work so easily dismissed.” 

The CEO eventually decided the company no longer needed in-house counsel — yet another mistake, in my opinion, by a CEO who hadn’t understood the value of a modern lawyer from the start.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Most CLOs Report To The CEO

The above dynamic is only one of several risks CLOs and GCs face when directed to report to the CFO instead of the CEO or a larger executive team. Other potential issues include: 

- A conflict of interest if the CFO makes decisions that are sound financially but not ethically.
- A lack of transparency when concerns aren’t discussed with other executive team members.
- A lack of accountability for CFOs not held responsible for any legal issues that arise.
- A lack of trust between the legal department and other executives leads others to avoid consulting counsel on issues affecting the company.
I will add the caveat that a CLO or GC can successfully report to the CFO under the right circumstances. But as most CLOs report directly to the CEO ([77% globally; 81% in the U.S.](https://accounsel.realmagnet.land/fy-2023-clo-survey)), this situation seems rare.

The CLO Is An Advocate For The Company’s Legal Interests

CLOs who report directly to the CEO or who are an equal part of a communicative and engaged executive leadership team are part of ongoing discussions. This puts the CLO in the position to pick up on potential legal risks that others don’t have the expertise to recognize. 

As regular listeners in the larger conversational loop, CLOs consider input from all relevant stakeholders to become better informed about decisions that impact the company. This is a strategic tactic for creating an overall more inclusive culture and an approach that leads to more accountability for executive leaders. 

CLOs can leverage their expertise in areas such as contract law, corporate governance, and data privacy to provide in-depth legal insights no other executive can offer. A CLO who communicates often and with more people can spot potential opportunities that aren’t immediately apparent to others. CLOs can combine legal savvy with a broader business perspective to help companies: 

- Act following applicable laws and regulations
- Avoid potential legal issues by addressing them in advance
- Ensure actions and decisions follow the company’s code of ethics

# Biglaw Firms Are Really Missing The Mark On Parental Leave For Dads

There is a lot of pressure around gender parity, but while some firms are announcing gender neutral policies, the others are keeping quiet. It’s important for firms to pay attention to gender neutral policies to retain and support their top talent.

— Summer Eberhard, a managing director in MLA’s associate practice group and co-author of a [new survey on paid parental leave at large law firms](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/law-firms-botch-parental-leave-for-men-families-survey-says), commenting on the fact that 23% of firms offer 14 to 20 weeks of paid paternity leave, while 43% of firms offer the same amount of time for maternity leave. “It’s a soft benefit, but parental leave has a very direct effect on how people view their firms. It’s a driver for associates,” said Kate Reder Sheikh, a managing director of the MLA’s associate practice group and the other co-author of the study. “And there are significant strides that still need to be made.”

# In Favor Of Argumentative Questions Presented

Many court rules, both trial and appellate, require parties to set out the “questions presented” in a brief.

And most lawyer flub this opportunity.

Even relatively well-respected lawyers will present a question that begins with the word “whether,” wanders on for seven or eight single-spaced lines, and ends with a period.

The judge looks at the question presented, reads it, and immediately thinks, “Should I read that run-on sentence again, to try to understand it, or should I not care what it said and just continue reading the brief?”

We’ll give those types of questions an “F” for advocacy.

Similarly, some relatively well-respected lawyers write utterly generic questions presented: “Should defendant’s motion to dismiss counts one through three of the complaint be granted?”

The judge looks at the question presented, reads it, and immediately thinks, “Maybe yes; maybe no. We’ll see.”

The advocate has at least successfully communicated with the reader. We’ll grade those questions a “D” for advocacy.

Good questions presented do not cause judges to scratch their heads about what’s being communicated and do not leave judges in doubt about the appropriate outcome. Instead, good questions leave the judge saying to herself: “This party is absolutely right! It’s clear that I should grant this motion.”

We’ll grade those questions “A” for advocacy.

Let me give three examples, all based generally on real life but fictionalized to protect both the innocent and the privilege.

Here’s a good question presented:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[Darnay](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/6995714176444266387) was injured in a car crash on May 1, 2019. The applicable two-year statute of limitations thus expired on April 30, 2021. But Darnay did not file his complaint until August 15, 2021. Is this action time-barred?

The reader can have only one reaction to that question: “Hell yes!”

That’s advocacy.

Here’s a question presented in a draft brief by a lawyer who doesn’t care about repeat business:

Where defendant/insurance broker proffers uncontested evidence demonstrating a break in the causal chain between its alleged wrongful conduct in connection with the procurement of an insurance policy for plaintiffs and the loss asserted by plaintiffs due to the denial of a claim for coverage under the procured policy, should summary judgment have been granted dismissing plaintiffs’ claims against defendant/insurance broker for lack of proximate cause, a required element of the claims asserted against defendant/insurance broker?

Here’s the revised question presented after in-house counsel edited the brief:

An insurance broker presented uncontested evidence showing that the insurer denied coverage of the policyholder’s claim for several reasons, including a reason unrelated to any alleged error in placing the policy. Does this lack of proximate cause require granting summary judgment dismissing the policyholder’s claims against the broker?

Finally, here’s an utterly generic question presented, which convinces nobody:

Should this court grant defendant’s motion to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff lacks standing to maintain this action?

Here’s the same question, but no longer generic:

[Jarndyce](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/6995714176444266387) is a participant in a fully funded defined-benefit retirement plan.  Jarndyce will thus receive precisely the same retirement benefits no matter how the plan’s investment options perform. Should this court grant BigCo’s motion to dismiss on the ground that Jarndyce lacks standing to challenge the performance of the retirement plan?

See? Adding a little detail makes a world of difference.

Every word you write in a brief is an opportunity to persuade. Don’t overlook those opportunities, even if they’re hidden in the required format of the brief.

# Biglaw Firm Hit With $100 Million Class Action Gender Discrimination Lawsuit
## This Biglaw firm is allegedly ""operating in the dark ages when it comes to gender equality.""

Three makes [a trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-male-dominated-culture/). We now have three (3!) female Biglaw partners willing to take their firms to court over gender bias. My hat’s off to you all.

Law.com [reports](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/31/chadbourne-hit-with-100m-gender-bias-suit/) that a Chadbourne & Parke litigation partner, [Kerrie Campbell](http://www.chadbourne.com/kcampbell), has filed a $100 million class action lawsuit against the firm on behalf of current and former female partners, alleging gender discrimination:

The suit alleges that female partners have been excluded from positions with decision-making authority, and are paid less and receive smaller bonuses than their male counterparts. According to Campbell’s attorneys, Chadbourne’s management committee is made up of five men, who make all pay and promotion decisions. Campbell alleges she was underpaid by $2.7 million.

“Chadbourne & Parke seems to be operating in the dark ages when it comes to gender equality,” lead counsel David Sanford said in a statement. “Chadbourne may talk a good game about treating its lawyers fairly and equally, but Ms. Campbell’s allegations show that at Chadbourne gender discrimination is standard operating procedure.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
In a statement, Chadbourne said they supported the advancement of women and denied the allegations:

Ms. Campbell’s complaint against the firm is riddled with falsehoods and, once the facts are fully presented, the firm is confident that her allegations will be shown to be completely baseless.

There is plenty of time for the specifics to get hashed out in court, and no liability for any firm has been established yet, but the trend of these suits is really noteworthy.

To Campbell and the other women suing their firms: thank you for being willing to bear the brunt of these lawsuits. Most of the women I know who’ve spent any time working in Biglaw know in their heart, or at least strongly suspect, things just aren’t as “fair” for them as they are for their male colleagues. But amassing evidence of that, and being willing to take on the legal might of a Biglaw firm — potentially risking your own career in the process — well, that takes an awful lot of guts.

I predict this is far from the last such lawsuit we’ll see in Biglaw. Hopefully, with enough of these, something will really change.

# This Is The New Normal When It Comes To Office Attendance At Biglaw Firms
## Not all firms are mandating attendance yet, but time will tell....

For firms that were not feeling comfortable with a mandate, they would say enough of our peers are doing it. The people who are mandating will look at it and say we aren’t the only ones.

— Thomas Fulcher, vice chair, mid-Atlantic lead and director at Savills, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/19/3-days-in-the-office-is-the-new-normal-at-am-law-100-firms/), on the company’s new Legal Tenant Practice Group survey, which revealed that 34% of firms have mandated attendance for three days a week, while another 33% “encourage” attendance three days a week. Just 7% of firms have mandated attendance of two days a week, and another 15% encourage attendance two days a week. Finally, 7% of firms encourage attendance with no set number of days, while no respondents to the Savills survey encourage or mandate attendance one or four days a week.

# After Months Of Doom & Gloom, Maybe Biglaw Firms Still Made Massive Profits In 2022
## Financially suffering law firms may be the exception rather than the rule.

After some [high-profile layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) and some [sneaky stealth layoff shenanigans](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/when-biglaw-firms-set-90-day-performance-targets-stealth-layoffs-cant-be-far-behind/), the legal industry overall seems calm and steady. Predictions of [a coming layoff storm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/industry-expert-cant-believe-there-havent-been-more-outright-layoffs-in-biglaw-yet/) abound, but [like the surprise over the last jobs report](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/stock-markets-januarys-us-jobs-reports-is-stunningly-good.html), maybe economic turmoil is mostly a fiction outside of the tech sector and firms with a diversified practice aren’t going to end up suffering much.

We’re already hearing little leaks from firms about the final 2022 numbers and while there are going to be some elite firms taking a hit, there’s been a little more good news than bad so far.

For example, Paul Hastings boasted $4.7 million in profits per equity partner in 2021 and just told Bloomberg that [its profits were UP in 2022](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/paul-hastings-sees-profits-rise-despite-tightening-market). They weren’t alone:

Vinson & Elkins’ chair Keith Fullenweider and vice-chair Jim Fox [told ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/vinson-elkins-brings-back-former-partner-in-expansion-plan)Bloomberg Law in November that the firm’s financial performance was “trending positive” for the year. Baker Botts recently [said](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2023/01/27/aiming-to-sharpen-value-for-clients-baker-botts-posts-higher-financials-across-the-board-in-2022/) it beat its 2021 gross revenue figures by 4%, according to the American Lawyer.

We’re still several weeks away from the release of the Am Law 100, the best ([if not universally trusted](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/just-how-accurate-are-am-laws-rankings/)) peek at the financial health of top law firms, but this year’s report seems likely to be the most fascinating in years with a genuine split between the 2022 haves and have-not-quite-as-muches.

Maybe 2022 turns out to be a crazy blip where everyone’s revenue numbers get tossed in the air. But it also might be an inflection point where some firms distinguish themselves for adapting to the post-pandemic business climate better than the rest.

# Top 20 Biglaw Firm Welcomes Lawyers Back To Office, But Without Raises (Yet)
## It's time to put up or shut up: show associates the money if you want them back in the office.

What is it with Biglaw firms announcing their return-to-office plans before they announce their Milbank matches? Come on, let’s think about incentivizing employees here, folks. No one really wants to head back to the office during an ongoing pandemic, but a bigger paycheck might make it a little more palatable.

One of the firms that made its office return plan known prior to informing employees that there would be no salary match to come just yet is Weil Gotshal, a firm that’s in the top 20 of the Am Law 100 (No. 17, to be exact).

Earlier this week, the firm sent out a brief memo letting associates know that its US offices would be reopening fully on February 28. Weil followed up with a town hall meeting where salaries were discussed, but no raises came, and according to some sources, they didn’t even seem imminent. In a [recent Instagram story](https://www.instagram.com/stories/biglawboiz/2770847957554968859/), BigLawBoiz summarized the situation quite perfectly.



All empires fall indeed.

What are these firms waiting for? The $215K salary scale is here, and associate compensation reaching these heights was [inevitable](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/these-biglaw-salary-raises-were-inevitable-so-when-will-the-first-firm-match/). Match this money before Biglaw is broken down into salary tiers and your firm is left in the cold.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

It’s the most wonderful time of the Biglaw year! As the day inches closer and closer to quittin’ time (as if that’s even a thing in Biglaw), everyone is desperate for something — anything — to distract them until their (appropriately socially distant) Thanksgiving plans can begin.

Well, we can thank Debevoise for the perfect bonus memo distraction.

Today, Debevoise announced year-end bonuses, in line with the prevailing market rate. The bonus scale is as follows ([you can read the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/debevoise-year-end-bonuses/2/)):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class of 2020: $15,000 (prorated)
Class of 2019: $15,000
Class of 2018: $25,000
Class of 2017: $50,000
Class of 2016: $65,000
Class of 2015: $80,000
Class of 2014: $90,000
Class of 2013+: $100,000

Back in September, Debevoise was among the Biglaw firms[ to hand out COVID appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/debevoise-bonuses/). Those special bonuses range from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year, and are in addition to the year-end bonus numbers. So yeah, Biglaw associates have a lot to be thankful for!

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

It’s nice, if somewhat boring, to report when a Biglaw firm offers a straight match of the market standard set by Milbank [earlier this month. ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/)There’s clarity for associates — current and prospective. Unfortunately, that’s just not how every firm rolls. Ropes & Gray announced their bonus schedule today, and while junior associates are clear on what they’ll take home (subject to some conditions, as described below), mid-level and senior associates are not afforded that clarity.

Here’s the bonus grid the firm circulated:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Anyone more senior than the class of 2017 is off the grid. The world of individualized compensation could be good, could be bad, or could be average for associates, putting them largely at the mercy of how busy their practice group was this year.

Additionally, Ropes & Gray is the first Biglaw firm to announce bonuses this year that have significant stipulations on them (there will be more before bonus season is over). The target for the bonuses is 1,900 billable and pro bono hours, and the firm may adjust the bonuses up if associates bill “substantially” more than that, or down if they fail to meet the target. Plus, the firm’s policy will automatically deduct from the bonus amount if the associate fails to diary their hours in a timely manner.

Bonuses will be paid by the firm on December 24th. ([Full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/biglaw-bonus-announcement-comes-with-lack-of-clarity-for-mid-level-and-senior-associates/2/))

Remember, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 04.06.17
## Is this Supreme Court nominee a plagiarist? * SCOTUS nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch has been accused of plagiarizing borrowing language and sentence style from other authors and incorporating it into a book and a law journal article without proper citation. On the bright side, at least one of the authors whose language he copied doesn't seem to have a problem with it. [[POLITICO](https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/04/gorsuch-writings-supreme-court-236891)] * As it turns out, Chadbourne & Parke isn't too keen on having a partner who filed a $100 million gender discrimination suit against the firm still working there. A spokesperson for Chadbourne says that the partners will convene to vote Kerrie Campbell out of the partnership. We'll likely have more on this later today. [[Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202783067293/Chadbourne-Wants-Kerrie-Campbell-to-Leave-the-Building)] * According to Citi Private Bank’s Law Firm Group, the leaders of some of America's largest law firms had the wrong idea about how 2016 would turn out. Legal demand went down, not up as hoped for; realization rates did not improve, as expected; and revenue at many firms dropped, instead of increasing. Ouch. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/law-firm-leaders-struggle-to-see-the-market-report/)] * Professor Verna Williams will serve as the special assistant to the provost (i.e., interim dean) of the University of Cincinnati College of Law while Dean Jennifer Bard is on administrative leave.

* SCOTUS nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch has been accused of plagiarizing borrowing language and sentence style from other authors and incorporating it into a book and a law journal article without proper citation. On the bright side, at least one of the authors whose language he copied doesn’t seem to have a problem with it. [[POLITICO](https://secure.politico.com/story/2017/04/gorsuch-writings-supreme-court-236891)]

* As it turns out, Chadbourne & Parke isn’t too keen on having a partner who filed a $100 million gender discrimination suit against the firm still working there. A spokesperson for Chadbourne says that the partners will convene to vote Kerrie Campbell out of the partnership. We’ll likely have more on this later today.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
* According to Citi Private Bank’s Law Firm Group, the leaders of some of America’s largest law firms had the wrong idea about how 2016 would turn out. Legal demand went down, not up as hoped for; realization rates did not improve, as expected; and revenue at many firms dropped, instead of increasing. Ouch. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/law-firm-leaders-struggle-to-see-the-market-report/)]


* Professor Verna Williams will serve as the special assistant to the provost (i.e., interim dean) of the University of Cincinnati College of Law while Dean Jennifer Bard is on administrative leave. Williams was one of the UC professors who [opposed Bard’s leadership](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/dean-increases-rankings-drama-at-law-school/), once referring to the situation as “untenable.” [[Cincinnati Enquirer](http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/04/05/uc-names-interim-leader-law-school/100069720/)]

* Speaking of Dean Bard, she has obtained legal representation and claims that her [removal from her position](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/law-school-dean-out-amid-controversy/) was improper. Per her attorney, “[t]he interim provost placed Dean Bard on administrative leave without the slightest factual basis for doing so,” and the law faculty were unwilling to put students’ needs ahead of their own.

One by one, Biglaw firms are closing up shop in Asia, especially in the greater China region. Thus far, four firms — Latham, Perkins Coie, Proskauer, and Akin Gump — have shuttered their operations in China within the last year, and now a fifth firm is following suit, leaving just a single office standing.

As noted by [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/22/a-double-blow-orrick-shutters-taipei-and-shanghai-offices-in-attempt-to-rebalance-regional-platform-405-138536/), the latest firm to do so is Orrick. The top Am Law firm closed its Taipei office and is in the process of winding down its Shanghai office. The firm offered the following statement:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“These moves reflect a rebalancing of our Asia Pacific platform, including the launch of our Singapore office in 2021, to align with client demand.”

The firm did not employ any lawyers on a full-time basis in Taipei, as the office served mostly as “a space to meet with clients based there.” Its Shanghai office, however, employs two partners and a small team (two associates and one staff member), and all of them will move to the firm’s Beijing office come July, when that location’s lease runs out. Eight others from the Shanghai office — an associate, a consultant, and six staff members — will receive “market severance.”

Best of luck to those who are being displaced or losing their jobs thanks to Orrick’s decision to close its Shanghai office.

Which Biglaw firm will be the next say zàijiàn to its offices in China? You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20China%20Office%20Closure) or text us ([646-820-8477](tel:646-820-8477)) if you have any intel. Thank you.

# Funny Or Not?

Sometimes an end of the year column looks at what the past year has wrought and makes predictions for the year to come. Not mine. I will leave that to others with Ouija boards, tarot cards, crystal balls (mine is in the shop) and the ever popular but not necessarily dependable Magic 8 Ball.

So, I will look back at some of the things that lawyers did this past year that gave us about the only humor (some intentional, some of the unintentional aka “you’ve got to be kidding” variety) we had.

A California law firm [posted a job on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3357004032/) showing that at least some lawyers still have senses of humor. This firm (and I wonder if the job has been filled) has its tongue firmly in cheek describing some of the perks for working for the firm: commuting consists of walking from bed to home office, appropriate attire is sweatpants with pet hair (I can relate), and the duties that the associate attorney will be expected to do, most, if not all, of them usual associate responsibilities. Never have I seen a firm be so blunt in how much crap the successful applicant will be expected to eat. Bravo to this firm for truly telling it like it is. Definitely funny.

Whether something is funny depends on your point of view: are you leading the parade or cleaning up after the elephants? Here’s one lawyer who falls into the latter category.

This partner thinks that Biglaw is a “scam.” He’s not the first person to think that, although I don’t think that many say it publicly, but an issue for him is [whether the juice is worth the squeeze](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/new-biglaw-partner-says-biglaw-firms-are-a-scam/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=238216770&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-%20_WoMaMY7fUOguFQ0EPsJAJb4ifC4Ag9b5DWkqDMhq25Ipx9Q8WRszbd_s58dfP47ARU5_UJZpuXh4-aGYRjEgmXhih8w&utm_content=238216770&utm_source=hs_email), that is,  is the financial obligation of being a partner worth it? Funny or not?

Has anyone read the new book “[Servants of the Damned](https://www.amazon.com/Servants-Damned-Donald-Corruption-Justice-ebook/dp/B09SHW5Y9J/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3SVG9DKL4XNIE&keywords=servants+of+the+damned+by+david+enrich&qid=1672117293&sprefix=servants%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-1)” by David Enrich? It’s a history of Jones Day, how it morphed from a local Cleveland firm to today’s powerhouse. It’s a fascinating read. But Jones Day clawing back bar exam fees from a former associate doesn’t make [a good impression for the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/cheapskates-at-jones-day-bill-former-associate-for-bar-prep/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Daily&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=238216770&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-89o7Ha7CL60cgxK7HMwUnIrhmxHJ8-dp2Tc0huMpalqwfzj1Nl6mmBsilWgCBvSFZCo8FHDol-MPBs6HtFAOwtjhxO7w&utm_content=238216770&utm_source=hs_email). Where’s the firm’s sense of humor? Does the “sunk costs” concept apply here?

And then from clawback to lawsuit, one firm is [suing its associates for not billing enough hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/law-firm-sues-associates-for-not-billing-enough/?utm_campaign=Above%20the%20Law%20Small%20Law&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=237295761&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--%20J213FCEM8Kj3bb70zEwD2T5dVDR38xVStmt9OcqYOYtyArf1krUySHsSiC_xrR6FbFs8dK1uNJKvjI1YNaReGTWwSIA&utm_content=237295761&utm_source=hs_email). Again, unintentionally funny. Which is worse, being sued for not billing enough hours or being fired and facing discipline for padding the bills?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Let’s analyze this: is it better to be truthful and admit that your hours fall below what’s wanted, or is it better to be duplicitous and avoid litigation, but suffer collateral consequences, such as possible disbarment for fraud? Here’s Exhibit A for what can happen in overbilling situations. Granted that this is an extreme example since the attorney billed [more than 24 hours in a day](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/lawyer-is-disbarred-after-he-is-accused-of-billing-more-than-24-hours-a-day?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=weekly_email), but you get the picture.

Biglaw firms are experiencing slow collections in the annual year-end rush to get as much [money as possible in the door](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/yikes-biglaw-firms-are-having-a-rough-go-of-it-when-it-comes-to-collections/) before the ball drops in Times Square. Biglaw is not the only business having collection problems. One company’s collection problem is another firm’s payables dilemma. Any law firms that are “slow pay” to their vendors? Funny or not?

“Bed check” has apparently returned at this Biglaw firm, and I don’t mean WFH sitting on your bed. One Biglaw firm is docking associate bonus payments (of course, not partners) for “insufficient compliance with the mandatory attendance rule.” What rule? Apparently, there was [no advance notice of this new docking policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/associates-hit-with-unannounced-bonus-reductions-for-not-being-in-the-office-enough/) until it hit associate paychecks.

This is the 21st century version of “bed check.” Back in dinosaur days, a secretary (that’s what the term was in those days) walked around the floor with paper and pen in hand and noted who was there and wasn’t. These walkarounds were at 8:30 (starting time being 8:15) and 4:30 (ending time was 4:45). We didn’t have desktop computers then. Desks looked messy and jackets were hung on the backs of chairs to show that we were at work, not necessarily at the desk. Again, unintentionally funny for exempt professionals.

Everyone needs to [be careful when opening a can of Pringles](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/lawyer-faces-ethics-complaint-for-pooping-in-pringles-can-flinging-it-into-victims-advocacy-center-parking-lot/), especially in Ohio. Why? The Ohio Disciplinary Counsel has charged an attorney defending a murder case with (and I am not making this up) with pooping into a Pringles can (thankfully empty) and then tossing that can, without a lid, out his car window and into the parking lot where the victim’s case advocate worked. The attorney allegedly then drove off to attend a hearing in the case.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
This fact pattern would make a great crossover criminal law-ethics-tort question. Was there an intentional tort or was the attorney merely negligent in his choice of a dumping location? Did he commit any crime? Were any ethical rules violated? Discuss.

The attorney had [allegedly used Pringles](https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/legal_profession/2022/11/no-sht.html) and poops as weapons of mass elimination 10 other times. Do you think Pringles might sue for defecation? (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)

And lastly, I will break my own rule about predictions: stories about the State Bar of California and the Tom Girardi mess will continue into 2023. Not funny. Apologies in advance to my ATL editors.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

The demand for associates no longer exceeds supply. So it only makes sense that firms are not as eager to hire remote attorneys, and offers are not going to have to be as aggressive.

— [Summer Eberhard](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/summer-eberhard), a recruiter at Major Lindsey & Africa, commenting on the slowdown of the law firm associate hiring market, in an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/the-party-is-ending-big-law-associates-brace-for-fiscal-change). While associates were once able to command large signing bonuses and exclusive perks upon joining a new firm, Eberhard said that she’s had to bring some associates down a peg or two when it came to their expectations. “I haven’t seen a lot of pushback,” she said. “Associates are seeing firsthand in their firms that work has slowed.” [Katherine Loanzon](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/katherine-loanzon/), managing director at legal headhunting firm Kinney Recruiting, also spoke to [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/the-party-is-ending-big-law-associates-brace-for-fiscal-change) about the lateral hiring scene right now. “The market has taken a complete 180 from last year,” she said.

# Rod Rosenstein Offered To Wear A Wire To Record Trump, According To The New York Times

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is going to walk away from the Trump era, assuming that any of us are able to walk away from the Trump era, with one of the most complicated legacies of anybody in Donald Trump’s government.

On the one hand, he’s been in charge of the Russia investigation since Jeff Sessions rightly recused himself because he lied to Congress. Rosenstein hired Robert Mueller. He’s been a key cog in keeping the investigation going.

On the other hand, he was complicit in Donald Trump’s obstruction of justice that necessitated the need for a special counsel in the first place. It’s Rosenstein’s letter that Trump used as pretext for firing then-F.B.I. Director James Comey.

Today, the [New York Times has an explosive report](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-wear-wire-25th-amendment.html) about what Rosenstein was willing to do to the president.

The deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, suggested last year that he secretly record President Trump in the White House to expose the chaos consuming the administration, and he discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office for being unfit.

Mr. Rosenstein made these suggestions in the spring of 2017 when Mr. Trump’s firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director plunged the White House into turmoil. Over the ensuing days, the president divulged classified intelligence to Russians in the Oval Office, and revelations emerged that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to pledge loyalty and end an investigation into a senior aide…

[A]ccording to the others who described his comments, Mr. Rosenstein not only confirmed that he was serious about the idea but also followed up by suggesting that other F.B.I. officials who were interviewing to be the bureau’s director could also secretly record Mr. Trump.

Rosenstein vehemently denies the report. But, like, what do you want him to say? “Yes, President Trump is cray-cray, we’re all gonna die if we don’t stop him. Please send help now!”

And if you really parse Rosenstein’s denial… it’s kind of not really a denial:

“The New York Times’s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect,” he said in a statement. “I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.”

Alright kids, let’s put on our close-read glasses:

- “The New York Times’s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect” — This is a good strong blanket denial, that doesn’t specifically deny any particular allegation.
- “I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources” — Listen, people are talking anonymously because they fear retaliation by the crazy president. Don’t act like you’ve never been one.
- “who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda.” — Telling your boss exactly what he wants to hear is a good strategy when a report comes out that you were willing to secretly tape your boss.
- “But let me be clear about this” — Cool. Here come the specific denials.
- “Based on my personal dealings with the president” — Wait, your “personal dealings”? You’re saying that the president has never ordered you to watch his one-man performance of Kiss of the Spiderwoman, personally? That’s comforting.
- “there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.” — That’s a curious use of the word “is.” Considering that the report dealt with whether you were looking to invoke the 25th Amendment, one might have said “there was no basis to invoke the 25th, nor is there now.” But, you didn’t say that, did you?
- “…” — Where is the specific denial about secretly recording the president? That’s the shocking thing here, isn’t it? It appears that pretty much everybody in your administration already knows that the president is unfit for office, that all of you cowards occasionally think about the 25th is a known issue. But… secretly recording the president? Wearing a wire? That’s new.
This report will, undoubtedly, feed Trump’s desire to fire Jeff Sessions, and Rod Rosenstein. It will feed the “deep state” narrative by the alt-right.

But… I believe that the Deputy Attorney General offered to wear a wire to secretly record the President of the United States because he’s a dangerous man, unfit for office. Everybody knows this, and still, nobody does anything to stop him.

# How To Run Your Practice Like A Tech CEO

Happy New Year, everybody. 2020 is finally behind us, a COVID-19 vaccine is being distributed, and anticipation for a fresh start seems to be in the air. In that spirit, I’m issuing a pair of challenges to myself and to those reading, which, I hope, will encourage all of us to rethink how we run our practices. It’s 2021, people. We live in the future, and there’s no time like the present to start acting like it.

Less Time Deciding, More Time Doing

Picture Steve Jobs in your mind. What do you see? A tall tech guru unfailingly wearing a black turtleneck, jeans, and sneakers. Jobs was notorious for never deviating from his standard uniform. While stories vary as to why he began wearing the same thing every day, what’s certain is that for the last 20 years of his life, Steve Jobs didn’t have to think about what he was wearing tomorrow. He’d automated that decision away.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Jobs isn’t the only notable figure who’s gone that route. Mark Zuckerberg wears a copy of the same gray T-shirt almost every day, a practice he’s [on record](https://careers.workopolis.com/advice/the-reason-mark-zuckerberg-wears-the-same-shirt-every-day/) as adopting to reduce the number of trivial decisions he has to make in a day. President Barack Obama wore either a gray or blue suit every day for most of his term in office for the same reason.

I’m not here to advocate throwing out your wardrobe to start the new year, but I am firmly of the belief that reducing the time we spend on trivial tasks is a worthy goal. And the most effective method for reducing trivial tasks in a law firm I’ve found has been automation.

Challenge 1: Automate Something

Anything you do regularly, from getting dressed in the morning to pitching new clients, is a candidate for automation. There are almost always trivial decisions to be made or minor tasks to be accomplished that frankly don’t need our full suite of skills to accomplish. We’re highly skilled information-age workers who are paid well for the bespoke, considered counsel we provide our clients. We shouldn’t be spending any more time than is absolutely necessary tinkering with Word documents, fiddling with hand calculators, or otherwise failing to add actual value to our clients.

So that’s my professional challenge to you for 2021: automate something. Free up time. Find an area of your practice where you’re spending time you don’t need to be spending, and reclaim that time for yourself.

It’s easier than you might think. Building out legal forms that auto-populate with necessary information is a classic law firm automation strategy, but we can think broader than just substantive legal issues. Attorneys that network heavily might spend a lot of their nonbillable time going through their contacts to figure out who to touch base with next. Save that brain space and time by implementing a system to track your networking and alert you when a contact has gone over a set period of time without a chat.

Even the seemingly tiniest, easiest repetitive processes add up over time. If you could automate a process that takes you just one minute, within five years you’d have clawed back a day of productive time. If you can automate a 10-minute-a-day task, you’ll save nearly two weeks in the same period. That’s time added back into your day to spend practicing law, building your book, seeing your kids, or enjoying your home life.

There’s something in your workday that doesn’t need to be there. Find what it is and automate it away.

Challenge 2: Create And Track A New Metric

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Most of us know how many hours we billed and dollars we collected last year, but for many that’s where our interest in numerical analysis ends. That’s a missed opportunity. Billables and dollars collected are crucial metrics, but they only tell us the final score, not the story of the game itself. It doesn’t do us much good to know we generated a million dollars if we don’t know how or why we were able to do it.

That’s why we need to do better at measuring our performance. Creating objective metrics gives us insight into our businesses, helps develop goals to strive for, and can start the conversation on where we try to develop next. Sit down, think through some area of your practice you’d like to understand better, figure out how to measure it, and start gathering data. Start simple, and grow out from there.

For instance, do you know how many deals or cases you’re working on as you sit reading this? If you started tracking that figure and updating it monthly, within a couple quarters you’d start to develop a rough, but objective view of how your practice is shaped, especially when compared against the billable hour and dollars-collected figures you’re already recording. If, for example, your dollars are staying steady while your number of matters worked is decreasing over time, you’ve got good evidence that the matters you’re working on are bigger and more valuable individually than they used to be.

Some Final Thoughts

Tech can be intimidating, especially to attorneys, but chances are you already have most of the tools you need at your fingertips. Most general office software and attorney-facing programs have major automation and metric-tracking tools already built in. We just tend not to utilize them to their full potential. Consider contacting your customer support rep or doing a little digging in the Help files to find tools you didn’t even know you had.

Finally, any of these challenges can be made immeasurably easier by working alongside your firm’s IT department. As a rule, these departments are staffed with smart, hard-working people who mostly love interesting new challenges. Many IT teams get excited at the chance to build something new and useful, as opposed to just resetting passwords and asking if the caller has [tried turning it off and on again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UT8RkSmN4k).

A generation ago, lawyers didn’t even type out their own briefs. Now, we can edit them on our smartphones, at home, in between Zoom meetings, all while reviewing the research our new AI software automatically generated. Technology has revolutionized our field of work, despite it being populated by more than its share of technophobes, and those changes are only just beginning. Data and technology can be your greatest assets as an attorney. This year, let’s resolve to use them.

If the thought of technological automation and tracking still overwhelms you, here’s a [link](https://www.amazon.com/poriff-Fashion-Knitted-Turtleneck-Pullover/dp/B07K7DHD4G/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3774KDD7SH6PQ&dchild=1&keywords=steve+jobs+turtleneck&qid=1610053562&sprefix=steve+jobs+tu%2Caps%2C185&sr=8-5) to a black turtleneck.

# Lawyers Can Officially Kiss Those Giant Signing Bonuses Goodbye
## Now that the talent war is over, they're a thing of the past.

Most of the offers I’ve seen in the fourth quarter did not contain signing bonuses. They were common in 2021 and they will be largely absent in 2023. I think it’s only for associates and partners who live in rarified air, as opposed to anyone with a functional knowledge of a practice area.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh), a Bay Area associate recruiter with Major Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/02/15/the-balance-of-power-begins-to-shift-in-favor-of-law-firms/) on the disappearance of Biglaw signing bonuses for virtually any and all lawyers making lateral moves in recent months. Sheikh went on to explain that while the bar for hiring “is back up” now compared to the talent war of 2021, “there will be incentives to make big moves and that exists at the associate and the partner level” when it comes to “really talented lawyers.”

# With Cravath's Approval, Top Firm Shows Up To Announce Higher Pay Scale For Associates
## This news came almost immediately after Cravath signed off on the new salary scale.

Now that [Cravath has spoken](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cravath-raises/) on the new associate compensation scale, we can expect matches to start rolling out at warp speed across Biglaw. If your firm hasn’t adopted the [Davis Polk salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) yet, you better get ready, because that match could be coming any time now.

Shortly after Cravath signed on to $205K base salaries, another leading law firm quickly made its announcement. Paul Weiss — a firm ranked at No. 20 on the most recent Am Law 100, having brought in $1,543,730,000 gross revenue in 2020 — delighted associates last night with a match of its own.

This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm (full memo on next page):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013+: $365,000
It’s worth noting that the firm’s [prior salary scale from 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/paul-weiss-makes-their-compensation-statement/) included a bump for ninth-year associates. Instead of making $375,000 (a compensation level that’s been instituted at only three other firms thus far), they’ll be included with the class year beneath them at $365,000, which is nothing to sneeze at. As a plus, Paul Weiss will be raising summer associate salaries to match the class of 2020.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# 'Indonesian Torture Case' Not Exactly The Phrase You Want To See Attached To Biden Official
## Criticism had grown louder of the pick, but this proved too much to overcome.

[Alex Oh](https://www.globallegalinsights.com/firms/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-and-garrison/alex-oh) looked to be locked into a long-term run as the SEC Enforcement chief, but instead will be sticking around Paul Weiss. The co-chair of the firm’s Anti-Corruption & FCPA Practice Group resigned from the government post she was named to last week after Judge Royce Lamberth “reprimanded her and others defending oil giant ExxonMobil in a class action lawsuit brought by Indonesian villagers,” [as Politico put it](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/28/sec-alex-oh-resignation-484955).

The reprimand came in response to [a motion filed by plaintiffs’ counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2021/04/Lamberth-Motion.pdf) over a variety of allegedly dilatory deposition tactics.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“In light of the time and attention it will take from me, I have reached the conclusion that I cannot address this development without it becoming an unwelcome distraction to the important work of the division,” Oh said in a resignation letter.

Whether the Judge Lamberth order really changed Oh’s mind or merely served as the last straw isn’t exactly clear. The individual order is not flattering, but could be argued. On the other hand, headlines characterizing the underlying matter as “Indonesian torture case” aren’t particularly helpful for someone trying to seamlessly transition into an administration built on the back of already skeptical progressive voters.

To be fair, progressive opposition to Oh’s selection for the Enforcement job existed before the public focused on this case, where Indonesian villagers are suing ExxonMobil for hiring a private army that allegedly committed murders and other acts of torture to guard natural gas facilities in the country. Groups had already questioned Oh’s selection based on her long history of defending the class of client that she’d be expected to take to task in the new role.

It seems [like we’re talking about revolving doors a lot today](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/new-report-explains-that-no-matter-how-objectionable-you-thought-jones-day-was-its-worse/), but it’s worth keeping top of mind that the long-term career path of these posts is a return to the private sector and consequently a return to currying favor with people you’ve spent several years prosecuting. That’s not an easy impulse to firewall when it’s worth millions. And even for those that can successfully overcome that — and I personally think more of those people exist than some people think — the appearance of impropriety can be enough to avoid putting the government in that position.

On the other hand, Gary Gensler went from Goldman Sachs to a darling of left-leaning groups after a solid tenure as a regulator under Obama. Sometimes people can surprise you. But the Exxon case appears to have ultimately been too much to overcome for Oh.

Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, said Wednesday that “Gary Gensler and the SEC dodged a bullet in avoiding having a seemingly overzealous defender of ExxonMobil’s interests over Indonesian villagers entrusted with the powerful SEC Enforcement Division.”

It all goes back to a theme we’ve been talking about for a while here: the right to counsel doesn’t necessarily mean the right to have you as counsel, and when a lawyer isn’t acting as a court-appointed attorney, the lawyer is making a choice in every matter and has to live with the consequences of that choice. The ACLU didn’t defend Nazis because “everyone deserves a lawyer,” they did it to further a higher principle and the organization is more than comfortable defending that point without resorting to an undeserved romanticization of the “role of a lawyer.”

And, sometimes, getting wrapped up with the phrase “Indonesian torture case” is going to be a stumbling block to government work. That’s just the way it goes.

# The Best Biglaw Firms, Ranked By Summer Associates (2018)
## What matters most to summer associates? Here are the Top 10 firms.

The summer of 2018 was pretty exciting for summer associates much in the same way that the summer of 2016 was, in that law students who received offers of permanent employment from firms that adopted the latest raises knew they’d be earning huge salaries after graduation. But it’s not just superb salaries that summer associates were satisfied with. According to a new survey from the American Lawyer, they were “thrilled” with just about everything having to do with their experiences in Biglaw.

So, what matters most to summer associates, and which firms did they like the best?

Before we get to the rankings, let’s discuss the methodology used by [Am Law](https://www.law.com/2018/09/27/summer-associates-are-happier-than-ever/):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Firms were ranked by their average scores based on nine categories: interesting work, real work, training and guidance, partner-summer associate interaction, associate-summer associate interaction, communication of goals and expectations, accuracy of firm self-portrayal, inclination to accept full-time associateship and overall rating as a place to work.

Without further ado, here are the Top 10 firms (ranked through No. 9 due to a tie):


(Table via American Lawyer)

Click [here](https://www.law.com/2018/09/27/summer-associates-are-happier-than-ever/) to see the full rankings. (Here’s a little spoiler alert: Drinker Biddle is ranked dead last due to summer associates’ lack of “real” work. The firm’s summers use “training modules,” which the firm has defended as “integral” to its program).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
How did the firms in the Top 10 rise to the top? Work-life balance was incredibly important to millennials — more important than almost anything else when it came to weighing job offers from Biglaw firms. Per the Am Law survey, nearly 50 percent of summer associates said they’d consider work-life balance before accepting an offer.

What law students actually observed at their firms, however, didn’t always match up with their wishes. Here’s some additional detail from the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2018/09/27/summer-associates-are-happier-than-ever/):

Summer associates’ views on what they actually observed were mixed. Numerous survey respondents said in open-ended answers that they were surprised by the work-life balance their firms afforded, or by the number of lawyers who worked reasonable hours at the office.

But some say their firms could do more to encourage the use of flexible arrangements or criticize the expectations they were held to.

“There is no work-life balance, and the attorneys who succeed are ones who are single or who have stay-at-home wives,” a summer associate in Charlotte says.

Another important factor for summer associates was diversity (in terms of people of color and women), and at some firms, they really didn’t like what they saw. “I would tell the firm that diversity in top law schools already exists. The firm needs to be more focused and aggressive in its recruitment of these people,” said one New York summer associate. Another summer from Delaware said the lack of diversity “makes the few [people of color] who are in the office feel like this isn’t a space they belong in.”

When asked what they would consider in evaluating a job offer, 10.7 percent of survey respondents said diversity was an important factor, up from 8.8 percent last year.

And 6.7 percent say an above-average proportion of female partners was an important consideration, up slightly from 5.9 percent last year.

Many survey respondents, in their open-ended answers, urged their firms to continue or strengthen their efforts toward diversifying their firm and its leadership.

Things need to change in Biglaw, and if these firms want to keep their scores high on these summer associate surveys, they need to change fast. In the meantime, congratulations to all of the firms that earned the respect and appreciation of their summer associates — you’ll be paying it back to them in spades in just a few years.

# Beyond Biglaw: What Do The Pay Raises Mean For Boutique Firms?
## Columnist Gaston Kroub, Biglaw partner turned boutique firm founder, offers his thoughts on the recent law firm pay hike.

The market leaders have spoken. Hardworking associates, primarily those fortunate to work for the top (most profitable) slice of the legal market, are getting a raise. Considering the huge inflation in profits per partner that the firms handing out these raises have generally enjoyed, it was not an unexpected move. In fact, the extreme profitability gains — for both top Biglaw and boutique firms — since the last time the market rate for associates was set kind of compelled this adjustment. As expected, this news is getting a lot of attention, and deservedly so (driven in no small part by these pages). But it is worth keeping in mind that the actual benefits of this round of pay raises are actually limited to a very small subset of the legal market.

As a former Biglaw partner and current owner of a boutique law firm, I watch the reaction to this news with interest. While we don’t (yet) find ourselves competing with Biglaw for talent, we definitely market and consider ourselves as a Biglaw equivalent in terms of quality. In fact, nearly every one of our contested matters since we founded our firm has found us going up against either a Biglaw (whether IP-specific or general practice) firm or a boutique firm like ours founded by Biglaw refugees.

So when the time comes for us to [consider](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/beyond-biglaw-small-firm-interview-tips-part-1/) [adding](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/beyond-biglaw-small-firm-interview-tips-part-2/) (now more expensive) talent to our ranks, we will be faced with a stark decision. Do we decide to compete with Biglaw and other boutiques based on an ability to meet or exceed market rates? Or do we try and sell prospective associates on the quality of the work and prospects for advancement, even if the pay is less than what they would be making on the new [Cravath scale?](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) That is a decision for another day for our firm, but I do not envy those firms, of any size, who find themselves forced to respond immediately to the latest show of strength from a market leader.

In the meantime, there are a few thing that associates, whether they are in Biglaw or otherwise, need to remember about these salary raises. Most importantly, smart associates need to make sound financial decisions with the newfound money. Whether it is paying down debt, so that they can exit Biglaw sooner, or just adding to whatever savings they have accumulated. Rushing out to buy yourself the Rolex you had promised yourself when you made partner is probably not a good idea. Better to save what you can of the raise, and if possible, give some charity to a worthy cause or person as well. Or actually make partner, if possible.

That might be harder than ever, and this salary raise will likely serve in the long run to make associate jobs less stable, especially since there has been very little reporting on [client reaction to these moves](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-do-and-should-in-house-lawyers-think-about-the-biglaw-pay-raises/). Sure, we may hear some lip service from a general counsel at some large company on how they applaud the generosity of firms, and welcome the firms they work with having the ability to attract and retain top talent. But those platitudes generally take a darker turn, especially in private discussion between that same general counsel and their relationship partner, if and when firms who raised salaries decide to try and recoup some of that money by raising rates. Make no mistake. Someone needs to pay for these raises, and many firms will have a hard time resisting the opportunity to pass those costs to their clients. We will see how well-received this move will be then.

Likewise, smart associates will consider doing something to immediately demonstrate their commitment to the firm. Whether that is volunteering for an extra assignment, or even sending a thank you note to the executive committee with a short description of how the raise will impact your family for the better, it is important to show some gratitude. Yes, partners are rich, and the firms that led this charge by and large have the richest partners around. But that does not mean that basic decency does not apply, or that associates were somehow entitled to make more money. Now is the time to demonstrate some class and humility, irrespective of how much you actually deserved the raise. I know the vast majority of those associates who have received one, actually do deserve one. Showing some renewed commitment to your firm in exchange is the right approach.

It is also important to maintain some humility. The reason that firms have gone along with these raises — or announced them in the first place — had little to do with the individual identities of their current associates. For firms, these moves are very much also about marketing, and projecting an image of success to clients, peer firms, and outside talent. With respect to the latter, the focus is more on retaining or attracting experienced talent than making the firm more attractive to incoming junior associates. I don’t think firms are worried about their ability to attract top law students, or think a salary raise was necessary to get those students interviewing for first-year positions. In contrast, anytime firms can make the divide between in-house pay packages and what they are offering greater, maybe they can hold on to their most profitable associates for a little while longer. If the extra money helps keep those profitable associates motivated to keep hitting (or increasing) their billing targets, all the better. While everyone can celebrate the decision of their firm to match these raises, they should also remember that the decision was not about them in particular. It is a healthier perspective than displaying any arrogance about these raises.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Ultimately, I think these raises have very little to say about the long-term viability of the current Biglaw business model. Sure, if you are at a firm that did not match (or [should not match](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/dear-biglaw-firms-please-dont-raise-salaries/)), there may be cause for concern. But even if you are at Cravath, the fundamental challenges of the Biglaw lifestyle were not really addressed by this round of raises. For one, no one will be expected to work less hard as a result of these raises. We all know the opposite is more likely true. It comes down to this. If you are happy practicing law, especially law at the highest level of difficulty and sophistication, this raise will just be the sprinkles on top of your delicious ice cream cone of professional contentment. If you hate being a lawyer, especially a Biglaw one, all these raises will do is potentially grease the skids for your eventual exit. Spreading the wealth doesn’t guarantee happiness after all.

# Clients Dish: The Best In Biglaw Client Service
## Which firms are among the best of the best?

Which law firms do clients appreciate the most? That’s the real question behind BTI Consulting Group’s Client Service A-Team [report](https://www.bticonsulting.com/client-service-a-team-for-law-firms-2019/), which identifies the top 30 law firms clients identify as having the best client services. To compile the report, BTI spoke with 350 legal decision-makers who were asked to name firms that excelled in the following areas: unprompted communication, commitment to help, understands the client’s business, deals with unexpected changes, deals with complexity, innovative approach, and keeps clients informed.

From those surveys, the BTI team put together the list of the top 30 firms:

- Jones Day
- Skadden
- Latham & Watkins
- DLA Piper
- Gibson Dunn
- Hogan Lovells
- White & Case
- Cooley
- Dechert
- Akin Gump
- Morgan Lewis
- Sidley Austin
- Davis Polk & Wardwell
- Dentons
- Arnold & Porter
- Wachtell Lipton
- Littler Mendelson
- Paul Weiss
- Pillsbury Winthrop
- BakerHostetler
- Ropes & Gray
- Reed Smith

- Mayer Brown LLP
- Baker McKenzie
- Willkie Farr

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
What’s truly remarkable is that three of the firms — Jones Day, Morgan Lewis, and Sidley Austin — have appeared on the Top 30 list every year BTI has done the report. That’s 18 years of excellence in client service. As BTI Consulting president Michael Rynowecer [said of the firms](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1110497/in-house-attys-name-best-firms-for-client-service):

“We’ve been through recessions, financial crises, market booms, market busts, and yet they seem to manage to understand clients and be able to continually adjust, and in some cases reinvent, parts of the firm to accommodate the marketplace,” BTI Consulting president Michael Rynowecer said of Jones Day, Morgan Lewis and Sidley Austin.

And Jones Day is no stranger to the top of this ranking. The firm has been tops on the list 11 of the last 18 years, and is currently on a three-year streak at number one.

THE ONE LEGAL MARKETING HACK THEY DON’T WANT YOU TO KNOW!

Because it’s probably trademark infringement.

Back in September, [Lewis Brisbois](https://lewisbrisbois.com/) filed a [trademark infringement suit](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/02/Lewis-Brisbois-Complaint.pdf) against a bunch of folks in Texas apparently running a mediation company named *checks notes* Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As you likely already suspect, none of these defendants are named Lewis, Brisbois, Bisgaard, or Smith. There is a Jones though, which is so very close in the ubiquitous last name game, yet sadly does not count for credit.

Per [Law360](https://www.law360.com/pulse/articles/1533809/lewis-brisbois-sues-lewis-brisbois-in-texas-name-spat):

According to the suit, Bitgood and another man, Richard P. Jones, sued a residential development called Imperial Lofts LLC and two individuals earlier this year, alleging that they’d been improperly charged rental fees and hit with eviction petitions.

In March, the defendants in that case hired David Oubre, the managing partner of Lewis Brisbois-the-firm’s Houston office, to represent them.

In May, and unbeknownst to law firm Lewis Brisbois, Bitgood and Jones’ lawyer, Susan Norman, filed a notarized “assumed name certificate” for a mediation business named “Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith” at the clerk’s office in Fort Bend County, west of Houston.

This led to the foundation of an LLP with that name and even a second “assumed name certificate.” There were actual real-life lawyers involved in all of this! The mediation version of Lewis Brisbois then added the Lewis Brisbois that you and everyone else on the planet thinks of as defendants to the original case, guaranteeing that the law firm learned about the new business.

The law firm chose to come and take it.

[Fast forward to today](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1571274/judge-has-never-ever-seen-acts-in-lewis-brisbois-tm-row):

The parties on the receiving end of a trademark infringement suit brought by Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP said Tuesday that they wouldn’t accept the terms of a permanent injunction put forward by the law firm, prompting a federal district judge to remark that he’s “never, ever seen anything like” the conduct by the parties.

It’s not just you, Your Honor.

What is the hangup over the permanent injunction? Are they trying to keep their options open so they can open DLA Piper Fine Food and Provisions?

“The terms are unnecessary, Draconian, and basically false,” [Defendant and attorney Susan Norman] said. “I’m not ever going to agree to an injunction against myself. I just cannot.”

The SEC makes people agree to “don’t do it again” injunctions all the time! This isn’t a wild condition. Especially where the brazenness involved gives the law firm reasonable pause when asked to take the defendants at their word.

Norman said she would “vigorously oppose” the granting of a permanent injunction and would “immediately have to appeal.”

Yeah, definitely try to sell an appellate court on that. That will turn out about as well as the “come and take it” gambit.

# What’s The Future Of The Brick-And-Mortar Law Office?

Even before the pandemic pushed the world’s economy toward laptops and dining room tables, physical offices were falling out of fashion in the business world. International companies like the Big Four accounting firms have been [experimenting with hoteling](https://www.goingconcern.com/accounting-firm-offices-nap-rooms-hoteling/) and similar concepts to decrease their real estate footprint for years. Once the COVID-19 crisis was in full swing, that trend kicked into overdrive. [Tech companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/08/07/facebook-tells-employees-to-work-from-home-up-until-summer-2021/?sh=3b4996816d8d) like Facebook, Google, and Intel have told their employees to work from home until at least summer 2021. REI recently opted to sell, rather than move into, its brand new state-of-the-art headquarters campus. The [long-predicted future](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/tomorrow-is-here/) of remote work appears to have been finally thrust upon us.

Although law firms have overall followed the trend of moving their workforces to operating remotely, many in the legal world continue to predict a return to the office. Among the law firm managing partners I’ve spoken with, there seems to be little appetite to make the current state of affairs permanent. Most expect some lasting change, but they also believe the overall long-term impact will be less than most expect. To my surprise, several law firm leaders have even set a strategic priority of getting back to pre-pandemic normal as quickly as possible once COVID-19 is finally contained.

Are these law firm leaders prescient, out of touch, or simply locked into long-term leases? The answer may be all three.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The Only Constant Is Change

Law is traditionally slow to adopt the changes of the broader business world, but in this case I struggle to imagine that the law firms of 2022 and beyond will look like 2020. For starters, many attorneys may find they’ve developed a taste for being untethered to a physical location. No one loves spending time on a commute that could instead be spent on loved ones, personal improvement, extra billing, or just getting a few more winks of sleep. There’s also something nourishing for the soul about nailing a court argument or finalizing an eight-figure negotiation while wearing Ugg slippers. Law firm leadership expecting everyone to return to the traditional 50 hours in the office a week will likely find resistance to that notion now that the pandemic is proving we can get the jobs done in our spare rooms and guest houses.

Then there’s the pure dollars-and-cents argument. As office leases come up and firms are evaluating their next move, the lure of saving money on rent has to be strong. Real estate is usually the second-biggest line item on a firm’s expense sheet after personnel. Every dollar saved there is another dollar left over at the end-of-year distribution to the partnership. Most partnerships would jump at reducing costs and fattening their wallets.

Yet I don’t expect the legal real estate market to vanish overnight. There are at least two strong reasons for firms to maintain at least some dedicated office space: collaboration and clients.

Office space fosters collaboration both in obvious practical ways and less obvious, squishier ways. Some practices can’t operate on a laptop and cellphone basis as well as others. Litigators sometimes still need to store and review physical documents and evidence. Many mediators still prefer conference rooms to Zoom breakout rooms for negotiations. Transactional attorneys may find that deals get closed on better terms in person without Microsoft Teams’ lag time and disconnections. Having dedicated space on hand to meet those needs makes sense. Even the most dedicated of cloud-based law firms like [Fisher Broyles](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/the-most-important-law-firm-youve-never-heard-of/) maintains some office space. Meanwhile, the jury’s still out on whether firms with brick-and-mortar roots will be able to make the transition to a digital world while keeping morale high and feelings of isolation low.

For better or for worse, there also remains a subset of clients — albeit a decreasing one — that may still be attracted to the shiny objects of a fancy law firm. There are those who want to know by the pile of the carpet or the glint of the lobby sculpture that the firm they’re looking to hire is smart, strong, and expensive enough to be worth their time. Some decisions on whether to hire a law firm may still get made when the elevator dings and the client steps out into the reception area. It may seem like empty theater, but if it matters to some clients, it’s something we need to take seriously.

Where It Gets Weird

What looks less essential with each passing day, then, are the luxe private attorney offices that so many of us associate with the basic concept of being an attorney. It’s here that I see the biggest revisions developing to the traditional law firm blueprint. Some firms may abandon offices altogether in favor of working from home, or move to hoteling concepts like the Big Four. Others may give their attorneys the option of paying out of their own pockets for office space and furniture. Still others may have offices that are half the size of their current footprint. I expect to see experimentation in office solutions, and ultimately far more bespoke, cost-efficient models of officing in the legal industry than anything we’ve had in past decades.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Meanwhile, I wouldn’t be surprised in the least if some of the savings from downsizing on attorney offices isn’t poured back into upgrading the spaces that remain. This is especially true if the larger market demand for commercial real estate goes down, driving down prices. Some of the savings can be directed into going for broke on projecting success to new and ongoing customers, or into fostering and developing attorney and staff morale and firm culture through beefed-up common areas and collaboration rooms. Firms looking to reduce their attorney offices but keep their personnel happy might experiment with lounges, coffee house-like spaces, quiet spaces, nursing rooms, and other common goods that provide community and enjoyment in far more cost-effective ways.

I’m bullish on Biglaw’s prospects for experimentation and growth. The incentives, both personal and collective, people-centric and strictly financial, are all aligned to push us toward more effective, interesting, and well-tailored real estate solutions.

No matter how these new offices take shape, you can be sure that attorneys and other legal professionals will float in and out of the space much more regularly. The days of five or six days a week in the office are gone forever — no matter how much some law firm leaders try to will it away. In a competitive world, if firms don’t adopt flexible remote working policies, employees will leave to firms that will.

After all, why should we have to choose Uggs or dress shoes when we can have both?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Espy-Williams has had quite a career with the firm and will most definitely leave a footprint on its diversity and inclusion efforts going forward. After graduating from the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law in 2006, Espy-Williams served as a judicial intern to former Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears of the Supreme Court of Georgia.

She started her career at Cozen O’Connor as a contract attorney, then was promoted to an associate, became a partner in 2013, and was appointed as a Vice Chair, Office Managing Partner in 2015. Needless to say, her career advancement has been quite impressive.

This week, Lynnette D. Espy-Williams was gracious enough to spend some time with us and share her thoughts on moving from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., advice for those just starting out on their career journeys, and strategies for finding mentors and sponsors in the workplace.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): Congratulations on being named Cozen O’Connor’s first Chief Diversity Officer. Amongst the many changes, you will be moving to Washington, D.C. What will you miss most about Atlanta?

Lynnette D. Espy-Williams (LW): Thank you! There are so many things that I will miss about Atlanta! Specifically, I will miss the city’s rich and diverse culture, the arts scene, as well as all of the restaurants that I have frequented for so many years. I also leave behind a tremendous amount of friends and family.

Despite leaving behind so many “gems” that make up such an incredible city, I am so excited that I am able to return to Washington, D.C., as I went to law school nearby in Maryland. I am looking forward to exploring the city and am grateful to be taking on such an important and significant role at Cozen O’Connor.

RC: Can you share with us a little bit about your educational and career background prior to this new role within the firm?

LW: Absolutely! I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, and at a very early age, I knew that I wanted to be a lawyer. After attending Spelman College and the University Of Maryland School of Law, I had the privilege of clerking for the Georgia Supreme Court under Justice Leah Ward Sears, the first African-American female Chief Justice in the United States and the first woman and youngest person to sit on Georgia’s Supreme Court.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Shortly after my clerkship, I joined Cozen O’Connor, in December 2006. I have experience in litigating a wide variety of civil and commercial matters, including matters pertaining to professional liability, mass and complex torts, premises liability, products liability, and contract disputes. Prior to being appointed Chief Diversity Officer, I served as Vice-Chair, Office Managing Partner for Cozen O’Connor’s Atlanta office.

RC: What do you hope to accomplish in your new role as Chief Diversity Officer?

LW: There are so many things that I want to accomplish as Chief Diversity Officer so I have had to sit down and prioritize all of my goals for the upcoming year.

One of my goals is to strengthen the firm’s resource groups tailored to promote the success and inclusion of five self-identifying constituencies: (1) Asian Attorney Resource Group; (2) Black Attorney Resource Group; (3) LGBTQ Attorney Resource Group; (4) Hispanic/Latino Attorney Resource Group; and (5) Disabled and/or Veteran Attorney Resource Group.

I am also actively involved in developing a strategic plan with respect to diversity and inclusion initiatives so that we are thinking proactively as to how we can increase diversity not only internally within our firm but within the profession.

RC: What advice do you have for law students and young attorneys just beginning their respective careers?

LW: My advice for a law student or young attorney just beginning their respective careers is to spend a significant amount of time honing your skills.

Always put your best foot forward and routinely look for opportunities to improve your writing, deposition, and public speaking skills. Another way to hone your skills is to make sure you take on substantive pro bono assignments.

Not only is doing pro bono work the right thing to do, it is also important from a professional development standpoint as pro bono assignments can sometimes lead you to invaluable experiences like arguing motions in Court and deposing witnesses. Without pro bono work, you may not get these unique experiences until much later in your career. Take advantage of the learning experience!

RC: You mentioned how important it is to find a sponsor or mentor early in your career. Do you have any specific strategies for networking?

LW: It is extremely important to find a mentor and/or sponsor early in your career as a young lawyer. When I started at Cozen O’Connor in 2006, I realized pretty early on that I needed a sponsor, someone who could unilaterally change the trajectory of my career and guide my steps internally.

Given I worked out of a regional office, it was important for me to connect with someone outside of Atlanta as I knew one day, I wanted to be a part of firm management. Given my aspirations, one day, I picked up the phone and called Vincent McGuinness, Cozen O’Connor’s Managing Partner, and humbly asked him to serve as my mentor. At first, he was a bit talking aback as he had no idea who I was given I had just joined the firm and was working out of Atlanta.

However, he quickly agreed to mentor me, and over the years, he has ensured that I have received substantive assignments, has provided me with several opportunities to lead firm-wide committees, and has supported my involvement with several bar associations.

I strongly believe that my relationship with Mr. McGuinness, and the many lawyers that have helped me along the way, were vital to my success. If a young lawyer is unable to find a mentor internally, I would recommend that they look externally via bar associations, community events, etc. You never know where your next client or mentor will come from!

RC: You stated that your career arc was much more the exception than the rule. What do you mean by this?

LW: My career at Cozen O’Connor has been wonderful. I have had the opportunity to hold a management position, lead firm-wide committees, and have mentors that have poured into my personal and professional development. With that said, I know that my experience as a diverse female partner in a law firm is not the same experience that other women and/or diverse lawyers have in their respective firms.

Thus, I consider my career, and the success that I have had, to be “the exception” in Biglaw, not the rule. As Chief Diversity Officer, my responsibility is to make sure that it becomes the “rule” for diverse lawyers in our firm to receive the same opportunities, experiences and success, and to feel a part of an inclusive work environment.

RC: How are you enjoying D.C. so far?

LW: I am really enjoying my time in D.C.! My family and I are having a great time meeting new people and exploring the city. We recently visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture which was incredible! We also look forward to experiencing DC in the summer. We have heard great things about different events and festivals that we would like to explore.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

LW: I just want to thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about my new role with Cozen O’Connor.

It really is an honor to serve as Chief Diversity Officer and to lead such a dynamic firm. I look forward to making my mark in the diversity space!

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Lynnette D. Espy-Williams for taking the time to share her story with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

# 3 Final Thoughts On Dominion V. Fox
## Did Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity learn their lesson from the Dominion lawsuit? It depends what lesson you have in mind.

Fox settled with Dominion, and everyone immediately asked whether the settlement involved Fox apologizing for its conduct. The pundits did their thing.  But here’s the truth.

In the typical lawsuit, the defendant (who’s paying money) asks that the amount of the settlement be kept confidential because the defendant thinks it would be hurt by revealing the amount that it was paying. (The payment could be interpreted to be an admission of liability, even though the settlement agreement says otherwise. A large payment could encourage additional lawsuits of the same type in the future. And so on.)

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the typical lawsuit, the plaintiff doesn’t care very much about whether the amount of the payment is confidential. It would be nice, of course, to be able to say that BigCo had paid you several hundred thousand dollars because it had discriminated against you (or whatever), but the value of the settlement payment far exceeds the value of bragging about the settlement, so the plaintiff agrees to confidentiality.

What happened in Dominion against Fox? Fox agreed to pay a phenomenal amount of money to Dominion and, in the negotiations, almost certainly insisted that the amount of the settlement be kept confidential. (This is just a guess on my part, but I’d bet the mortgage on it.) Dominion said, probably early on in negotiations, that confidentiality was non-negotiable; the amount of the settlement had to be made public.

You want an apology? Fox gave 787.5 million of ’em.

But an express apology — like Fox saying, “Fox apologizes to Dominion for having broadcast false statements about Dominion’s role in the 2020 election”?  Or, better yet, Fox admitting on the air that Fox had knowingly lied? You didn’t see that. Instead, you got a mealy-mouthed concession that Fox “[acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/506100840582476089#).” That ain’t an apology; that’s lawyers crafting a statement that Dominion can insist is an apology and that Fox can insist is nothing of the sort.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Here’s my second thought: Pundits are saying that Fox is [still facing a “bigger” lawsuit against it](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/506100840582476089#). Dominion claimed only $1.6 billion in damages, but the pending Smartmatic lawsuit seeks $2.7 billion. Ergo: The Smartmatic case is bigger than the Dominion one.

This is silly. The amount that a plaintiff claims in the complaint is pure fiction.  Some junior lawyer says, “How much should we demand in the complaint? A billion? A couple billion? A gazillion?” The senior lawyer says, “A gazillion sounds about right.” And a gazillion it is.

But, at trial, where you need actual proof, it turns out that the gazillion is actually a buck fifty.

The difference between the Dominion “$1.6 billion” lawsuit and the Smartmatic “$2.7 billion” lawsuit has nothing to do with the difference between the purely fictitious $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion. The difference is instead the amount of damages that the respective plaintiffs can prove at trial. I don’t know the actual damage number that Dominion was planning to present at trial, nor do I know what damages Smartmatic’s experts are calculating. But the damage numbers are based on the companies’ respective profits lost as a result of the defamation, or the companies’ lost enterprise value as a result of the defamation, or some such thing. It has absolutely nothing to do with the amounts demanded in the two complaints, and intelligent commentators should stop insisting that it does.

Lastly: Did Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity learn their lesson from the Dominion lawsuit? It depends what lesson you have in mind. I’d bet Carlson and Hannity did learn a lesson, but it has nothing to do with making false statements on the air. The lesson, instead, is of course this: “Don’t write stupid emails!” It’s the emails that would have proved that the pundits knew the statements they were broadcasting were false, and that’s what created liability.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s how it works at every company with operations in the United States: The law department gives programs about “intelligent business communications,” advising employees to keep emails (and text messages, and so on) short, factual, and true. No jokes; no opinions; just the facts. (That really means, “No stupid emails!” But smart companies don’t put that advice explicitly in writing. The advice would later look bad to juries.)

Corporate employees hear the advice, ignore it, and continue writing stupid emails.

In some small percentage of cases, there’s later litigation. An employee’s emails are disclosed. The employee can’t believe this: “You mean we actually have to turn over to the other side the stupid things that I wrote?!” The employee is tortured for hours at deposition about his or her stupid emails. The employee is aghast: “How could I have been such a fool to write stupid emails?”

For about two weeks after the deposition, the employee remembers this lesson, and the employee does not write stupid emails. And then, the human mind being what it is, the memory of the deposition fades, and the employee starts writing stupid emails again.

What did Carlson and Hannity learn from their experience in the Dominion case? Don’t write stupid emails! (Carlson and Hannity may be reminded of that lesson when they’re deposed again in the Smartmatic case.) For two weeks or a month after the last of those depositions, the boys won’t write stupid emails. But, a couple of weeks later, human nature being what it is, Carlson and Hannity will start writing stupid emails again.

Which is good news for later plaintiffs in defamation lawsuits against Fox.

And bad news for Fox.

But did Carlson and Hannity learn not to broadcast lies?

Not if that’s the way you attract a television audience.

You may already know that Lateral Link is one of the largest and most successful legal recruiting agencies in the United States.  Maybe you’ve spoken with a Lateral Link recruiter as a potential candidate for lateral roles.  But have you considered becoming a Lateral Link recruiter yourself?

We are seeking to add to our associate and partner recruiting teams in the Southeast, Chicago/Midwest, and Northern California.  In Texas, we are hiring with a focus on partner recruiting. We are also seeking a recruiter to open a new office in London.  Please note that these roles can be done remotely!  For example, for the Southeast team, you could be based in Miami, Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, or anywhere else in the region.

Demand for our services is booming, and we are actively seeking to add recruiters to our industry-leading team.  Prior legal recruiting experience is welcome but not required.

Maybe you have a friend who would be a great recruiter?  Send them our way!  If you introduce us to someone who becomes a recruiter on our team, we will thank you with a $5000 referral fee.

Legal recruiting is a great career

Do you like talking to people?  Do you have an entrepreneurial spirit?  Do you understand the Biglaw market?  If so, you should consider a career in legal recruiting.

I made the jump from law firm partner to legal recruiting 12 years ago, and like most of my colleagues, I haven’t looked back.  No billable hours.  No one-size-fits-all compensation constraints.  No long commutes.  Recruiting is all about flexibility.  You work when and where you want, setting your own goals.  And the earning potential is unlimited: we have recruiters billing in the seven-figure range!

There has never been a better (or more lucrative!) time to join Lateral Link.  We are experiencing the best year in our history and expect to make over 500 placements in 2021.  We are placing candidates throughout the United States, and we’re increasingly active in [cross-border lateral placements](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/international-lateral-moves/).

We are open to wide range of backgrounds

Although search firm legal recruiting experience is helpful, it is by no means required.  Many of our most successful recruiters joined Lateral Link after careers as practicing attorneys or law firm recruiting coordinators.  Others have made the transition from sales roles.  What matters most is a natural ability to connect with people and a desire to build your own practice.

Curious to learn more?  Feel free to [email me](mailto:shodes@laterallink.com) for more information or to set up a call.

And as always, if you are not interested in becoming a recruiter but would like to explore a lateral law firm move, please reach out.  Now is a [fantastic time to lateral](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/dont-let-rumors-guide-your-lateral-job-search/).  Even if you aren’t ready to make an immediate jump, it’s [never too early](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/why-you-should-build-a-relationship-with-a-recruiter-now/) to start building a trusted relationship with a recruiter.

# Document Automation 101 & Why It’s Necessary For Your Workflow
## Document automation streamlines workflow and streamlining workflow results in more productivity, less wasted cost, and more time for client matters.

[](http://bit.ly/2OxGZm5)You may have heard the term, “document automation” before, but do you really understand what it is, how it works, and why it benefits your firm?

Document automation has been a standard in the legal industry for decades.  Automating the drafting and assembly process creates time saving advantages and reduces errors that are prone to happen with manual drafting.  To put it another way: document automation streamlines workflow and streamlining workflow results in more productivity, less wasted cost, and more time for client matters.

Here’s how it works: document automation starts with your firm’s exemplar documents that are drafted often.  A document automation software, in this case [Thomson Reuters’ Contract Express](https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/425213692;226661646;i), instructs a user to simply add variables (to accommodate for different clauses, names, etc.) to your exemplar document, turning it into a questionnaire, which fuels the engine behind the document’s automation. Once the questionnaire is finalized, users can complete the documents by answering the questions resulting in a finished document.

Workflow is Crucial to Efficient Work

What are the benefits to document automation?  Eliminating manual drafting removes the tedious task of updating variables within a reused document.  Consequently, steps in the drafting process are condensed and you have more control over document consistency.  Among other things the amount of errors avoided usually made with manual drafting are reduced, which in turn decreases the number of reviews and redrafts.

Don’t know where to start?  Never drafted a document for a specific topic before?  Your practice doesn’t have an available document set?  Writer’s block?  [Contract Express](http://bit.ly/2OxGZm5) is integrated with Thomson Reuters’ know-how solution, Practical Law. The integration with Practical Law provides access up to 300 pre-automated templates within Contract Express.  In times of stressful need, having access to these templates helps immensely.

More Client Collaboration

When the document is ready for the client Contract Express has the power to connect your client to you and the document via a secure web portal.  Your firm creates and controls a client site where clients log into a password-protected area to gain full access to client-specific documents.  Clients get full or limited rights to their automated documents and templates with an archived history that is easily accessible. This way practitioners and clients can work one on one within a client site.

In a time when client demands are high client collaboration is key.  The added benefits of document automation and a client site allows you to deliver quality work at a faster rate. This setting becomes the foundation for maintaining and improving client collaboration across practice groups.

Technology Provides More Benefits Than Risks

Think about the amount of time you spend drafting documents.  Are you doing that manually? How old is your software?  The dollars and time spent drafting documents adds up and much of that time and money is wasteful.  With Contract Express you can reduce drafting time, which is more money saved.

To have the ability to draft a document automatically in a fraction of the time of manual drafting is a huge advantage. Your gain is a more productive and faster workflow.  What will you do with the time?

# Quinn Emanuel To Adopt Hoteling Policy For Lawyers In Its New NYC Office
## Is hoteling the way of the future for Biglaw firms? Only time will tell, but at Quinn Emanuel, some lawyers will say adios to their own offices.

How does a top-ranked Biglaw firm with a “work from anywhere” policy manage its office space? The same way any other Biglaw firm would, but in this case, hoteling is likely to play a prime role in how offices are allocated.

Quinn Emanuel — which first instituted its [indefinite remote work policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/quinn-emanuel-will-allow-lawyers-to-work-remotely-indefinitely-from-anywhere-in-the-country/) in December 2021 — recently signed a 15-year lease in Manhattan for 132,000 square feet of office space across three floors on Fifth Avenue. Jennifer Barrett, co-managing partner of the firm’s New York office, told the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/27/quinn-emanuel-to-mix-name-plates-and-hoteling-in-new-manhattan-office/) that “beyond cool aesthetics,” the firm had been searching for “a space we could configure as a state-of-the-art location in this post-pandemic world.”

What does that mean for Quinn’s associates and partners? Here’s more information on the firm’s plans from [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/27/quinn-emanuel-to-mix-name-plates-and-hoteling-in-new-manhattan-office/):

Barrett … said leaders and site planners will work to determine how many permanent offices versus hoteling spaces to allocate in the new space by tracking the workplace habits of lawyers. …

“We are not a mandatory in-office work culture but our New York office prides itself on people loving to come into the office,” Barrett said. “We were looking for a space where we could build out ‘name plate’ offices for people who plan to come in frequently every week and state-of-the-art hoteling offices for people who come in and work from the office just like they can from home.”

Barrett, while stressing that flexibility is of the utmost importance to the firm, also noted that based on current attendance trends, it’s expected that more than half of the firm’s lawyers in New York will want a name plate office. Will everyone who wants a fixed office with their name on the door receive one? That’s yet to be determined.

Quinn Emanuel will officially move all of its attorneys to its new NYC office in early 2025.

# Will OCI Disappear At Law Schools Thanks To Biglaw's 'Precruiting'?
## Times are changing for Biglaw recruiting at law schools -- but what if things are changing a little *too* much for comfort?

Is it time to wave goodbye to OCI as we once knew it?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I think the reality is that pretty soon we’re not going to be participating in OCI at all. I’m not going to say that definitively, but it feels like we’re headed in that direction.

I wish it didn’t come to this. It was so great in the old days, we knew exactly what was happening. There are advantages to the new way of doing things—we are more in control of the candidates we see—but it’s hard because I feel like students are not getting as much time to consider and explore all their options before making a decision that’s going to impact their career for a long time.

— Caroline Menes, director of legal recruiting at Sheppard Mullin, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/02/21/stanford-and-yale-bumped-up-oci-in-response-to-precruiting-but-big-law-isnt-backing-down-from-direct-applications/) on what the precruiting of law students outside of formal on-campus recruiting programs could possibly lead to in the future. Yale and Stanford Law have already [moved the dates of their virtual on-campus interviews](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/top-law-schools-change-the-dates-of-their-virtual-interview-programs/) to begin earlier in the cycle than their recruitment programming typically has, while other law schools have yet to make a move. Nikia Gray, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement, noted that in 2023, a little less than [half of all summer associate offers](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/fomo-in-biglaw-recruiting-will-more-law-schools-switch-their-dates-for-on-campus-recruiting/) came prior to the start of law schools’ formal interview programs.

# Skadden Knows It Takes $415,000 To Be An Elite Biglaw Firm
## Of course they're matching.

Good news for associates at Skadden — for [the second time in a week](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/skadden-raises-22/), they’re seeing raises. Of course, they aren’t the only ones. To keep their elite status and attract/retain associates, firms have embarked on a series of raises — nudged forward by[ Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), then [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/), and now [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/). In fact, this unprecedented series of compensation moves is the big story in Biglaw this week/month/year. Firms are ponying up increasingly large sums of money (particularly for the super valuable midlevel and senior ranks) to keep associates happily billing.

And it was pretty much a given that Skadden, ranked #5 on the Am Law 100, with an impressive $2,662,890,000 in gross revenue in 2020, would match the top of the market salaries. Take a gander at the new compensation scale at Skadden:

Class Year	Salary
2014+	$415,000
2015	$400,000
2016	$370,000
2017	$345,000
2018	$295,000
2019	$250,000
2020	$225,000
2021	$215,000
The increases are retroactive to January 1. You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/skadden-re-raise-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Hint: Not including LeClairRyan, which went from 179 to defunct over the last year, this Biglaw firm had the steepest decline, going from 86th in the 2019 ranking to falling out of the top 100 firms in this year’s list.

# Former Skadden Associate Is First To Be Sentenced In Mueller Probe
## He'll probably lose his license to practice law, too.

It was just last week that Alex van der Zwaan, a former associate at the London office of Skadden Arps, turned in a sentencing memo to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, begging for leniency in sentencing — specifically, for a sentence that [didn’t include jail time](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/former-skadden-associate-who-pleaded-guilty-in-mueller-probe-begs-for-no-jail-time/). Van der Zwaan had been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for lying to investigators in the Russia probe about his communications with former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates, and he pleaded guilty shortly thereafter.

Today, in the first criminal punishment imposed as a result of the Mueller investigation, Van der Zwaan — who faced up to six months in jail — received a 30-day sentence. “What I did was wrong,” he said in an apology given during his hearing.

Van der Zwaan was also ordered to pay a $20,000 fine and serve two months of supervised release.

[Judge] Jackson refused van der Zwaan’s request to just pay a fine for lying to Mueller team. “We’re not talking about a traffic ticket,” she said.

Van der Zwaan stands to lose much more than just his freedom for a month’s time. He’s already lost his prestigious job at Skadden, his “professional life has been destroyed,” and he’ll likely lose his license to practice law in the United Kingdom. Van der Zwaan lied to investigators to save his career, and now he doesn’t have one. He’ll be trading his golden Biglaw handcuffs for standard-order shackles.

As noted by Judge Jackson, Van der Zwaan “put his personal interests ahead of the interests of justice” and should have known better, since he’s an attorney. At least his sentence is short enough that he’ll be able to reunite with his wife — whom he apologized to in court — before she gives birth to their first child this summer.

# Merger Mania! First Associate Raises, Now A Transatlantic Merger
## American firm eyes a London expansion.

After [raising associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prodigal-law-firm-returns-to-cravath-scale/) last week (but [not so much for the counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/whats-up-with-counsel-salaries/)), Haynes and Boone dropped some more big firm news: they’re merging!

The Texas-based firm’s new partner is London-based Curtis Davis Garrard, “a boutique firm specialising in the provision of maritime legal services with a particular focus on projects and disputes in the shipbuilding and offshore oil and gas sectors.” Sounds like a perfect partner for a firm based in Dallas with oodles of energy business. The addition of the boutique (the deal is still seeking regulatory approval) will give Haynes and Boone its long sought-after London presence.

Though honestly, the best line from the press release has to be…

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The merger underscores the firm’s belief that London’s preeminence as a commercial and financial center will not be impacted, long term, by the U.K. vote to exit the European Union.

Yeah. That vote must have been a real nervous day for a firm who just put up a bunch of cash in associate raises and had a merger all but sealed only to watch a bunch of nativist drunks torpedo the economy. Good times!

That said, Haynes and Boone kept its wits about it and pushed ahead, having faith that the UK will reverse course now that they’ve had a taste of the hangover.

For all of CDG’s lawyers, welcome to American Biglaw!

# Plunging In Headfirst Can Be Dangerous To More Than Just Your Health
## Resist the urge to plunge in and act too quickly. Instead, adopt a structured problem-solving strategy and leap forward with a plan.

In August of 2020, I wrote my very first blog post about life as an in-house counsel. In that article ([In-House Counsel — More Than Just a Legal Advisor](https://ironcladapp.com/blog/counsel-as-strategic-advisors/)), I wrote about the importance of being more than just a legal advisor. I wrote that, while a good general counsel was responsible “for spotting issues, for providing objective legal advice, for drafting and reviewing agreements, and for providing possible solutions to issues important to the organization,” I also noted that a great general counsel was so much more. A great general counsel was also responsible for “serv[ing] as a strategic business partner committed to the advancement of the organization’s business.”

To serve as an effective strategic business partner, a general counsel must work with internal and external business partners to ensure that the organization uses effective problem-solving strategies to achieve the organization’s vision mission, objectives, and goals. While this may seem self-evident, I assure you it is not.

When assisting your internal and external business partners in identifying and addressing a specific problem, be sure to use a deliberate — not the reflexive — mindset. Resist the urge to plunge in and act too quickly. Instead, adopt a structured problem-solving strategy and leap forward with a plan.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
How can you tell if you are operating using the reflexive mindset?

- You know you are acting with a reflexive mindset when you accept the problem as stated and fail to question what you have been told. When you assume that what you have been told is correct and complete, it is a recipe for disaster. While it is fine to trust the people with whom you work, but you also must verify the information you receive. You will only be able to give good advice if you have confirmed that you have correctly identified the problem that needs to be solved.
- You know you are acting with a reflexive mindset when you immediately assume you have the best solution and you move quickly to undertake the tasks required to solve the problem. When you work for an organization long enough, it is easy to assume that you have seen it all. Resist that mindset at all cost. All problems are not created equal. The facts that form the basis of the problem will deviate slightly from problem to problem. When the facts deviate so should your solution.
- You know you are acting with a reflexive mindset when you do not bring other internal or external business to the table and ask for input. Complex problems can rarely be successfully solved by one person or one department alone. It is so important to consult other internal and external partners who will be impacted by the results.
- You know you are acting with a reflexive mindset when you “shoot from the hip.” When you “shoot from the hip” and provide on the spot advice, you are essentially acknowledging that the problem has been correctly framed and the solution to that problem is a good one. You may actually be making the problem worse and not better.
If this sounds anything like how you have solved problems, you may be acting as a result of “plunging-in bias.” An Academy of Management Learning & Education article written by Gaurab Bhardwaj, Alia Crocker, Jonathan Sims, and Richard D. Wang, all of Babson College, called, “Alleviating the Plunging-In Bias, Elevating Strategic Problem Solving” explains a little-known, but widespread, bias that can affect all aspects of life: plunging-in bias. They define the bias as “not understanding the problem and not thinking about how best to solve it before starting to solve it … a common but little recognized cognitive bias.”

According to Bhardwaj, “Good people can make bad decisions because they don’t follow the right approach. All of us, given our proclivity for action and our desire to do good things, can fall into the plunging-in bias,” Bhardwaj said. “It’s a trap we fall into every day. In our work lives, in our personal lives.”

The next time you are asked to solve a problem think before you plunge in and try to solve the problem. Consider adopting Albert Einstein’s approach to problem solving instead:

If I were given an hour in which to do a problem upon which my life depended, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes reviewing it and five minutes solving it.

# California-Based Biglaw Firm Matches Cravath In Most Offices
## Another Cali firm raises salaries.

Good (and early in the day) news for associates at Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe. The Biglaw firm has gotten on board with other West Coast Biglaw giants like [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-bumps-salary-to-attract-and-retain-the-best-and-brightest-attorneys/), [Wilson Sonsini](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/silicon-valley-giant-finally-moves-on-associate-pay/), and [Fenwick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/that-180k-payday-is-spreading-on-the-west-coast/), and moved their associates up to the MoneyLaw scale, established by Cravath last week. Well, for associates in most of their offices at least.

According to an email sent out by firm leadership this morning, U.S. associates in “major markets” will be getting the Cravath scale. But take heart, because associates in Portland, Seattle, and Sacramento will still be getting raises between $20,000 and $45,000 depending on class year.

Another interesting note is that for eighth-year associates, in all U.S. offices, the last $15,000 of compensation is dependent on ratings and hitting billing targets. It’s unclear how difficult attaining those standards will be for senior associates, but one tipster characterized the move as “screwing” senior associates.

# What Corporate Lawyers Encountered In The Pandemic Era
## The M&A market ground to a halt but quickly became extremely active. Here, two Kirkland partners weigh in.

In early 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic performed its slow roll toward the severe crisis it would become, uncertainty abounded. And if there is one thing the corporate world doesn’t like, it’s uncertainty, including in the area of mergers and acquisitions.

A few months after the federal government declared a national emergency in mid-March of last year, M&A activity ground to a halt as everyone tried to assess the shape of the predicament.

“When the pandemic first hit and people realized this wasn’t going to be two or three weeks and then back to normal, we spent a lot of time with strategic clients and private equity clients thinking about balance sheets, and whether deals would fall apart and if financing was going to be available,” said David B. Feirstein, a partner with Kirkland & Ellis who is also co-chair of the [Practising Law Institute’s program, Hot Topics in Mergers and Acquisitions 2021](https://bit.ly/3zCpbgT). “This was a horrific crisis, but it didn’t end up as a banking and debt-market crisis.”

In other words, credit would not dry up as it had during the crisis of 2008. As a result, the hard times in M&A were relatively brief.

“Things basically shut down in mid-March of 2020,” said Eric L. Schiele, a partner and member of the executive committee at Kirkland, also a co-chair of the program. “Then, right around the turn of the third quarter, the M&A market became extremely active, and quite frankly it’s been on a tear since then. The second quarter of this year, in terms of number of deals, was the busiest quarter on record.”

A Hard Look

As many businesses began to feel the full impact of the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020, Schiele said most parties involved in large pending mergers or acquisitions “took a close look to see if their deals were at risk.”

Despite this, most deals closed. For example, Schiele worked on two large sell-side deals announced around the beginning of February 2020, “right before the pandemic hit in earnest.” 

After some wrangling, both were completed.

Feirstein said a lot of time was devoted to renegotiations during this period. “When all was said and done, I think the list of deals involving termination or subject to litigation took up no more than a PowerPoint slide. It wasn’t two deals, but it wasn’t a hundred either.”

This could be because corporate law eschews a broken M&A agreement. 

“The underlying premise in Delaware courts is that it should be difficult to get out of a deal once it’s announced,” Schiele said. This is significant because that state’s law governs the majority of the Fortune 500 companies.

The most common points of dispute in this context are operating covenants and material adverse effect clauses (also known as a material adverse change).

An operating covenant is a suite of provision in a merger agreement that governs the period of time between the announcement of a deal and its closing, Feirstein explained.

“The buyer wants you to operate your business within certain parameters,” he said, “and wants to make sure it is getting the same company” for which it originally negotiated.

Companies in sectors like retail and hospitality could not possibly maintain the status quo of their businesses as Covid-19 spread. Whether it was a drastic reduction in revenue or drastic measures taken to scrape through the crisis, change happened.

A significant Delaware case decided in November 2020 said no to the MAE argument and a very fact-specific yes to the covenant argument, as well as re-emphasized lessons about careful drafting.

In AB Stable VIII LLC v. Maps Hotels, the court held, among a host of other issues, that the target company made “extensive changes to its business . . . relieving Buyer of its obligation to close.”

The court said “the most logical reading” of the operating covenant in question was that the target company was required to seek the buyer’s consent before it took action outside of the ordinary course of business. Because it failed to do so, it failed to comply with the covenant, pandemic or no pandemic.

“There are several different ways one can word a covenant to allow someone to react [to outside events] in a reasonable way,” Schiele said. “We again re-learned what we had already learned, over and over: the words matter.”

A High Bar

On the other hand, the buyer’s attempt in AB Stable to use an MAE to get out of the deal failed. In fact, the assertion of an MAE or MAC is a difficult argument because it requires something beyond general damage to the business.

“A MAC clause is typically drafted to exclude general market conditions,” Schiele said. “The conventional MAC is meant to be directed specifically to the target business.”

Feirstein explained that an MAE or MAC is a definition in a merger agreement that is generally subject to a number of negotiated exclusions.

Although some dealmakers included the word “pandemic” in their exclusions before Covid-19, it didn’t take long for its use to spread, a typical response to a crisis. For example, when a volcano erupted in Iceland in 2010 and its ash restricted air travel for a while, “volcanoes were suddenly in every MAC definition,” Schiele said.

However, even absent a specific term, something like a pandemic is most often going to be excluded from a MAC because, Schiele said, “clearly it is a macro event.” 

The Bounce

Not many parties are trying to back out of their deals these days, even as the pandemic drags on.

“In the first half of 2021 we saw almost $3 trillion in M&A volume, one of the most active periods we’ve ever had,” Feirstein said.

“Tech has been very busy, and healthcare was quite busy over the period, from this time last year when it was clear that the M&A market was back,” Schiele said. 

A surplus of cash was another factor. Memories of the 2008 financial crisis had pushed many companies into a defensive crouch.

“Companies built up liquidity because, in many cases, their cash flows were substantially impaired, if not halted altogether, and they didn’t know if debt financing was going to continue to be available or for how long,” Schiele said. “But because of, among other things, the actions taken by the Federal Reserve, liquidity remained readily available. Then as the crisis began to abate many companies emerged with war chests of cash to deploy that would otherwise sit on their balance sheets earning historically low interest.”

Elizabeth M. Bennett was a business reporter who moved into legal journalism when she covered the Delaware courts, a beat that inspired her to go to law school. After a few years as a practicing attorney in the Philadelphia region, she decamped to the Pacific Northwest and returned to freelance reporting and editing.

Gender equality in the legal profession has become even more important in the #MeToo era, and the last year has brought to light many of the disparities that women face when they head into the office each and every day. From pay to partnership promotions to the composition of leadership committees to family policies, there are many areas where law firms must change to keep up with the times. Thankfully, law firms are becoming more progressive, but which firms are doing the best they can for women in all areas?

This year, the Yale Law Women released its inaugural ranking of the Top 10 Female-Friendly Firms, piggybacking off its annual list of the Top 10 Family-Friendly Firms. We cover the latter ranking every year (see our posts from [2017](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2017/), [2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2016/), [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2015/), [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2014/), [2013](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/the-top-ten-family-friendly-law-firms-2013/), [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/the-2012-top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law/), [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/top-ten-family-friendly-firms-according-to-yale-law-women/), [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/05/family-friendly-law-firms/), [2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/08/yale-law-women-anoint-top-ten-family-friendly-firms/), and [2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/non-sequiturs-09-08-08/)), and intend to cover YLW’s important new ranking every year in the future.

Which firms made the cut in 2018? Let’s take a look at the latest rankings.

The YLW also awarded Category Honors in those three categories:

Gender Equity

- At least 50% of associates were women at the following firms: Arnoled & Porter; Bryan Cave; Cleary Gottlieb; Drinker Biddle; Hogan Lovells; Holland & Knight; Littler; McDermott Will; Morgan Lewis; O’Melveny; and Squire Patton Boggs.

Training & Mentorship

- The following firms had the highest percentage of women partners participating in firm mentorship programs: Linklaters; O’Melveny; and Shearman & Sterling.
Congratulations to all of the firms that made it onto the Yale Law Women’s first-ever ranking of the most female-friendly firms. What’s interesting (to me) is the fact that not all of the most female-friendly firms were able to make it onto the YLW’s top 10 ranking of the most family-friendly firms. We wonder why that is…

Here’s the list of the most family-friendly firms according to Yale Law Women:

- Bryan Cave
- Fish & Richardson
- Hunton & Williams
- McDermott Will & Emery
- Morgan, Lewis & Bockius
- Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe
- Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman
- Reed Smith
- Vinson & Elkins

In 2018, the following firms were dropped from the list after having made an appearance last year: Cleary Gottlieb; Jenner & Block; King & Spalding; Munger Tolles & Olson; O’Melveny & Myers; Proskauer Rose; and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.

Here’s a round-up of useful information about some of the YLW study’s findings:

Billable Hours & Compensation:Of the firms reporting the number of billable hours that their attorneys worked in 2017, junior associates on average worked 1,734 billable hours, senior associates on average worked 1,890 billable hours, and partners on average worked 1,615 billable hours. Fifty-six percent of firms required full-time associates to work a minimum number of billable hours to receive a bonus; for those firms, the median minimum was 1,910 hours. Thirty-three percent of firms counted mentoring or time spent serving on committees as partially or fully billable.

Parental & Family Accomodations: Of the firms surveyed, 65% of firms offer paid primary caregiver leave of at least 90 days, 32% of attorneys taking some amount of caregiver leave were men, 40% of firms allowed attorneys to take some number of years off and return, and 46% of firms offered paid caregiver leave for events other than the birth or adoption of a child (e.g., elder care or long-term illness in the family).

Part-Time & Flex-Time: Of the firms surveyed, 5.5% of associates worked on part-time schedules (and of those working part-time, 70% were women), 89% of firms allow attorneys to work on flexible full-time schedules, 4.7% of partners worked on part-time schedules, and 17% of attorneys promoted to partner in 2017 had previously worked or were currently working part-time or flexible full-time schedules when promoted.

The YLW also awarded Category Honors in two of those categories:

Parental & Family Accomodations

- The following firms offered the greatest number of weeks for paid primary caregiver leave: Hogan Lovells; Morrison & Foerster; Orrick; and Winston & Strawn.
Part-Time & Flex-Time

- The following firms had the highest percentage of attorneys promoted to partner in 2017 who have worked part-time or flex-time schedules: Morgan Lewis; Orrick; and Winston & Strawn.

While vast improvements have been made in terms of gender equity and parental accommodations offerings at large law firms, there is still a lot of work to be done. We said this in the past, but it bears repeating in times like these: “The legal profession has come a long way in terms of attempting to afford equal opportunities for success for both men and women, but it’s still got a long way to go. Why are lawyers still hurrying up and waiting for change?” Be forces for good at your firms. Women deserve to be treated equally, and allies have never been more important. Offer help where help is needed, and together, we can achieve true greatness.

# Massive Furloughs Hit This Biglaw Firm
## Twenty-five percent of staff has been furloughed!

The hits just keep on coming.

If you thought being perennially in the Am Law 100 rankings would somehow shield a Biglaw firm from having to make tough cuts during economic hard times, well, the coronavirus is here to laugh at your hubris. Here at Above the Law, we’ve been inundated with reports of firms making tough cost-cutting measures in order to weather the economic downturn, and it’s clear even large national firms are feeling the pinch.

The latest Biglaw firm to make cuts in Nixon Peabody. Though the firm hasn’t lowered the boom on attorneys (so far), an astonishing ~25 percent of staff members have been furloughed. The furlough becomes effective on April 6th and will remain in place “until further notice.”

To secure top-tier talent, law firms must understand and respond to the shifting preferences and expectations of associates. The purpose of this article is to help law firms better understand what associates are looking for when considering a lateral move. Equipped with this information, firms will be better positioned to critically analyze policies and procedures that may be inhibiting recruitment and growth efforts.

Today’s associates want two things. No, it’s not better snacks in the break room. It’s transparency and fairness – a prominent theme throughout this article. Considering these trends and expectations will ensure that your law firm is an attractive option for lateral attorneys.

The Pursuit of Transparent Compensation

At the heart of candidate expectations is an unequivocal demand for transparent compensation. Transparency starts at the beginning of the job search and sets the stage for a positive or negative candidate experience.

There is a high demand for transparent salaries. Lateral associates want to know the salary for each job they are considering before applying. In fact, compensation expectations are often included in the first conversation legal recruiters have with their candidates. Thus, the first step in attracting the best candidates is to be clear on compensation. Firms can create clarity by providing a salary range in the job description and sharing this range with their recruitment partners. Salary transparency ensures that both parties are aligned before investing time and energy into the interview process.

Transparency also extends to the offer process. If a candidate discloses a target salary and the firm agrees to interview that candidate, the firm’s offer should reflect the candidate’s target number. In a real-life example, a candidate was transparent and ensured salary alignment by disclosing her target salary, but the offer she received was $25,000 less than previously discussed. This discrepancy left the candidate with a negative impression of the firm, which ultimately resulted in an offer that was not accepted. To ensure that your offers are accepted, discuss realistic salary ranges as an initial matter and ensure that the candidate’s salary request fits within your compensation plan and structure.

Valuing Contributions Beyond Billable Hours

Transparency drives candidates to the firm, but equitable compensation helps them stay. Associates and partners alike are expressing a desire for recognition and compensation for their contributions outside of billable hours, including activities such as recruitment, training, diversity programs, and business development. Oftentimes, these important yet non-billable activities are not taken into consideration when determining overall compensation. In a real-life example, a partner’s expertise, ethnicity, and gender were leveraged to obtain new business but the partner received no credit or other form of compensation for helping to bring in that new business to the firm. To maintain equitable compensation, develop a system to appropriately value non-billable contributions.

Redefining Bonus Structures

The legal industry is experiencing a significant shift in how bonuses are perceived and valued by candidates. Disenchantment with discretionary bonuses is growing. More and more candidates favor transparent, formulaic bonus structures. Associates want to know what goals they are required to meet and what they will receive in return. They crave clear guidelines and expect to be presented with a written bonus structure.

Associates are also conducting cost-benefit analyses to evaluate the best way to spend their time. Bonus structures that provide an hourly rate for hours billed in excess of the firm’s requirement are being strictly scrutinized. Accordingly, the law firm’s formula must be motivating and competitive. In two real-life examples, one associate earns a $1,500 bonus for every 100 hours billed over 1,900 hours while the other earns $75 per hour billed over 1,900. The first associate calculated that this bonus amounts to $15 per hour and felt that they could be paid more working a second job or forgoing the bonus altogether while the second associate billed 2,300 hours and earned a $30,000 bonus. The first associate felt demotivated and undervalued while the other felt motivated and excited to succeed.

In another notable trend, many candidates (associates and partners alike) are willing to exchange the promise of a large bonus for a slightly higher base salary even if it means a reduction in overall compensation. In another real-life example, an associate expressed more interest in a compensation structure with a base salary of $200,000 and a $10,000 bonus than a base salary of $150,000 with a $100,000 bonus. These trends highlight a preference for predictability, stability, and transparency.

Let’s not forget bonuses based on collections. Associates are turned off by bonuses that are only paid when and if the client pays. While associates understand that there is a business reason for linking bonuses to collections, associates feel that they have no control over when and if a client pays their bill. This issue is also compounded when the associate exclusively works for one client who has a reputation for payment delays or a client has strict billing rules. Unlinking associate bonuses to client-dependent activities will create a more equitable environment and culture.

Bonus structures – if designed properly – have the potential to attract, motivate, and retain candidates. Firms should review their bonus plan and evaluate it with a critical eye. It may also be an opportunity to save money and enhance culture while also better reflecting associate compensation trends and desires.

The Desire for Upward Progression

Associates crave firms that offer an upward trajectory. After all, no one wants to be at a dead-end job. Associates are seeking firms with reputations for offering annual raises and a clear path to partnership. In a real-life example, an associate with a four-year tenure at her firm made a lateral move because she had not received a raise in over two years. If your firm struggles to provide annual raises and has no defined path to partnership, your firm is likely a less attractive option to laterals. To combat these issues, carry out intentional salary adjustments, calendar time each year to review salaries, and document the path to partnership.

The Imperative for Determined  Leave

Similar to salary, candidates are demanding transparency around time off and leave of absence. Vacation days and parental leave are of high interest. Candidates are now less content with open-ended leave policies and desire specific and numerical leave policies. They do not want to guess how much time off is too much or too little. They want to know the firm’s expectations upfront (usually in the form of a formal written policy) and adhere to those requirements. In particular, associates want to know the firm’s policy on leave before accepting an offer. This is understandable as policies often vary from firm to firm. To attract top candidates, law firms should consider memorializing their policies in written documents and actively promote their policies during the interview process. Doing so will ensure that candidates are well-informed and eliminate the need for candidates to initiate this taboo yet crucial conversation.

Embracing Flexibility: The Hybrid Work Model

The demand for flexibility is stronger than ever, with many candidates seeking firms that have adopted the hybrid work model. In particular, candidates seek an established, written policy clearly identifying the number of days expected to be worked in office. In a real-life example, a firm offering hybrid work (1 day in the office per week) is able to attract talent at salaries well below market. Offering this work model has saved the firm thousands of dollars per attorney in base salaries. This approach also helps to retain attorneys because employees highly value this level of flexibility and it is less likely to be found at competitor firms. If your firm is considering adopting a hybrid work model, make sure you have the necessary technological infrastructure, are able to maintain a level of mentorship and support, and clearly communicate expectations.

A Call for Transparency and Fairness

Transparency and fairness stand out as the prevailing themes in the current landscape of candidate preferences. Law firms that align their policies and procedures with these principles will position themselves as attractive employers for today’s legal talent. Embracing these trends will not only enhance the firm’s reputation but will also contribute to the long-term success and stability of the firm.

# Bountiful Bonuses For All: The Firms That Are Truly Spreading The Wealth
## We know that lawyers are getting showered in cash, but what about their colleagues on the staff side?

Ever since Biglaw started bestowing raises and bonuses upon associates, we’ve received a slew of emails from law firm support staff wondering what their fate may be as the Benjamins continue to rain down upon their colleagues. After all, it takes an army for law firms this large to run, and the behind-the-scenes battalions of staff members deserve their due, too.

Which firms have gone out of their way to show their support staff that they truly matter? Which firms have dipped into their pockets to say thank you to their staff?

This is exactly what we’d like to know. If your firm has increased wages for staff or offered bonuses to staff members, please be sure to reach out to us. We want to know if your firm is really spreading the wealth to all employees.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Merger Activity Very Likely To Soar To New Heights In 2024
## Law firm growth via merger may be at an 'an all-time high' this year. Has your firm got the urge to merge?

When 2024 first began, industry experts predicted that law firms would have [quite the “appetite” for mergers](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/law-firms-really-have-the-urge-to-merge-in-2024/), with one analyst going so far as to say that interest in growth via merger was at “an all-time high.” Lo and behold, those predictions have come true, with 20 mergers already completed in just the first quarter of the year alone — a 25% increase over merger activity that took place in Q1 of 2023.

As noted in a recent report by Fairfax Associates, all of these mergers reflect “a likely uptick in law firm merger activity in 2024.” Here are some additional details, courtesy of the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/01/with-high-interest-in-law-firm-acquisitions-a-likely-uptick-in-mergers-underway/):

Indeed, with the benefits of scale more apparent, more firms than ever before are willing to consider marriage proposals. And firms with between 400 and 800 lawyers are especially hungry to acquire smaller firms right now, which themselves may be looking at succession planning and trying to find ways to provide a boost for the future, noted Lisa Smith, a principal at Fairfax.

“I think it’s more of the same,” Smith said during an interview, on the merger dynamics across the industry. “But it is picking up. So, I do expect that we’ll see more total mergers for 2024 than we saw in 2023.”

In 2023, Fairfax tallied 48 total law firm mergers, including five “large-firm” mergers (i.e., combinations between firms with 100+ lawyers each). With nearly half of last year’s total merger count being completed in the first quarter, it looks like 2024 merger activity will indeed be up.

Which firms have the urge to merge? We know that the A&O Shearman deal will be official in May, and Dentons is set to combine with yet another firm sometime soon. If you know of any other high-profile merger that may be underway, please don’t hesitate to let us know via [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or text us at (646) 820-8477. Thanks.

# Biglaw Firm Plans A September Return To Office, But Has No Plans To Make Lawyers Come In 5 Days Each Week
## Another law firm with a very flexible return to office work policy.

Flexibility continues to remain the goal for law firms considering a return to in-office business in the wake of the pandemic. Yet another Biglaw firm is planning to fully reopen its U.S. offices after Labor Day, and until then anyone who wants to return to their desks will be doing so on a completely voluntary basis.

Kramer Levin — a firm that came in at No. 98 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, with $390,000,000 gross revenue in 2020 — is expecting attorneys to return to the office “sometime in September, but not before September 20.” This timeline will give everyone a chance to make arrangements for future needs, like child care, elder care, schooling, and commuting.

In an email sent yesterday by co-managing partners Paul Schoeman and Howard Spilko, they reiterated flexibility was of the utmost importance, and that attorneys (and perhaps staffers) would not have to be in the office five days each week:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A key takeaway from the survey we conducted last year is that you want flexibility in where you work. We are working on the parameters and protocols for our return, including developing a flexible work policy that will address the expected number of days in the office per week and many other details. We are planning for our attorneys to be able to work some days in the office and some days remotely on average each week. Where roles and responsibilities permit for our staff, we are also developing flexibility arrangements.

That sounds pretty promising. “We are thankful for the progress made on the COVID-19 front, optimistic about the future and pleased that we can begin planning for our return to our offices in September,” Schoeman and Spilko noted in a statement about the firm’s reopening plans. “We want to provide ample time for our people to make this transition, and we are developing plans for there to be flexibility in where people work when we do return.”

The co-managing partners continued, speaking to Kramer Levin being built on its strong relationships that foster collaboration, mentorship, growth and excellent client service, concluding, “Our goal is to find a balance that ensures we continue to build on those fundamentals. We are inspired by the resilience of our community and confident we will find the right path for a smooth transition back to the office.”

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# First, Biglaw Rejected Him. Now He's A Partner And He Wants To Help Young Lawyers

In 2002, Brian Potts, then a law student at Vermont Law School, wrote to Perkins Coie, an Am Law 100 law firm, inquiring about a job. The firm responded by mail politely informing him that no positions were available.

Almost 20 years later, [he is now a partner](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/brian-h-potts.html) at Perkins Coie’s Madison, Wisconsin, office.

But he kept that rejection letter. Last month, he posted a copy of it on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6693931728958046208/) with the classic words, “Law Students: If at first you don’t succeed, try try again.”

His post went viral. It has been viewed more than 3.5 million times and received over 48,000 positive responses. Many people have reached out to him requesting advice, and as a result, he is currently booked out for at least a month speaking with law students and recent graduates.

I reached out to Brian to learn more about his story. Here are his answers to my questions.

So what did you do after getting the rejection letter?

During my second year, I applied to every AmLaw 100 firm (and many AmLaw 200 firms) and got form rejection letters from all of them (including the one from Perkins). I kept them to motivate myself. I also applied to about 15 or 20 firms in the Kentucky area (where I’m from), and the only summer associate job I was offered was at the firm where my step-grandfather was a partner in Lexington, Kentucky.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I did very well during my summer associate gig, and they made me an offer. I then reapplied to dozens of top firms with an offer in hand and ended up getting an interview with only one firm but not an offer (it was not an AmLaw firm, but a great environmental boutique in D.C.).  So, I went to Kentucky after law school to begin my career.

A year in, I decided to go to Berkeley to get an LL.M — mostly as a way to get Berkeley’s name on my resume. During my year at Berkeley, I published an article in the Harvard Environmental Law Review (which was a huge deal — at least to me). I also got all As.

Even with Berkeley and the publication on my resume, when I reapplied to all of the top AmLaw firms in Chicago and Madison, I again got form rejection letters from all of them except from Baker MacKenzie in Chicago. I ended up interviewing at Baker but didn’t get an offer. I did, however, land an associate offer from a well-respected midlevel firm in Madison, which is where my wife is from. So, we moved to Madison.

When did you start getting attention from a major law firm?

A year later, a recruiter working for Foley & Lardner called me about an associate position in their Madison office. Although I was happy where I was, it was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. They were looking for a midlevel environmental associate with three to five years of experience. I was then a third-year so I perfectly fit the bill. And I “clicked” with the partners at Foley who I interviewed with.

So how did you like it at Foley?

I liked it. I ended up doing incredibly well at Foley; I made partner in the shortest time period possible at age 32.

How did you make partner in such a short period of time?

Hard work and luck. I met my hours requirements every year; and I treated the partners like I would treat my clients. Basically, I did whatever needed to be done to make the partners’ lives easier. And because the partners trusted me, I started to get a lot of client interaction. Eventually clients started to notice and appreciate my work. But there’s no doubt that I was also a bit lucky on the business development front. I made friends in town who trusted me, and some of them ended up in jobs where they could refer business to me.

When you transferred to an AmLaw 100 firm, were there any differences in the office culture and expectations from you?

Honestly, the biggest difference was in the dollar value of the matters I got to work on. The hours requirements and day-to-day expectations were pretty similar.

Describe your transition to Perkins Coie. 

I lateraled to Perkins three and a half years ago because of a client conflict. It was nerve racking. But all of my major clients came with me. Things are going extremely well in my practice now. Our group in Madison has grown from three to six attorneys (and we have a new associate joining this fall). I was also recently made co-chair of the firm’s Energy Industry Group.

During your career, what do you think helped you to get noticed?

I’ve tried to distinguish myself since law school by writing legal articles and op-eds. I also now teach a class on Renewable Energy Development & Project Finance at my alma mater, Vermont Law School. And I’ve founded two startup companies, including inventing the [LegalBoard](https://legalkeyboards.com/products/legal-wireless), the first and only keyboard for lawyers ([which Above The Law has covered extensively](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/this-week-in-legal-tech-the-keyboard-that-consumed-the-legal-profession/)).

There are many law students and young lawyers who want to emulate your accomplishment. What steps should they take now and later to maximize their chances of being hired?  

Spend an inordinate amount of time working on your writing (whether you are an excellent writer or not) and studying your area of the law. Work hard. And don’t panic if you haven’t landed your dream job yet. It may be hard to imagine now — but you will be your most marketable three to five years after starting to practice law. So, bide your time.

Also, [email me](BPotts@perkinscoie.com). I recently asked for mentoring help on LinkedIn (since I’ve been inundated with requests for advice). More than 70 accomplished lawyers have already contacted me with offers to help. Together we are starting the LinkedIn Legal Mentor Network. Law students and recent grads can just email me, and I’ll refer them to a few contacts who have aligning interests from the network.

I want to thank Brian Potts for his time and for his offering to help young lawyers at a very difficult time. If you have a unique success story you want to share, please reach out to me.

# Outside Counsel Rankings List The Firms You Want To Call
## Our second annual look at the firms in-house counsel think you should call.

[](http://bit.ly/2EUI9X1)Dear law firms, we have your report card.

Welcome to our [second annual outside counsel rankings](http://bit.ly/2EUI9X1). The conceit behind this list is simple and, I think, powerful. We’ve asked in-house counsel to rank the firms they work with and rate their satisfaction with the work.

It seems to me that asking your clients what they think of you is something that every law firm should do. It seems to me that looking at what clients say about law firms is something that other clients should look at.

Here’s the key part of our methodology:

In late 2018 and through January of this year, we reached out to corporate counsel and in-house attorneys at thousands of companies, ranging from small and medium-sized private companies to large public corporations. Ultimately, roughly 1,000 in-house lawyers — from nearly 500 companies and over 40 cities — shared with us their evaluations of their companies’ outside law firms. Our survey was direct. We asked counsel two simple questions: 1.) “Which law firms does your company engage for legal services?” and 2.) “Please indicate the highest level legal work for which your company will engage the particular firm(s).” The “levels” of work were defined along a four-point scale:

* Cost-efficient, bulk tasks (1)
* Routine matters (2)
* High-value, complex matters (3)
* “Bet-the-company” matters (4)

Listen to [what in-house counsel say](http://bit.ly/2EUI9X1) about these firms. I would.

# Biglaw Firm In The Midst Of Massive Partner Defections

Oof, these numbers are really something. The Pittsburgh-based Biglaw firm K&L Gates has been steadily losing attorneys all year long. According to ALM Intelligence data, from December 2018 through October 2019, the firm lost a total of 96 partners, while only picking up 32 in that timeframe. That net decrease represents 7.9 percent of the total partnership. And across all attorneys, the firm is net down 56 lawyers.

The partner defections were spread throughout the firm’s offices. The most recent included nine partners from Australia [who left as part of a 28-attorney group last month](https://www.law.com/legal-week/2019/11/17/defectors-from-kl-gates-launch-employment-firm-in-australia/). While that’s certainly a hefty departure, the firm also saw 17 partners leave in Warsaw, 10 in Pittsburgh, six in London, and five in Boston.

As[ reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/11/25/kl-gates-defections-follow-years-of-financial-declines/) Law.com, the firm did better in the other categories of attorneys (counsel and associates) where, on balance, the firm didn’t lose many bodies:

Looking at the rest of its lawyer ranks, K&L Gates hired 59 counsel and lost 61 from mid-November 2018 to mid-November 2019, data showed. It did hire more associates than it lost—164 hires compared with 154 departures. The greatest associate hiring was in Singapore, followed by Pittsburgh and Seattle, then Charlotte and Boston—though Pittsburgh, Seattle and Charlotte were also among the top offices for associate defections.

In a statement, the firm expressed confidence in their strategic direction:

“As a firm, we are quite pleased with the laterals who have joined us over the last several years. In the aggregate, their practices have been substantially accretive, and they have added in many cases key capability and bench strength across the extensive K&L Gates platform,” the spokesman said in a statement. “While partners depart law firms from time to time for any number of reasons, K&L Gates has continued to gain strength and momentum in accordance with our strategic direction, including through the lateral markets.”

That’s certainly a nice sentiment, but when almost a hundred partners leave in a year you have to wonder if we’ll be seeing even more departures in 2020.

# Morning Docket: 06.13.16
## * We know our readers: here's the only news that you care about this morning. This is the roster of salary movement news from Friday and Saturday: [Desmarais](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/elite-ip-litigation-boutique-shatters-the-market-leaves-cravath-raises-in-the-dust/), [Brown Rudnick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/firm-announces-raises-kinda-screws-over-the-older-folks/), [Susman Godfrey](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prestigious-litigation-boutique-announces-nationwide-salary-raises-to-190k/), [White & Case](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-biglaw-firm-joins-the-ranks-of-moneylaw-for-some-of-its-associates/), [Shearman & Sterling](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-throws-roving-party-to-announce-pay-raises/), and [Baker Botts](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/saturday-morning-special-another-firm-raises-compensation-but-do-they-beat-the-market/). If you’re ever worried that you’ve missed any of our coverage, check out our omnibus 2016 salary page where we collect all of these stories. [[2016 Salary Increase / Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/)] * You may be wondering why some law firms in your city haven't hopped on board the Cravath-inspired MoneyLaw train yet. It's apparently all about competing market forces. John Beulick, Armstrong Teasdale's new managing partner, says he's considering bumping up associate pay because ""[w]e want to and need to be competitive in our markets to have the talent that clients want us to have."" [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/how-the-associate-salary-arms-race-affects-armstrong-teasdale/)] * Speaking of raises for associates in flyover country, four Texas-based firms and seven national firms with offices in the Lone Star state have already announced matches to the new Cravath scale. Three more Texas firms -- Akin Gump, Haynes and Boone, and Andrews Kurth -- are expected to follow suit in the coming days. Please be sure to send us your firm's memos ASAP after raises are announced! [[Dallas Morning News](http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20160610-eight-firms-in-texas-hike-first-year-associate-base-pay-to-180k.ece)] * WHATCHA GONNA DO, BROTHER, WHEN LITIGATION FINANCE RUNS WILD ON YOU?!? Thanks to billionaire Peter Thiel's financial assistance, Hulk Hogan bodyslammed Gawker into submission with a multimillion-dollar jury verdict. After declaring bankruptcy and entering into an asset purchase agreement, the media company is investigating possible legal claims against the venture capitalist. [[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/06/10/gawker-exploring-lawsuit-against-peter-thiel/#1a1d78853755)] * ""I don't really think [this lawsuit] has legs."" Doctors in California are filing suit to block The End of Life Option Act, a new state law that legalizes physician-assisted suicide. They claim that the law violates the state's constitution with regard to citizens' equal protection and due process rights because it fails to make ""rational distinctions"" between those who qualify under the law and those who are not covered under it.

* You may be wondering why some law firms in your city haven’t hopped on board the Cravath-inspired MoneyLaw train yet. It’s apparently all about competing market forces. John Beulick, Armstrong Teasdale’s new managing partner, says he’s considering bumping up associate pay because “[w]e want to and need to be competitive in our markets to have the talent that clients want us to have.” [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/how-the-associate-salary-arms-race-affects-armstrong-teasdale/)]

* Speaking of raises for associates in flyover country, four Texas-based firms and seven national firms with offices in the Lone Star state have already announced matches to the new Cravath scale. Three more Texas firms — Akin Gump, Haynes and Boone, and Andrews Kurth — are expected to follow suit in the coming days. Please be sure to send us your firm’s memos ASAP after raises are announced!

Today is [International Women’s Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/), and there’s no better time to celebrate the progress that women in the United States have made in the legal profession.

Over the course of the last 155 years, women in this country have achieved many important firsts as lawyers — in 1869, the first woman was admitted to the bar; in 1879, the first woman argued before the Supreme Court; in 1981, the first woman was confirmed to serve as a justice on the Supreme Court; in 2016, women made up the majority of law school classes for the first time on record (a trend that’s continued ever since); and in 2023, women made up the majority of law firm associates, for the first time ever.

Despite all of this progress, while women have made great strides at the law firm partnership level, they still make up just 27.76% of [all partners](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/Research/2022NALPReportonDiversity_Final.pdf), and only 27% of all law firm [practice group leaders](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2023-november/see-her-hear-her-historical-evolution-women-in-law/#:~:text=In%202020%20women%20made%20up,percent%20of%20practice%20group%20leaders.). What can be done to remedy this situation?

I recently had the pleasure of chatting with [Laura Swihart](https://www.dechert.com/people/s/laura-swihart.html), co-chair of Dechert’s global finance and real estate practice groups and a member of the firm’s policy committee, to get her thoughts on the matter. Here is a write-up of our important conversation on how Biglaw firms can get more women into partnership and into firm leadership.

Staci Zaretsky (SZ): What can law firms — and Biglaw firms in particular — do to better support and retain their female associates?

Laura Swihart (LS): I think that law firms, especially Biglaw firms, often focus on creating women’s support groups and mentoring programs, providing motivational programming, maternity and child care programs, and offering flexible and part-time work schedules to retain their female associates.  Although these initiatives are excellent and very helpful, in the end, I believe that every employee wants to feel like they are a strategic, valued member of a dynamic, growing team.  It isn’t all about the hours and the soft support.  I think firms would be better served by making sure they are tracking the assignments and business development opportunities being given to the female associates from the start of their careers.  Making sure that female associates are being staffed on the more high profile, exciting matters for the most strategic clients and invited to industry and client events is most important, in my opinion.  I do not believe that female associates leave due to becoming mothers, because other women don’t support them, or because of the long hours.  I believe that they often leave because they don’t feel that they are being given the opportunity to work for the best clients on the most interesting matters, which is the best path to promotion and partnership.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
SZ: Law firm partnership skews heavily male.  What, if anything, do you think needs to change so that more female associates will be able to ascend to their firms’ partnership?

LS: In addition to being staffed from early in their career on the more sophisticated matters and included on business development initiatives and at client events, as we discussed previously, to heighten the profile of the women in the firm, I think that firms need to encourage female associates to start thinking about partnership earlier in their careers.  Dechert has a program for midlevel and senior female associates to help them plan for partnership.  Both male and female partners at the firm, including those in management, are active in the program.  We work with the female associates to determine what specialties they might be interested in, find industry groups and speaking and writing opportunities in that area for them, and develop a detailed business plan and client target list.  We also provide professional coaching opportunities.  I only realized late in my career that almost all of the firm leaders I have had the pleasure to work with, both men and women, have worked with a professional coach to hone their business, management, writing, and public speaking skills.  Those who have gone through the program have provided extremely positive feedback and many are now partners.

SZ: Despite a great deal of progress, women still aren’t as well represented in law firm leadership.  How can law firms make sure that women are better represented among their leaders?

LS: I think if firms implement some of these initiatives, there will be more and more women in the ranks of law firm leadership over time.  In the meantime, it’s crucial for Biglaw firms to actively promote women into leadership roles for their management committees, practice group leaders, and office head roles. This approach not only fosters diversity and inclusion but also serves as a powerful retention tool. Studies show that junior female attorneys are more likely to stay and aspire to leadership roles when they see women achieving such positions in their organization. By actively promoting women into leadership roles, firms can inspire their female attorneys and demonstrate their commitment to gender equality.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, we’d like to thank Laura Swihart of Dechert for taking the time to help answer some pressing questions on how Biglaw firms can better assist with helping women advance in the practice of law.

Things are still closed down, which means we’ve not had an opportunity to haunt the halls of an event center with the usual legal community suspects for a while, so let’s see what’s going on out there. It’s time to catch up with Keith Lee, founder of LawyerSmack, about the private community of lawyers he’s built up over the years and the trends he’s observed participating in these conversations with lawyers from all sectors coming together to connect.

# Biglaw Firm Undercuts Pro Bono Effort In Pennywise, Pound Foolish Move
## 'Pro boneheaded' is more like it.

While some law firms initiate layoffs, others take cost-cutting moves to respond to the “[The Little Recession That Couldn’t](https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1618603414329626626?s=20&t=YOG8WbsaTfC-0dDeRVmuSQ),” the ongoing economic jitters unsupported by any data, but living rent free in the minds of the Federal Reserve. While undoubtedly preferable to a layoff, belt tightening while equity partners cash in on seven-figure payouts can tarnish a firm’s reputation longer than any short-term decline in deal activity.

These firms will have to reenter the hiring market some day. Protecting their brand as an employer is ultimately more important than saving a couple grand today.

Paul Hastings just curbed the number of hours associates may count toward their 2000-hour annual billing requirement. While historically unlimited, associates may now only count “up to 100 hours” of pro bono toward meeting hours and, by extension, remaining in the firm’s good graces come bonus time (though any requests to increase this amount may be granted with advance approval).

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Guaranteeing that no fully compensated associate brings in less than 1900 hours’ worth of paying work ensures some modest gain to the firm’s bottom line, but is this juice worth the squeeze? Are there an overwhelming mass of associates loading up on 500 or 600 hours of pro bono work every year to meet the 2000-hour threshold? Most associates probably aren’t coming close to the 100-hour mark, let alone exceeding it. This rule only matters to the slice of associates who bill an extraordinary amount to pro bono and fall below 1900 in paying work and it strains credulity that the firm is losing a significant amount from that fraction of attorneys.

And in many firms, pro bono work is available because some cause is a passion project for a partner. If a rainmaker wants to keep a junior busy for 150 hours on volunteer work, that seems like a matter between the partners and not the associate’s problem.

While pro bono hours don’t cost the firm all that much, they make much more off the work in the form of recruiting good will. As a tipster notes, “the unlimited hours was always part of their pitch for recruiting.” And it’s a powerful talent lure because an associate interested in throwing themselves into a volunteer project tends to be an associate with a high degree of self-motivation. Coupled with the experiential training that pro bono work provides — because firms give younger attorneys more responsibility on matters where they don’t feel pressure to show value to the client in the form of personal partner work — pro bono is a relatively cheap way to get top talent.

Associates are absolutely floored by this decision and wonder how the firm can stand by its stated commitment to pro bono when associates are only going to be recognized for pro bono efforts that do not exceed 5% of their annual contributions.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Though worse than cutting back the pro bono benefit is how the firm spread the news.

I said “announced” because they sent an email generically saying the firm’s bonus policy can be found in the employee handbook, and only when you went to the handbook did you see the change. Associates are not happy.

“You can’t get paid anymore for the work we’ve always told you that you could get paid for doing” is not the place where you want to hide the ball. Beyond whether or not it’s a good idea, this is where you’ve got to be upfront.

# Biglaw Firm Doles Out Special February Bonuses
## They may have had to wait a while, but associates finally get their special bonuses.

2018 was a good year for associate compensation. Milbank [kicked things off](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) with a nice summer raise, and before you knew it, we were in the middle of salary wars. The way that[ Simpson Thacher tried to get ahead of the pack](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) — but was soon copied by most elite firms — was by offering special bonuses, distinct from the traditional end-of-the-year money. The size of the special bonuses ranged, based on seniority, from $5,000 for first-years to an impressive $25,000 for the classes of 2010-2012.

This summer, Cooley declined to participate in the special bonuses (though they did raise associate salaries in line with the Biglaw market). At the time, associates were [reportedly “livid”](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-firm-raises-salaries-but-stiffs-associates-on-summer-bonuses-promises-to-make-it-up-at-the-end-of-the-year/) that the firm wouldn’t pony up the extra cash. But the firm promised to make it up to associates at the end of the year.

Now comes word the firm made good on that promise. Cooley gave out lockstep special bonuses, paid out on February 15th, on the same scale as the summer bonuses. Plus the firm upped the bonus payout for extraordinary performance — to the tune of 20 percent above the market rate.

# Why Doesn't Anyone Want To Teach Law Any More?

Essentially all entry-level hiring at law schools is done through the American Association of Law Schools’ Faculty Recruiting Register. Ten or 15 years ago, nearly 1,000 people signed up seeking a career in legal academia. This year, 328 names appear in the register.

What happened? Why doesn’t anyone want to teach law any more?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I suspect a bunch of factors are at play, but I’m going to build to a crescendo here.  I’m going to start with the factors that don’t matter, and I’ll finish with the real reason applications to law school faculties have dropped off. And, of course, there’s nothing at all empirical about what I’m doing here. I’m giving you my suspicions, which are worth what you paid for them.

(Allow me a personal aside: I considered a career in legal academia. I wrote about a dozen law review articles during the course of my career, in part to keep the door to academia open. In the early 2000s, three law school buddies of mine ended up on the five-person “appointments committee” of a respectable law school. I received a memorable email:  “Herrmann, if you ever wanted to teach, now’s your chance! We’ve got a majority on the appointments committee!” But I decided against, and “[knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if  I should ever come back](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken).” I didn’t. I spent some time teaching on the adjunct faulty of a law school while I was working as a partner at a firm, but I never again seriously considered full-time teaching.)

Where was I?

Oh, yeah. Why doesn’t anyone want to teach law?

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
First: Money. Everyone’s wallowing in student debt. If you go to a prestigious law firm — and anyone with the law school credentials needed to teach could land a job at a prestigious law firm — you earn north of $200,000 per year. In academia, you earn less. That’s two hundred thousand reasons not to teach.

But I don’t think that explains the decrease in applicants for law school teaching jobs. It’s more or less been true during my lifetime that you get paid about a third less in your first year of teaching than you’d make in your first year at a fancy law firm. (That gap grows over time. If you’re a successful partner, you can earn far more at a firm than you do in academia.) But the one-third discount has remained essentially constant over the past few decades; you’re taking no more of a haircut now than you were 30 years ago. The haircut is, of course, measured as a percentage; a one-third haircut off of $150K is less than a one-third haircut from $210K. So, as salaries have risen, the absolute amount of the law school haircut has increased over time. But you can afford to repay your debts on a law professor’s salary, and people choose to teach in part for the academic lifestyle.  Indeed, my sense is that the life of a first-year associate is worse now than it was many years ago, so that academia’s comparative lifestyle advantage has increased. I don’t think money’s the deciding factor.

Here’s the second possible reason fewer people are applying to teach law: Entry-level hiring at law schools is way down these days, so the number of people applying for those jobs is lower.

It is true that entry-level law school hiring has fallen off. Law schools are trying to reduce the size of their faculties, not bulk them up. But I don’t think that explains too much. If you apply to teach, and you don’t land a job, then you stay at your fancy law firm, earn another $200K for your next year’s work, and apply to law schools again the following year. I’m not sure the unlikelihood of landing a job significantly decreases the number of people who would apply for the job.

If you sense the thundering volume building in my crescendo, then you’re right (and you have sensitive ears). Here’s the third, and real, reason I think fewer folks are now applying for jobs in legal academia. Thirty years ago, the path to a tenure-track position in legal academia was relatively easy: Get great grades at a great law school, clerk, apply for a tenure-track position in academia.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Today, the path to a tenure-track position in legal academia is hard: Get great grades at a great law school; clerk; spend several years doing serious academic writing, perhaps getting an advanced degree in history, economics, or philosophy on the side; apply for a tenure-track position in academia. That’s lots of muss and lots of fuss. It upends your life.

For me, at least (and of course I view myself as being representative of everyone), it was easy to work at a law firm and then consider an early career move into legal academia. If I’d really had to invest three or four years in obtaining an advanced degree, or being a teaching fellow, or working as a visiting assistant professor, all the while cranking out articles, that’s a whole lot more challenging change of jobs.

I suspect that the new requirements for entry-level jobs in legal academia — the requirements that force candidates to spend years of their lives earning less money on the off-chance that they’ll land a job in academia some day — are probably what’s reducing the number of candidates for those roles.

Mark Herrmann spent 17 years as a partner at a leading international law firm and is now deputy general counsel at a large international company. He is the author of [The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](https://www.amazon.com/Curmudgeons-Guide-Practicing-Law/dp/1641054336/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/144-3788773-6854967?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1641054336&pd_rd_r=61f38502-781d-47fb-a260-1970deea4a4d&pd_rd_w=AWqCy&pd_rd_wg=kFTh8&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=YK5GGKBGTD85BA2P42XB&psc=1&refRID=YK5GGKBGTD85BA2P42XB) and [Drug and Device Product Liability Litigation Strateg](http://www.amazon.com/Device-Product-Liability-Litigation-Strategy/dp/0198803532/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=%22drug+and+device+product+liability+litigation+strategy%22+second&qid=1578409788&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmr0)[y](http://www.amazon.com/Device-Product-Liability-Litigation-Strategy/dp/0198803532/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?keywords=%22drug+and+device+product+liability+litigation+strategy%22+second&qid=1578409788&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmr0) (affiliate links).

# What If This Year's Biglaw Bonus Is No Bonus At All?

‘No! Not my bonus!’

I think at a lot of firms, the bonus is keeping your job in an environment where many firms aren’t performing as well as they have in the last couple of years. And in firms that are performing with strength and have high profits to reflect that, I think we’ll still see bonuses for highest performers whether measured in hours or other ways.

— Law firm management consultant Kent Zimmermann, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/23/baker-mckenzie-remains-alone-on-bonuses-as-firms-grapple-with-excess-capacity/), on what the bonus season may look like this year across different tiers of Biglaw firms. Zimmermann said he expects many firms may “rein in the swagger” when it comes to their bonus packages. No other Biglaw firm has spoken on bonuses since [Baker McKenzie made its announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/), as they all seem to be [waiting for Cravath’s seal of approval](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/bonus-season-has-started-but-where-are-the-bonuses/).

We’re midway through summer associate season, and on-campus interviews begin in about a month at law schools across the country for next year’s crop of summer associates. What better time to release the closely watched rankings for the best summer associate programs?

Hot on the heels of Vault’s rankings of the [most prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2018/) law firms and the law firms with the [best quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2018/) comes the career website’s ranking of the best summer associate programs in Biglaw. Junior associates (first- through third-year attorneys) who summered at their current firms were asked to rank their experiences on how much fun the program was and how well it prepared them for life at the firm. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that many of the firms that made the Top 10 list for having the best quality of life made the Top 10 for having the best summer associate program.

There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the [Top 10 Firms With the Best Summer Associate Programs](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-summer-associate-programs?sRankID=270&pg=3) based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2018:

Here are the Top 3 [Summer Associate Programs That Best Prepared Attorneys for Practice](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-summer-associate-programs?sRankID=273):

- [Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/fried,-frank,-harris,-shriver-jacobson-llp/company-overview.aspx)
- [O’Melveny & Myers LLP](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/omelveny-myers-llp/company-overview.aspx)
- [Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/pillsbury-winthrop-shaw-pittman-llp/company-overview.aspx)
Since Fried Frank has swept the summer associate rankings, it’s also worth mentioning that in a [recent survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/higher-pay-for-fewer-summer-associates-but-layoffs-may-be-looming/) conducted by the American Lawyer, Fried Frank was tied as one of the firms that paid its summer associates the most, at $3,750 per week. Great job! No wonder summers love the firm so much.

Congratulations to all 50 of the Biglaw firms that made the latest edition of the Vault Best Summer Associate Program rankings. How did your firm do?

## These firms are home to the most cutthroat litigators out there.

If you’re working in-house and dealing with bet-the-company litigation, you want the very best litigators in the world to be on your side. You want a firm with litigators so strong that opponents gasp in fear at the very mention of its name. You want a firm that is known internationally for going for the jugular and coming out on top.

But how can you ensure that you’ve picked the right firm? BTI Consulting Group just made it a little easier with the release of its annual ranking of the firms most likely to trigger dread in opposing counsel, as determined by a poll of in-house counsel. After reviewing all responses, BTI named the “Fearsome Foursome,” the most-feared litigation firms in the country. These are the firms you do not want to see on the other side.

So, which firms are being [honored this year](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/the-39-firms-most-feared-in-litigation) for their ability to strike fear in their opponents’ hearts and minds?

Per BTI President Michael Rynowecer, this is why these firms give GCs nightmares:

Fearless Nature
These firms are bold. They feel the fear and uncertainty created by the unsteady reopening and instinctively dive in to sort things out — and move forward.

Uber Urgent
Like the best Electric Vehicles, they start with the power on at full force and accelerate into a case at breakneck speed.

Relentless
Giving up is not an option. The fearsome start out fully resourced and don’t stop until they reach their goal.

Strategically Aggressive
Clients report settlements are harder to come by. This means more strategy, more defense, and an aggressive posture to prove your point. The Fearsome Foursome embrace the aggressive approach — making it more difficult for the other side.

The BTI report also named 12 firms as “Awesome Opponents” — firms with lawyers corporate counsel would prefer to steer clear of in litigation (in alphabetical order):

Some people really, really hate their bankruptcy trustees.

This morning, a tipster caught this image outside Grand Central station in New York. Apparently we have some communist vampire hybrid photoshop about Paul Hastings engaged in extortion?

I’m skeptical, friends.

It’s not exactly clear why the protesters think the average New Yorker knows what Paul Hastings even is, let alone would care to learn more about a protest that looks like… this. The default setting of New York City is “do not engage crazy” and this poster is designed to broadcast maximum crazy. It costs real money to print a banner like this! Mayhaps that money could’ve been better spent on a bit of design work?

Alas, wise spending decisions aren’t how a guy ends up in Chapter 11 in the first place.

This protest is the latest in an ongoing campaign that lodges a bunch of random allegations against Paul Hastings partner Luc Despins, who serves as the Chapter 11 trustee overseeing the estate of Chinese mogul Guo Wengui (a/k/a Miles Guo, a/k/a Ho Wan Kwok). Guo claims to have around $100K to his name and around $500 million in liabilities. Quite the reversal from the $1.1 billion that outlets estimated Guo had at one point.

But what Guo does have is a longstanding Mar-a-Lago relationship and a partnership with Steve Bannon. As we’ve discussed in the past, Guo [provided money for a number of conservative causes](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/pretty-weird-how-republican-megadonors-keep-getting-popped-for-being-unregistered-chinese-agents-huh/)…

And speaking of Steve Bannon … if the name Guo Wengui sounds familiar, it’s because Guo has long been a [patron](https://www.axios.com/2019/10/29/steve-bannon-contract-chinese-billionaire-guo-media) of Bannon’s. In fact, Bannon was on Guo’s yacht when the [mailman came to arrest him](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/steve-bannon-arrested-by-mailmen-in-border-wall-fraud-scheme/) for his We Build the Wall grift. And Guo was recently revealed to be the [money behind GETTR](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpworld-app-is-bankrolled-by-fugitive-chinese-billionaire?ref=scroll), the conservative social media platform started by Jason Miller, Trump’s comms guy.

Bannon and Guo have a group called New Federal State of China and many of the attacks on Paul Hastings direct people to that entity. Which tracks because most of the attacks on the firm posture Guo as the “number 1” enemy of the Chinese government and suggest the efforts to clean up Guo’s own voluntary bankruptcy amount to a Chinese plot to take down dissidents. On the one hand, this imagery is exactly the sort of thing that would trigger a response from the standard January 6 Bannon supporter. On the other hand… were they expecting to find a lot of them outside Grand Central on a Tuesday? Apparently, the protest boasted another sign that said, “Paul Hastings doesn’t practice law, they practice Jew hatred,” which is… not where a protest with alt-right roots generally veers.

Last month, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Julie Manning [ordered](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/egpbykggkvq/Pacific%20Alliance%20v.%20Kwok%20-%20TRO.pdf) Guo to [stop running a smear campaign](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/paul-hastings-partner-wants-guo-wengui-sanctioned-smear-campaign-2022-12-01/) against Despins and Paul Hastings. Specifically:

(1) posting false and harassing online materials about the Chapter 11 Trustee Luc Despins (the “Trustee”), PAX’s or PAG’s officers or employees, counsel to the Trustee or PAX, and any of their respective relatives; (2) publishing online the home addresses and other personal information of the Trustee, PAX’s manager PAG’s Chairman Shan Weijian, PAX’s or PAG’s other officers and employees, and their respective relatives (including identifying relatives’ employers); and (3) encouraging, inciting, suggesting, or directly or indirectly funding protests at the home or office the Trustee, PAX’s or PAG’s officers or employees, counsel to the Trustee or PAX, and any of their respective relatives (including former spouses).

And to otherwise, “take any act that, threatens, or encourages others to threaten the safety of Trustee, PAX’s or PAG’s officers or employees, counsel to the Trustee or PAX, and any of their respective relatives (including former spouses).” Seems pretty reasonable.

# 'Legal Tech Lists': 5 Lawyer Tropes Upended By Legal Tech (Remote Litigation Edition)
## We thought this area deserved its own list.

In the past few weeks we’ve identified, analyzed, and rectified 10 lawyer tropes (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/legal-tech-lists-5-lawyer-tropes-that-were-upended-by-legal-tech/) and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/legal-tech-lists-5-more-lawyer-tropes-that-were-upended-by-legal-tech/)), perpetuated by cultural staples but abruptly upended by legal technology. 

Remote litigation, the act of participating in a legal proceeding from your home office, has proven itself here to stay and sufficiently upended so many lawyer tropes that we thought that it deserved its own list.  

So here we relay a trope, provide an example, and talk about how legal tech rectifies that problem today.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Trope 1: Settlement Water

This, to be sure, is a cousin of our very first trope, the big firm piling of documents onto the solo practitioner.

In every lawyer movie ever, there’s that scene where the proceeding hosts play four-dimensional chess with opposing and visiting counsel by accentuating the David and Goliath-ness of the case via the conference room temperature, squeaky conference room seat, conference room snack, or visiting Rottweiler in their pet-friendly office.

The Goliaths typically have a real Lichtenstein or Pollack in the conference room. And typically serve coffee made with dehumidified Caspian Sea water from Scandinavian coffee beans with an aerated basil infusion and ground by hand by Associates using the teeth of Patagonian toothfish.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Exemplary Scene:  Turning the tables a little bit here, here’s a scene from [Erin Brockovich ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGX4nMrnxg0)where the big firms lawyers are sitting at the table in Ed Masry’s conference room (That paneling! Those curtains!) and during a pause in the settlement negotiation, as the big firm lawyer is about to take a sip of water, Erin tells her from whence that water came. 

The Modern, Remote Litigation Solution: At home, while you still might be surrounded by or subject to dated window treatments and that paneling you’ve been meaning to replace, you get to drink whatever you want! Water, coffee with Oat Milk, Cashew Milk, and/or Almond Milk, Lactose-free milk, Condensed Milk, any kind of milk! And the snacks? Anything you can find in your own fridge or pantry.  

Trope 2: The Gladiator Deposition

They call it entertainment for a reason. We’ve surely all observed and likely even participated in one of those depositions. One of those ones where the tenets of human comportment are eviscerated from the attorneys’ oeuvre; ones that make you question the fundamental truths your Nona told you about humans being generally good.  

Exemplary Scene: In this scene from [The Insider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNKmmA6_oTQ), we see Russell Crow, in what could only have been research for his Oscar-winning role in the following year’s Gladiator, as he is questioned by a plaintiff’s attorney in tobacco litigation. Following a vociferous and aggressive objection by a big tobacco lawyer culminating in a smile, the plaintiff’s attorney gives him a tongue lashing. (But note: the astonishingly tranquil comportment of the court reporter.)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Modern, Remote Litigation Solution: While they were undetectable on film, you just know that such vociferousness resulted in spittle droplets being flung about. And the theater set-up of the deposition inevitably fostered the sort of theatrics that devolve into high-volume tongue lashings. Not so via remote litigation platform. No spittle. Arrange the virtual participants so that it’s virtually just you and the witness, and you’re nearly immune from glares and overwrought objections.

Trope 3: Impromptu Experts

We addressed the Courtroom Surprise in our first installment of “[Lawyer Tropes that Were Upended by Legal Tech](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/legal-tech-lists-5-lawyer-tropes-that-were-upended-by-legal-tech/).” But in entertainment, villains are wont to introduce a surprise expert, a compelling reason to allow such a surprise, and then compelling testimony. Our heroes are left flailing; their case now subject to serendipity. 

Exemplary Scene:  When Alabama District Attorney Jim Trotter III surprises Vinny with FBI tire mark analyst George Wilbur, it seems like William Gambini and Stanley Rothenstein’s respective geese might be cooked. Luckily for the defendants, Vinny’s fiancée Mona Lisa Vito just happens to come from a family of automobile mechanics and thwarts the prosecution in this scene from [My Cousin Vinny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nGQLQF1b6I&t=2s).

The Modern, Remote Litigation Solution: While things worked out for the defendants in the 1992 classic, the chance that you’re engaged to an expert to counter any surprise from your adversaries is rare. With remote litigation and Google, you can search for and identify the perfect witness and, no matter where they are, provided the judge is open to surprises, send them a link and then bask in their acumen.  

Trope 4:  Technical Ineptitude

Lawyers have not been historically eager to delve into and adopt new technology.

It’s a profession reliant on tradition and reputation, and the results of upending or even tweaking either can be unpredictable. And lawyers loathe unpredictability even more than newfangled technology.

We all have our stories of teaching the partner how to open Word or download something from Dropbox or whatever.  

Exemplary Scene:  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AzAFqrxfeY). 

The Modern, Remote Litigation Solution:  The ABA released [Formal Opinion 498](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/aba-formal-opinion-498.pdf) in March 2021, the apex of the pandemic when the shift to remote litigation was feeling more permanent, even advantageous. Opinion 498 read in conjunction with Comment [8] to Model Rule of Professional Conduct Rule 1.1 means attorneys can expect to litigate remotely and to do so, must be technologically competent.  

Trope 5: The Briefcase

Lawyers love to haul, hoist, heave, unfasten, rummage through, shut, and refasten their briefcases.

They love the clink and the clank of the spring-loaded clasps. They use their briefcases for security — emotional and physical — for dramatic effect, for indicating their status and, now and again, to carry papers, often referred to as “briefs.” 

Lawyers do everything there is to be done to and with a briefcase with purpose and grandiloquence.

The briefcase — sometimes tattered, sometimes Halliburton-issued steel with titanium lining (which while it has its merits, must be like carrying a toaster oven around the courthouse), sometimes chic — has always served as an extension of the lawyer, a 14” x 12” x 4” window into their psyche.

Exemplary Scene:  There are several histrionic briefcase maneuvers in this scene, from 1993’s [The Firm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzH1Z17c4yc), culminating in an invitation from Gene Hackman to Tom Cruise for an early lunch, following a detour to Gene Hackman’s office so he can drop off his briefcase. (The scene also highlights attorneys’ propensity for the unannounced office pop-in, another trope decimated by remote litigation.)

The Modern, Remote Litigation Solution:  With a stationary workspace providing access to legal proceedings, the briefcase has gone the way of the dodo.

With the ability to prepare and preconfigure every file and document, there’s no need to transport the documents, and therefore no need to carry a briefcase. Especially if you’re not leaving home. (Which implicates another trope upended by remote litigation: the lawyer running through the airport with their wheeled cart or spilling their litigation bag while waiting at the cross walk.)

Don’t despair, even sans briefcase you can still tell a great deal about an attorney in a remote setting — their background, their shirt and jacket combo, their chosen platforms. Oh, and also, how they litigate.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Leading Biglaw Firm Offers Market Raises On Top Of Eye-Popping Bonuses Up To $400K
## Holy crap. This firm really knows how to make associates happy. Their year-end bonuses are huge!

Successful Biglaw firms continue to match the Cravath scale for raises and bonuses left and right, with associates gushing with excitement over the news. Thus far, there have been few firms that have come over the top to offer year-end bonuses that really wow their associates, but that ends today.

This morning, Boies Schiller Flexner — a firm that brought in $220,000,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 157 in the most recent Am Law 200 — announced that it would be matching the Cravath scale for compensation increases, meaning that these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, as of January 1, 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016+ – $435,000
As far as bonuses are concerned, at Boies Schiller, associates have the option of doing the market bonus system, which will get them the Cravath scale — which ranges from $15,000 to $115,000 — or [they can opt](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/despite-changes-to-their-compensation-system-associates-at-boies-schiller-can-still-take-home-huge-bonuses/) into the firm’s formula compensation system, which includes a revenue share component that affords associates a cut of the matters they work on, which for contingency work [can be massive](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/boies-schiller-makes-its-associates-very-happy-once-again-with-giant-bonus-checks/).

This is what the firm noted about their formula bonuses this year:

[A]ssociates on Formula Compensation in general did very well this year.  Here are some figures that may be of interest:

- The prevailing market bonus scale ranges from $15,000 (for class of 2023, prorated) to $115,000 (for class of 2016 and above).*
- 87% of associates received a bonus that was as least as high as, and in most cases higher than, what that associate would have earned under the market system.  (Those that did not typically invested material time in a contingency case that has not yet paid out.)
- Nearly half (47%) of all associates who were with the Firm for the entire compensation year received a bonus at or above the very top of the market, i.e., above $115,000.  But whereas that bonus level is only available to very senior associates under the market system, many Boies Schiller associates earning bonuses at or about $115,000 were very junior, including more than a third (36%) of eligible associates from the 2021 and 2022 class years.
- Several associates received bonuses of $300,000 or more.
- The top associate bonus this year was more than 13 times what that associate would have earned under the market system.
- Overall, the associates bonus pool was more than twice as large as it would have been had all associates been on the market system.
Wow! Almost half of BSF associates on the formula bonus system are taking home bonuses reserved for the most senior associates at other Biglaw firms. In fact, there are some associates at BSF who are taking home bonuses as large as some of their colleagues’ salaries. This seems like a bonus system that associates would love.

“The firm needs to get recognition for being the amazing place that it is,” one BSF associate told us. “There is legitimately no firm I’d rather work at,” said another associate at the firm. “For me, it’s the quality of the work/early experience, the professional respect associates are shown on a daily basis, and the materially above-market pay.”

Not to be outdone, Boies Schiller is still going forward with its “extraordinary” and “extra-extraordinary” bonuses for those on the Cravath market bonus system. For those associates, billing 2000 hours will get them a standard bonus, while billing 2350 and 2600 hours will get them some massive payouts compared to the market scale. Just last year, “extraordinary” bonuses ranged from $30K-$150K, while “extra-extraordinary” bonuses ran from $40K-$165K.

Congratulations to everyone at Boies Schiller!

# Bonuses Coming At The End Of The Month For These Associates
## Law firm bonus season isn't over yet!

While most of Biglaw adheres to the “holiday” schedule with their bonus announcements, there are some who make their associates wait until the new year to learn their financial fate. We already discussed [Goodwin’s recent announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/associate-bonus-watch-the-good-news-keeps-on-coming/), and now it’s time to check in on another firm.

Wilson Sonsini issued its bonus announcement and informed associates that they will be getting paid on January 31st. As one might expect from the West Coast mainstay, they will be matching the Cravath scale in lockstep assuming associates have met their hours:

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000

So, no surprises from Wilson Sonsini. The reaction from associates can best be described as “unsurprised.” That might be why it took a week for anyone to send us a copy of the memo. According to one tipster:

I’ve heard nothing either way about the bonuses — but I’ve been too busy with work to do much gossiping!

Fair enough. But don’t let work get in the way of letting your pals at ATL know about your bonus!

We have a cropped copy of the bonus memo on the next page…

# From Olympic Gold Medalist To 3L
## Not a bad reason to take a break from law school.

While some, perhaps correctly, argue that law school should be trimmed down to only two years, there’s no denying the life of a 3L is pretty sweet. Particularly if your summer associateship has gone well, you’re freed from much of the stress and worry of law school. Maybe you can even carve out some spare time to take a break from school. Like maybe you can attend the Olympics as part of the U.S. Presidential Delegation.

That’s exactly what Sarah Hughes, the Long Island Olympian who took the gold in Ladies Figure Skating in 2002, is doing right now. Hughes is now a 3L at the [University of Pennsylvania Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/penn-law/), having graduated from Yale in 2009. As[ Law.com](https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2018/02/12/olympian-sarah-hughes-now-a-penn-law-3l-in-pyeongchang-as-dignitary/) reports, right now she is in Pyeongchang at the Winter Olympic Games:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Hughes, who took gold during the 2002 winter games in Salt Lake City, is currently a third-year student at the elite Philadelphia law school and was a summer associate at Proskauer Rose last year. She’s taking a break from the classroom this week to attend the Pyeongchang games as a member of the U.S. Presidential Delegation. That delegation, led by Vice President Mike Pence, includes two generals and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Hughes is the only athlete among the seven-member delegation, which is tasked with attending the opening ceremonies, meeting U.S. athletes and cheering them on at various events.

Hughes is combining her passion for sports with her future legal career. Part of her [decision](http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/hub/ct-lean-in-stories-sarah-hughes-bsi-hub-20151022-story.html) to attend law school was to amplify her work with the Women’s Sports Foundation, an organization founded by Billie Jean King dedicated to providing sports access to girls. At law school she is a senior editor of the Journal of Business Law and a board member of the Penn Law Women’s Association and the Penn Law Entertainment and Sports Law Society. As mentioned above, she summered at Proskauer Rose — not surprising, given their well-regarded sports law practice.

All in all, going to the Olympics seems like a decent reason to miss a few classes, especially as it coincides with Hughes’s larger career plans. Even if she [had to miss](https://twitter.com/SarahHughesNY/status/963225483834871808) seeing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s talk.
