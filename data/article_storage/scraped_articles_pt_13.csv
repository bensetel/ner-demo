LOL What you call ‘rudeness’ is what got me where I am today. I am a partner at a big firm making over $650,000 a year. I’ll somehow survive if ‘several others’ won’t be coming back to the 4.0 team. To be honest, I don’t care whether there is a 4.0 team at all. I am perfectly happy with the 3.5 team and my players on that team.

— A Los Angeles-based litigation partner at an Am Law 100 firm, explaining during a long and heated email chain about women’s league tennis that her supposed “rudeness” is the secret to her success — and big salary.

# Nixon Peabody Partners Meet Over Repping Donald Trump, Managing Partner Called On To Step Down
## Representing Donald Trump always ends badly for the lawyers involved.

After Nixon Peabody [filed a motion to dismiss](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/11/Trump-Nixon.pdf) on [behalf of Donald Trump](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firm-adds-donald-trump-as-client-rest-of-the-firm-may-not-be-too-happy-about-it/), the firm’s partnership started wondering, “Why is this the first we’re hearing about the firm representing the most brand toxic man in the country?” It didn’t help that the motion strayed from a narrow focus on procedural issues to include [Trump’s favorite argument](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/trump-lawyers-howl-about-proposed-gag-order-even-as-their-client-demands-death-for-potential-witness/) — and everyone else’s favorite to mock — to hurl Brandenburg at everything from gag orders to the constitutional standard for aiding an insurrection and that January 6 was just a run-of-the-mill exercise in free speech.

How are things over at Nixon Peabody? Well, the phrase used by multiple different tipsters over the last week is “shitstorm.”

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

On Monday, managing partner Stephen Zubiago held a firm-wide meeting where he basically told the rest of the firm that he authorized the firm to take on Trump as a client without informing the rest of the partners and they [all need to get over it](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/after-nixon-peabody-hitched-itself-to-donald-trump-blindsided-partners-told-to-get-over-it/). He did not take questions. But ATL has now learned that this was just one of the meetings Zubiago held on Monday.

Because also on Monday the firm’s 220 partners convened for their own Zoom meeting to discuss the matter. As you might imagine, things got real.

Per reports, Zubiago and Brian Kelly — the partner representing Trump — spoke about “working through this together” and noting that the firm sometimes has to take on undesirable clients. Leadership offered a nod to strengthening internal procedures, despite the fact that the firm already has internal procedures for this… they just got ignored here. Apparently the justification floated for the secrecy is that they felt the representation was an internal confidential issue — an excuse that might fly if the firm’s drafting the guy a new will, but falls apart when it’s a case on the public docket!

Unlike the firm-wide meeting, Zubiago opened the floor to questions from his partners and it wasn’t long before someone raised this doozy:

Stephen Zubiago has to step down as managing partner, Anthony Barron, Litigation Department Chair, also has to step down.

This call seemed inevitable even back on November 1st, when we still hadn’t confirmed that Zubiago had prior knowledge of the situation. At that time tipsters reported “no confidence” conversations among partners in various offices.

It seems that telling the partners not to worry about it is the proverbial FA that precedes the FO.

According to a report of the meeting, Zubiago replied that he would not make any decisions on this matter at the time and then mused about why the commenter , chose a public forum to ask for his resignation and not in a private call Zubiago had held with the commenting partner earlier.

I dunno… maybe the tone of these meetings added extra sour to the situation?

Litigation chair Anthony Barron is a new figure in this imbroglio. Barron has apparently conveyed to the partners that he recognizes that taking on this client — and more importantly the clandestine process of taking on this client — was a bad decision. Because taking on Trump and slapping the firm’s name on embarrassing arguments alienated a lot of people, but even partners who could care less about Trump are angered by the lack of honesty and transparency. Barron seems to get this frustration and offers the sort of contrition that the other participants might want to adopt.

Instead, Zubiago seems content to strap in and deal with the onslaught. He will undoubtedly have supporters in an upcoming showdown. Will they outnumber his detractors?

Presumably he’s trying to work that out for himself right now.

# Why Are You A Lawyer, And Why Are You Here?
## Firms need to figure out why they’re in business.

My four-year-old son is a little lawyer in the making. His arsenal of questions is limited, but he’s relentless. Why can’t I have cake for dinner? Why can’t I fly like Superman? Why this? Why that? All day, every day, it’s why, why, why? It’s a question that most of us need to ask about our work lives more often, something I was reminded of recently when [watching a presentation by Simon Sinek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&feature=youtu.be).

Sinek is a marketing consultant and professional speaker, and he models marketing, leadership, and any number of related concepts as three nesting parts.

The outermost layer is What. What is your product? What is it that you provide to your customers? Beneath that is How — How do you provide your customers with What you provide them? What methods, systems, or resources do you have that set you apart from the competition?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At the core, however, is Why. Why do you do what you do? Why do customers need to come to you? What larger purpose or vision are you fulfilling by way of your What and How?

Sinek gives the example of Apple, one of the world’s most successful companies despite facing significant competition. There are dozens of phones competing with the iPhone, yet the iPhone owns the plurality of the market. There were hundreds of MP3 players competing with the iPod, many significantly more powerful or better designed, yet none even dented the iPod’s market dominance.

Sinek attributes Apple’s success to its ability to communicate its Why to the larger audience. Apple’s competitors could market What they had — we’ve got a product! They could market How they did it — we’ve got a good supply chain that helps us provide low-cost, high quality goods!

Where Apple broke away from the pack was by focusing not on What or How, but Why. Apple didn’t pitch the iPod as the best MP3 player for the dollar; it pitched itself as the company with a burning drive to make the most intuitive interface and beautiful design possible for its products. Apple was a company made of visionaries, for visionaries, that just so happened to make iPods. People bought into that vision, and bought Apple’s products by the stack.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Bad companies only know what they do. Average companies know how to do something, then figure out what to do from there. Great companies start with a goal, a Why, and work outward from there. The Why/How/What concept is flexible, maybe even flexible to the point of facile, but Sinek is definitely onto something with his obsessive push for companies to understand their Why.

Lawyers are good at asking other people Why, but not traditionally great at asking that question to themselves. Far, far too many lawyers have no good idea why they’re in law. For many, I fear that the answer would be, “I had a JD and a bunch of student debt, what else was I supposed to do?” Not many people find joy and fulfillment by default.

Many others in Biglaw, I suspect, would say their Why is “to make a pile of cash.” Points for honesty, if that’s you, but that can be a difficult Why to translate into a strong marketing push. “I want your business so I can buy a jet” isn’t the most effective pitch I’ve heard.

If “Why am I a lawyer?” is scary, then “Why am I a part of my law firm?” or “Why does my law firm even exist?” have to be terrifying. Every law firm knows its What — legal services. Most law firms can brag about their How — top-tier attorneys, hard workers, smart workers, real-world experience, efficiency, etc. I’d wager that very, very few law firms can answer Why they’re in business, much less communicate that Why to their clients.

Law firms are institutions like any other, and I’ve written before that [the strongest law firms typically have a sense of identity and culture baked in](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-culture-card-in-law-firms/). Firms that don’t have that identity, that can’t tell their attorneys why they all work at the same place, are going to struggle to find and maintain their niche in the market.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
It’s cliché to say, but the practice of law ain’t what it used to be. Law firms used to have a monopoly on attorney hiring, and once an attorney was hired the expectation was that the relationship was for life. Many attorneys now jump from firm to firm, always searching for better work, higher pay, more prestigious clients. And it’s not just other firms that are poaching attorneys any more. It’s in-house gigs, non-traditional legal service providers, and other new sources of competition that are luring firm attorneys away. Good pay or swank offices can only keep attorneys for so long. Attorneys are going to ask their firms why they should stick around, and to answer that, firms need to figure out Why they’re in business at all.

I count myself fortunate to work at a firm that formed over a century ago, back when its home office was a territory, rather than a state. The attorneys at the firm helped build the American West. They drafted some of the first workers’ compensation and water laws. That tradition of building the communities we’re in helps our lawyers feel like we’re part of something bigger than just trying cases or closing deals.

I took an informal poll of some of my partner-level attorney friends at various firms as I wrote this article, asking them why they stay at their firms instead of heading anywhere else. Not a single one told me the answer was money. Instead, to a person, they told me it was their relationships with the other people in the office that brought them into work every day.

Whys come in all shapes and sizes. For some firms, it really is just to make as much money as possible. For others, they might want to improve the world, or be the best in their chosen area of law. There are many answers, but to reach them, you’ve got to start with the question.

And if you need some help asking Why, well, I know a guy.

# Lawyers Can Do More To Protect Attorney-Client Communications
## Accidentally hitting 'reply all' on an individual email is merely the tip of the iceberg of all the ways a lawyer can fail to protect their clients' interests.

Every lawyer knows that attorney-client communications are sacrosanct and should be protected. For this reason, many lawyers ask third parties to leave a room if attorney-client communications are occurring or seek private settings to have a conversation with clients. However, in certain instances in my career I have witnessed lawyers being extremely careless about attorney-client communications, and attorneys should take additional steps to ensure that communications between clients and their counsel are protected.

Usually, the recklessness of a lawyer is the reason why adversaries and others might hear attorney-client communications. Perhaps the most egregious example of this was when I was at a deposition with dozens of lawyers involving a deponent who was very sick. The witness was unable to project his voice far, and since the room was large, the deponent wore a microphone hooked into a speaker so that everyone in the room could better hear the testimony.

At one point in the deposition, the deponent’s lawyer asked to take a break, and the lawyer and his client retreated into another room. However, the lawyer did not remove the microphone from his client or turn the speaker off! As a result, everyone at the deposition could clearly hear what the lawyer and his client were communicating. Even worse, it appeared that the lawyer was basically coaching his client to misrepresent certain things in the conversation that everyone could hear, which was extremely inappropriate. It was only after one of the other lawyers ran into the next room to stop the conversation that the incident ended, and, of course, the reckless lawyer tried to shake things off as if nothing had occurred. However, the negligence of this attorney not only gave the other lawyers insight into the deponent’s testimony, but exposed the lawyer to accusations that he was not acting appropriately.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Sometimes, the disclosure of attorney-client communications does not occur in person but, rather, over email. This website and other news outlets routinely report mishaps involving individuals who accidentally hit “reply all” to an email chain. It is not uncommon for lawyers and their clients to all be on one email chain together, especially with transactional matters, because sometimes it is easier than having the lawyers play a game of “telephone” to convey points that the other side made.

In any case, one time I was working on a transactional matter when a stakeholder to a deal replied all to everyone instead of just the people that were on their side of the transaction. The email included some personal attacks on some people working on the deal and also included some strategic points that would be beneficial to the other side. To add insult to injury, a few more emails went out like this before the individuals involved discovered what happened and tried to fix the situation. This circumstance made it much more difficult to close the deal and gave the other side an advantage that they might not have had if the disclosure did not occur.

Of course, lawyers do sometimes have a responsibility to make it less likely that they will detect protected attorney-client communications. Whenever I am in court or some other closed space where clients are with their counsel, and sensitive communication may occur, I usually distance myself from any communications and make my presence known so that attorneys and clients do not inadvertently communicate something that I can hear. Even if this is not ethically required, trying not to overhear sensitive conversations may be considered a courtesy in the legal profession.

However, sometimes it is simply impossible to avoid attorneys and clients who are recklessly communicating in such a way that other parties to a lawsuit or transactional matter can hear the communications. Once attorney-client communications have been disclosed it is extremely difficult to unhear what was said and undo the disclosure so the parties are in the same place as they were before the disclosure. As a result, attorneys and clients could be more careful when communicating to ensure the smallest chance possible that their communications will be seen or heard by other parties to a matter.

# Biglaw Partners Dish: On-Campus Interview Disasters

It is self-evident, but you probably don’t want to screw up an interview that will substantially affect the course of your legal career. But rising 2Ls also don’t know what they are in for. Sure, they may have interviewed before, but nothing quite prepares you for the gauntlet that is on-campus interview week.

So, how do you avoid certain disaster? Well, forewarned is forearmed, so the good people at Law.com [asked a couple of managing partners](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/09/hiring-partners-share-war-stories-from-on-campus-interviews/) for their worst interview stories. Don’t do these things:

[R. Charles Miller](http://www.klgates.com/r-charles-miller/), managing partner at K&L Gates, has a doozy of a story:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ninety-five percent are students are well prepared and attentive. It’s always the 5 percent. I had one guy come into an interview. It was a hot day. I had taken off my jacket. He saunters in and says, “Guess I better lose the jacket,” and he kicked his feet up on the desk.

No, you aren’t being cute or funny, and besides, neither of those things will land you the Biglaw job of your dreams.

[Richard Batchelder Jr](https://www.ropesgray.com/richardbatchelder/), Ropes & Gray hiring partner, really doesn’t like it when people are less than honest on their résumés. Sure, there are the obvious no-nos: fibbing awards or neglecting to mention a law school you transferred from. But he also tells a fun tale of what can go wrong when you embellish personal interests on your résumé:

One student had “dogs” as his personal interest [on his résumé]. When I brought that up, he said, “I don’t have a dog.” I asked him if he had dogs as a kid. He said that he didn’t. I asked him if he [grew up around] dogs. He said, “I didn’t play with dogs growing up.” And then he said, “I guess that’s not a very good personal interest.”

The very next person I interviewed had “raising miniature schnauzers” on her résumé. I asked, “How many miniature schnauzers have you raised?” She said, “Oh, just one.” I said, “I assumed when you said ‘raising’ you did that often.” She said, “I guess that’s a little misleading.”

Yup. Listen 2Ls, personal interests are basically only there to spark an interesting conversation with your interviewer; there isn’t much upside to lying here.

Hopefully, knowing what not to do is helpful. You don’t want to screw this up; after all, the rest of your life is at stake.

Eric Holder (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

This whole practice area is a reflection of where the nation is as it tries to grapple with issues that for too long we have, if not willfully ignored, been reckless in not confronting. And so the fact that we are engaged in this kind of practice, I think it’s actually a pretty good sign.

This isn’t what you’d expect necessarily from a big, established, unbelievably credentialed law firm. We’re doing things here that I think are societally beneficial. And all of this work really is consistent with what I think lawyers at their best, law firms at their best, can do.

— Former Attorney General [Eric Holder](https://www.cov.com/en/professionals/h/eric-holder), who is currently a partner at Covington & Burling, commenting on his [emerging practice of workplace culture investigations](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/12/02/corporate-america-confronting-racism-and-sexual-misconduct-turns-to-big-law-to-investigate-its-culture/) at some of the largest companies in the United States.

Don’t you love when the rainmakers spread the water around?

I’m sure you would if you worked at Covington and Burling, a Biglaw firm that recently decided to match the Cravath scale. They could afford to do it to, considering that they raked in $1,321,296,000 in 2020. That’s a lot of money! Here is the new scale:



The salary increase will be retroactive to January 1st and will be reflected in the next March paycheck.

(Turn to the next page to see the Covington and Burling memo.)

We like hearing about salary increases almost as much as you enjoy spending them. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Salary & Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Today’s law firm clients are requiring a level of engagement that extends well beyond legal outcomes. Clients want and need a firm that serves as a strategic partner, one that understands how legal services help support the entirety of the clients’ businesses. Increasingly, they want their legal representatives to be partners, especially clients with multiple, often overlapping needs. 

Cultivating this kind of [highly engaged relationship](https://info.abovethelaw.com/building-a-client-centric-law-firm-client-engagement-for-the-modern-practice) is a fact of life for firms of every size and practice focus. And it requires firms to look closely at client engagement—how they work with their clients, and how they maintain profitable connections with them. 

Check out this free report from Thomson Reuters, [Building A Client-centric Law Firm](https://info.abovethelaw.com/building-a-client-centric-law-firm-client-engagement-for-the-modern-practice), which breaks down the strategic imperatives around optimizing the lifeblood of your law firm practice: client relationships.

Biglaw isn’t done handing out raises and bonuses to associates! The end of 2023 is nearly upon us and firms are eager to share their good financial news with associates.

Goodwin Procter, a behemoth of a firm with 1,633 attorneys and $2,211,469,000 in gross revenue last year, is signing off on the latest set of Biglaw raises. The standard was established last month by the combination of Milbank and Cravath. Now the top of the Biglaw is clamoring to show they can keep up and pay the big buck to associates.

The following is the compensation grid at the firm:

Salary Class	Base Salary
2023	$225,000
2022	$235,000
2021	$260,000
2020	$310,000
2019	$365,000
2018	$390,000
2017	$420,000
2016+	$435,000
These raises are effective January 1. The firm also announced bonuses that match the prevailing market rate.

Salary Class	Bonus
2022	$20,000
2021	$30,000
2020	$57,500
2019	$75,000
2018	$90,000
2017	$105,000
2016+	$115,000
Bonuses are based on associates billing 1,950 hours. Plus associate ratings can dial those bonuses up or down based on the below:

Associates who recorded ARC hours materially higher than 1,950 hours and/or associates in their fourth year or above who received a Distinctive rating will receive bonuses above these class amounts. Associates in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 class years who met the 1,950 ARC hours threshold will receive the class bonus amount unless they are performing below frameworks; associates receiving a Below Frameworks rating are not bonus eligible. Bonuses will be subject to proration based on our standard practice for flex time schedules, hire date, and approved leaves of absence.

You can read the full memo on the [next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/goodwin-compensation-23/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

I am not feeling much, if any, holiday spirit. Are you? With wars raging between Ukraine and  Russia and between Israel and Hamas, there are not a lot of good feelings this time of year. Wherever you are. We don’t have to look overseas; just look at the goings on, or more precisely, not goings on in D.C. and in various states.

The Marx Brothers had a routine about contract drafting and the presence of a “sanity clause.” I would tell Virginia, there is no Santa Claus, especially this year, and no “sanity clause,” just as Chico Marx told Groucho while “negotiating.”

“Negotiation” would hardly be the correct term, but the scene from the Marx Brothers’ “[A Night at the Opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbUDSxJFsDA),” is worth four minutes of your time, and you may even crack a smile, let alone a laugh.

Add to all that mishegoss the likelihood of a rerun of the 2020 election in 2024, regardless of the numerical outcome, which could well go on forever, which makes my head spin around like Linda Blair’s in “The Exorcist.”

It won’t be a matter of “to the victor belongs the spoils.” It will be “déjà vu all over again.” Is anyone ready for this? As we all know, insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Are we all insane? [Grinchy enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppWrbYC3WwQ) for you?

It’s hard to choose insane, inane examples of our professional antics this year among the many out there, but I will try. One in particular not only “strains credulity” to use a polite term in a pleading that is code for “the other side is nuts,” but tosses credulity into outer space.

Whatever happened to America’s mayor, Rudy Giuliani? From hero worship after 9/11 to becoming a laughingstock in and out of the profession, his trajectory, as we have seen, has gone straight into the toilet. Even after losing summary judgment in the Georgia election workers case and being nailed with a stratospheric judgment — probably never even a tiny portion to be collected — Giuliani insists that he has the goods on these two women. Proof requires evidence. And what does he have? Bupkis (Yiddish for zero, zip, nada.) If you turn back the clock 25 years or so, do you think that he would have ever imagined being in the pickle he’s in these days? I doubt it, but he’s certainly changed in the intervening two decades.

And now, he’s [being sued again](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/18/politics/georgia-election-workers-giuliani/index.html). For defamation again. By the same two election workers he previously defamed in Georgia. (It’s that old Herman’s Hermits song, “Henry the Eighth”: “Second verse same as the first.”) Do you remember your parents telling you, “If I have told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times, don’t ever do that again?” Lesson lost on Giuliani.

And while I know my editor is sick of Tom Girardi stories (sorry, Alex), his spectacular fall was all [over the media and the TV reality series](https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/what-erika-jaynes-ex-husband-tom-girardis-life-is-really-like-today/ar-AA1lfGOg), “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” Lawsuits a-flying, Girardi in an assisted living facility because, purportedly, he’s suffering from dementia, state bar investigations, and finger-pointing in all directions, especially at the bar itself for failing to do anything about Girardi and his antics until the disciplinary horse was not only out of the barn, but galloping away at an extremely high speed.

Dinosaur lawyers will remember, perhaps assuming facts not in evidence, that there was a fad, if you can call it that, of stuffing as many people as possible into a VW bug (the car, not an insect). Inane or insane: how many words can you fit on a line of a brief or other court submission?

Judge Sheryl H. Lipman for the Western District of Tennessee, who is hearing the underlying litigation, used fewer words than the lawyers who were in a battle royal over [what do the words “double spacing” truly mean](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/heated-litigation-fight-over-double-spacing-ends-in-judge-telling-everyone-to-shut-up/).

This question, which had all the seriousness of a Final Jeopardy question, consumed the time and labor of some major law firms who claimed “unfair,” just like we did in games of Red Rover (obviously before video games and smart phones). At the end of the day, it was a big brouhaha over nothing, as the judge, hearing the case and this motion, concluded. She was way too judicial to say STFU, but that was the clear meaning of her ruling, telling the lawyers to focus their attention on the issues in the case and ditch the ridiculous. (I wonder how the various law firms sold their clients on how it was worth the billable hours. Ka-ching.) As in-house counsel, I would have said, “if you want to litigate that issue, it’s on your dime, not my client’s.”

Is this akin to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? In this case, there were no angels, just lawyers litigating that momentous issue, with straight faces all around. Of course, I don’t think that anyone would equate angels with lawyers, an obvious contradiction. But since this is the Christmas season, it’s the perfect time to watch (or rewatch) the movie “[It’s a Wonderful Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life).” It’s sappy and overwrought (cue the lawyer in me), but there are lessons in it for lawyers — along with everyone else who has a pulse.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Biglaw Firms Aligned With Associate Values May Come Out On Top In Talent Wars
## What better way to gain a sense of belonging at your firm than by working together to help those in need.

Put it this way, law firms are in a very competitive fight for talent, and the competition is greater than it’s been at any time in recent history. And a lot of the upcoming lawyers want to be part of something that’s bigger than themselves. They want to align with organizations that have values that they agree with. They want to align with organizations that stand for something.

— Kent Zimmermann, a law firm consultant for Zeughauser Group, commenting on the expected [resurgence of pro bono work across Biglaw](https://www.law.com/2022/07/19/political-events-and-office-returns-may-lead-to-pro-bono-resurgence-in-2022/) in 2022, and how that may help with recruiting new associates. With “flash point issues” like abortion rights and gun control, associates are sure to have their fill of humanitarian assistance in the years to come while working at some of the largest law firms in America.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)

# Certified Fresh Bonuses
## Another dose of magic (circle).

Bonus news is coming in fast and furious now. For the associates this is a nice send-off before closing up shop for the Thanksgiving holiday… and inevitably reopening shop on Thursday afternoon to turn around another draft of that document. But for your humble Above the Law crew, everyone is just forcing us to delay that cocktail.

All right, no it isn’t.

The latest to announce is Freshfields, who[ already joined the fall bonus gang](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/), so this is just an announcement of the annual bonuses. Unsurprisingly, the firm is following the market standard for its U.S. associates.

# A Blueprint For Collaboration And Efficiency Through Value-Based Pricing
## Implementing value-based pricing requires a fundamental cultural shift within legal departments.

Demanding value-based pricing (e.g., matter value-based fixed fees, success/performance fees, or scope-specific retainer agreements) from law firms represents a significant cultural shift for legal departments, requiring a departure from traditional billing models based solely on billable hours and overcoming concerns that asking for it may tarnish relationships.

This shift involves embracing a new mindset that prioritizes efficiency, transparency, and alignment of incentives between legal service providers and their clients.

Here’s a breakdown of the cultural changes necessary for legal departments to effectively implement value-based pricing:

1. Embrace a Value Mindset

In-house legal departments are expected to be strategic business partners to the company, financial stewards of the company’s money, and deliver value to the organization.

In order for internal legal teams and their trusted legal service partners to deliver value, there must be a shift of focus from simply tracking hours worked to assessing the value derived from the legal services.

Effort (hours) does not tie to the actual value received. Instead, the value focus should be on pricing tied to tasks, activities, and deliverables.

This requires a deeper understanding of the specific goals and objectives of the organization and how legal support contributes to achieving those goals and objectives.

2. Value Communication and Collaboration

Legal departments need to improve communication with law firms regarding their expectations, priorities, and desired outcomes.

Collaborative discussions are crucial for aligning the scope of work, value-based pricing structures, and performance metrics.

Further, legal departments must communicate/market the value their legal services are bringing to the broader organization, such as their role in revenue velocity and risk mitigation.

3. Transparency and Accountability

Transparency in pricing and service delivery is essential for building trust and fostering long-term partnerships.

Law firms are part of the value proposition to an organization, and therefore, how a legal department manages the relationship should align with the desired outcomes set out initially when scoping the matter(s).

Legal departments should develop initial scopes of work and required pricing structures while encouraging law firms to provide detailed pricing proposals, breakdowns of costs, and regular progress reports that highlight not only substantive legal issues/decisions but also the impact of that on cost.

This ensures accountability and alignment with budgetary constraints.

4. Focus on Efficiency and Innovation

Value-based pricing incentivizes law firms to prioritize efficiency and innovation in service delivery by tying results and deliverables to the price paid.

Legal departments should encourage and reward those law firms that use creative problem-solving and explore alternative approaches, such as leveraging technology and process improvements, to streamline workflows and reduce costs.

5. Performance Measurement and Continuous Improvement

Legal departments should establish a governance model that monitors performance from a quality and cost vs. value delivered perspective.

They should establish clear performance metrics and baseline benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness and value of legal services provided by external firms.

End-of-matter performance reviews and annual 360 feedback sessions help identify areas for improvement and reinforce accountability on both sides.

6. Risk-Sharing and Outcome-Based Incentives

Value-based pricing encourages a shift toward risk-sharing arrangements and outcome-based incentives, where law firms are rewarded for achieving favorable results or meeting specific milestones.

Legal departments should explore different risk-sharing pricing models, such as contingent fees, success fees, and recovery fees, tailored to the nature and complexity of each matter.

7. Cultural Alignment Across Stakeholders

Achieving successful value-based pricing requires cultural alignment not only within legal departments but also among key stakeholders, including senior management, finance, and procurement teams.

Collaboration and buy-in from all parties are crucial for driving meaningful change and overcoming resistance to new pricing models. Internal change management is one of the key obstacles in implementing value-based pricing structures.

8. Investment in Skills and Capabilities

Legal departments may need to invest in developing capabilities to negotiate and manage value-based pricing agreements effectively.

This can be done via engagement of experts in this space to not only develop the initial framework but also train/coach internal legal department resources on how to manage it going forward.

This includes training staff on pricing strategies, scoping techniques, value-based price structures, law firm negotiations, financial analysis, and performance management techniques.

In conclusion, implementing value-based pricing requires a fundamental cultural shift within legal departments that focuses on value, transparency, efficiency, and collaboration.

By embracing this new mindset and adopting innovative pricing models, legal departments can significantly reduce legal spend, increase budget predictability, build stronger partnerships with law firms, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately enhance the overall value proposition for their organizations.

# Biglaw Firm To Make 'Bring Your Dog To Work Day' Permanent For Health & Wellness Purposes
## Just make sure not to roll over on those billables when the pets are at the office.

Sit. Stay. Beg. No, those aren’t commands from partners, but associates at this Biglaw firm may get used to hearing them a lot more often now that “Bring Your Dog to Work Day” will be a monthly health and wellness feature. Because after all, life in Biglaw can be pretty rrrruff!

Magic Circle firm Slaughter & May allowed lawyers and staff members to bring their dogs to work on a trial basis [this past June](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/new-biglaw-perk-hotness-dogs/), and the program was so successful that dogs will be allowed to come to work once every month.

“I have long been an advocate of having our dogs in the office,” Slaughters’ managing partner Deborah Finkler said at the time of the trial. “The benefits of all animals and especially dogs to mental health, morale and alleviating stress are widely recognised.”

We bet Slaughter & May associates are howling with excitement.

As reported by [Legal Cheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/01/slaughters-makes-bring-your-dog-to-work-day-permanent-after-successful-summer-trial/), Slaughter isn’t the only firm that allows dogs to come to work as an associate wellness perk — Gowling WLG, Norton Rose Fulbright, and Eversheds Sutherland have launched similar programs.

Are any Biglaw firms in the US using pets as a perk, or would they be barking up the wrong tree to even suggest such a thing? All we know is that we think programs like these are paws-itively delightful. Hopefully more firms will throw associates a bone and let them bring their pets to work.

# Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firm Cutting Associate Salaries
## Even top law firms are cutting salaries.

The Biglaw cost-cutting measures brought on by COVID-19 is creeping up and up the Am Law rankings, proving big gross revenue is not enough to stem cash flow concerns. The latest firm to announce cuts is Reed Smith, who raked in $1,174,973,000 in 2018 gross revenue, making it 27th on the Am Law 100 ranking.

Today, firm global managing partner [Sandy Thomas](https://www.reedsmith.com/en/professionals/t/thomas-alexander-y) announced on an all-associate call that associate pay will be cut by 15 percent for May through the end of August. They’re also cutting counsel salary by 10 percent. And they’d previously announced a voluntary leave program during the coronavirus crisis. (The firm also released [an FAQ about the cuts, available on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/reed-smith-salary-cuts/2/))

A firm spokesperson had this to say about the cuts:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As a result of the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, we have made a series of compensation adjustments in recent weeks that affect our lawyers and professional staff. After our initial decision last month to defer partner distributions across the firm, we also reduced base pay for counsel by 10 percent for the next three months and deferred decisions on merit increases and discretionary bonus payments for professional staff. We can now confirm that we are reducing associate pay by 15 percent for four months, beginning in May. Annual raises have already been awarded to associates, and their previously announced bonuses will be paid later this month.

According to tipsters, the cuts (particularly since they have associates taking a deeper cut than counsel) have gone over like a lead balloon:

Associates are MAD. Sandy Thomas came on and gave what came off as a very condescending pep talk – we know you’re working hard because we see your utilization and we know your clients need you. Many of us are left to wonder, ok, then why cut our pay so much (5% higher pay cut than counsel took).

Best of luck to those at Reed Smith as they deal with these austerity measures.

# Lessons From A Quitter
## Here's a podcast I did about quitting Biglaw.

Quitting Biglaw. It’s the dream of almost everybody who gets a job in Biglaw. And I’m living it! Hold up, I need to go pay off one credit card by maxing out another credit card. Ahh… living the dream!

Goli Kalkhoran is a former attorney who left the law to start a podcast called “Lessons From A Quitter.” I went on her show and talked about my own experiences getting out of the practice of law, and into the coverage of law. (My colleague David Lat made a [previous appearance](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/lessons-from-a-quitter/e/56523888) on the podcast.)

Check it out, and good luck to other people trying to break the golden handcuffs.

[Fresh off the news](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-loses-over-a-dozen-partners-as-more-firms-spread-to-boston/) that 13 partners had left the Boston office of the Biglaw firm LeClairRyan, comes word that the firm has lost even more attorneys. This time the defectors a group of corporate and real estate attorney from the Richmond office. Partners Katja Hill and John Selbach, senior counsel Grant Grayson, and associates Jonathan Jones and Nicole Scott have left for [Whiteford Taylor Preston](https://www.wtplaw.com/).

Hill has served in positions of leadership during her time at LeClairRyan, including as the Office Leader of the Richmond office, on the Board of Directors and as the Chair of the LeClairRyan Foundation Board of Trustees. Her practice focuses on the acquisition, sale, leasing and financing of commercial real estate properties. Selbach’s client base includes clients in the manufacturing, distribution, retail, waste services, government contracting, IT, financial services, medical services and real estate sectors. The full group of attorneys will join the Corporate and Securities section at Whiteford Taylor.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to data collected by ALM, over the last few years LeClairRyan has seen a 13 percent drop in revenue, from $163 million in 2016 to $142 million in 2018. In 2018 42 partners — nearly 20 percent of the the entire equity partnership — left the firm, and from the looks of it that trend is continuing into 2019. As Law.com [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/01/09/leclairryan-loses-18-lawyers-as-freeman-mathis-moves-into-boston/) on the previous spate of departures, LeClairRyan CEO C. Erik Gustafson is choosing to focus on the overall strategic vision of the firm:

“The movements over the past year are reflective of our efforts to shift our focus to one that includes a greater proportion of corporate, business litigation, employment, financial services, regulatory, and intellectual property engagements as evidenced by the addition of more than 20 lateral partners in those practices in 10 of our offices in the past year,” Gustafson said in a statement. “From a business perspective we recognize the importance of continuing to improve our financial performance, increasing our profits per partner and revenue per lawyer. This necessarily involves heartfelt changes.”

We’ll certainly be following all the firm’s personnel changes closely, whether they’re heartfelt or not.

Working in Biglaw has a lot of perks.  As this website has discussed at length, Biglaw associates make insane sums of money, and this usually empowers attorneys at Biglaw firms to [pay off their student loans in a relatively brief amount of time](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/law-school-tips/).  In addition, associates in Biglaw can usually use their experiences at a top shop to obtain all kinds of employment once they decide to stop working at a top firm.

However, in some instances, working in Biglaw can be a liability when searching for certain types of jobs.  Sure, if you want to secure a top government position or land a job in-house, then working in Biglaw can be an important credential to possess.  However, if you want to move into other parts of the legal profession, working in Biglaw can present a number of issues.

As mentioned in a few prior articles, I worked in Biglaw for a little over a year during my student debt repayment saga.  I was a litigation associate at a top firm, but I definitely was not a litigator.  During my year or so in Biglaw, I hardly ever entered a courtroom.  I never argued a motion, never did any type of trial work, and I never obtained hands-on experience litigating cases.  In addition, I never took a deposition during my year or so in Biglaw, nor did I have any interactions with clients.

Rather, I spent most of my time in Biglaw conducting doc review and writing research memos.  The most important brief I ever wholly wrote in Biglaw was for a pro hac vice motion! I usually just wrote smaller sections of briefs, and I never had any input on the arguments that were made.  While conducting document review, I usually just had to decide if materials were privileged and whether documents were responsive to subpoenas.  It was easy work to complete, but document review taught me little about what it’s like to be a litigator.

As a litigation associate in Biglaw, I worked on several multimillion-dollar and a few multibillion-dollar matters.  If there was a motion to argue, even on the smallest issue, the top brass would go to court to argue it.  Since the cases we worked on were so large, and opportunities to go to court were so rare, I never did any meaningful hands-on litigation tasks.  There were times when I helped with pro bono matters, and I was able to go to court and interact with clients in these few instances.  However, the pro bono issues I dealt with were unrelated to anything I worked on regularly as an associate in Biglaw.

After leaving Biglaw, I was determined that I would find a job that allowed me to actually litigate cases.  I wanted a gig that would enable me to appear in court frequently and argue motions on a wide variety of issues.  I also wanted a job that would allow me to take and defend depositions on at least a monthly basis so that I could practice this essential litigation skill.  I did not care if I had to take a pay cut to work a job that would provide me with the chance to hone my litigation skills.  Of course, I had a [large amount of student debt when I left Biglaw](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/), but I figured that I could work part-time jobs to [supplement my income while I worked a gig that would allow me to develop litigation skills](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/introducing-side-hustles/).

I had a very difficult time getting hired by a smaller firm that would allow me to actually litigate cases.  Many firms did not like the fact that I never made court appearances or took depositions as an associate in Biglaw.  Even though I made critical contributions to some important cases, many firms could not get past the fact that in Biglaw, I wrote memos instead of actually litigating matters.  And I don’t blame these firms!  Even though I worked at a top Biglaw shop, any smaller firm that hired me would have to train me on how to litigate cases, since I did not learn these skills at my Biglaw gig.

Another reason why many litigation firms did not want to hire me was because of how much money I made in Biglaw.  Many smaller litigation shops only pay associates half or less the salary that associates in Biglaw earn.  It is difficult to convince partners at many litigation shops that you would be satisfied earning less money than you did in Biglaw.  There is typically much turnover at smaller shops, and the brass at smaller firms want to make sure that you won’t just gain experience at their firm for a year or so before looking for more lucrative work.

All told, I was much happier as a “street lawyer” actually litigating cases than I ever was at a Biglaw.  At my first gig after leaving a Biglaw, I managed 44 cases, including class actions, commercial matters, and many other types of lawsuits.  While employed at this smaller firm, I attended hundreds of court appearances, argued dozens of motions, and took numerous depositions.  This gig taught me litigation skills I could never acquire in Biglaw, and I was happy that I convinced a firm to excuse my lack of litigation experience when deciding to hire me.

In the end, there are some areas of the legal profession that you may have difficulty entering if you worked in Biglaw.  Indeed, if you want to litigate cases and work at a smaller firm, it might be difficult to demonstrate that you have the skills and drive necessary to succeed at a smaller litigation shop.  However, if you are truthful about your desire to work at a smaller firm, and if you do everything you can to gain practical skills in Biglaw (usually by completing pro bono work), you will have the best shot at making a change in your career.

Earlier this week, we [predicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/more-departures-from-the-kl-gates-do-they-matter/?rf=1) that prominent partners in investment management would be leaving [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/) for other firms. These predictions have come to pass, as reported by the [Legal Intelligencer](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202751283555/Stradley-Ronon-Opens-in-Chicago-With-KL-Gates-Hires#ixzz41xwWQgV4):

Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young has brought on a four-partner team from K&L Gates, adding to its Washington, D.C., office and spurring the opening of a Chicago location.

Stradley Ronon said Thursday it has hired investment management partners David Glatz and Alan Goldberg in Chicago and Eric Purple and Nicole Trudeau in Washington.

“Nice pick up for Stradley,” one ATL tipster told us. Said a second source, “Dave Glatz and Alan Goldberg were heavy hitters in the Chicago office’s strong Investment Management group. Can’t see the group surviving if it loses their book of business.” A third reader estimated the departing partners’ combined book of business as “north of $10 million.”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In light of these and [other](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/more-departures-from-the-kl-gates-do-they-matter/) recent departures, several sources of ours expressed concern over the future of the Chicago office (previously described by a tipster as a [“hot mess”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/more-departures-from-the-kl-gates-do-they-matter/?rf=1)). From a former associate:

The office is definitely in trouble. A lot of the big partners are getting close to retirement. Younger partners just haven’t been bringing in sufficient business. Associates are leaving left and right. And this past summer class–100% received offers, but only 66% (6 out of 9) accepted them. Not a good situation. IP group was the strongest in the office, but with the most recent defections, even that group can’t be relied upon.

From a former partner (speaking about the firm more generally):

Management is extremely bloated… 70+ lawyers, most of whom do not bill many hours. Some of these partners bill no hours and make well into the seven figures. On top of that, the firm has cut sweetheart deals with lateral partners in order to build numbers.

Panic has set in at the Chicago office, where associates are being offered retention bonuses if they agree to stay on until July.

We love news of associate bonuses here at Above the Law, but these aren’t the bonuses we’re looking for.

We reached out to K&L Gates about this report of retention bonuses, but the firm didn’t get back to us. If you have info about K&L you’d like to tell, you know [where to reach us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=K%20and%20L%20Gates).

The COVID-19 pandemic is reshaping the world as we know it. Every industry has been impacted, and the legal arena is no different. Transaction management –historically a paper- and labor-intensive endeavor — is facing unprecedented challenges. Given the current pace of change to law firm practices, Above the Law and [Litera](http://bit.ly/3861FLB) have partnered to get a better sense of exactly how firms are responding to the outbreak and what tools legal professionals are using to help them reprioritize and reconfigure their workflows and client relationships.

As such, we are fielding a brief [survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9S65CVOMBSxMz5j) that is looking for insights into topics such as:

- Preparedness to handle changes;
- Concerns regarding the deal management process;
- Evolution of client requests; and
- Impact on deal completion.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

## * As we previously mentioned, London-based firms CMS and Olswang and international firm Nabarro were considering entering into a merger. Partners at all three firms have officially voted in favor of the merger, which will close in May 2017. The new firm will operate under the CMS name. We'll have more on this later.

In the Supreme Court's first design patent case in more than 120 years, Samsung will face off against Apple today, where the smartphone companies will duke it out over how much Samsung should have had to pay for copying the iPhone. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL1N1CG0HZ?il=0)] * ""Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg no longer needs to worry about whether she seems threatening to the Court. She is the Court."" A new linguistics research study tells us what we can learn from Justice Ginsburg's accent as a lawyer versus her accent as a Supreme Court justice, and how all lawyers make accommodations in their speech. [[TIME](http://time.com/ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court/)] * By edict of a federal court -- and over Governor Rick Scott's objections -- Florida's voter registration deadline has been extended to 5 p.m. Wednesday thanks to Hurricane Matthew's interference with last-minute sign-ups. Florida's Democratic Party alleged many voters would be ""severely burdened"" by the hurricane's effects.

# Morning Docket: 04.11.17
## Uh-oh! Trouble in paradise? It looks like Martin Shkreli's lawyer -- who also happens to be his co-defendant -- has turned on him. * Florida has released the results from its administration of the February 2017 bar exam, and they were not pretty. The percentage of those who passed dipped a bit since 2016, but students at both Orlando law schools were more likely to have failed. But which law school did the worst of all? We'll have more on this later. [[Orlando Sentinel](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/school-zone/os-bar-rates-florida-20170410-story.html)] * Trouble in paradise? Martin Shkreli's former lawyer, Evan Greebel -- who also happens to be his co-defendant -- has turned on him, accusing the pharma bro of submitting false documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission and engaging in illegal stock trading. Greebel, of course, now wants to be tried separately from Shkreli. [[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-07/martin-shkreli-s-former-lawyer-threatens-to-blow-the-whistle)] * ""I never in my wildest dreams imagined I would be back."" Five women who once worked at Davis Polk and had been gone for at least two years to raise their families have returned to the firm for one-year stints with a program called ""Davis Polk Revisited.""

[[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2017/04/10/davis-polk-welcomes-back-female-lawyers-who-took-break-from-law/)] * A former Hunton & Williams partner who spent 20 years on the lam as a fugitive has finally been caught. Scott Wolas, who was disbarred in 1999, was most recently accused in a $1.5 million real estate investment fraud scheme. Over the course of his alleged criminal career, Wolas reportedly assumed a number of other aliases. [[Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202783300080/After-20-Years-as-Fugitive-ExHunton-Partner-Arrested-in-Florida)] * Each year around Easter, the ABA Journal hosts a Peeps in Law diorama contest. It's time to cast your vote for your favorite, and this time around, the competition is pretty stiff. We're particularly partial to the entry that's been dubbed ""State of Peepington v.

Woohoo! Bonus season is kicking into high gear!

Yesterday, Schulte Roth — ranked 84th on the 2020 Am Law 200 — announced their year-end bonuses. Because 2020 has been challenging, the firm is reducing the usual hours requirements for bonuses, from 2,000 to 1,800. And more than just a simple match of the prevailing market rate, the firm is also offering step up bonuses (also with reduced hours targets). Here’s what the 2020 hours requirements are at the firm:

And those special bonuses that are pretty much de rigueur at elite firms will also kick in at 1,800 hours.

Here’s what the full scale at the firm looks like this year ([full memo available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/schulte-bonuses/2/)):

All told, that’s between $15,000 and $45,000 (depending on class year) over market rate that associates can earn. That’s quite the thank you for the extra hard work associates put in during the pandemic. And you have to appreciate that the firm recognizes how fucked this year was by lowering the threshold for the extra cash. Kudos. And, we aren’t the only ones that think so. Tipsters at the firm report everyone appreciates the firm’s response:

Pretty happy with everything – hours target lowered to 1800, class bonus, special bonus, and on top of that the three step up targets are based on the 1800 hour target.  For those of us who had a busy year at the firm, these aren’t unrealistic.  The new firm management has done a pretty good job maintaining morale during Covid.  Making the money more accessible to everyone this year is something we can definitely appreciate.

As always, we depend on you when it comes to bonus news. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

Jack Hopper, Managing Director at Kinney Recruiting.

It’s hard not to like Jack Hopper. In fact, it might just be impossible. “I’ve been in this business a long time and I find this to be true: The truly rewarding thing about what we do for a living is that we get to help people. Every placement translates into one thing and that is that we are in a unique position to make real positive differences in people’s lives.” Jack is a Managing Director in the Houston office and Austin office of [Kinney Recruiting](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/). With over 23 years of experience in the industry, and almost a decade of it at Kinney, Jack knows the intricacies of the practice of law, the secret to being a successful recruiter and the importance of looking beyond the paper and at the person.

Jack grew up in Houston, Texas, in a family of lawyers. “To tell you the truth, my father didn’t want me to go to law school. He wanted me to be an architect.” Jack’s father, Jack M. Hopper, was a Senior Partner and Head of the Labor Section at Vinson & Elkins in Houston. As persuasive as he might have been in court, Jack could not convince Jack and his brother to try a different path, and both ended up following their father’s footsteps into law. Jack graduated from The University of Texas at Austin, where he received a BA in History. “After I graduated, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do with my degree and anticipated either going into a graduate program in architecture or going to law school. I had the artistic ability and interest in the arts to go into architecture, but I ended up choosing law school because I figured that I’d do better as a lawyer.” Following his undergraduate studies, Jack attended South Texas College of Law where he obtained his JD. Upon graduating from law school, he joined the Houston office of the law firm Stumph & Falgout. As an associate in the litigation group, his practice concentrated on a commercial litigation docket. “After two years, I got an opportunity to go in-house at a Fortune 500 company based in Houston, where I was the Division Counsel. I later decided to go out on my own. I practiced all in for about 10 years.”

Jack broke into the legal recruiting profession in 1998, after deciding that he was ready for something new after ten years of practicing law. “One of my best friends, Jim Dilworth, who I went to law school and high school with in Houston, went into recruiting straight out of law school. His sister, Pam Dilworth, was one of the most successful recruiters of her time. In fact, Jim placed me in my in-house counsel role.” Jim always suspected that Jack would be an excellent recruiter and often mentioned it to him. “I took Jim’s advice and took a leap of faith. I didn’t actually begin my recruiting career as a legal recruiter. My first role was with Co-Counsel, a successful privately-owned company in Houston. I was hired in a business development capacity, where I was tasked with client contact and marketing our project attorney capabilities. I enjoyed my role and the client interaction, but I sensed early on that I would be even better at the actual direct hire recruiting. In 1999, I was offered a permanent placement recruiting opportunity in Miami with The Affiliates (now Robert Half Legal) and I jumped at it, and I’ve never looked back.” Jack was a natural. “I like to think I’ve made – in fact, I know that I’ve made many friends over the years in this business. Candidates and clients that turned into friends and are now a part of my life. When you work hard for people and they know that you have their best interest at heart, they remember you. That’s another thing you don’t find in other careers. We really get the chance – and paid(!) – to develop relationships and have positive impacts on people’s lives. Outside of being a doctor or performing a public service, that’s probably as good as you can ask for in terms of doing something for a living. I’ve always held on to that and it’s what still brings me so much satisfaction to this day, 23 years later.”

 Over his career, Jack has lived and recruited in Austin, Houston, Miami and Atlanta, placing scores of candidates from across the U.S. He joined Kinney Recruiting in January 2013, making this his 10th year with the firm. “First off, I like everybody at Kinney considerably and I think of them as friends. We’ve been doing this a long time. I’ve been in the business for 23 years, Robert’s been in it for 20, Danny’s been in it for 17. Those are unheard of times in recruiting. We have incredible brand recognition, great technology, a great back-office team and Robert is a fantastic businessman. Everyone’s also really good at what they do, and I think the fact that all of our recruiters are former practicing lawyers is an advantage. We really have it all. I’ve seen this industry change over the years and for one thing, technology has gotten better. Something I often tell anyone that asks is that one of the things that sets Kinney apart from my previous companies is our superior technology. Our client and candidate management software helps us source, identify and target the right candidates.”

“One of the biggest transformations I’ve seen in the industry is recruiters’ reliance on email to source candidates. That was unheard of when I started out.  The other big change has been the number of recruiters that are new to this industry. A lot of them never pick up the phone and call candidates in a targeted fashion and build relationships which, in my opinion, is still the most effective and rewarding way to achieve success.  They rely on email blasts that they send to 100, 200, 500 candidates hoping someone will respond. That works to a point but we do it differently. We call candidates, we create connections and we build trust with clients. I’ve worked for every type of company in this business. All great companies, I have nothing bad to say about any of them, but at Kinney there’s a great mutuality of what I get from being a part of this organization and what I bring to it with my experience and skills. I’ve been with Kinney now for the longest I’ve ever been anywhere in my professional career and frankly, I plan to finish out my career here.”

 Jack believes that what makes a recruiter great is possessing the passion to look beyond the paper and at the person. “In my opinion, the best candidates are those that are not only great on paper but also high-character individuals. Some of the best placements I have ever made were candidates that I really liked and felt were super smart and delightful human beings. You get slam-dunks, sure, but any recruiter can pick a sure-fire placement based off of a great resume. Where the skill comes in is the ability to identify the intangibles. I had a candidate in Miami who had been okay in school and the firm he was at was okay, but he had great experience and was a fine young man. I advocated him to a really high-end litigation boutique that was composed of former US attorneys. I said, “You’ve got to interview this kid. If you don’t hire him, that’s fine and if after you meet him you tell me it was a waste of time, you never have to work with me again. But I’m telling you that it won’t be a waste of your time, whether you hire him or not.” I’ll never forget that right after they interviewed him, they told me “You are absolutely right. He’s a rockstar”. They ended up hiring him and he made partner.” To Jack, candidates are every bit as much a client as his fee-paying clients are. “We don’t represent the best interests of one above the other. We are looking to make the perfect marriage. If you ever get one misaligned, it won’t work. I often tell my candidates that I’m their advocate. The best candidates are the ones who trust me and appreciate that A, I know what I’m doing; B, I do care; and C, I have their best interest at heart. I’m here as their career consultant and bring them my experience and advice. I’ve been doing this for 23 years and I’ve talked to a lot of people. I’ve got good instincts, I’ve got good people skills and if I see something in a candidate and tell a client that they’ve got to talk to them, they’ll take my word on that.”

“The advice I always give my candidates is “to thine own self be true.” If you’re looking to make a transition in the marketplace, make sure it’s for the right reasons. It’s fine to make a move based on compensation but it’s got to be more than just putting food on the table and money in the bank. It should be about advancing yourself both professionally and personally. Another piece of advice to candidates, and maybe the most important, is to simply be a good person. The stuff that makes a good candidate, a good client and a good recruiter is the same stuff that makes you a good person. Treat others with respect, be someone of integrity, show up and do what you say you will, show passion and enthusiasm, be compassionate and always be honest. That’s what it comes down to and that’s what’s ultimately going to help you advance your career.”

“My wife kids me about the fact that I always think the best about everybody. “You’re a glass half-full kind of guy” she says. I’m fine with that. I tend to want to see the good in people. I’m pretty good at doing that and I think people tend to like me too. Well, I like to think they like me.” It could be his laidback and friendly style, the fact that he’s a good person or the way he talks about his family and his wife, Jennifer. It might even be how much he adores his four dogs: Sophie the poodle, Lillie the chihuahua, Gracie the Malitpoo and Taco the hound dog (we promised Jack they’d get a shoutout). Whatever it is about him, it’s no wonder that Jack has built a successful career in spotting good people and helping them find happiness in their professional and personal lives.

# Biglaw Bonus Season Ain't Over Yet: Big Bucks For Big Billers At This Firm
## How much do you have to bill at this firm to come out on top?

It’s a new year, but that doesn’t mean that Biglaw bonus season is over just yet. Some firms still haven’t made their announcements, some firms still haven’t paid out their bonuses, and some firms made their anouncements weeks ago, but their associates were too excited about the holiday season to pass the big news along to your editors here at Above the Law.

Today’s bonus announcement is of the third variety. Winston & Strawn announced its year-end bonuses on December 14, but we didn’t hear about it until last night. In case you’ve somehow forgotten what this year’s bonus scale looks like, here it is again:

Class of 2018: $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2017: $15,000
Class of 2016: $25,000
Class of 2015: $50,000
Class of 2014: $65,000
Class of 2013: $80,000
Class of 2012: $90,000
Class of 2011: $100,000

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Bonuses for the class of 2010 and beyond will be handled on a case by case basis, and the firm takes care to note that bonuses may be “above or below” the Cravath scale based on performance factors including “evaluation ratings, productivity, and other extraordinary contributions to the firm.” Winston & Strawn will also pay additional bonus cash to associates who have “substantially exceed[ed]” the firm’s 2000-hour annual billables goal. Last, but not least, the firm will true up associates who didn’t qualify for summer bonuses during the summer, but now do with a full year’s worth of billing. The firm expects to pay out its bonuses early next month.

Having to wait so long for bonus money must stink, but associates will be filthy rich come February, so there’s not much to complain about. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to see the Winston & Strawn bonus memo.)

Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

# Former Cleary Facilities Manager Receives Jail Time For Stealing $1M+ From The Firm
## He duped the firm into funding an 'extravagant lavish lifestyle.'

Earlier this month, Paul Fitzsimmons, a former facilities manager at the UK outpost of Cleary Gottlieb, was sentenced for his role in a scheme to steal funds from the firm. Fitzsimmons, along with his partner, Toby Britton, a company director of a vendor to the firm, managed to net more than £1 million — that’s $1,216,405 — over the course of three years.

As noted in a statement from the City of London police, Fitzsimmons reportedly used the stolen funds “to fuel an extravagant lavish lifestyle for him and his partner” which included “high-end performance cars, luxury furniture and designer clothes.”

[RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/cleary-manager-jailed-stealing-ps1m) has additional details on how Fitzsimmons was caught:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Evidence from the trial revealed that the pair set up fake companies with different directors listed to “make the trail less obvious and to leave as little digital footprint as possible”. Invoices were then paid for work that had not been carried out, as Fitzsimmons and Britton duped the US firm to the tune of over £1 million.

The two were finally busted in 2018 when Cleary’s finance team became suspicious – an investigation company was hired to comb through the accounts, and uncovered the dodgy transactions. Police arrested the pair.

Fitzsimmons began working at the firm in the late 1990s. Cleary offered this statement on the matter:

“The firm uncovered the matter as part of its monitoring and oversight processes in 2018, and immediately reported it to the police and the Solicitors Regulation Authority. We would like to thank the police for their hard work and professionalism throughout this long running case.”

Fitzsimmons was sentenced to six years in jail, while Britton received a four-year sentence.

# After Weeks Of Associate Worry, Firm Matches Market With Bonuses
## A little more magic for associates.

The last time Linklaters responded to market bonuses, the firm took two weeks longer than its peers to come to a decision [and then didn’t even match](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/magic-circle-gives-special-bonuses-but-how-much-is-anyones-guess/). In a cryptic message, the firm promised bonuses on an increasing scale beginning at 1700 hours, though associates weren’t confident that billing 2000 hours would even net half the market bonus.

So while it may not surprise anyone that Linklaters took longer than the rest of the market to respond, it is welcome news that the firm fully matched the prevailing market this time around.

In an email circulated on Friday — [you know how much we hate that](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/dont-announce-your-bonuses-on-a-friday/) — the firm called off a previously announced 5 percent bonus and replaced it with market-level bonuses.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


The first installment will arrive June 30, while the second is expected to be paid at the same time as the eventual annual bonus. No word on hours requirements or catch-up provisions, so let’s hope that’s because there aren’t any restrictions — associates have been through enough over the past year.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

With demand drying up, corporate Biglaw attorneys have had a rough go of it over the course of the past year. With the possibility of layoffs unfortunately becoming top of mind, many of these lawyers may be wondering if there’s somewhere else they can take their talents. Lo and behold, pastures may, in fact, be greener for corporate attorneys at a midsize firm. These lawyers will, of course, have many questions about what their lives at a midsize firm will look like, and how they can make the most of this new experience.

Who better to answer these questions than the leader of a midsize firm who made the leap from Biglaw?

I recently had the pleasure of chatting with [Steve Cooperman](https://www.morrisoncohen.com/scooperman), chair and co-managing partner of Morrison Cohen, an international midsize firm, to get his thoughts on the benefits of building a legal career as a corporate lawyer at a midsize firm rather than in Biglaw. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our lively conversation on how corporate lawyers can build meaningful careers at a midsize firm.

Staci Zaretsky (SZ): You started your career at Skadden and then moved to Morrison Cohen. Could you tell me a little bit about why you decided to make a move to a midsize firm?

Steve Cooperman (SC): I had a strong gut feeling that the firm, which was only 15 years old at the time, was on the verge of going to the next level of growth and sophistication. With 60 plus lawyers (now 130 lawyers), I felt that I had the potential to make a meaningful contribution in those efforts and would be part of a team and organization that I could get my arms around. That was a very exciting prospect.

SZ: What are some of the biggest benefits an associate can expect at a midsize firm over a Biglaw firm?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
SC: At our firm, deals are staffed with fewer associates, so associates benefit from increased responsibility and client facing opportunities, as well as greater attention to work-life harmony and investment by the firm in their future. We hire for the long term with the intention that our associates will grow into partners, so training and mentorship are a big part of our associates’ experience.

SZ: We all know that corporate associates in Biglaw firms have had a difficult time over the past year or so. How are corporate associates in midsize firms faring? 

SC: Given that much of our practice comprises middle market transactional work and we do our best to avoid making decisions based on cyclical market conditions, we are not as susceptible to some of the macro-economic headwinds that many larger firms face. Also, given our rate structure, we see up-market clients coming to us in a downturn in the economy, where they can get the talent of Biglaw at a lower cost. That means even in a market downturn, our volume of work has not suffered in any material way, and our associates have fared well.

SZ: Biglaw associates usually say that their billable hours obligations are their greatest cause of stress. Can you tell me what work-life balance looks like at a midsize firm? 

SC: For us, it means lower average annual billable hours. So while you will have times when you are working on a deal with all its attendant time pressures, as you might in Biglaw, that is not the perpetual state of affairs here. We watch our hours and workflows to make sure we are not stressing our system.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
SZ: What advice do you have for an associate who may be considering a lateral move to a midsize firm?  

SC: Find a firm where you can still get sophisticated work and have the ability to continue to learn and progress. Culture is critical – at a midsize firm, everyone is much more visible so I think it is important to be at a place that aligns with your values, professional desires and goals.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, we’d like to thank Steve Cooperman of Morrison Cohen for taking the time to help answer some pressing career questions for prospective corporate midsize associates.

# Should You Be Introducing Your Start-Up Clients To VC's?
## I am not sure how much value there is in a warm introduction to an investor from a lawyer.

It is still something of a mystery how small start-ups are able to work with Biglaw firms. But, one of the value adds that many Biglaw firms promise their clients is introductions to VCs. And, to be fair, I have heard many VCs on panels talk about the importance of entrepreneurs approaching them via a “warm introduction,” often through lawyers.

Plus, I am sure that many lawyers are capable of making those introductions and getting their clients that big meeting. In fact, on a recent trip to San Francisco, I twice sat drinking coffee, pretending to work on my laptop while eavesdropping on a pair of lawyers promising some wide eyed hipster that they were going to introduce him to investors.

So, I am sure that the temptation is great for junior and midlevel associates to try to go out and get their app-building friends to sign a letter of engagement by telling them they can make introductions to some of their firm’s VC clients.

Try to avoid that temptation.

When I [discussed this topic last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/should-startups-have-lawyers-make-warm-introductions-to-vcs/) with Austin based start-up lawyer Jose Ancer, I had a slightly different take on this issue, but over time I have reconsidered my position, not only because these “warm intros” are rife with conflict of interest, but because, quite frankly, I am not sure how much value there is in a warm intro from a lawyer. Paul Graham, one of the founders of Y Combinator, often says that start-ups think that getting in touch with VCs is difficult, when actually getting in touch is quite easy. Building traction with users and customers is the hard part.

It is true that VCs say they like warm intros, but while that term sounds generic, what VCs really mean by warm introductions is something very specific: an introduction from someone they know who has already invested in the company. Both introductions lead to a meeting, but only one will give your client a head start. An introduction to a VC from a lawyer is not worthless, it is just worth less.

# The War On Law Firms

Lawyers, especially more established ones, enjoy referring to the vocation of law not as a mere business, but as a profession. Anyone can own a business, but having a profession requires something special. “Profession” carries connotations of grandeur, learning, following a higher duty to society as a whole. In contrast, “business” is just the gauche act of making money. Businesses are run by Gordon Gekko; Atticus Finch was a member of a profession.

It’s fun to pretend to be a Philosopher-King or -Queen, dispensing wisdom and authority from on high while ignoring the petty economics. Philosophers don’t need to get their hands dirty with math. They have people for that. So long as the Philosopher carefully listens and gives wise counsel, the kingdom will prosper, the peasants will rejoice, and the offices will remain wood-paneled, because that is the way of things.

Ask [Ozymandias ](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias)how that worked out for him.

The world is changing, and the grand profession of law is changing with it. We’re in the early stages of a war for our life, and it’s not the lofty sages that will shape the future of our industry. It’s the scrappy businesspeople who are willing to get their hands dirty, crunch numbers, and make bold choices.

A War On All Fronts

The battle for market share is being fought by more combatants than you might realize. [Alternative legal service providers](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/unitedlex-luthor/) are stealing commoditized market share, and in some instances even traditional bespoke legal work. The [Big Four accounting firms ](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/)are expanding the scope of their consultation services, and boxing law firms out in the process. Legal-oriented startups [run by non-lawyers ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/when-vc-meets-jd/)are trying to disrupt the basic fabric of the industry. In-house legal departments in search of efficiency (or internal budget allocations) are keeping more work in house than ever before. The monopoly we enjoyed for decades is being consistently eroded, and when you start with a monopoly, you have nowhere to go but down.

The way this erosion has played out in the Biglaw market has been fascinating, but troubling. The market as a whole for law firm services has been sluggish, seemingly missing out on the past ten years of economic recovery. But it hasn’t been sluggish all over. [The top 1 percent of firms are growing massively](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/in-defense-of-more-sizzle-less-steak/), and solos and boutiques are chugging along fine. It’s the middle market that’s feeling the squeeze. Midsized firms are struggling to keep their market share. As the overall pie continues to shrink, that segment of the market will be fighting harder amongst itself for fewer dollars. And if and when the next recession hits, a bloodbath will likely ensue.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The scariest part about all of this is how few lawyers even realize this battle is going on. It’s been such a slow boil for the past decade that it’s been easy to miss. We all felt the crunch when the Great Recession set in, shifted hard into a low-expectation mindset while we rode out the downturn, and never really shifted back out. Ten years of moderate growth has been greeted, year over year, as good news. But compared to the overall economy, the legal market has barely bounced back at all. Slow growth has been the norm for so long, many have started to think their firm’s performance has been acceptable, maybe even healthy, when in fact it’s tenuous at best.

Markets change, and industries die. Magazines used to be big business. They set the cultural conversation. When was the last time you bought a magazine outside of an airport? Thanks to some intrepid Wikipedia editors, you can pull up a list of [magazines that have died](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_American_magazines) as their industry contracted. You can also find virtual graveyards for the big box[ department stores](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_department_stores_of_the_United_States) and [retailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_retailers_of_the_United_States) that have crumbled under the weight of competing with the internet.

Mismanagement and bad fortune surely took down their share of the victims listed above, but if you look at the dates these companies folded, an overwhelming number have come in the last 20 years. A tsunami was incoming for the industry as a whole, and only a lucky few made it to high ground in time.

Law firms that don’t recognize the fundamental problems facing our industry run the same risk. Too many firms are coasting on inertia and are unprepared for a shock to their system. Even outwardly thriving firms like [Sedgwick](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/sedgwick-death-by-billable-hours/) can turn out to be brittle and vulnerable when a bad turn comes. Any firm that isn’t actively planning for the downturn may be just a few years from closing its doors.

To survive this war, firms need to be disciplined and realistic. They need to embrace financial planning,[ educate themselves in complex analytics](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/revenge-of-the-nerds/), push partners for creativity and efficiency, and work hard on accurately understanding, allocating, and cutting their costs. They need to emphasize [diversity in hiring and promotion](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/moneyball-meets-attorney-recruitment/) to maximize the skill sets and communities at their disposal. They need to get scrappy, clever, and clear-eyed. They need to run themselves like a business, not a Victorian intellectual salon.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Gordon Gekko Need Not Apply

To be clear, I’m not advocating for the return of Gordon Gekko, nor am I advocating we abandon the higher goals we traditionally aspire to. The legal industry is under siege, but we should not jettison our better selves entirely in the name of staying alive and making money. We can and should run ourselves smarter, while at the same time remaining humane, caring, and reflective. For all the unearned bluster we sometimes ascribe it, it still means something to have a profession. We owe ourselves, and the society that has given us so much, to remember that.

The notion that we are a profession and not a business will do us no favors in the next decade. Neither will the idea that we must cut throats, pillage, and plunder to survive. To make it through the coming reckoning, we need to balance the scales between the professional and the business sides of our industry. We need to find the productive middle ground between Atticus Finch and Saul Goodman. Above all we have to survive, both body and soul.

The first step to surviving a war is knowing that you’re in one. Now it’s time to decide what kind of soldiers we choose to be. Choose wisely.

# MoFo Faces Overbilling Lawsuit Alleging 'A Billing Feeding Frenzy'
## Just what the Biglaw firm needs.

Between the [pregnancy discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/mofo-responds-to-explosive-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/) and the [internal investigation](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/amid-growing-scandal-mofo-launches-investigation-into-partner-justin-fairfax/), facing another high profile dispute is probably the last thing that MoFo wants right now, but well, here we are.

On Wednesday a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas against Morrison & Foerster by plaintiffs which include Synergies Corp., AVD Trading, FireStar Group LLC, Firestar Diamond International and owner, jewelry designer Nirav Modi. Plaintiffs allege the Biglaw firm was hired to wind down the entities, but billing quickly got out of hand:

“MoFo then expended an exorbitant and excessive amount of time, primarily on matters that had little to do with winding down the entities. In the course of two months, MoFo had 34 different timekeepers bill 669 hours at a cost of $484,321.39,” the plaintiffs allege in the complaint.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The complaint also says while the firm had arranged for $625,319 to be paid to its trust account, it also “unilaterally decided to pay itself from these funds—although this was never authorized. This left $170,978 in the trust account.”

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/02/14/mofo-hit-with-texas-lawsuit-alleging-egregious-overbilling/) Law.com, plaintiffs are also alleging that MoFo missed claims the plaintiffs could have asserted — to the tune of $17 million:

The plaintiffs allege the representation should have been a “straight-forward assignment,” and the lawyers should have filed certificates of dissolution in Delaware, reviewed the clients’ financial statements and prepared general ledger or balance sheets for the companies. Because they did not do those things, the plaintiffs allege, Morrison & Foerster “completely missed $17 million in claims that plaintiffs could have asserted in a bankruptcy action.” They allege that counsel they hired after firing Morrison & Foerster did assert the claims.

The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, fraud, breach of contract and theft. MoFo has not yet responded to the allegations.

# Biglaw Lawyer Becomes Impromptu Champion Of D.C.
## Viral video star is senior Biglaw attorney.

Amidst all the awful of yesterday, there was a viral moment caught by Norwegian journalist Veronica Westhrin capturing the frustration and horror of D.C. residents watching their town get defaced by a gang of ignorant white supremacists high on delusions of widespread voter fraud and whipped into a frenzy by a deranged lame duck president.

But it turns out we have a Biglaw attorney here.

A white man standing on his stoop yelling at the rioters besieging the city and a Black woman passing by in her car share their anger and sorrow as an unprecedented assault took place in their city. Neighbors connecting in a crisis.

So I filmed this video today. I shot it in a D.C. neighbourhood as Trump-supporters were leaving downtown after the protests and riots today. Apparently it went viral after I posted in on my Instagram [@westhrin](https://twitter.com/westhrin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) So here it is, Twitter!

BarredinDC did some digging and managed to [score an interview](https://barredindc.com/2021/01/07/an-interview-with-the-porch-guy/) with #guyonporch, who turns out to be [Peter Tracey](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/peter-l-tracey.html), Senior Counsel at Perkins Coie. Tracey explained how he ended up in a viral video:

I agreed with the Mayor’s guidance that we should not engage. But I saw this couple walking back with the Trump flag unfurled. I just let them have it. I have done that a couple times at these last couple rallys and have let my thoughts be known. But it just happened that a Norwegian TV crew was outside and filmed the whole thing.

Tracey told BarredInDC that he thinks the issue that yesterday should force everyone to focus “on the disparity between the way that people of color would have been treated had they done the same thing versus the kid glove treatment that these guys got yesterday.” But he also touched on the importance of strategically deploying his own white privilege:

This is exactly what white privilege is. You know what, I had white privilege to be able to sit there and scream that crap. I get that.

In the meantime, this accidentally captured expression of community underscores the importance of DC statehood. Anyone who thinks this place isn’t its own entity and can just be ported off to Maryland or something has no idea what goes on there. To that end….

Give DC statehood and make [#guyonporch](https://twitter.com/hashtag/guyonporch?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [#womanincar](https://twitter.com/hashtag/womanincar?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) their senators. [https://t.co/XfmLz9rxUD](https://t.co/XfmLz9rxUD)

# Magic Circle Firms Must Pull Rabbit Out Of Hat To Stay Competitive With U.S. Firms
## Report suggests top London firms may be heading to mid-market status without bold action.

Last week, Womble Bond Dickinson and BDB Pitmans [announced a possible merger](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/10/womble-bond-dickinson-in-merger-talks-with-bdb-pitmans/). If a new report is to be believed, transatlantic mergers may become a lot more common in coming years.

According to [Arden Partners](https://www.arden-partners.com/), the top firms in the UK simply cannot keep up with the American firms and absent significant merger-based growth, the firms will fade into mid-market work. As the expression goes, the American firms are “overpaid, oversexed, and over here” and while we’re all probably better off not dwelling on the sex lives of Biglaw, the “overpaid” factor has led to U.S. firms consistently outspending the Brits in the talent wars.

From [Financial News](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/magic-circle-law-firmsus-rivals-competition-mergers-20221026):

Arden Partners argued that the Magic Circle firms either need to find merger partners to boost their balance sheets or shift their strategies to focus on mid-market work.

Paraphrasing arguments previously made by The Future of the Professions author Richard Susskind, the report concludes that Magic Circle firms have the wrong strategies, but the vested interests of the partnership model means they are unlikely to change them.

“They probably don’t have the right answer because they are a room full of millionaires that refuse to believe that their business model is in trouble,” the Arden report said.

It probably doesn’t help that the country shot its business genitals off when its ginned up populace voted to leave the EU without a whiff of a plan. As the UK shambles toward becoming one of [the weakest economies in Europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/10/uk-economy-disaster-degrowth-brexit/671847/), even the good news coming out of the big firms isn’t all that good:

The Magic Circle has continued to perform well in recent years. Clifford Chance, for example, posted an 8% revenue increase to £1.97bn last year, and boosted partner pay 10% to £2.04m.

However, that growth looks anaemic next to Los Angeles-headquartered Latham & Watkins, which added $1bn to its top line last year, growing revenue more than 25% to $5.49bn, and upping partner profit more than 25% to $5.7m.

It could be a busy couple of years for law firm stationery suppliers.

In Biglaw, as in capitalism generally, the rich just keep on getting richer.

According to CounselLink’s [2020 Enterprise Legal Management Trends Report, ](https://counsellink.com/trends/)the more attorneys that are employed at a firm, the more money that firm in able to command in its average billing rates. The biggest 50 law firms have an average partner billing rate of $575 per hour, which is 51 percent higher than the next band of firms. Those that are slightly smaller, with 501-750 attorneys, are averaging partner billing rates of $380 an hour. And it keeps on going down from there, with partner billing rates at firms with 201-500 lawyers 29 percent higher than those with only 101-200 lawyers.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/07/14/high-rate-work-went-to-the-largest-law-firms-last-year-but-discounts-are-now-rising/) Law.com, Kris Satkunas, director of strategic consulting at LexisNexis CounselLink, notes that these higher rates make the biggest Biglaw firms even more profitable, but there is an opportunity for the firms below:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“[The largest firms] really have a hold on those markets,” said Kris Satkunas, director of strategic consulting at LexisNexis CounselLink and the report’s author. “It’s almost a chicken-and-the-egg thing: the larger the firm, the higher its rate. But a higher rate drives up the firms’ average income, meaning the firm can grow even larger.”

….

“I don’t think people realize how strong the correlation is between the size of the firm and the rates,” Satkunas said. Firms slightly smaller than the “largest firms” category, ones with head counts of 501-750 lawyers, have an opportunity, she added, as clients look for high-quality legal work at a lower cost.

But the report also found that alternative fee arrangements are gaining traction — as Satkunas said, “I’m hopeful that we’re finally moving away from talking about alternative fee arrangements and starting to embrace them.” Last year, 12.1 percent of matters were under alternative fee arrangements and as the economic pressure of COVID-19 continues, that number is bound to continue to go up.

Since the Dobbs opinion came down, Supreme Court justices have faced protests outside their homes and outside their favorite restaurants. The Supreme Court asked local officials to clamp down on it and Morton’s Steakhouse used its JD from the Filet Mignon School of Law, but the Court’s problem is its own pesky precedents catching up with it. We also discuss the threat Texas legislators sent to Sidley Austin suggesting it would go after the firm for its health plan covering health care travel and the future of state border-crossing laws and guns and briefly preview Elon Musk’s Twitter fight.

# Why Business Development Is Every Lawyer's Problem
## It's not all about knowing the law.

Joe speaks with David Ackert, host of The Market Leaders Podcast, about the role of business development in the legal profession. Lawyers may not love the hustle, but it’s the basis of a service industry and lawyers at every level have a role to play in building their future opportunities. And it’s not just a challenge for attorneys — firms need to build a culture that maximizes respect for attorney business development too.

Oh, baby, baby! The competition for 2021 Lawyer of the Year honors was not a close one, not even one little bit. Our top candidate took home more than 50% of the vote, while our second-place finisher had just 11% of the total tally. In fact, the new titleholder secured almost 150 more votes than this year’s silver medalist.

Before we announce which luminary lawyer prevailed, let’s review Above the Law’s past Lawyers of the Year:

In a year where some of the most important news circled around the frivolous litigation in the wake of 2020’s presidential election, it makes sense that the lawyer who came out on top had … absolutely nothing to do with it. America needed a break from lawyers trying to protect “FREEDUMB,” and voted for an attorney who was trying to free one of the country’s most beloved pop stars.

In the end, it was [Mathew Rosengart](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosengart-mathew-s), the Greenberg Traurig partner who succeeded in freeing Britney Spears from more than a decade of conservatorship who took home the title in our 2021 Lawyer of the Year competition. He [entered the superstar’s legal life](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/its-greenberg-traurig-bitch-britney-spears-hires-a-biglaw-partner/) this past summer, and by November, the conservatorship was no more. Rosengart earned 56% of the vote in our annual contest, and he continues to earn praise from not just his client, but all of [her superfans](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/britneys-lawyer-developing-bizarre-cult-following/). Because she’s stronger than yesterday, here are some high compliments from Ms. Spears:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Congratulations to our Lawyer of the Year finalists, and very special congratulations to our 2021 Lawyer of the Year, Mathew Rosengart. Thanks to his zealous representation, Britney Spears is no longer overprotected but in control of her own life. Though his firm’s bills may be quite high, her freedom is simply priceless. Thanks to Biglaw’s [“zaddy”](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/the-lawyer-who-freed-britney-spears-has-some-thoughts-on-his-zaddy-status/) not just for freeing Britney, but for making legislators take a closer look into conservatorship laws and inspiring a new generation to consider going into the legal profession.

# Proskauer Goes Even Harder After Former Firm Executive With Amended Complaint
## The legal battle is heating up.

The explosive [lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/proskauer-files-lawsuit-against-fired-chief-operating-officer-what-you-need-to-know/) between Biglaw firm Proskauer and its former chief operating officer, [Jonathan O’Brien](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jonathan-obrien/), continues to be filled with eye-popping rancor. You’ll recall, the firm alleged in its initial complaint, filed in December, that the now-former COO downloaded 34 gigabytes of internal data to a USB drive before announcing he was leaving the firm to [work for a competitor](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/ex-proskauer-exec-was-heading-to-paul-hastings-before-biglaw-lawsuit-blew-it-all-up/). O’Brien was poised to[ join Paul Hastings](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/ex-proskauer-exec-was-heading-to-paul-hastings-before-biglaw-lawsuit-blew-it-all-up/), but that deal blew up when the lawsuit was filed. (The firm fired O’Brien the same day they filed the Southern District of New York complaint.) The complaint also alleged O’Brien attempted to delete emails subject to a litigation hold.

Of course, because this case is nothing if not acrimonious,[ O’Brien responded](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/former-chief-operating-officer-accuses-proskauer-of-machiavellian-management-in-latest-filing/) by calling the firm’s management “Machiavellian.” He told the court he only downloaded the information necessary to do his job as he traveled abroad at year end. [Proskauer responded by calling](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/proskauer-jonathan-obrien-coo-litigation-update-absurd/) O’Brien’s explanation for his possession of the documents in question “ludicrous” and “facially absurd.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now Proskauer has filed an [amended complaint](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zdpxdgeawpx/gov.uscourts.nysd.591672.90.0.pdf), adding a lot more color to the dispute between the two parties. As [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ex-proskauer-coo-accused-of-scheme-to-poach-staff-before-exit) Bloomberg Law, the new complaint accuses O’Brien of a scheme to recruit a number of Proskauer executives to Paul Hastings:

Jonathan O’Brien conspired with “key executives,” including Proskauer’s former chief financial officer, Leigh Anne Whyte, in the effort to bring senior officials and staff with them in a move to Paul Hastings, Proskauer said Monday. The new allegations came in an amended complaint filed in a Manhattan federal court.

The firm also accused O’Brien of sharing recruiting information with the “chair of the competing law firm,” a reference to Frank Lopez, the Paul Hastings chair and a Proskauer alum. The two law firms are among the largest in the US, with each eclipsing over $1.2 billion in gross revenue in 2022.

The firm alleges as part of the recruitment plan, O’Brien violated his fiduciary duties to the firm:

O’Brien, while still at Proskauer, repeatedly talked with Lopez, the Paul Hastings chair, about how to get his colleagues on board, according to the amended complaint. He violated his fiduciary duties to Proskauer in those talks, the suit alleges.

O’Brien shared an internal “recruiting initiative” with Lopez, “who then used that information to Proskauer’s detriment,” the firm said.

Proskauer also notes in the amended complaint that, after the first complaint was filed, O’Brien deleted communications.

In a statement, Paul Hastings said the firm “neither solicited nor received any confidential or proprietary information,” and that, “This continues to be another firm’s personnel dispute and we do not comment on other firms’ personnel matters.”

O’Brien’s attorney, Russell Beck, said in a statement the amended complaint was “drafted with an eye towards using the media.”

Biglaw firms are officially spreading holiday cheer for associates in the form of cold, hard cash. As we’ve noted on our annual [compensation scorecard](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/biglaw-raise-bonus-tracker-2023/), 26 Am Law 100 firms have already made their raise and bonus announcements, along with several prestigious boutique firms.

By our count, nearly all of the top 10 Biglaw firms by gross revenue have increased associate wages and announced year-end bonuses, save for just a few. We can now add another elite firm to the list.

We’ve confirmed that on Friday, Morgan Lewis — a firm that brought in $2,745,251,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 8 in the most recent Am Law 100 — delivered the news of its raises and bonuses via voicemail. The firm is using the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries ML associates will see in 2024:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016 – $435,000
Morgan Lewis is also matching the Cravath bonus scale, and this is what year-end bonuses will look like at the firm:

- Class of 2023 – $15,000
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016 – $115,000
Congratulations to everyone at Morgan Lewis!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# Sidley Partner Takes Flamethrower To Bridges On The Way Out
## He's got a point... but this was almost definitely the wrong way to go about it.

Departure memos from partners can certainly [ruffle some feathers](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/), but generally it’s not the departing partner trying to start a ruckus. This time, however, an outgoing Sidley partner decided to tell all of his clients just what he thinks of his colleagues and burn every bridge imaginable as he leaves the building.

Obviously, there can be low-grade bad-mouthing whenever a partner leaves. When a partner accepts a lateral move, they will have to convince their clients to come along for the ride and sometimes that involves some nuanced downplaying of one’s former partners. But Sidley’s Steven Baik isn’t even trying to port his business with him… he’s joining a client! So why drop an anvil on the former firm?

Let’s consider Baik’s email to clients:

Hello Friend,

I address you as “friend” because I consider each of you a friend more so than a client.

That’s a sweet sentiment.

Unfortunately, private law firms have forgotten what an honest relationship is with a client.

Uh-oh.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I recall being chastised by a fellow partner when I had warned a client about a less than superior associate staffed on the client’s matter. As expected, that associate didn’t perform as hoped or expected. The client noted this to the partner, who also found out that I had warned the client.

That partner, rather than focusing on how best to serve the client and repair any damage to the relationship, inquired of me why I had warned the client.

Actually, I have a question for Baik: rather than focusing on how best to serve the client and prevent any damage to the relationship, why did you trash your firm to someone who — friend or not — was another partner’s client? This was the opportunity to tell the other partner, “I’m not confident in this associate… you may need to put in a little more supervision than you’re used to,” or to go directly to the associate and say, “This client is also a friend, so please loop me in when you circulate your drafts so I have an opportunity to comment.” It might mean more work for Baik without earning a cut, but if it’s all about friendships instead of the dollars, then it’s worth it.

All in all, I agree with Baik’s sentiment that Biglaw is plagued by too much focus on “compensation, realization, profits per partner, etc.” but the answer isn’t throwing an associate (and by extension a fellow partner) under the bus to keep in a client’s good graces. But the answer has to always begin with making the firm’s product the best it can be, not in preemptively offering warnings and excuses to the client.

Baik’s now going to work with PUBG, a video game company that specializes in offering players flamethrowers they can use to exact all sorts of damage to other players. Fitting.

One thing is for sure, PUBG’s probably not hiring Sidley any time soon.

# Appreciating The Accountants
## Finding a good accountant is as integral to running a successful law practice as picking the right banking relationship or malpractice insurance provider.

As an associate at most larger law firms, interactions with the firm’s accounting department are often sporadic at best. Most of the time, you never hear from accounting at all. At some point, when you have been fortunate enough to originate a client or two, you will likely be introduced to someone in accounting, who will likely reach out to make sure that outstanding invoices are in the process of being collected, if at all. Making partner doesn’t change things much — your interactions with accounting typically revolve around billing and collections issues. (While collecting money can be a bear, at least you can also take succor in the fact that you are a partner at a large enough firm to have its own internal accounting staff.)

What about personal taxes for Biglaw lawyers? As a salaried associate or counsel, they are actually quite easy to handle using tax software or a volume preparer — unless you have a spouse with their own business, or have inherited a vast real estate empire that generates income for you on the side. Even as a partner, most of the difficult personal tax issues — such as paying state taxes in each state the firm operates in — are handled by the firm, leaving your personal return relatively simple to handle with minimal outside help. In fact, at least for litigators, you are more likely to have to spend more time dealing with litigation audit requests from accountants for your clients than you need to spend on your personal taxes. Again, assuming your main income is from your Biglaw draw and distributions, without involvement of income-bearing investments of consequence and the accompanying additional tax complexity.

Things change immediately, however, once you decide to leave the big firm cocoon (or if you never entered one, right when you start practicing) to open your own firm. As a service business owner (albeit one that is a bit disadvantaged under current tax law relative to other businesses), one of the first things you need to do is find a good accountant. This can’t be overstated — and is as integral to running a successful law practice as picking the right banking relationship or malpractice insurance provider.

In fact, it is well worth the investment in time to actually interview accountants before selecting one. You can start with practices that come recommended by others and have some familiarity with the types of issues firms like the one you are starting typically encounter. Probably best to talk to at least two so you have some means of comparing options. For firms with established accountants, it is important to continually evaluate your relationship with your firm’s accountant, to make sure you are getting the expertise and service your firm needs to flourish.

Considering how important it can be to have good accounting help, it is also worthwhile to consider what you can do as a client to help your accountant provide optimal service. That starts with recognizing how busy accountants can get, especially during tax season. Which means helping them out by organizing the firm’s finances, collecting 1099s from clients, and assembling whatever other information the accountants will need for the firm’s upcoming return. In addition, an awareness of the accountants’ workload during tax season suggests you should leave the planning and strategy discussions for less busy times. Ideally after filing season has completed, when your discussion can take into account the return that was just filed as well as your performance to date in the current tax year.

As important as a relationship with a solid accountant can be for a firm, it is also important for lawyers to learn from how accountants service their clients. In fact, anytime you, as a lawyer, interact with other service providers, you are provided with an opportunity to learn something. Sometimes, we can emulate what we learn, such as how good accountants really take the time to try to understand a client’s businesses as much as possible. So that advice can be tailored to the particular needs of the client — something any good lawyer should strive to do for all clients. And at other times, a lawyer may be presented with an example of what not to do from a fellow service provider, such as if an accountant is not forceful enough about getting critical documents or information from a client, resulting in errors on a return, for example. Here too, a lawyer can learn how important it is to be persistent about making sure that clients are giving the full picture, so that any advice can be accurate and responsive to the client’s actual needs.

Ultimately, developing a relationship with a good accountant is a must for any firm, as it is with any business. Our practice has benefited from the good advice we have gotten from accountants we have worked with, on issues such as how best to structure licensing deals to whether or not it is worth it to pursue tax refunds from overseas withholdings of monies due our clients by foreign defendants. Just as each and every practice is different, so too will a firm’s needs from its accountants be different. So take the time to find a good one, or periodically consider whether your current accountant is the best match for your firm. For as long as the answer is yes, appreciating the accountants will always be good form.

[Fresh off the news ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firm-passes-on-representing-kanye-west-after-rapper-refuses-to-back-away-from-antisemitic-remarks/)that Biglaw firm Brown Rudnick will not be representing Kanye West in his “business interests,” another massive firm has announced they’ll no longer be working with the rap star. As[ reported by ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/kanye-west-lawyers-drop-hip-hop-star-after-antisemitic-remarks)Bloomberg Law, Cadwalader has also announced they’re parting ways with Ye.

Litigation partner [Nicholas Gravante](https://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/nicholas-gravante) represented Ye last month, as part of the rapper’s efforts to end his contract with Gap. Now the firm is distancing itself from the star.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“We are not presently providing any representation and have no intention of providing any future representation,” a Cadwalader spokesman said via email Wednesday.

This comes following[ a barrage ](https://www.billboard.com/lists/kanye-west-hate-speech-consequences-timeline/celebrities-react-to-death-con-tweet/)of media appearances and social media posts that espoused problematic views. He launched antisemitic attacks on social media that got him booted from Twitter. [He spread](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/19/1129747423/kanye-west-george-floyd-lawsuit) vicious, unfounded rumors that it wasn’t former police officer Derek Chauvin that caused George Floyd’s death but rather fentanyl — and as a result is facing a $250 million lawsuit. He wore a [“White Lives Matter” shirt](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kanye-wests-white-lives-matter-drama-everything-to-know/) to his Yeezy fashion show.

And Cadwalader and Brown Rudnick aren’t the only companies to distance themselves from Ye. He’s lost deals with Balenciaga and [Adidas](https://fashionista.com/2022/10/adidas-kanye-west-partnership-ending). He was dropped by Creative Artists Agency, and film and television studio MRC announced they were ditching a completed documentary on West.

Besides the obvious moral stance in distancing these brands from Kanye West, it’s clear antisemitism and the other hateful things Ye has done recently are just bad for business.

After a year of the pandemic, closed offices, and virtual meetings, not only is March Madness back, but so is Lateral Link’s $10,000 Texas Placement Bonus! Here’s how it works: if you start working with a Lateral Link Texas recruiter before the end of the March Madness Tournament (April 5) and we ultimately place you, Lateral Link will pay you $10,000 just for working with us.[[1]](#_ftn1)

Texas has four major, bustling, and diverse big city centers, and it’s home to many Am Law 100 firms and high-end boutiques. While the Texas market slowed down last year because of the pandemic, the legal market has come back in full force, and firms cannot hire fast enough.

The current demand for associates in Texas is remarkable. There are over 70 corporate associate positions in Dallas, Houston, and Austin combined. The litigation market is equally busy, with over 65 posted associate positions in Texas. And these figures do not include the numerous unposted opportunities we are currently working on with some of our top law firm clients.

Texas continues to be a top destination for legal talent, with its low cost of living, lack of a state income tax, and competitive salaries compared to other major markets. Over the last five years, over 50 Am Law 200 firms have opened offices in Dallas, Austin, or Houston. The firms with the most growth in the associate space over the past six months include Kirkland & Ellis, Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani, Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith, Winstead, and Akerman.

The practice areas with the most hiring over the past six months include corporate and finance, litigation, labor and employment, and real estate. Some of the highest Vault- and Am Law-ranked corporate practice groups reside in Texas. In particular, Kirkland, Sidley, and Latham lead the way on headline corporate and private equity transactions on an international scale. In the past six months, corporate and finance had 60 new attorney hires in Texas. Within these practice areas, corporate hiring has been primarily concentrated in M&A and, especially, in the private equity space. With regards to finance practice groups, debt finance, including syndicated and leveraged lending, was the busiest hiring area.

Real estate continues to be a busy practice area, especially in Dallas. These associates handle a wide variety of sophisticated commercial real estate transactions, including purchases, sales, leasing, development, management, and ventures. There are approximately 20 associate real estate opportunities currently in Texas.

The tip-off for the March Madness Tournament started yesterday, so let’s get started! The Texas legal market is back and is busy, with available positions for associates of all practices and seniority levels. There have been approximately 200 associate hires since September 1, 2020. Law firms are very open and happy to relocate candidates coming from other markets.

Stay tuned to see what’s next… A Texas team hasn’t won the NCAA Tournament since 1966. This year, there are seven teams from the Lone Star State that made the tournament. If a Texas team wins it all, Lateral Link will extend the March Madness Placement Bonus until June 1.[[2]](#_ftn2) Enjoy the games, and Hook’em Horns!!

# Biglaw Salary Hike: Not All Offices Are Created Equal

So we know that [some folks are bound to be left out in the cold](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-bad-news-who-wont-be-matching/?rf=1) when it comes to the new associate compensation scale. Some firms simply won’t be able to make the move. But after [Weil Gotshal & Manges](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-biglaw-giant-goes-to-180k-for-all-u-s-offices/) and [Milbank Tweed](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/) made it clear the raises were for all U.S. associates, there was hope that if a firm matched, it would do it in all of its (U.S.) offices.

That dream has been squashed for associates at one Biglaw firm. Earlier today, the powers that be at Covington & Burling, one of the nation’s [15 most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/2016-vault-law-firm-rankings-self-perpetuating-prestige/), sent all associates the email below (don’t worry if you can’t read it, the full text is on the next page). In it they make clear that the attorneys outside of their New York office (like the 500+ lawyers in their D.C. office) are sh!t outta luck when it comes to a payday bump:

Talk about a gut punch. On the one hand, you can’t accuse the firm of being opaque about its compensation decisions. On the other, it’s called brutal honesty for a reason.

At least the possibility of a raise for New York Covington associates looks pretty good. The firm says, “We are not planning to increase associate salaries in any market outside New York.” While I wouldn’t go on a shopping spree just yet, they seem to imply NY will go to 180. But for the rest of the Covington associates, I’m sorry, that sucks.

(You can read the full text of the firm’s email on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/2/).)

# Beyond Biglaw: Interview With A 'NewLaw' Pioneer (Part 1)
## An interview with the COO of a law firm founded with the idea of offering clients and lawyers an alternative to Biglaw structure and rates.

I recently had the opportunity to meet in person, and then conduct a written interview with, [Marlene Laro](http://www.potomaclaw.com/attorney-profiles/marlene-e-laro/), partner and chief operating officer of [Potomac Law Group](http://www.potomaclaw.com/), a law firm founded with the idea of offering clients and lawyers an alternative to Biglaw structure and rates. Over the course of our conversation, and as reflected in Marlene’s answers below, it became clear that we may be on the cusp of an explosion of a new breed of law firms entering the broader legal market. Lawyers considering launching their own firms, or joining existing ones, will likely benefit from the paths forged by firms like Potomac Law, and other smaller firms which embrace varied business models and approaches to success in a competitive legal services landscape. I hope that readers find the interview with Marlene as interesting as I found learning about the impressive firm she and her partner, [Ben Lieber](http://www.potomaclaw.com/attorney-profiles/benjamin-lieber/), have built.

GK: We at [KSK](http://www.kskiplaw.com/) have found it important, particularly as Biglaw refugees, to provide an easy categorization of our firm to others. In our case, we often say we are a focused boutique, or something along those lines. How do you characterize Potomac Law’s model?

ML: “New-model law firm” is typically the term applied to Potomac Law, but this label is very broad. Within the “new model” category, there is a spectrum of legal services providers, from high-end legal staffing providers to virtual firms offering shared marketing platforms to true law firms utilizing a distributed workforce. We put ourselves firmly in this last category. We often refer to our firm as a “traditional law firm with a modern twist,” which conveys that we offer a similar level of legal service and talent as a Biglaw firm, but with greater reliance on technology and telecommuting to reduce overhead and enable considerably lower rates.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
GK: What are the similarities between Biglaw and Potomac Law?

ML: The typical Potomac Law lawyer is of the same caliber found in Biglaw — highly experienced in a particular field with excellent academic credentials and good client hands. That’s not entirely surprising considering most of our lawyers join us from Biglaw’s partner, counsel, or senior associate ranks. As in a traditional law firm, our lawyers often work collaboratively on client matters, particularly in the case of litigation and M&A work. We also have a healthy mix of rainmakers and service attorneys at our firm, as you would find in Biglaw. Another important similarity is the complexity of work — we have grown in five short years to develop very active practices in a range of higher-end fields, including patent, tech transactions, and IP litigation.

GK: What are some key differences between Biglaw and Potomac Law?

ML: The primary difference (other than billing rates!) is that we do not make use of a classic pyramid/apprenticeship model. Our lawyers have a minimum of seven years, and on average over 20 years, of legal experience; we do not have junior or mid-level associates. Clients often feel the best value is found at the senior associate and partner levels (where they avoid having to pay to train attorneys), and so we have built a firm around these profiles.

That leads me to another key difference — office space. While we have the nice, well-appointed office space one might expect of a 60-lawyer firm, it is small — very small — and is meant more for team sessions, client meetings, and firm lunches than as a day-to-day workspace. Most of the work is performed remotely, again keeping our overhead down.

In addition to lower hourly rates, as a younger firm we have the flexibility to provide a greater range of fee arrangements, from fixed fee to success-based to other creative, shared-risk approaches. I should note that very often clients are content with our primary fee arrangement (low hourly rates), but we do work with them to shape alternatives where there is an interest.

All of the above is from the client perspective, but there are some important differences from the attorney perspective as well. We do not have minimum billable hours for attorneys, nor do we have origination targets for partners. That’s a function of our compensation model — we pay lawyers based on their billings and originations, typically at a much higher effective percentage than in Biglaw. Lawyers also have much greater latitude to set their own rates here. We believe that this model is a win-win: for clients, who enjoy lower rates, and for attorneys, who keep much more of what they earn.

GK: What are the downsides to your firm’s model?

ML: The freedom and flexibility of working remotely does come at something of a cost in terms of firm cohesiveness, as relationships among our attorneys form more slowly due to the distributed nature of our workforce. As a management team, we spend a lot of time thinking through ways to foster an increased sense of community among our lawyers and staff. We try to create opportunities for colleagues to get to know one another more quickly, as we recognize that informal interaction that happens spontaneously around the office water cooler is less likely in our model. Some of that happens naturally with the larger team-based matters, but to supplement we host firm events, such as regular Lunch & Learns with guest speakers, conferences, and happy hours, to bring lawyers together. Over time, lawyers feel part of the team as they cross-market their services and work on client matters together.

Also, our model works best with lawyers who are comfortable with technology and working with people who are in different physical locations.

GK: Has anyone explicitly argued to you that your model is incongruent with providing sophisticated legal services to sophisticated clients? How do or would you respond?

ML: Not yet — and they are running out of time!

The way we see it, a common physical presence is no longer essential to delivering high-end legal services to a demanding corporate base with complex needs. A fine legal mind backed by a technology infrastructure, a communications platform, a collaborative environment, and a capable, responsive support group in the form of paralegals and legal assistants is more than sufficient.

And I think our experience has borne that out. Our clients are a diverse set, spanning multiple industries and ranging in size, from Fortune 500 companies to early-stage startups. Their legal needs are varied and often complex. We represent major multinational corporations, including 6 of the Fortune 100, and those clients have remained with us.

Thanks to Marlene for her thoughts, and we will be back next week with Part 2 of our interview.

# 3 Tips For IP Summer Associates
## Demonstrating a true interest in IP and the desire to work hard to learn more will set any summer associate apart.

Back in 2015, I gave some [advice](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/beyond-biglaw-interviewing-for-a-summer-associate-position/) for law students hoping to score a summer associate position with a law firm. As we approach the summer, it is as good a time as any to share some advice for this (and future) year’s crop of summer associates — particularly those who are angling for a career practicing IP law. Yes, I am a bit removed at this point from my Biglaw days. Even more so from my days as a summer associate myself. But I do have past experience as a summer associate mentor, as well as the current perspective of a law firm co-owner who has had the pleasure of working with some ambitious summer interns at our own firm. So here goes. Because if you have to be memorable as a summer associate, you should try to do it in a way that will keep you off ATL’s pages as a cautionary tale. (By the way, the advice below can be adjusted to taste for summer associates who are not practicing IP, or IP lawyers who find themselves in a new firm or professional environment.)

First and foremost, summer associates fortunate enough to have landed a summer job at an IP boutique or with the IP group of a Biglaw firm should remember that gratitude is always a virtue. Even when we are sure that our hard work and talent have earned us any measure of professional success, we must remember that other deserving people may not have been as lucky. Yes, we can and should take pride in our accomplishments — and earning a summer associate position is an accomplishment. But that does not excuse anyone from tainting that accomplishment by lording it over their classmates, or showing up for work with a sense of entitlement. As I have said many times before, law is a brutal profession where everyone needs some good fortune to succeed. A sense of entitlement, or burning personal bridges by being remembered by classmates as a jerk, is professional poison. So stay humble.

Remember as well that humility is only a virtue when practiced. As a summer associate, you will be interacting with colleagues from other schools, as well as law firm personnel that span the gamut of the firm’s hierarchy. Every interaction you have, whether it be with lawyers or support staff, is an opportunity to make a good impression. Take that opportunity. Pay particular care to the firm lawyers and staff who are investing their time and energy into making your summer associate experience a pleasurable one. Thank them for their efforts, while avoiding behaviors that suggest you are unprepared to flourish in a law firm environment.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Pay attention to those lawyers who seem to have a good reputation around the firm, especially if they are not rainmakers. Observe and try to model your behavior on their behavior. Especially when it comes to things like dress, being on time, showing interest in those things the firm is exposing you to, or how to interact with others. Why them and not a rainmaker? Because everyone is forced to respect a rainmaker, or to at least tolerate behaviors by that rainmaker that younger lawyers would never be able to get away with. Focus instead on the up-and-comers, at least in terms of choosing what behaviors to emulate. They are doing what you aspire to do, by flourishing as associates and junior partners in a law firm environment while practicing IP law.

Second, keep in mind that while you are technically colleagues with your fellow summers, you are also being evaluated against them. As a general rule, therefore, it is best to never give them (or anyone else) ammunition that could be used against you in a professional setting. No need to be paranoid that they are out to get you though. So by all means be friendly and outgoing within the limits of your personality’s comfort zone. But avoid gossip at all costs, whether it be about fellow summers, the firm, or any of the firm’s employees you interact with. Moreover, you should avoid sharing personal details about yourself to the extent possible. A good rule of thumb is to never talk about your personal life unless directly asked and even then to give as general a set of answers as possible. Stay away from involving others in your personal dramas. Yes, it seems wonderful to make “work friends.” But you have chosen a brutal profession and work friendships in this business are forged over many years of shared tribulation and toil as colleagues. Not by becoming mutual emotional sponges for someone else as summer associates. Save the personal stuff for your real friends or family, not the workplace, especially at this nascent stage of your career.

Finally, always keep in mind that lawyers love to talk about themselves. And remember fondly those that give them the opportunity to do so. Especially if that person does a good job of showing that they are actually interested in what they are hearing. It is important, therefore, to seize any opportunity you have to proactively talk to the firm’s lawyers about IP and their current practices. Ask them about what they are doing that is interesting to them now, or how their practice has changed over the years. They will by and large prefer a conversation along those lines than trying to make small talk about sports or the weather.

You can even be a go-getter and ask if they have any recommendations about areas within IP law that they think have the potential to heat up going forward, so you can start learning more about those topics before you join the firm full-time. Interest is infectious and even the most jaded IP lawyer will likely want to help a younger colleague who shows genuine desire to advance in the field. Think of your interactions with those lawyers as opportunities to learn and it will get noticed favorably. Which is the entire goal of being a summer associate experience — to leave the firm feeling secure that you can be brought on full-time right out of law school. Demonstrating a true interest in IP and the desire to work hard to learn more will set any summer associate apart. So enjoy your summer and leave that good taste behind.

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Senior Associates In High Demand Amid Staffing 'Scramble'
## It's rare for something like this to happen, but more senior associates than usual are being sought out by law firms for lateral opportunities.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

For the first time in a long time, there is a preference for associates with six-plus years of experience, due to an understanding or a misperception that junior associates may not have been as well-trained during the pandemic.

— [Ru Bhatt](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/ru-bhatt?byconsultantorauthor=ru-bhatt), a New York-based associate recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/06/litigators-are-scrambling-to-staff-cases-battling-rate-revenue-and-quality-challenges/), on the state of legal hiring at the moment, with firms showing a preference for more senior attorneys with “transferable skills” (i.e., the ability to run cases or deals), as partners are reportedly “scrambling” to appropriately staff cases. Bhatt did say that such a demand for senior associates is unusual, but that “[g]iven how strong of a need there is, it’s a bit of a unique situation this year.”

# Cravath Elects Its Next Presiding Partner, M&A Star Faiza Saeed

Faiza J. Saeed

When I was a little boy growing up in the New Jersey suburbs, reading my mother’s back issues of Architectural Digest in the basement while other boys played baseball and such, I came across a compliment that stuck with me over the years. Someone (I can’t remember who) complimented Mica Ertegun, noted interior designer and wife of music mogul Ahmet Ertegun, using these words: “So elegant she can wear linen without wrinkling it.”

If any Biglaw partner deserves such high praise, it’s M&A rock star [Faiza Saeed](https://www.cravath.com/fsaeed/), who was just elected the next presiding partner of storied Cravath, Swaine & Moore (as reported last night by Julie Triedman of the [American Lawyer](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/07/13/cravath-elects-top-ma-partner-faiza-saeed-as-new-leader/?slreturn=20160614082347)). The 50-year-old Saeed, who currently serves as co-head of M&A at CSM, will take the reins in January 2017 from [C. Allen Parker](https://www.cravath.com/aparker/), whose four-year term concludes at the end of this year. She will become the firm’s 16th presiding partner and its first woman leader — and she will be in that role in 2019, when the firm celebrates its bicentennial anniversary.

I have been fascinated by Faiza Saeed for many years, dating back to a profile of her that appeared in New York magazine back in February 2001, when she was a young partner at Cravath. (It’s not online, sadly, but I fished it out of my storage unit last night; sometimes it pays to be a packrat.) The writer, Cameron Stracher, commended Saeed for having “an amazing client list for any lawyer, even more amazing considering that Saeed is 35 and made partner only two years ago.” After describing her background — daughter of Pakistani immigrants, majored in molecular biology and economics at UC Berkeley, almost went to medical school but wound up at Harvard Law School instead — Stracher noted that “though she doesn’t make a banker’s salary, she doesn’t do too badly (average profits per partner at Cravath last year were $2.1 million). And she is worth it.”

In the spirit of “Throwback Thursday,” I must also confess that I was intrigued by the photo of Saeed that ran with the article (at right, click to enlarge; “no filter,” as the kids say on Instragram). She’s wearing a lavender blazer — not typical attire for a top practitioner in the macho, male-dominated world of mergers and acquisitions — and she exudes the calmness and wisdom that have made her a leading lawyer for Fortune 500 companies over the years. At the same time, the portrait reflects a certain seriousness — perhaps a sadness — that makes you want to know more about this goddess of M&A.

I had the privilege of meeting Faiza Saeed in person more than a decade later, at a 2013 DealBook/New York Times conference where she spoke on a panel about activist investing and I served as a post-panel discussion facilitator. She was superb on the panel; I emailed a friend at the time, “She’s amazing — very eloquent, poised, and polished — she could be a TV newscaster.” She was warm and friendly when I approached her and introduced myself, although without giving up that air of mystery that so intrigued me.

Those who know Faiza Saeed have nothing but raves. One fellow Cravath partner described her to me succinctly: “Wonderful.” Outgoing presiding partner Allen Parker told Sara Randazzo of the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/cravath-swaine-moore-names-faiza-saeed-as-presiding-partner-1468455684) that Saeed is “a person of real character and integrity,” who will be an excellent leader of the firm.

Saeed’s clients — which include, as noted by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/business/dealbook/faiza-saeed-to-become-first-woman-to-lead-cravath-swaine-moore.html?_r=0), Precision Castparts (sold to Berkshire Hathaway for $37 billion), DreamWorks (sale pending to NBCUniversal for $4 billion), and Yahoo (very much hoping to sell itself) — adore her as well. I reached out to [Paul Cappuccio](http://www.timewarner.com/company/management/senior-corporate-executives/paul-t-cappuccio), executive vice president and general counsel of longtime Cravath client Time Warner, who shared these comments on Saeed:

Faiza, along with a couple of her partners, has been our go-to lawyer on many of our most important transactions over the last two decades. She is not merely a superb transactional lawyer, but also a trusted boardroom counsellor, whose advice and judgment both our management and board value very highly. She is also a wonderful person, who helps make everything she works on a more enjoyable experience.

Saeed will continue to maintain her M&A practice, which shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. She is a key rainmaker in Cravath’s corporate group, a major draw and contact point for clients (even more so in the wake of Scott Barshay’s [departure for Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/) earlier this year).

And being presiding partner does leave some room for maintaining a practice. Cravath is small by Biglaw standards — a shade under 500 lawyers, almost all of them in New York (aside from a small London office) — and running it is not as all-consuming a job as being managing partner of certain other Biglaw firms.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
First, Cravath has an executive director, Donna Rosenwasser, who handles day-to-day management. Second, its partnership — at 89 members, also small by Biglaw standards — is famously democratic. It holds regular, in-person lunch meetings, something that Biglaw mega-firms with hundreds of partners all over the globe can’t do, and even rank-and-file partners have input into firm decisions. Being presiding partner at Cravath doesn’t come with the dictatorial control of managing partner at many other firms; as noted by Paul Barrett of the [WSJ](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB879709788788692000) back in 1997, the job “comes with modest official powers and relies more on persuasion.” Indeed, former presiding partner Samuel Butler famously [compared the post](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB879709788788692000) to being “a fire hydrant in the presence of 70-odd dogs.”

The history-making nature of Faiza Saeed’s election as Cravath’s first female presiding partner should also be noted. As we’ve chronicled repeatedly in these pages, the ranks of Biglaw partners, especially equity partners, are sorely lacking in gender diversity. A mere [18 percent of equity partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/why-arent-more-women-being-promoted-to-partner-in-law-firms/) are women, according to [a study](http://www.nawl.org/p/cm/ld/fid=506) by the National Association of Women Lawyers. As for managing partners, the numbers are even smaller; Saeed joins just a handful of women leading Am Law 100 firms. The two most prominent right now, as noted by [DealBook](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/business/dealbook/faiza-saeed-to-become-first-woman-to-lead-cravath-swaine-moore.html?_r=0), are Jami Wintz McKeon of Morgan Lewis and Kathryn J. Fritz of Fenwick & West. With all due respect to Morgan Lewis and Fenwick, however, it’s fair to say that as of January, Cravath will be the most prestigious, profitable, and white-shoe firm to boast a woman leader.

Although he still has a few months on the job, it is appropriate at this time to congratulate outgoing presiding partner Allen Parker on his spectacularly successful tenure. He hands Cravath over to Faiza Saeed in great shape. Last year the firm advised on a record-breaking $927 billion in deals, placing second in the league tables only to Skadden (a much larger firm by headcount), and enjoyed profits per partner of $3.56 million, an increase of 5.6 percent over the prior year and good for a sixth-place finish in the [Am Law 100 ranked by PPP](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/). Cravath also [took back the #1 spot](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/?rf=1) from Wachtell in the Vault 100 rankings, which rank the nation’s top law firms by prestige and are closely followed by law students and young lawyers choosing between employers.

More importantly for Biglaw as a whole, Allen Parker spearheaded Cravath’s [recent pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), which has reverberated throughout the world of large law firms and taken the standard starting salary to $180,000 (and reallocated hundreds of millions in compensation from partners to associates in the process). Parker thought it was the right thing to do — and he did it, despite possible [client pushback](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/), demonstrating a significant amount of courage as well as Cravath’s continued leadership of Biglaw. Mr. Parker, the law firm associates of America salute you.

Congratulations to Faiza Saeed on her election as Cravath’s next presiding partner, and congratulations to Cravath on selecting its next leader — a brilliant lawyer and leader, magnificently equipped to take one of America’s great law firms into its third century of success. Without wrinkling any linen.

# The Curious Conflict-Check Maze
## What happens when outside counsel conflict checks turn into a way for firms to evaluate whose business is worth more to them?

Despite their smiles as we shook hands and they left the conference room, we knew our mutual peace would be short lived. After months of back and forth negotiations over a sizable dispute with one of the nation’s largest insurance companies, we knew we were headed to court.

At best, our new agreement would buy us a few weeks, but more than likely we knew we had only bought ourselves a couple of days. In either event, we knew we would be in need of some outside counsel help, and fast.

To those Biglaw colleagues reading in hopes of gleaning a little bit of insight into the selection process, I will save you the read. Sometimes there is little analysis put into the decision.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the instant case, we knew we needed help, we knew the size of the dispute was large, and we did not care what we would have to pay counsel to protect our interest. Thus we started with the largest firms and worked backward.

Given the size of our hospital network, to say the respective firms’ managing partners were easy to get ahold of would be an understatement. You could practically hear the screech of their S-Classes’ tires racing through the city streets in an effort to meet with us as soon as possible.

At the start of each meeting, the large grins and visions of dollar signs dancing in their heads quickly faded as we named our likely opposing party. By and large, all were polite as they attempted to side-step our business, but by the seventh decline, they all pretty much started to sound the same.

“Oh, it’s insurer X, well you know we would love to help, but I think we are conflicted out for X, Y, or Z reason. But thanks for thinking of us and please keep us in mind for future engagements.”

And one by one, just as quickly as they had filed in to discuss the potential engagement, they left with the same sullen look.

That is, until our eighth meeting gave us a glimmer of hope. After being told no seven times before, the eighth told us they thought they could help, but that they would need to consult with their firm’s management committee.

We ended with a sense of hope and relief that our search was finally over until the firm called back to inform us they had an existing engagement with the insurer, but they were confident they could sufficiently wall off the engagement so as not to present a conflict to our present engagement.

Gee, how kind of you to offer up a reduced legal team so you could preserve your existing engagement with our adverse party. This time, we were the ones politely declining and onto the ninth meeting we went.

Eventually, we secured outside counsel and, to date, they have proven to be a capable partner in our corner. But if you could not tell already, the search for outside counsel left a bitter taste in my mouth.

The conflict check I had always heard about, and even recall from my professional responsibility course in law school, seemed a whole lot less about ethics than it did as a way for a firm to evaluate whose business was worth more to them.

At the end of the day, I understand. Keeping a steady large client happy is often more important than a single engagement, as sizable as it may be.

But if you are a firm who has constantly attempted to develop our business on numerous occasions, when the opportunity finally presents itself, might I suggest something more than a generic decline used nearly verbatim by your Biglaw competitors.

# The Law Schools Where The Most Graduates Got Jobs At Large Firms (2019)
## You don't necessarily need to go to a top law school to get a job at a top law firm.

Do you like money? Of course you do, you’ve got student loans to pay off. Do you like prestige? Obviously, you’re a Type A law student. If you’re like the majority of your colleagues and you’d like to embark upon upon a career path that’ll pad your wallet and get you in on the ground floor at a prestigious firm, then you’ll probably want to compete for a job at a large firm.

[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/06/09/law-grads-hiring-report-job-stats-for-the-class-of-2019/) produced several helpful charts based on law school employment data for the class of 2019. Today, we will take a look at one of the more interesting charts, the law schools that sent the highest percentage of their most recent graduating class into large firms with 100 or more lawyers. On this list, you’ll find a dazzling array of law schools from the T14, but we’re not here to tell you what you already know — that graduates of top law schools get top jobs. That being said, we’re going to dive a little deeper into the list and highlight the schools you may not realize are some of the top large-firm contenders. Here they are for your viewing pleasure:

26. Howard: 30.08 percent
37. Pittsburgh: 23.33 percent
40. Brooklyn: 22.63 percent
43. Saint Louis: 21.34 percent
50. Loyola-Chicago: 19.80 percent
53. Chicago-Kent: 18.53 percent
54. Case Western: 18.18 percent
65. Albany: 16.18 percent
67. Wayne State: 15.79 percent
70. Seton Hall: 15.00 percent

# What’s Next in 2021? My Crystal Ball Is In The Shop
## Right now, a top-of-mind issue is whether to RTW (return to work) or continue to WFH (work from home).

Above The Law has been rife with news about salaries and bonuses in Biglaw recently, as the firms race to reward lawyers who have sweated blood and tears for clients during the pandemic. They deserve whatever monetary accolades they receive. However, there has been a lot of soul-searching during these past 16 months as to whether the juice is worth the squeeze: is it worth all that money in exchange for the Faustian bargain made? The number of billable hours required: the nights, the weekends, the loss of family and friend time in the crunch to make those numbers. If the student loan debt were to be wiped out, would there still be as many lawyers in Biglaw or would that number diminish as lawyers, suffering under that burden, make other choices? How many lawyers would choose to live, [as Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/39409.html), almost 200 years ago, by quarrels, which is what we do as lawyers?

That is, of course, a very personal decision and choice, but there is something to be said that money isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Remember the old saying that “[money doesn’t buy happiness](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210629-the-great-resignation-how-employers-drove-workers-to-quit?ocid=global_worklife_rss&xtor=ES-213-%5BBBC%20News%20Newsletter%5D-2021July1-%5Bworklife%5D)”?

It seems that staff members, without which no law firm can function successfully, [are disposable](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/biglaw-firms-are-raising-salaries-and-cutting-jobs-at-the-same-time/).

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

One firm, in additional to pink slipping associates last fall, has ditched secretarial positions for a new twist on an old idea: [the office secretarial pool](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/associate-layoffs-and-staff-cuts-come-to-am-law-50-biglaw-firm/), now called a “resource center.”  Many years ago, when most readers weren’t even on the planet yet, one client that I worked for had a word processing center (in the days before we had individual PCs). Secretaries (before the term legal assistant came in use) would type correspondence (e.g., letters, memos, and the like) and do the copying and filing, but the heavy-duty lifting of typing and revising documents and pleadings was done in the word processing center. What goes around seems to come around.

Yes, we have always been told to “do more with less,” but there’s a [point of diminishing returns](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/associate-layoffs-and-staff-cuts-come-to-am-law-50-biglaw-firm/), and I wonder if we’re at that point now. It shouldn’t just be the care and feeding of lawyers, but also of staff. Staff always takes the first hit. Even if they are dialing for receivable dollars, staff is still a below-the-line item.

Right now, a top-of-mind issue is whether to RTW (return to work) or continue to WFH (work from home). On a CNBC program, Mark Cuban summed up the dilemma that employers are facing as to whether to compel employees to return to work or cut them some slack. “How companies respond to that very question is going to define their brand for decades,” he said. “If you rushed in and somebody got sick, you were that company. If you didn’t take care of your employees or stakeholders and put them first, you were that company.” For many employees, cautioned Cuban, “that’s going to be unforgivable.”

What’s that? You’ve put in the requisite number of years for a judgeship, you are tired of business development and billing, and now you think the bench might be the next logical step. Doable? I don’t know what other states are doing, but here in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the creation of a [statewide judicial mentorship program](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/01/governor-newsom-launches-california-judicial-mentor-program-to-promote-a-diverse-and-inclusive-judiciary/?mc_cid=ff3cb8d571&mc_eid=0b7a22146c), way too late for any dinosaurs who lusted after the judiciary (that was me for a nanosecond), but in time for those who come after us.

Working groups of judicial officers will pitch judicial service to “support and encourage lawyers and judges considering service on the appellate and trial courts. The program will work to identify and provide judicial mentors for these individuals and deploy informational resources and tool kits about the judicial appointment process.” The goal is to make the judiciary look more like the state’s population, which is minority majority. While there’s no guarantee that participating in the program will result in an appointment, nor is it a prerequisite to the judicial application process, it sure won’t hurt.

Mentoring those already in practice is great, no doubt about that, but what about the pipeline? Where are future lawyers going to come from? How will they be encouraged to seek legal careers, given the cost of a legal education? Here’s one [resource in my state](https://calawpathways.org/). Established in 2015, it will take time to show substantive results, but it’s a start.

And last, but not least, yet another “heads-up” about the perils of social media. (You know I can’t resist, since I am not a social media fan, and this is just another example of why not.)

No lawyer should ever tell a Facebook friend how to get rid of her ex-boyfriend (or anyone else for that matter). The Tennessee Supreme Court [suspended a lawyer](https://www.tncourts.gov/sites/default/files/in_rewinstonbranshawsitton.opn_.pdf) for four years (one-year actual suspension and three years’ probation) for doing exactly that.

After giving the advice, the lawyer thought better of it, and suggested to that friend she delete the entire thread because premeditation could be used against her at trial. The court decided that the attorney’s advice was clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice and violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. “In addition, his choice to post the remarks on a public platform amplified their deleterious effect.” The court went on to say that “The social media posts fostered a public perception that a lawyer’s role is to manufacture false evidence.”  As if the public doesn’t think that already; recent news headlines speak for themselves. It was, the court said, projection of “a public image of the corruption of the judicial process.”

It will forever boggle my mind that lawyers, who are supposed to be smarter than the average bear, can’t help themselves on social media. I don’t understand why there’s this need to show off when it only leads to trouble for the lawyer. And trouble is the last thing that any lawyer needs.

# What Really Goes On At Kirkland & Ellis
## This data is invaluable for anyone considering a career in Biglaw.

Kirkland & Ellis is known for making more partners than the average Biglaw shop — that’s good news if you’re looking to start your career at the firm. But, the bad news is they get elevated to nonshare partner status — a lower tier than equity partnership. After four years they’re eligible to be real life equity partners and the model has been [described](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202770008488/Shearman-Gambles-on-Wall-Street-Rarity-Nonequity-Partners) as “up [to the equity ranks] or out [of the firm].” With only about 20 percent of nonshare partners making it to the promised land of full fledged partnership, one has to wonder — where do all these talented lawyers wind up?

Well, it turns out “up or out” may not be a hard and fast rule at Kirkland. According to [detailed reporting](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/10/09/what-happens-to-kirklands-legions-of-income-partners/) by the American Lawyer, of the attorneys elevated to nonshare partnership between 2010 and 2013, 43 percent are still at the firm. For those that do leave Kirkland, usually they wind up at other Biglaw firms (read: mostly King & Spalding and Sidley Austin):

The most common landing ground for Kirkland’s income partners is at other Am Law 200 firms. Across the four Kirkland income partner classes analyzed by The American Lawyer, roughly a quarter of those lawyers are now practicing at other firms, according to those firms’ websites, state bar registrations and individual profiles on professional networking website LinkedIn. Two of the most common firms for Kirkland refugees are King & Spalding and Sidley Austin.

Other former Kirkland partners wound up in-house — 21 percent landed there, often with high profile jobs like Chief Legal Officer or General Counsel. Less than 10 percent turned to government work after leaving K&E. The balance started their own firms, became entrepreneurs, or wound up in academia.

Importantly, American Lawyer also noted some interesting gender disparities. Men were more likely to get the nod to be nonshare partners in the first place — 69 percent of partners in the classes analyzed were men. Men are also more likely to stay at the firm — 47 percent of men have stay compared with 31 percent of women. Women have a higher percentage of those going in-house post-K&E, 30 percent compared with 18.

What happens after you make partner, but not equity partner is an issue devoid of transparency. But in order to make informed decisions about the second half of your legal career — regardless of the firm you work at — you need information about the options available. This kind of data is invaluable for anyone considering a career in Biglaw.

Husch Blackwell has heard your concerns and wants to assure you everything is just fine. As you may recall, [earlier this week news broke that an attorney at Husch Blackwell](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/donald-trumps-biglaw-attorney-is-helping-kanye-west-get-on-the-presidential-ballot/?rf=1), Lane Ruhland, was spotted delivering to Wisconsin officials signatures to put Kanye West on the presidential ballot. Maybe not the high-powered work you’d expect from a Biglaw attorney, but certainly nothing untoward about it. But then you learn Ruhland, along with others at Husch, represent the Donald Trump reelection campaign.

Let’s drop those receipts, as the kids say, because this just never gets old:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

“No comment” as woman enters election commission building just after 5p in Madison to drop off signatures for Kanye West [pic.twitter.com/zVxePn5Fe2](https://t.co/zVxePn5Fe2)

— Matt Smith (@mattsmith_news) [August 4, 2020](https://twitter.com/mattsmith_news/status/1290770377627631617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Lane Ruhland, the Wisconsin lawyer who dropped off Kanye West's presidential filing at the Wisconsin Board of Elections represented Donald Trump's presidential campaign exactly one week before in federal court [pic.twitter.com/RHajkRDiMO](https://t.co/RHajkRDiMO)

— Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) [August 5, 2020](https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/1290854110368083973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Apparently working for multiple presidential candidates raised some questions among the rank and file at Husch. According to an email circulated internally, firm leadership made clear that a conflicts check was run for the representation of Kanye West and/or his 2020 presidential campaign. They make no mention of how, exactly, this squares with representing another 2020 presidential candidate — and not just representing him on a firm level, the same attorney is apparently working for multiple candidates — for example if conflicts were disclosed and waived or if there’s a limited scope to the representation. Just trust that the conflict has been cleared.

But the firmwide email also makes clear that the “controversial” aspect of the representation (though it isn’t clear if they’re talking about the Kanye campaign or the Trump campaign) isn’t something they particularly care about. And “representation of clients is not an endorsement of said clients’ cultural or political viewpoints.”

Before Better Call Saul, there was Mr. Show. The brainchild of Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, who would go on to another legally themed show in Arrested Development, Mr. Show produced some of the greatest comedy sketches of all time. And one of their greatest centered on [a pair of ad executives pitching GloboChem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uco5Ed-5y2U), a soulless multinational, on a series of ads to shore up the company’s image that all followed the hackneyed style of contemporary advertising… but with jarringly unnecessary profane. The last one just zoomed out to show the Earth from orbit — the image corporations unimaginatively embrace to convey either a worldwide approach or because their contribution to environmental and human misery is less visible from there.

That skit is top of mind after seeing GloboChem’s real-life Biglaw analog, Jones Day, put out an [introductory video on their website](https://www.jonesday.com/en/). [Roll On Friday has a shot by shot breakdown that cannot be matched](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/bonkers-law-firm-website-jones-day-goes-large), so you should definitely read that. But in a nutshell, Jones Day clearly hired some ad executives who asked what exactly it was that Jones Day did and when they heard it was stuff like [this](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/investigation-into-jones-day-reveals-endemic-culture-of-sexual-inappropriateness/), and [this](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/jones-day-files-for-sanctions-in-ongoing-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/), and [this](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/donald-trumps-amazing-cease-desist-letter/), they responded, “Well, screw that, let’s just put entirely random stock footage together and hope it flies.” And then they contemplated the existential dread that follows first learning about Jones Day.

Why are they watching the Space Shuttle? As well-oiled as the revolving door between Jones Day and the Trump administration is, NASA is one of the agencies their alumni aren’t running. See what I mean about the superficial corporate imagery? Mission control is a team, so this conveys that Jones Day is a team too! In a way that actual Jones Day footage never could because… [stuff like this](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/lawsuit-alleges-jones-day-doctored-firm-picture-to-make-attorney-look-more-caucasian/).



Just to be clear, Jones Day is just a 5-year-old boy being asked what they want to be when they grow up. It’s a fitting homage to how Jones Day likes to say anyone can be firefighters, like when Jones Day partner Kevyn Orr took over Detroit in an undemocratic coup executed by Michigan’s governor and filled the drastic loss of experienced firefighters by [rush training a bunch of people](https://www.michiganradio.org/post/detroit-emergency-manager-plans-train-more-firefighters). Very meta.

There’s a symphony orchestra in there for some reason too. What a glorious acid trip we’re on together!

# Law Firm Leaders Were Cautiously Optimistic... Before $180K Raises And Brexit
## Law firms were in good shape before everything went to hell.

At least that’s the takeaway from the latest Citi Private Bank Law Firm Leaders Confidence Index. The report, compiling responses from the “Managing Partners, Chairs, Executive Directors, COOs and CFOs of 155 law firms (38 Am Law 50, 34 Am Law 51-100, 39 Am Law 2nd 100, 44 Niche/smaller),” gathered the mood of firm leaders on the economy and firm financials for the second half of 2016.

The conclusions are, actually, a curious artifact at this point. It’s hard to say how these leaders would have felt about the global economy months before Brexit. Or how they understood growth long before Cravath kicked the salary hornet’s nest.

For example, on the question of the Global Economy, leaders were lukewarm:

Oh, how many firms watched their London office disappear in a burst of Floo powder after they filled this survey out. There should be [an online petition](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/26/europe/uk-second-referendum-petition/) for these leaders to change their votes on the Citi survey.

Meanwhile, the demand growth numbers are what we’re used to seeing out of law firms: “good, not great.”

Growth greater than 5%	8%
Growth 2-5%	35%
Growth less than 2%	18%
Unchanged	18%
Decrease less than 2%	11%
Decrease 2-5%	7%
Decrease greater than 5%	2%

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A total of 61 percent of respondents see a demand increase of some kind. That’s down from the 66 percent who saw the same trend in the last report. The moral of the story is that law firm leaders are still “cautiously optimistic.” Will this hold with the U.K. trying to blow up its economy and clients worried about raises bringing on creeping fees?

But for the $180K question: what of associate FTE over the second half of the year?

Growth greater than 3%	19%
Growth 1-3%	30%
Growth less than 1%	12%
Unchanged	18%
Decrease less than 1%	8%
Decrease 1-3%	8%
Decrease greater than 3%	5%
This is actually a bit of a pullback from the previous report, but this was also before firms opened up their coffers. There’s a price for everything in this world, and with the majority of law firm leaders believing, consistently across these reports, that partners are pretty much maxed out on utilization, it’s going to be the associates who have to pick up the slack.

The next report is going to be very interesting on the FTE question…

# At Long Last Biglaw Giant Makes Its Compensation Move

It was only Friday that Above the Law HQ received emails from desperate WilmerHale associates anxious over the firm’s radio silence on the important issue of associate compensation. One tipster characterized the mood at the firm as “open revolt.” And associates had every reason to be pissed. Peer firms were going around raising salaries and offering special summer bonuses while Wilmer — [with its $1,137,300,000 in 2017 revenue and clocking in at #36 on the profits per partner rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/?rf=1) — stayed quiet about the monetary fate of its associates.

But the firm is silent no more.

Today the firm announced raises for its associates in accordance with the prevailing market scale — yes, they’re effective as of yesterday, July 1st, the same effective date most other Biglaw firms:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
1st Year Associate: $190,000
2nd Year Associate: $200,000
3rd Year Associate: $220,000
4th Year Senior Associate: $255,000
5th Year Senior Associate: $280,000
6th Year Senior Associate: $305,000
1st Year Counsel: $325,000
2nd Year and Above Counsel: $340,000

And, not a firm to fall behind the pack in compensation, they are also providing special bonuses, provided associates are on track to hit the 2,000 hour billing requirement.

1st Year Associate: $5,000
2nd Year Associate: $7,500
3rd Year Associate: $10,000
4th Year Senior Associate: $15,000
5th Year Senior Associate: $20,000
6th Year Senior Associate: $25,000
1st Year Counsel: $25,000
2nd Year and Above Counsel: $25,000

If an associate fails to meet the billing target for the special bonus they’ll have the opportunity to earn that money if they hit their hours by the end of the year.

The last time Elon toured the legal system, he botched the negotiation process so badly that [he locked himself into buying Twitter for $44 billion](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/) so he could provide a safe space for neo-Nazis and anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists. On that front, well, mission accomplished!

Fast forward and Twitter is now worth [a mere $15 billion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-twitter-worth-a-third-of-its-44-billion-price-tag-fidelity/) and the only thing keeping it from bottoming out completely is that the audience still trying to settle on Mastodon or Bluesky or, as the case may be, Threads.

Meta (the artist formerly known as Facebook) unleashed a new microblogging platform called Threads that leverages the company’s existing user base — specifically its Instagram users — to roar out of the gates faster than the other Twitter alternatives out there, boasting 30 million users within 24 hours.

And while Musk chickened out of a challenge to fight Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a cage match, [blaming his mother in the process](https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-mom-not-allowed-fight-mark-zuckerberg), he’s still itching for a fight and yesterday he sent Meta a mean legal threat.

Or… not a threat? It’s not really a cease and desist or anything. It’s just a conglomeration of vaguely litigation-sounding words that don’t really add up to much.

The full letter from Quinn Emanuel’s Alex Spiro is below, but here are the highlights:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg:

I write on behalf of X Corp., as successor in interest to Twitter, Inc. (“Twitter”). Based on recent reports regarding your recently launched “Threads” app, Twitter has serious concerns that Meta Platforms (“Meta”) has engaged in systematic, willful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property.

That sounds scary! Alas, it is not.

Over the past year, Meta has hired dozens of former Twitter employees. Twitter knows that these employees previously worked at Twitter; that these employees had and continue to have access to Twitter’s trade secrets and other highly confidential information; that these employees owe ongoing obligations to Twitter; and that many of these employees have improperly retained Twitter documents and electronic devices.

You know, if Twitter wanted to keep those folks from joining other companies, Twitter [didn’t have to fire them all](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-confirms-he-has-fired-over-80-of-twitter-employees-so-far-377045-2023-04-12). Musk bragged about firing 80 percent of Twitter’s staff and apparently never considered the possibility that computer programmers might program computers again. While [his platform became a buggy mess](https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html), those folks found new jobs.

The letter alludes to “ongoing obligations,” a delightfully vague expression that falls well short of “non-compete agreements” because California frowns on non-competes that bar a former employer from locking someone out of their profession. Maybe Twitter is evoking the “bros before platform clones” doctrine.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
If former employees improperly retained documents and electronic devices that could present a real issue… but why would they?

We’re not talking about rocket science here — that’s the other business where Musk drapes himself in the accomplishments of smarter people he employs — it’s a microblogging platform. The “trade secrets” involved are in the money-making algorithm stuff that Threads isn’t even doing yet as it tries to amass users with a pleasant feed for the time being.

Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information. Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice to prevent any further retention, disclosure, or use of its intellectual property by Meta.

Meta will, after they regain composure from the belly laughs, respond, “Thanks, we won’t, peace!”

The letter then goes on an extended jag about Meta not being allowed to scrape Twitter user data, which is a fair point though the whole point of Threads is that it can accrete users through Instagram so it doesn’t need to be trawling Twitter. And it’s not like a company needs some sort of alchemy to get users to leave Twitter, Elon’s managed to do that all on–ALERT: Rate Limit Exceeded.

Sorry, about that. I guess I wrote too many words for the day.

Please consider this letter a formal notice that Meta must preserve any documents that could be relevant to a dispute between Twitter, Meta, and/or former Twitter employees who now work for Meta. That includes, but is not limited to, all documents related to the recruitment, hiring, and onboarding of these former Twitter employees, the development of Meta’s competing Threads app, and any communications between these former Twitter employees and any agent, representative, or employee or Meta.

All that for a litigation hold.

Perhaps Musk is serious about trying to tangle with Facebook and add a massive litigation sinkhole atop his company’s declining value. But it seems as though, if Musk thought he had a case, he’d be filing a lawsuit instead of sending an ersatz cease and desist letter. Meta is not going to yank Threads from the market over some weak sauce speculation that fired Twitter employees consulted arcane Twitter lore to program an app that lets you read short messages.

It’s put up or shut up o’clock on the West Coast. And all we’ve got so far is a lawyerly cage match challenge. His mom should tell him to slink away from this one too.

[Last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/so-you-got-your-grades-now-what-part-i-the-good-news/), I discussed how 1Ls should react, and capitalize, on a strong Fall academic performance. For those students who are regular readers of this column who fit that description, feel free to skip this week’s iteration — rest assured Above the Law corporate overlords, anyone who is reading this sentence has already clicked on the article, so we already have their page view — because I will be focusing on the other side of the Fall grades coin: students who had a weak academic showing.

Not surprisingly, a 4.0 Fall GPA — or for those students in the Yale/Harvard/Stanford tier where grades do not exist, a bunch of smiley face stickers? — results in feelings of ecstasy for students, but in my experience, that level of excitement is surpassed by the feeling of despair that overwhelms students who find themselves at the bottom of the class, perhaps speaking to an inherent pessimistic nature among law students who are doubtful that a strong performance can endure over time, but are confident a weak one will. A law student’s 1L Fall exam period is an all encompassing endeavour which wrings out every drop of effort and determination and represents the first chance most have to gauge their legal abilities vis a vis their peers. Finding out that you did not measure up can be heartbreaking and leave you questioning the rest of your planned professional life.

But I am here to tell those current students, and even those who have been in that position before, not to despair. Why? Well first, understand what a single semester worth of grades does not prove. Not being at the top of your class does not mean you are incompetent and will be unable to practice law in the future. For many law students, especially those at the most selective schools, academic success has been the standard throughout their lives, to the point where a transcript that does not contain all As can generate some . . . odd reactions.

Due to the nature of the bell curve used in most, if not all, 1L classes, the simple fact of the matter is that someone has to do poorly. At many schools, if first-year professors were allowed to deviate from the curve, everyone would get a high mark because they all know the material. But on one day, over the course of a few hours, you were not able to express your mastery of Torts as well as some of your classmates. That is ok. Now, this does not mean that you should not change any of your studying or exam habits for the next semester, doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results is a definition of insanity. Ask your professors to review your exams with you, so you can get a sense as to where and how you erred. But recognizing that a change in studying strategy is necessary is not an indictment of your lawyering ability. And also, take solace in the fact that after the Fall semester, and especially after 1L, your ability to pick and chose courses that not only align better with your interests but with your preferred grading system (i.e., a long paper versus an exam) increases exponentially.

While there are macro concerns that underachieving law students must address, there are also micro issues as well. When it comes to summer jobs, a weak Fall semester might require some reevaluation. If your plan was to land a Biglaw position in a hyper competitive geographic market, that might not be possible (though there are some exceptions as discussed below). Remember that while Biglaw is increasingly embracing 1L hiring, for the most part, it is the 2L summer that is still the most important for post-graduation Biglaw employment. Explore the variety of non-firm opportunities for summer employment, which will still give you some great experience while also not being as grade dependent. Each and every year at Vanderbilt, we have scores of students who work for judges, district attorneys/public defenders, and even in-house departments who spend their 2L summer in Biglaw and work for those employers after graduation.

Also, keep in mind that there are numerous ways to get into a private firm for 1L summer. Many employers have robust programs for underserved populations and these programs are often less dependent on grades than more traditional recruiting methods. And make sure you read the fine print on these programs. While you might not consider yourself a diverse applicant, many firms are looking for a variety of diverse candidates including socioeconomic diversity as well as students who are the first in their family to attend college. If you fit such a description, apply.

Finally, if your grades are truly poor, be willing to have a realistic conversation with yourself, and those closest to you, about your future in the law. If you came to law school with dreams of clerking on the Supreme Court, recognize that is going to be very difficult to achieve at this point. That does not mean you cannot be a competent attorney, but make sure your more realistic goals are worth, to you, the next two and a half years of economic and emotional investment.

The first semester of law school is a time unlike any other in a lawyer’s life which can end in jubilation or dispair. But while the latter category is understandable, it should not be the norm for underachieving students. If you find yourself at the bottom of the class, realize this is not a permanent indictment of your abilities. Just have an honest conversation with yourself and if you want to go back into the ring, dust yourself off and start again.

Remote working for a long period under the spectre of the pandemic has not been easy for anyone, but it has brought with it many benefits too, many of which our people have consistently told us they value highly.

We also know that people miss working together in a physical office space and as a firm we are keen to maintain the very many benefits that face to face interactions and collaboration brings to us and our clients. We think our hybrid working model will allow for the best of both.

— Rob Hill, Clyde & Co U.K. board chair, commenting on the firm’s plan to close one of its London offices under the auspices of a [transition to new “hybrid” working model](https://www.law.com/2021/04/16/clydes-scraps-one-london-office-as-it-rolls-out-new-hybrid-model-of-working-292-86267/), where employees will work from home up to 60% of the time and sign up to book spaces in team “neighborhoods” while in the office. The firm is eliminating 82,574 square feet of office space, a reduction of 36%.

According to a 2024 Client Advisory from Hildebrandt Consulting and Citi Law Firm Group, what percentage of large law firms said they plan on expanding their income partner ranks through 2025?

Biglaw firms continue to roll out cost-cutting measures, and much like the social distancing and isolation that have become part and parcel of our everyday lives due to the coronavirus pandemic, there seems to be no end in sight. From salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs, law firms across the country are doing their damndest to keep their heads above water amid the economic upheaval that’s been brought about by the COVID-19 outbreak.

We’ve received word that yet another Am Law 100 firm is trying to save on cash by having employees share in its financial pain. Ogletree currently places at #73 in the latest Am Law 100 ranking, and sources tell us that the firm decided to cut both salaries and workweek hours for its staff, with some going as far to say their salaries have been halved. We’ve also been told that while the firm has approved special COVID pay for some, when that runs out, they’ll be on unpaid leave (with paid benefits through May 31). It sounds like this is just a polite way of saying these employees have been furloughed. Here’s an excerpt from a memo we received:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


A rather distraught source had this to say about what’s happening at the firm:

In my department, I’m working only two days a week and pulling from a firm-funded COVID leave fund to make up my pay. But once that runs out next week, I have to use Paid Time or Sick Leave. There is no guarantee that I will even be able to work the two days I am now by the end of the month. I have been told I will have to apply for unemployment at that point.

On top of the matters affecting staff members at the firm, Ogletree has [canceled its 2020 summer associate program](https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2020/04/13/ogletree-cancels-summer-associate-program/). The 36 law students who were supposed to work at the firm this summer will not receive any of the compensation that they were relying upon, and sources tell us that unlike other firms, Ogletree has not guaranteed future employment — only hope of such offers “when we emerge from the crisis.”

Last, but not least, sources claim the firm has allegedly laid off attorneys in one of its Texas offices. We are unable to confirm these reports at this time.

We reached out to the firm several times for comment, but have yet to hear back.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

If you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Layoff Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the layoff alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each layoff, salary cut, or furlough announcement that we publish.

# Allen & Overy Loses Managing Partner Amid Shearman Merger Talks
## An unexpected exit from one of the firm's leaders.

Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling are poised to [create a Biglaw behemoth](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/shearman-sterling-allen-overy-merger/), A&O Shearman, if their proposed merger is approved by the partnership of both firms. Once combined, the firm will have 3,900 lawyers with approximately 800 partners, spread across 49 offices. A&O Shearman’s combined revenue will total $3.4 billion.

But there’s nothing quite like a managing partner abandoning ship amid tie-up talks that’ll throw an unexpected wrench into the best laid plans.

Allen & Overy’s global managing partner [Gareth Price](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/people/Gareth-Price), a 30-year veteran of the firm, recently announced that he’d be leaving for “personal reasons,” with a year left to serve in his term. He spent the last three years of his time at the firm as managing partner. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/13/allen-overy-managing-partner-exits-ahead-of-merger-as-revenue-surpasses-2-billion-405-125474/) has more:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Price’s departure will come as a surprise to the wider industry given he still had another year on his term and is only 51 years old. Commenting on the departure, global senior partner, Wim Dejonghe said: “I want to express our gratitude for Gareth’s stellar contribution to A&O over the last 30 years—starting out as a trainee, becoming one of our youngest partners in 2003 and being elected managing partner in 2020.”

He added: “He led our market-leading energy and infrastructure practice for many years and as managing partner steered us through the pandemic and played a pivotal role in the negotiations with Shearman & Sterling that set us up for success in the future.”

Dejonghe, who previously held Price’s position, will be [doing double duty](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/allen-overy-managing-partner-exits-amid-shearman-merger-push) as he takes on the responsibilities of managing partner for the time being until a replacement is named, all while hyping up the merger during a series of worldwide town hall meetings. Dejonghe doesn’t think that Price’s sudden departure will have any effect on the firms’ combination, telling the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/e3baeead-737c-4401-937c-b6150aeb8ac8), “We are on both sides really confident we will get the 75 per cent approval that we need.”

Meanwhile, A&O has been busy spreading the good word about its most recent financial results. The firm increased revenue by 7% over the course of the last year, up to £2.1 billion (~$2.75 billion), of which $2.5 billion was U.S. revenue. Profits drooped, however — from £900 million down to £892 million — which Dejonghe blamed on the “inflationary environment.”

A vote on the merger was originally planned for sometime this summer, but has been pushed back to October.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Firm From The 'Good' Part Of Pennsylvania Matches
## All Biglaw associates in Philly should feel good right now.

Philadelphia couldn’t single-handedly save Pennsylvania from itself. Not this time. The forces from the rest of the state were too strong. The enthusiasm gap was too wide. The suppression was too real.

At least lawyers living in Philadelphia can ask the bank to deliver their bonuses in 50,000 one-dollar bills, so they can roll around in it while screaming, “You’re not getting your coal plants back, you mouth-breathing idiots.”

[Dechert](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/dechert-llp/) matched the Cravath bonus scale this afternoon. Whether or not one has economically marketable skills has little to do with how many Mexicans are in the country, and more to do with whether you had the educational opportunities to land a good job. Dechert associates had that: this is but one of their many rewards. Other rewards include not getting your “news” from Alex Jones and understanding the limits of magical thinking.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Dechert was a little late to [join the MoneyLaw club](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-finally-joins-the-moneylaw-club-raising-associate-salaries/) on raises, though it got there eventually. Today’s news — which came much faster than [Dechert’s 2015 bonus announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-cravath-match-makes-every-day-sunny-for-this-firms-associates/), some two weeks after Cravath — ends what suspense there was from its associates. There is a 1950 hours cutoff in order to be eligible for the bonus. But if you billed less than that, the whole “living your life” thing is kind of your bonus.

Moreover, Dechert is the first mover in the Philly market. Yes, we know — Dechert is now a [global law firm](https://www.dechert.com/) — but it still plays a huge role in setting Philadelphia market comp. All Biglaw associates in that area should feel good right now. Seems like the Philly legal market still thinks of itself more like New York, and less like Alabama.

You can read the full bonus memo on the next page.

As bonus season rolls on, please remember to tell us when your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

# Morning Docket: 09.20.16
## * Alecia Schmuhl, the lawyer accused of teaming up with her husband and plotting to kill the managing partner of the law firm she was fired from, has taken a deal in her case and could serve anywhere from 10 to 45 years in prison under the terms of her plea agreement. She'll be sentenced by the middle of January 2017.

Longtime chairman Peter Kalis will step down at the end of February, and come March, James Segerdahl will serve as the firm's global managing partner, while Michael Caccese will serve as chairman of the firm's management committee. We'll have more on this later today. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/two-lawyers-to-take-helm-of-kl-gates-post-kalis/)] * A big old welcome back to Biglaw: Brackett Denniston III, who has served as general counsel at GE for more than two decades, is throwing in the in-house towel to get back to the daily grind of law firm life. He recently rejoined Goodwin Procter -- a firm where he previously worked for about 15 years -- as senior counsel, and while there, he hopes to work on ""hard cases"" and mentor some of the firm's younger lawyers. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/09/19/longtime-ge-general-counsel-rejoins-goodwin/?ref=/blogs/law)] * What do the Redskins and the Slants have in common, aside from names that some may consider offensive? As it turns out, the football team and the rock band are fighting the same fight before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. They both claim the First Amendment bars the USPTO from refusing to register their ""disparaging"" marks, and the Supreme Court may soon grant cert on either one of their cases. [[Associated Press](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPREME_COURT_OFFENSIVE_TRADEMARKS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT)] * If you're planning to apply to law school during this admissions cycle despite the state of the job market for entry-level attorneys, then you may want to follow this 10-week timeline for submitting your applications. Don't forget that the goal here is to get ahead of the game, take advantage of rolling admissions, and submit all of your materials before those pesky December LSAT test-takers.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Boies Schiller Makes Its Associates VERY Happy Once Again With Giant Bonus Checks
## Great news from a firm that prides itself on top-notch compensation.

Associates at Boies Schiller Flexner are used to having very happy holidays. The firm has long prided itself on the generous compensation it offers its hard-working associates, a product of a formula that includes a revenue share component that affords associates a cut of the matters they work on, which for contingency work can be massive. It’s nice to see a firm buck the tired “copy Cravath or get crazy and copy Cravath plus a few extra bucks” model and try something actually innovative.

This model historically means some associates absolutely blow away the annual Cravath scale. Even the dissenting voices we’ve heard from over the years end up basically matching the scale if not beating it slightly.

BSF just handed out its bonus calculations to associates and everyone seems characteristically happy. It’s interesting because last week, David Boies himself aired a note of caution about bonuses. He worried, after a year that saw the relative impact of BSF’s mid- and senior-level bonuses shrink a bit proportionally to the juniors ([something we touched on a bit here](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/boies-schiller-bonuses-appear-to-underperform-market-but-not-everyone-notices/)), and a summer of firms handing out raises and mid-year bonuses, that perhaps only 70 percent of his associates would find themselves clobbering their peers on the Cravath scale. That sounds pretty good actually, but Boies responded that it does until you remember that previously 90 percent of BSF associates were in that position. As he put it, “you can think of it as the number of associates [not beating Cravath compensation] has now tripled.” That’s a pretty “glass half empty” view of it under the circumstances, but Boies said he was concerned about making sure the firm kept atop the compensation heap.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It sounds like his associates are happy:

- “Boies Schiller bonuses came in this week. Everyone reporting big numbers… Larger than expected. Ppl were anxious about summer raise cutting into bonus, didn’t happen. Executive committee makes big statement on comp. Ppl very happy after a rough year last year.”
- “Just a heads up that BSF local leadership communicated bonus information early this week. People seem quite pleased.”
- “Bonuses here (at least in NYC) are big—I’ve heard all first years into six figures. Can confirm 280k+ for a classmate of mine who had a crazy [year and] billed over 3000. I… got about 190. The bonuses come just before the firm retreat this weekend.”
Exciting news for the BSF crew heading into the firm meeting.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms.

# K&L Gates After Peter Kalis's Reign

Peter Kalis

As we mentioned [yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/peter-kalis-wont-run-for-re-election-as-chair-of-kl-gates/), the longtime chair and managing partner of K&L Gates, [Peter Kalis](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/peter-kalis/), will not be running for re-election after his term ends in February 2017. His departure from the top job will mark the end of an era for the firm: Kalis has led the firm for almost two decades, ever since becoming chair in 1997 at age 47.

In our [story about his departure](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/peter-kalis-wont-run-for-re-election-as-chair-of-kl-gates/), we chronicled Kalis’s triumphs as a leader. Kalis — a Rhodes Scholar, Yale Law School graduate, and Supreme Court clerk — is no stranger to success, and he certainly succeeded in growing K&L Gates. During his tenure, the somewhat provincial Pittsburgh firm evolved into a global giant, through mergers, acquisitions, and lateral hiring. Today it boasts more than $1 billion in annual revenue, generated by almost 2,000 lawyers spread across 46 offices on five continents.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But that expansion came at a cost, some claim. Critics of Kalis — one of Biglaw’s most powerful leaders, nicknamed [“The King”](https://bol.bna.com/at-kl-gates-partners-exit-and-the-king-is-silent/) by some for his strong management style — argue that culture and collegiality at K&L have suffered under his watch. For some past critiques of the Kalis regime at K&L Gates, see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/the-latest-departures-through-the-kl-gates/) (“management is extremely bloated”) and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/why-are-so-many-partners-walking-out-the-kl-gates/) (“it’s run like a dictatorship”).

Some of Kalis’s critics ended up leaving the firm, resulting in the departures of some major rainmakers. As noted by [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/peter-kalis-chair-of-kl-gates-to-step-down/):

[Earlier this year, t]he firm saw partners depart for Mayer Brown, Morgan Lewis & Bockius, and Venable, and internal controversy festered over payments to lateral partner hires. Perhaps most notably, Jeff Randall, an intellectual property partner who joined the firm from Paul Hastings in 2015, was brought on to earn roughly $5 million, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.

Another high-profile lateral the firm brought on board — John Pierce, who joined from Latham & Watkins in January — left the firm after five months for an in-house position at the venture capital fund SGVC. He was a global practice area leader for litigation.

Given the powerful central management at K&L Gates, the question of Kalis’s successor looms large for the firm’s future. Julie Triedman handicaps the field over at [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/06/who-will-be-the-next-chair-of-kl-gates/):

Attention is now focused on three candidates, say several insiders: the firm’s vice chair and general counsel, James Segerdahl, in Pittsburgh; longtime management committee member and energy practice area co-head Michael Zanic, also in Pittsburgh; and vice chair for practice management Michael Caccese, in Boston.

Others possibly in the running include Craig Budner, a dual management and executive committee member recently named to lead the firm’s global integration and strategic growth efforts, and R. Charles Miller, the well-liked head of the firm’s U.S. offices, but neither “has much of a power base,” says a former member of management.

Part of the challenge in finding a Kalis successor, according to one former partner, is that “the vacuum created by Kalis’s departure is too deep.” There are two [possible paths](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/06/who-will-be-the-next-chair-of-kl-gates/), per Triedman:

The firm “could find someone in Kalis’ mold, or the firm could revert to somebody who is a stable hand whom everybody trusts and who will hopefully steady the ship in terms of defections and the up and down numbers,” said a fourth departed partner, “until they figure out where they’re going. In light of the way things have gone recently, I feel strongly that they’re going to opt for the latter.”

A consensus candidate, say several former partners, would be the firm’s general counsel [James] Segerdahl, an extremely well-liked insurance coverage partner. Segerdahl, who is in his early 50s, has “resolved internal problems to the satisfaction of many, and as the general counsel, he knows the firm’s strengths and weaknesses. And he’s a Pittsburgh guy, which would give many people comfort,” said one, echoed by the others. But he doesn’t have a big book of business, a few noted, and might be best for a single term.

But should lack of a big book really be a problem, especially for a firm as large, diversified, and dispersed as K&L Gates? As managing partner Bruce Stachenfeld [recently wrote in our pages](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/reinventing-the-law-business-succession-planning-my-top-15-recommendations-items-1-7/):

I would avoid picking the biggest rainmaker [to lead the firm after the charismatic head departs] – this is painfully stupid. The rainmaker most likely should be out making rain and not running the firm. Plus, rainmaking skills are not necessarily the skills needed to run a law firm.

But the temptation to make the rainmaker the king (or queen) is hard to resist, because of a simple Biglaw equation that Stachenfeld also notes: “Rain = power.”

P.S. It’s not as problematic to make a rainmaker the head of the firm if you have a relatively small, fairly unified firm that doesn’t require much management. So I wouldn’t worry too much about, say, [Faiza Saeed taking over at Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/cravath-elects-its-next-presiding-partner-ma-star-faiza-saeed/), which has just a few hundred lawyers (not thousands), two offices (New York and a small London outpost), and a flat, democratic partnership structure. The same goes for my former firm, Wachtell Lipton, which is even smaller than Cravath and has just one office. Wachtell has long been run by rainmakers — Marty Lipton and Herb Wachtell in the early days, Ed Herlihy and Dan Neff today — and it has done just fine for itself. But K&L Gates is a different animal, and running such a large and global firm is a full-time job that leaves little to no time for maintaining a practice.

As spring special bonuses roll through Biglaw, associates who work at firms that *haven’t* ponied up the big bucks are in a waiting game. Will their firm flex its financial muscle and show associates some love (read: cash)? Well, folks at D.C.-based Akin Gump just got good news —  the firm announced their bonuses.

Akin is rolling out bonuses that match the prevailing market standard, as set by Davis Polk. It was expected, but still nice to see.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Associates in good standing will be paid bonuses according to the following scale:

May 15 Payment Amount	October 15 Payment Amount	Total Bonus Amount
Class of 2020	$4,500	$7,500	$12,000
Class of 2019	$6,000	$10,000	$16,000
Class of 2018	$12,000	$20,000	$32,000
Class of 2017	$16,500	$27,500	$44,000
Class of 2016	$19,500	$32,500	$52,000

Class of 2014 and senior	$24,000	$40,000	$64,000
And the firm notes, “[a]s we are only a quarter into the year, productivity will not be factored into the May bonus.”

Congrats!

# How To Distinguish Hype Versus Reality Around Artificial Intelligence
## Explore the evolution, mechanics, and practical applications of artificial intelligence with a focus on optimizing legal recruiting through haistack.ai.

With all the hype around artificial intelligence (AI), I’m reminded of a time when I was immersed in selling and building cloud solutions in 2009. A technology that was relatively new, “cloud” became the term du jour, finding its way into every offering and presentation. Does that sound familiar? Upon scrutinizing these presentations, it was apparent that the term “Web 2.0” was simply replaced with “Cloud,” previously the next big thing.

To educate potential customers about the cloud, our team developed a punch list of the five characteristics of cloud computing. This list was derived straight from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and their definition of cloud computing. If an offering answered no to any of the characteristics, it was not cloud computing.

AI, tracing its roots back to the 1950s, presents a broader and more complex scenario than cloud computing. What we can do is attempt to create our own checklist of characteristics of AI, helping to discern whether a product that claims to be AI truly is.

Defining Artificial Intelligence

AI is fundamentally an emulation of human-like intelligence, with the capability to learn, adapt, and autonomously execute tasks within machine constructs. In essence, it weaves together various fields such as computer science, data analytics, and statistics to develop algorithms capable of mimicking human intellect. The ambition of AI is to create machines that can perceptively learn from experiences, adapt to new inputs, and autonomously perform tasks without human interference.

Mechanics of AI: A Glimpse into Machine and Deep Learning

Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, enables computers to refine their operations without explicit programming by learning from data. It uses algorithms to predict future outputs by analyzing historical data, forming a foundation for deep learning (DL).

DL, an intricate branch of ML, leverages artificial neural networks, often modeled to emulate human brain functionalities. These networks contain complex layers of interconnected nodes that meticulously process and transform data. Notably, DL has the ability to autonomously learn and enhance its performance from extensive data inputs, gradually improving its accuracy over time.

Navigating through applications, DL has carved substantial paths in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommendation systems. This technology permeates various industries, steering the evolution of innovations like self-driving cars, speech-to-text transcription, and personalized recommendation engines.

haistack.ai: Pioneering AI in Legal Recruiting

In the legal recruiting realm, haistack.ai emerges as a notable example of AI application. This AI-driven platform integrates publicly accessible data, esteemed industry legal rankings, and accumulated data from years in the lateral recruiting market, seamlessly matching candidates with premier firms.

haistack.ai, fueled by the aforementioned ML and DL techniques, scrutinizes data, identifying and correlating patterns of successful candidate placements to adeptly match candidates with suitable firms, thereby refining the recruitment process.

The merits of utilizing haistack.ai in legal recruiting are multifold:

- Efficiency: The platform rapidly sifts through extensive data to pinpoint ideal candidates, rendering the recruitment process proficient.
- Accuracy: Algorithms correlate patterns in successful candidate placements, ensuring ideal candidates are matched with fitting firms.
- Diversity and Inclusion: Notably, haistack.ai minimizes bias in legal recruiting, promoting diversity and inclusion by selecting candidates based on skills and experience rather than demographic factors.
An AI Checklist for Authenticity

To discern genuine AI applications, a checklist proves useful:

- Data: Utilizes extensive data for training and applies learned insights to analyze live data, identifying correlations, patterns, and predictive analytics.
- Algorithms: Employs algorithms that rely on data training to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions.
- Automation: Operates autonomously, acting based on rules or learned knowledge without human intervention.
- Learning: Modifies results or decisions adaptively in response to changes in underlying data.
If a solution lacks any of these characteristics, it likely falls short of genuine AI.

Artificial intelligence is a rapidly evolving field with transformative potential across various aspects of our lives and industries. Through its deployment of intricate algorithms designed to eschew bias and optimize legal recruiting, haistack.ai exemplifies the future trajectory of AI in legal spheres, driving efficient, accurate, and inclusive recruitment processes.

# Celebrating Women Lawyers During Women's History Month
## Despite all the progress that women lawyers here have made here in the last 140 years or so, we still have a long way to go and much to do.

It’s [Women’s History Month](https://womenshistorymonth.gov/), and I would be remiss if I didn’t say something about it during the month in the context of women lawyers, which, as you know, is a favorite topic of mine.

While I remember all too well how few women lawyers there were when I started out in dinosaur days (Jimmy Carter had just been elected President) and how much better the landscape looks more than 40 years later, women lawyers in this country still have a long way to go to achieve full gender and income parity, and it won’t be in my lifetime.

I am reading First, Evan Thomas’s detailed and admiring biography of Sandra Day O’Connor and remembering how it wasn’t all that long ago (less than 40 years) that President Reagan fulfilled his campaign promise of putting a woman on the Supreme Court. Justice O’Connor was first, but as we all know now, thankfully not last.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Whether you agree or not with Justice O’Connor’s jurisprudence, she has led the way for other women lawyers (Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan) to join the Supreme Court and for that alone, I think that all women lawyers are forever in her debt.

While I like the idea of “first” (as opposed to “none”), I can’t wait (and it’ll probably be after I’m taking a dirt nap) until “first” is no longer a big deal or any deal at all for women lawyers. [Charlotte E. Ray](https://www.history.com/news/charlotte-e-ray-first-black-woman-attorney) was the first African-American woman lawyer in this country, but after a few discouraging years in practice, she turned to teaching instead. Stories like that are less frequent today, but they’re still out there.

I don’t know if Women’s History Month is celebrated in any other country, but I’m fascinated by the stories of women lawyers overseas, who blazed trails in their countries as women lawyers. So, for example, [Cornelia Sorabji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_Sorabji) was the first woman to graduate from Bombay University, the first woman to study law at Oxford, the first female advocate in India, and the first woman to practice both in India and Britain.

Other examples of “first” women lawyers and judges appear in [this article](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2015/03/women-in-history-lawyers-and-judges/) compiled by the Library of Congress. It figuratively spans the globe.  Each vignette is fascinating and worth more than my mention here.

However, as tough and long a road as we still have to go, it’s way tougher for women lawyers in certain countries around the world. For example, in Saudi Arabia, while several thousand women [have law degrees](https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/saudi-arabia-sisters-law), the number of women actually licensed to practice is far, far less.  The article, written three years ago, is a fascinating look at the different world of women lawyers in Saudi Arabia, and the small subset of those who are actually licensed. It’s also a fascinating look at the different cultural issues that women lawyers face there. I don’t know about you, but I would be enormously frustrated if I had the law degree but couldn’t get licensed, probably akin to what people in this country feel after repeated failed attempts to pass whatever state bar they need for licensure here.

Being a human rights lawyer and female in a country that does not value the contributions of women and/or human rights lawyering must be incredibly difficult. Read the story of [Nasrin Sotoudeh](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/world/middleeast/nasrin-sotoudeh-iran-lawyer-lashes.html), a woman and human rights lawyer in Iran. Imagine being sentenced to a total of 38 years in prison and 148 lashes (yes, you read that right) for defending women protesting the country’s mandatory headscarf law. Whatever “benchslap” or sentence a court might hand down here in the States, 148 lashes or even one lash (other than a good tongue lashing) would not be part of the sentencing scheme here.

Amnesty International is [circulating a petition](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/03/iran-shocking-33-year-prison-term-and-148-lashes-for-womens-rights-defender-nasrin-sotoudeh/) protesting Sotoudeh’s sentence. Please sign it. I did. Whatever your personal feelings may be about this NGO, this is a lawyer doing her job and as lawyers we should support her. Shouldn’t we stand up for lawyers doing their jobs in the most difficult of circumstances?  Just imagine if this was any one of us doing what lawyers do and suffering these kinds of consequences for what we are supposed to do. We all say it can’t happen here, but one never knows and I hope we never learn.

Whatever problems we women lawyers have in this country, and I am certainly not diminishing them, they pale beside Sotoudeh’s sentence, who is being punished for her advocacy.

Women’s History Month reminds us that despite all the progress that women lawyers here have made here in the last 140 years or so, we still have a long way to go and much to do. 2020 marks 100 years since women won the right to vote, really not all that long ago. It took more than 60 years after that before Justice O’Connor became one of The Nine on the Supreme Court.

There still aren’t enough [women equity partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-biglaw-firms-with-the-most-female-equity-partners/) in Biglaw. Women lawyers compose 31 percent of general counsel, but they’re paid [almost 40 percent (not a typo) less](https://blog.lawgeex.com/8-stats-you-need-to-know-about-the-male-female-general-counsel-divide/) than their male counterparts. I found this report infuriating. When do income and gender parity become realities and not just aspirations? Your guess is as good as mine. Just because Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire’s dance partner (and yes, I know I’m dating myself), could dance backwards in high heels doesn’t mean that we should.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# The Mishandling Of Classified Documents
## Disclosure would go a long way toward solving the question of who, if anyone, should be prosecuted for the improper handling of classified material.

Here’s today’s question: Could it harm national security for a high-ranking government official to cart around top-secret documents for a few years, stuff those documents into a cardboard box, and then pack that box in his garage or in a storage room in his country club?

I guess I have a follow-up question: If that could hurt national security, then shouldn’t the CIA (or the Department of Defense, or whoever) know that the top-secret documents are missing?

If misuse of highly classified documents could harm national security, then we should be outraged: We should promptly investigate (1) why high-ranking officials are able to walk off with classified documents in the first place and (2) why the relevant agency, presumably keeping close tabs on its classified information, had no clue that the documents were missing for years.

This strikes me as a Code 3 situation: Sirens should be sounding and lights flashing! The list with the names of all of our spies in Iran has been missing for several years! Anyone care to look around for it?

Doesn’t this wreak of a systemic failure in both the White House and a government agency? Shouldn’t a responsible person investigate? Why is no one demanding an investigation — of both the White House and the agencies — and why is everyone simply blaming the political party they don’t like?

This seems wrong.

Say, I have an idea!

Back in fourth grade, our librarian — I think it was Miss Fitzgerald — was pretty good at tracking overdue books. She’d charge you a nickel a day for any book kept out past its due date.

Let’s drag Miss Fitzgerald out of retirement and ask her to keep track of classified government documents. It’s a nickel a day for every day that the documents are past due.

My proposal has two benefits: First, Miss Fitzgerald would plainly do a better job than the CIA at tracking overdue documents. Miss Fitzgerald knew almost all the time when a book was past due, and she’d come after you pretty hard. (And this was in the days before computers. Just think what she could do today!) Second, my proposal would go a fair way toward solving the current problem with the debt limit. At a nickel a day, those overdue charges rack up: It’s something like $18 per year! Trump has lots of documents, and Biden has held his documents for more than six years now. And we know that lots of people besides the president walk away with classified documents. CIA Director [David Petraeus](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/6753557930426840210#) and national security aide [Sandy Berger](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/6753557930426840210#) both pleaded guilty to taking classified documents.

Nobody really seems to care about the substance of these documents; we’d have been better off with a nickel a day.

Not only that: If Trump, and Biden, and Petraeus, and Berger are walking around with classified documents, think how many other people must have boxes filled with these documents lying around in their basements. We could pay some teenager minimum wage to root around through the basements of people with security clearance and net a fortune on the investment!

I suspect I know why nobody really cares about the substance of these documents: The government surely stamps virtually every document as “super secret; eyes only,” because that’s the natural thing to do. In government-speak, that’s the “[overclassification](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/6753557930426840210#)” of documents. But you and I have seen the process in action when low-level lawyers are tasked with marking corporate documents produced in litigation as “confidential” and thus “for use only in litigation.”

The young associate sees some document. It’s the take-out menu for Woolfie’s Delicatessen. There are a couple of handwritten words scribbled near the bottom of the menu. The associate can’t quite make out the words. “The words might be important, and I’ll get killed if some important document is made public. I guess I’ll stamp the menu ‘confidential’; we’ll withdraw the designation if the other side challenges it and somebody can read the writing.”

Next document.

So, too, I assume, in the government. The take-out menu for Woolfie’s is lying around somewhere in the CIA. It has a few words scribbled at the bottom. They appear to say, “2 roast beef with mustard,” but you can’t be absolutely sure. The document gets stamped “top secret.”

The document might contain information important to national security. If it does, there’d be hell to pay if it wasn’t marked “top secret.” And there’s basically no punishment for improperly classifying a document. In all likelihood, no one will ever notice the error. If they do, they’ll tell you that the document shouldn’t be deemed classified, and it’ll get changed. No harm; no foul.

One way to resolve the issues with Biden and Trump would simply be to declassify every document in dispute. After all, the documents have been lying around for years, and no one cared about the documents or missed them. So declassify ’em.  After all this time, let’s see what a tuna on whole wheat (with tomatoes) cost at that deli on 17th Street back in 2015.

What if I’ve inadvertently disclosed the nuclear codes? Biden didn’t care; Trump didn’t care; why should I care any more than our presidents do?

Besides, disclosure would go a long way toward solving the question of who, if anyone, should be prosecuted for the improper handling of classified material. I, at least, wouldn’t send Trump to jail for having the Woolfie’s menu at Mar-a-Lago; maybe Woolfie’s has a branch in Palm Beach.

There are always more stories to tell about the annual ILTACON show after it ends.  Join us at 1 p.m. Eastern on Sept. 7 for this live webinar presented with our friends at DISCO, where you’ll hear from an expert panel that was in the thick of ILTACON 2022.

While this year’s  conference was focused on innovation in the legal industry, much of the discourse among the attendees concerned the various “disconnects” haunting the legal tech landscape.
Whether it’s gaps in understanding between generations of lawyers, or lack of a shared language between vendors and their customers, our expert panel will analyze the myriad challenges in bridging law’s fundamental technology divide.  Among the specific issues to be explored include:

- Generational differences
- Firms vs. Legal Departments
- IT departments  vs. Lawyers
We’ll also recap this year’s key takeaways and answer your questions about what the latest in legal tech could mean for your firm. Register today!

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# Survey Shows There's A Gender Divide Regarding The Return To In-Office Work
## It's clear that something needs to change, both at a societal level and within law firms.

As vaccine rates increase and businesses start to open up, one question on many people’s minds is what “back to work” will look like. While many employees are on the fence about the when and how of the return to work, some employers have already made the call, including some law firms. According to recent reports, some large law firms have [already announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/latham-reopening/) their [plans](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/) for the return to in-office work, while others are [planning to allow](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/biglaw-firms-are-hiring-remote-associates-in-this-post-pandemic-world/) select attorneys to work remotely.

Of course, it remains to be seen whether requiring the return to full-time in-office work is the right choice. In fact, the results of a recent survey show that not all lawyers are on board with this idea. The survey results show a stark divide when it comes to the return to the office and that many attorneys prefer a hybrid option — something law firm leaders should consider before making final decisions.

The survey in question, “[Lawyers Perspectives on Returning to the Office](https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/209075/MLA_LawyersPerspectivesReturnToOffice_051021.pdf),” was conducted by Law360 Pulse and Major, Lindsey & Africa. More than 2,500 attorneys responded to it and the results provide lots of insight into how different segments of the legal professional population view the return to in-office work.

The results of the survey indicate that the opinions of attorneys about the return to in-office work vary greatly, with a clear generational and gender divide. Earlier this week I discussed the [results regarding the age and generational divide](https://www.mycase.com/blog/back-to-the-office-what-law-firm-leaders-need-to-know/), and today I’m going to address the findings as they relate to gender.

But first, let’s take a look at overall perspectives on the return to work. According to the results, only 21% of the attorneys surveyed would like to return to the office “as soon as possible.” Half, 50%, shared that they were most comfortable returning only after getting fully vaccinated. Another 20% preferred to return once the government declared herd immunity, while 16% wanted to do so once their employer required it. Lastly, 4% had no plans to return to the office.

Similarly, not all survey respondents were excited about the return to in-office work. According to the survey results, only 23% of attorneys were “very eager” to return to work once their preferred conditions were met. Additionally, 16% were “eager,” 24% fell squarely in the middle, 16% were “less eager,” and 21% were “not eager at all.”

The results of the survey showed that most respondents preferred to return to work on a hybrid schedule that included in-office days and remote working days. According to the report:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Only 21% of respondents saw themselves returning every day, while the largest group (45%) would prefer to settle into a “few times per week” routine. Fifteen percent (15%) were more conservative, seeking to return either a few times a month or less.

That being said, there was a large disparity in the results once they were broken down by gender. As explained in the report, women were less eager to return to in-office work and more cautious about the circumstances in which they returned:

Twenty percent (20%) more men than women were “eager” or “very eager” to return to the office. Women who responded to the survey were 10% more likely than their male counterparts to wait for herd immunity before returning.

Men and women attorneys were mostly in agreement regarding one issue: that vaccination should be the bar for the return to work, with 49% of men and 51% of women respondents choosing that option. In comparison, nearly twice as many men (26%) wanted to get back to work “as soon as possible” while only 15% of women were in that camp. Lastly, 26% of women preferred herd immunity as the bar for the return to the office, while 16% of men chose this option.

Women attorneys also shared that they were less likely to want to return to the office five days per week compared to male respondents. In fact, men were twice as likely (27%) to prefer the return to the office every day compared to only 13% of the women attorneys surveyed.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Notably, no matter how you sliced or diced it, women attorneys reported that they were simply less eager to return to the office overall compared to men. Specifically, 29% of men and 15% of women were “very eager” to return to the office. Almost half, 47%, of men were “eager” to return to the office compared to 28% of women. And 26% of women and 16% of men were “not eager at all.”

The report suggested a number of different proposed reasons for the disparity, including the increased burden of childcare responsibilities and the desire for work-life balance. Regardless of the reason, it’s clear that something needs to change, both at a societal level and within law firms.

Legal talent is at a premium, and in order to retain attorneys and ensure continued success in the months following the pandemic, it’s important for law firm leaders to fully understand and address the valid concerns and preferences of their firm’s attorneys. The failure to do so could result in the very real risk of experiencing the migration of foundational talent from law firms, an event that could very well have a detrimental impact on the long-term recovery from the effects of the pandemic.

Good news, the recent bonus bonanza spreading.

Cooley got the [COVID appreciation bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) ball rolling (even if they were later overshadowed by[ Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) and [others](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/) with a more[ generous scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/another-elite-firm-affirms-their-commitment-to-the-top-of-the-bonus-scale/)). And their appreciation isn’t limited to just associates. They are sharing the love with staff as well. The firm has announced that at the end of the month, the firm will be distribute an appreciation bonus to all professional staff.

Nicely done! And during a time when staff positions have been particularly hard hit by[ layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) (even elite firms like [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/skadden-announces-layoffs-across-u-s-offices/) and [Cleary](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/layoffs-come-to-cleary-gottlieb/) have laid folks off), it’s great to see some Biglaw staffers rewarded for the hard work they do to keep Biglaw running.

“I don’t think… I mean… I’m not someone it would be fair to call a gunner… do you think?” My client asked, a quiver of trepidation in her voice.

“Of course not,” her therapist reassured her. Because that’s what I’m paid for.

No, that’s not why I reassured her. I did so because my client is a nice person and gunners are loathsome pariahs, denizens of the fens and low places, nothing like her at all. There might not be much that everyone in this country agrees on at the moment but we all (especially lawyers) know one truth to be self-evident, which is that everyone hates gunners and no one wants to be one.

So it’s worth posing another salient query: What is a gunner?

Part of the answer, at a law firm, is obvious — a gunner is someone who wants to make partner. That’s the whole point of “gunning” at a law firm. If you are already a partner, you’re busy doing your partner thing. But if you’re an associate, the goal is to make partner. That’s what a gunner is gunning for.

The term “gunning” further suggests, however, that you’re pointing your gun at someone else (or several someone elses) and (as is normally the case when one points a gun at someone) therefore mean them no good.

And that’s another part of the answer — and what we all hate about “gunners” — not merely that they’re gunning for (i.e., want to make) partner (we all want to make partner (mmmm…money good!) It’s that, on the way to that goal of making partner, they’re gunning (i.e., want to eradicate) you (or anyone else standing in their way.)

That definition sounds straightforward — and loathsome — enough. But how does one actually know for a fact that someone’s a gunner, that he would nonchalantly pop some caps into a colleague’s back, then prance jauntily over said individual’s bleeding corpse in pursuit of partner-hood…as opposed to simply a hard-working, ambitious, talented lawyer on his way to success in his chosen field? Sometimes the distinction is not as obvious as it sounds.

In my client’s case, for instance, she stood accused of gunner-hood, but felt the charge was unjust. Even if I weren’t on her payroll, I’d be inclined to argue she has a point. Judge for yourself:

Turns out, Biglaw knows how to throw a party. Last night, White & Case threw an epic shindig at none other than the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They transformed the iconic Temple of Dendur into a tremendous party space to celebrate their sponsorship of a new exhibit at the museum, Thomas Cole’s Journey: Atlantic Crossings.

The exhibit, on display until May 13, 2018, celebrates the work of Thomas Cole. Cole was a nineteenth century landscape artist known as the founder of the Hudson River School, an artistic movement known for romantic depictions of the wilderness. As [Jack Pace](https://www.whitecase.com/people/jack-pace), executive partner of the New York office, notes, Cole’s work has a lot in common with the firm:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“We sponsored the exhibit for a couple of reasons. First, we are not only part of the New York legal community, but also of its larger cultural and business community. Supporting an institution like the Met is important to us as citizens of the city. Second, the Thomas Cole exhibit speaks to what our firm is about. Cole was an artist who spent a large part of his career traveling between New York and London, the cities in which our two largest offices are located. Our lawyers work very closely with each other on both sides the Atlantic, as well as throughout our global network. The transatlantic nature of Cole’s career mirrors our own history as a firm; we’ve been in New York for more than a century and London for nearly 47 years, so it was a very appropriate exhibit to support.”

But enough about all that, let’s take at look at the party pics:

Well, [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cooley-llp/) gets it. Across all 10 of its U.S. offices, the firm has raised the base salary to the new “normal” — the Cravath scale. Some firms may try to resist moving over to the $180K scale, but all that really proves is they aren’t at the top of the game.

Cooley knows that, and in the email to associates laying out the new compensation scale they note, “success in our profession is wholly dependent upon attracting and retaining the best and brightest attorneys. Indeed, Cooley’s ascension into the ranks of the elite global law firms is a manifestation of our success in building a team of associates and special counsel of the truly highest caliber — a team that shares our vision and values and validates our core competencies day in and day out.” A little more flowery than other memos we’ve seen, but it sure makes the hardworking associates feel good.

Indeed, the reaction has been positively gleeful from the Cooley associates we’ve heard from:

— Can’t believe we are doing this the same day as Kirkland and Skadden.

— Impressed that they matched this early — was expecting early next year. Looks like they are really trying to keep up with the market leaders. Very pleased.

— I’m pleasantly surprised that Cooley matched very early.

— Partying in the hallways has commenced.

— Woohoo!

And summer associates are getting their share of the love — in a separate email, they were informed they’d get a raise to $3,500 a week starting July 1.

Cooley’s Chief Executive Officer, [Joe Conroy](https://www.cooley.com/jconroy), also provided comment:

# Biglaw Firm's Embarrassingly Sexist Blunder
## Guess what? Cooking isn't just for women!

I am all for opportunities at law firms for coworkers to bond and make connections over something besides their work. It’s these small, human interactions that can really make the daily slog of law firm life bearable. But for goodness’ sake, when firm leadership tries to facilitate these connections, try not to fall into sexist (or racist or heteronormative or whatever) stereotypes.

Take, for example, this email that was circulated in the Columbus office of Taft Stettinius & Hollister — but only to the women. In the email, partner Jessica Manger — who, in a head-smacking turn is also on [the firm’s gender advancement committee](https://www.taftlaw.com/about/diversity-and-inclusion?tab=gender-advancement-committee) — asks the “women of Taft-Columbus” to contribute three recipes each for a firm cookbook, which is described as a “very old tradition” of the firm.

Oof. Everything underpinning this email is old fashioned and built on the notion that women are primarily responsible for cooking. So, let’s break it down — food preparation is not gendered. Men at the firm probably have recipes they could contribute, and some women have no desire to cook and have no recipes to share. It’s really just a retrograde set of assumptions that go into that ask, and it makes you wonder what other stereotypes the powers that be at the firm buy into. As one tipster noted:

What’s next? A swimsuit calendar featuring all the women of Taft, who are required to pose in bikinis?

The good news is the sources at the firm say the idea was quickly shot down by the rest of the women in the Columbus office for reifying these implicit biases. But hopefully this faux pas will be a lesson to Taft — and other firms out there — not to make these sort of unforced errors. Taft has some great policies aimed at gender equality, [particularly for parental leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/paternity-leave-bias-in-biglaw-when-will-it-end/), but this is a bad look for any firm.

You can read the full email below. *Of note, Chester Wilcox and Saxbe is a firm that merged with Taft and comprises a part of the Columbus office.*

We reached out to Taft for comment, and were provided with recent highlights regarding gender advancement and diversity and inclusion initiatives at the firm:

Implicit Bias

To support an environment where diversity and inclusion remain part of the Taft blueprint, we introduced a firm-wide implicit bias training program personally led by nationally-recognized trainer and author Dr. Arin Reeves. The on-site presentations across our offices conducted by Dr. Reeves and her team heightened awareness and instilled ongoing dialogue that have had lasting positive results, helping to interrupt the biases inherent in all of us. Attorneys engaged in an interactive process and openly and authentically discussed issues ranging from gender equality and racial and cultural stereotypes to cultural integration and transformational leadership.  We remain committed to continuing and reinforcing our implicit bias training efforts so that we form more inclusive work teams where each Taft team member is positioned to excel.

Taft Leadership

Taft continues to increase the number of women attorneys on Taft’s firm-wide management committees. As of 2019, women make up 37% of Taft’s practice group chairs or co-chairs, 50% of Taft’s executive committee and 45% of Taft’s compensation committee. In 2018, Taft was ranked nationally among the top 10 law firms in the “Inclusion Blueprint” survey, which assessed workplace policies to advance women into leadership positions. The survey was conducted by Diversity Lab, an incubator for diversity and inclusion in the law, and ChIPs, a nonprofit organization focused on advancing and connecting women in technology, law and policy.

One-Class Partnership

At the beginning of 2018, Taft adopted a one-class partnership structure, eliminating the two-tier system (equity and non-equity) that had been in place for more than 25 years. This has opened the door to leadership opportunities for women, attorneys of color, and younger attorneys. It has led to greater transparency and more inclusion. From 2017 to 2019, the percentage of female equity partners at Taft nearly doubled and increased from 12% in 2017 to 20% in 2018 and 23% in 2019. The one-class structure gives all partners a ‘meaningful seat at the table’ with full eligibility for any leadership positions in the firm. Overall, this encourages, energizes and empowers all of our partners, including all of our new or younger partners, to make a positive impact on the future success of Taft.
Thought Leadership

To ensure a cohesive approach and to keep the momentum strong, Taft’s Gender Advancement Committee hosts a Women’s Symposium for its attorneys each year and features national leaders Debra Esptein Henry, Esq. and Patricia K. Gillette. It provides an opportunity to review national benchmarks; redefine and redesign what makes a law firm great for women; and undertake best practices to attract, retain and advance women at Taft. A highlight of the symposium is recognizing Taft’s trailblazers with the Shattered Glass Award. Recipients have made specific strides toward making Taft more inclusive and have actively pushed Taft to elevate the respect, involvement and leadership opportunities for women attorneys.

Family-Centered Benefits

Taft recently [announced](http://www.taftlaw.com/news/story/2338-taft-announces-industry-leading-policy-for-attorney-parental-leave) a new industry leading parental leave policy for its attorneys. The new policy provides all Taft attorneys with 16 weeks of paid parental leave for birth or adoptive parents. The policy applies regardless of gender, marital status or primary versus non-primary caregiver status.

Last August, Taft adopted two additional family-centered paid benefits: Care@Work, a backup emergency child and adult care service, and Milk Stork, a breast milk storage and overnight shipping and delivery program. The introduction of these family-centered paid benefits supports an overall productive work-life balance and helps eliminate the stress of travel for new mothers.

By introducing these new family-centered services as paid benefits, Taft demonstrates its commitment to maintaining a productive work-life balance.

Gender Advancement Committee

Taft’s Gender Advancement Committee, led by me and Partner Tracy Betz, was created to continue the development, retention and promotion of women attorneys within Taft, the legal profession and the community. The Gender Advancement Committee and Taft attorneys host conferences and workshops and participate as speakers at industry events, putting our women’s initiatives at the forefront of our efforts and creating a lasting impact on the culture of our firm.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 10.09.19
## * According to an eight-page letter from White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, the White House will not cooperate in the impeachment inquiry because not only does it violate “the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent,” but it also “lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation"" and is merely an effort to ""nullify the outcome of the democratic process"" by negating the 2016 election and influencing the 2020 election. Well then!

[[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/10/08/big-law-supporters-form-new-group-backing-kamala-harris/)] * An investigation is currently underway at Yale Law School, where late this past weekend, anti-Semitic graffiti -- a swastika with the word “Trump” next to it -- was found on the steps to a side entrance to the school.
