In 2016[ Blank Rome merged with Dickstein Shapiro](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/has-dickstein-shapiro-found-a-new-rescuer/) — or at least that’s what folks colloquially called it. As it turns out it was fashioned as an asset sale and that sticking point is the basis of a new lawsuit.

Sixteen former Dickstein partners are suing Blank Rome alleging the structuring of the deal was designed to avoid payment of certain liabilities — namely the firm’s obligation to pay them more than $4 million in capital accounts. As the complaint notes:

Blank Rome’s transactional attorneys tried to ‘play cute’ by structuring the merger of Dickstein Shapiro into its law firm by the artifice of labeling it as an ‘asset sale’ for the solitary purpose of defrauding former Dickstein Shapiro partners (who were necessarily not going to be a part of Blank Rome).

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/09/12/read-the-complaint-former-dickstein-shapiro-partners-sue-blank-rome/) Law.com, the lawsuit goes on to note that there are other factors involved in the Blank Rome acquisition, notably the assumption of Dickstein’s lease and absorbing the majority of that firm’s clients. Plaintiffs are seeking a declaratory ruling that the deal was, in fact, a merger thus making Blank Rome liable for the payment of the partners’ capital accounts:

The suit claims that the Blank Rome deal to acquire 100-plus Dickstein Shapiro lawyers had the “hallmarks of a de facto merger.” In particular, the complaint points to the fact that Blank Rome assumed the lease on Dickstein Shapiro’s Washington, D.C. headquarters, virtually all of the dissolving firms business and clients went to Blank Rome, and various office and practice heads remained the same during the transition.

The partners are represented by [Brian Kabateck](http://www.kbklawyers.com/team/brian-s-kabateck/), who noted this type of case is outside of his usual practice:

“My world doesn’t usually intersect with the big firms except when I’m on the other side of a lawsuit suing their clients,” said Kabateck, noting that he wasn’t sure if other recent law firm dissolutions had been structured similarly. Kabateck said that the $4 million figure cited in the complaint is just for the 16 former partners named in the lawsuit, and that he knows of others who are owed capital. The lawsuit could be amended, he added, to include additional former partners and claims.

I know this sounds insecure, but I hear often that you are a tough place to work, and it’s not worth it. That conversation happens often. And that’s how I know that this reputational thing is a problem.

We’re like college sports: The players pick us. And the misconception of who we are is not helpful to our institution.

— [Jon Ballis](https://www.kirkland.com/lawyers/b/ballis-jon-a-pc), chairman of Kirkland & Ellis, commenting on his firm’s reputational problems within the Biglaw enclave, in a series of interviews with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/the-worlds-largest-law-firm-thinks-youve-got-it-all-wrong). Ballis wants to change the narrative and let would-be Kirkland associates know that the firm is simply misunderstood. “We have a system that demands a lot from people, gives them a lot of responsibility, and requires people to work together,” he said. “And if you don’t want to work together, we’re not your kind of firm.”

# Law Firm Consolidation — Perpetually Out Of Reach?

The coming wave of consolidation among law firms is a perpetual topic of discussion and speculation. The basic narrative is that the [richest, most successful firms](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/20/the-super-conflicted-rich-for-the-industrys-elite-a-wildly-successful-year-came-at-a-cost/) are pulling away from the rest of the industry, and firms below the top tier will be forced to merge in order to grow and remain competitive.

The notion that consolidation could be the panacea for challenges facing less profitable firms has always been questionable. But whether you buy into that particular narrative or not, it is incontrovertible that the legal industry remains remarkably fragmented in comparison to other professional services sectors.

So what are the barriers to a wave of mergers? And if the barriers were removed, would significant consolidation actually happen?

Big 4, Little 200?

Let’s consider the Big 4 accounting firms as an example of a relatively consolidated sector of professional services. In 2020, the Big 4 (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) generated combined revenue of [$157 billion](https://www.goingconcern.com/number-of-the-day-157-billion/).

As recently as 1989, there were eight major U.S. accounting firms (then called the “Big 8”). Mergers in that year created Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche, reducing the group to the Big 6. In 1998, an additional merger formed PricewaterhouseCoopers, thereby transforming the Big 6 into the Big 5. Consolidation into the Big 4 occurred not through merger, but through the insolvency of Arthur Andersen in the wake of the 2001 Enron Scandal.

No parallel wave of consolidation has occurred at the top of the legal industry. In 2020, the four largest law firms by gross revenue (Kirkland, Latham, DLA Piper, Baker McKenzie) brought in less than a tenth as much as the Big 4: [$15 billion](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/20/the-2021-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/). The entire Am Law 200 achieved gross revenue of around $125 billion.

A Client’s Right to Choose is Paramount

How can it be that the legal industry remains so fragmented in relation to peers in fields like accounting and management consulting? Ethics rules are a big part of the story.

In many industries, the product is tied tightly to the company that produces it. Individual executives come and go, but contracts between the firm and its customers remain relatively stable.

Not so in legal services. When clients engage a law firm, they engage not just the firm as an entity but the individual lawyers leading the matter. If the lead lawyer on a case decides the grass is greener at a new firm, there is little the old firm can do to prevent the client from following the lawyer. And indeed, lawyers are very mobile. Over the past 12 months alone, Am Law 200 law firms have made 7,385 lateral hires: 4,635 associates, 1,685 partners, and 1,065 counsel. Almost all of these lateral moves involved a departure from another Am Law 200 firm. A carousel of attorneys move from Am Law firm to Am Law firm, churning winners and losers on a quarterly basis. To take one example, Reed Smith saw 159 attorneys lateral out of the firm while 55 laterals joined. A net loss of laterals could be good or bad, depending on the respective profit margins of those coming and going, and the corresponding effect on overall firm profitability. Reed Smith’s profit margin is around 30%, so if the firm is losing partners with 20% profit margins and hiring replacements with 40% profit margins on their practices, then we should see the firm’s profits per partner move in a positive direction in the coming years.

The bottom line is that law firms contemplating a merger can’t be confident the new entity’s revenue will match or exceed the sum of the two firms’ most recent revenue figures. When the merger is announced, some partners will surely decide to leave, taking clients with them. If the departing lawyers happen to be rainmakers, the strength of the combined entity may be considerably less than a simple A + B calculation would suggest.

Conflicts Matter

Even if partner departures were not a concern, potential law firm mergers can also be disrupted by client conflicts. For some comparative perspective on conflicts, consider the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. McKinsey, as a firm, routinely serves competing clients in the same industry. It navigates conflicts by ensuring that individual consultants do not serve competitors and by safeguarding confidential information internally, such that McKinsey teams serving competitors do not share with each other the details of their work. In this way, the firm manages to sell its services to multiple competitors in a given sector.

Legal ethics constraints make it impossible to apply the McKinsey model in a law firm context. For conflicts purposes, a client of an individual lawyer is a client of every lawyer in the firm, albeit there are ways to wall off attorneys and use client waivers to navigate conflicts. Imagine if Quinn Emanuel sought to merge with a comparably profitable firm. Quinn’s profits per equity partner in 2020 were just shy of $4.7 million. On a PEP basis, the most compatible merger partners would be Cravath or Cahill. But either of those combinations would be a nonstarter from a conflicts perspective. Quinn is well known for its [strategic decision](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/inside-quinn-emanuels-bet-to-sue-wall-street-1-2) to represent plaintiffs against banks; Cravath and Cahill represent many of the financial institutions that Quinn has sued. Quinn may be a particularly extreme example, but conflicts among firms abound. Some firms represent insurance carriers; others represent policy holders. Even representing superficially similar companies brings the potential for conflict: think of the high profile litigation between Apple and Samsung.

Is Consolidation Desirable?

Let’s imagine that these ethical barriers were suddenly removed, making consolidation more viable. What would happen?

The basic logic undergirding consolidation in any industry is economies of scale: if two companies can operate more efficiently as a combined entity, a merger will create value. Does law practice exhibit economies of scale? Hugh A. Simons and Nicholas Bruch believe [it does not](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/22/debunking-the-consolidation-myth/):

Markets, where rivals focus on specific segments or seek to compete through differentiation rather than on cost, tend to remain fragmented. Haute couture is an example of such a market. Law is less like commodity chemicals and more like haute couture. It’s an amalgam of distinct services offered by very different providers in settings that have widely varying balances of power between buyers and sellers. Law exhibits no economies of scale. The notion that law must consolidate is simplistic and misleading.

Others commentators take a different view, arguing that law practice is suboptimally fragmented, and that the industry’s fragmentation prevents it from matching the innovation seen in other sectors. As Dan Packel [recently put it](https://www.law.com/2021/04/23/a-different-take-on-the-am-law-100/):

That fragmentation matters when we get to the question of why law firms are behind the curve on innovation. No one has market share anywhere comparable to the Big Four accounting firms, who collectively audit more than 80% of U.S. publicly traded companies. And it’s no coincidence that these businesses are far ahead of law firms when it comes to improvements in process management. Their revenues give them the capacities to invest, and the lack of fragmentation makes it easier to discern what works and what doesn’t.

Even if Simons and Bruch are right that firms have traditionally chosen to compete on differentiation, and not on cost, that doesn’t mean there are no economies of scale to be found. The most obvious low-hanging fruit is in support functions and real estate. That suggests the most plausible form of consolidation in the legal sector might be an intermediate one: roll-ups. In this model, law firms would maintain their distinct brands but combine their back office operations and share a common real estate footprint. In a rolled-up legal world, firms would still be a long way from the degree of consolidation in other professional services sectors, but it would be a start.

Let’s end by putting aside the inevitable conflicts and other obstacles and imagining a hyper-consolidated legal market with a closer resemblance to accounting’s Big 4. In this world, the current Am Law 100 would have merged into four megafirms based on broadly similar profits per equity partner. What would the combinations look like?

The most elite of the legal Big 4 would have been formed through a merger of firms with 2020 PEP of more than $5 million. It would have just six legacy members: Wachtell, Davis Polk, Kirkland, Paul Weiss, Simpson Thatcher, and Sullivan & Cromwell.

The second Big 4 legal megafirm would range from Quinn Emanuel ($4.7 million) to Dechert ($2.8 million). It would have resulted from the consolidation of 27 firms.

The third megafirm would have 31 legacy members, ranging from Cadwalader ($2.6 million) to Reed Smith ($1.5 million).

The remaining 36 Am Law 100 firms would comprise the fourth and final Big 4 legal megafirm. Their 2020 PEP ranges from Perkins Coie on the high end ($1.4 million) to Littler on the low end ($570k).

Will this happen anytime soon? Definitely not. But it’s a fun thought exercise.

# Top 25 Law Firm Conducts Stealth Layoffs
## Exact number of associates let go remains unclear.

We[ knew this was going to start happening](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-dreaded-stealth-layoff-rears-its-ugly-head/). Stealth layoffs are a Biglaw specialty and the economic upheaval surrounding COVID-19 is ripe for them. Above the Law is hearing from multiple insiders at the firm that over the last month or so, Goodwin Procter has been letting associates go. They’ve already [laid off staff members](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/even-a-billion-dollars-in-revenue-cant-stop-covid-19-layoffs/), and now it seems it’s cutting some associates from its payroll. As a reminder, the firm made over a billion dollars in gross revenue last year — $1,330,176,000 to be precise — making it 22nd on the most [recent Am Law 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#).

Particularly prevalent during economic downturns, stealth layoffs allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that there were economic-based layoffs. Rather than signal some perceived weakness, a firm tries to cut overhead without making a splash. So, they’ll give the associates X number of months/weeks to find a new job and the firm may even couch the reductions in performance review terms, making those let go doubt their lawyering skills.

Here is what we are hearing is happening at the firm. First it starts in dribbles. (Potentially identifying information of those laid off has been edited from tipster accounts.)

I heard Goodwin is emptying certain practice groups.

Have heard that Goodwin is making stealth associates layoffs.

Which, is not enough to base a story on, but it is enough to start poking around. And, the tips just continued to pour in.

Hi, this is a tip on stealth lay offs done by Goodwin Procter. We know of at least 12 associates that were laid off.

I was a Goodwin associate and can confirm that Goodwin has been conducting stealth layoffs.

Just wanted to give a tip that Goodwin recently laid off a handful of associates, but did not provide much detail regarding the layoffs, including how many associates were let go (I’m hearing at least 10-20….). The New York office had a firm-wide call where the firm…. communicated that some associates had been “counseled out” last week due to the anticipated reduction in revenue for the firm. Those let go 12 weeks severance and healthcare benefits through September. For the time being, firm leadership on the call communicated that those who had been let go have been let go, and there are no further plans to let associates go or cut salaries.

Tip: Goodwin is conducting stealth layoffs for economic reasons. They are trying to keep it under wraps by having affected associates sign confidentiality agreements. They should be listed as a firm implementing layoffs.

And then yesterday this account was [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/gjteh3/goodwin_procter_is_conducting_stealth_layoffs/):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Before the firm decided to stealth me, I received consistently positive performance evaluations and was given positive informal feedback. My hours were always a healthy margin above the billable hours target and were consistent with that of my colleagues. One day, very suddenly, I was told that I had performance issues and had three months to leave. The conversation made no sense to me, and I spent a lot of time and energy trying to figure out what I had done wrong – thinking I had inadvertently offended someone or made a giant mistake – until a coworker confided in me that the same thing happened to them. Through the grapevine I was able to figure out that this is happening throughout the firm, and it wasn’t just me.

And oof, that is basically a textbook account of stealth layoffs. [I have nothing but the deepest sympathy for anyone that finds themselves going through it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/what-the-2009-legal-layoffs-were-really-like/). And let me reassure you — it isn’t you.

When reached for comment a spokesperson for the firm said:

In early April, we completed our annual mid-year review cycle for our non-partner lawyers (Goodwin operates on a September fiscal year-end.) As a matter of policy, we do not comment on our performance management process.

Which is, again, textbook.

We couldn’t report on the nitty gritty of what is going on in Biglaw firms like Goodwin without the outstanding ATL tipster network. So thank you for helping this come to light.

# Where Are The Bonuses? These Am Law 50 Firms Haven't Matched Cravath Yet

It’s almost the end of the second week of bonus season, and bonus news seems to be significantly slowing down. Dozens upon dozens of firms have remained completely silent. Why? The market (i.e., Cravath and all of the firms that have matched) has spoken. There aren’t any decisions left to be made — except, of course, whether or not your firm is planning to stiff associates.

Which firms in the Am Law 50 haven’t uttered a word to their associates about bonuses yet? Here’s a list of the firms that have yet to match. Do with it what you will.

John Rowley (left) and Andrew Miller (by Fox5)

On Monday, we [put out a call](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/who-is-the-mystery-law-student-who-came-to-the-rescue-of-a-biglaw-partner/?rf=1) to try and find the law student who came to the aid of [John Rowley](http://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/r/rowley-iii-john-p/), a 62-year-old Baker McKenzie partner who was being assaulted by a group of teens in a D.C. Metro station. That student, a 23-year-old GW Law student named Andrew Miller, has now been found, as reported by [Fox5](http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/255362598-story):

“The word hero is thrown around casually – sports heroes, all sorts of heroes,” said Rowley [upon meeting Miller]. “This guy is a hero.”

“They stepped over him, came at me,” Miller described. “They threw one punch, which I was able to block kind of instinctively, but it landed a little bit. They swung again the second time. That one hit me. That one hit me down and I think that was the end of it.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Miller sacrificed to save Rowley, suffering a concussion. Rowley still has facial swelling and bruising (which you can see in this [Fox5 video](http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/255362598-story)), and he will need surgery so doctors can insert pints to heal the broken bones in his hand that hit a moving train. Two juveniles have been [arrested](http://www.fox5dc.com/news/254679389-story) in connection with the assault.

It’s not clear how Rowley knew his rescuer was a law student or how Miller learned about Rowley’s search for him. But we do know this much:

“There is a silver lining here,” said Rowley. “It’s that I have an opportunity to meet and get to know this young man because he really is a cut above. I haven’t had too much time to work on him yet, but I am a former federal prosecutor and I am trying to nudge him in that direction.”

“This incident kind of resolidifies my desire to make sure that whatever career that I go into, I am actually making a difference,” said Miller.

Andrew Miller, you already have. We can all enjoy a [good lawyer joke](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/old-lady-lawyer-lawyer-jokes-are-exactly-that-jokes/) every now and then, but it’s nice to know that they’re just jokes — and the many ways that lawyers help society are [no laughing matter](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/the-day-the-lawyer-jokes-died/).

‘Where’s my money?’

With some firms seeing expenses driven by compensation increases rising faster than revenues as a percentage, obviously that’s not a sustainable trajectory. It causes problems economically … and also can cause problems culturally, in that you have other people in the firm saying, ‘What in the world is going on?’

— Kent Zimmermann, a law firm consultant with Zeughauser Group, offering some insights to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/03/16/with-associate-raises-coming-in-waves-counsel-are-wondering-wheres-mine/) on why counsel compensation hasn’t mirrored the [new associate raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) that are reverberating through Biglaw. He says that counsel are similar to income partners in how they’re paid, and that firms are uncertain about adjusting their salaries due to the domino effect of increased expenses.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. In today’s special edition of this column, we’ll be discussing the discrimination and derogatory remarks male lawyers are subjected to when dealing with the prospect of taking paternity leave. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I work for a mid-size firm, and I’d always been told that we had a great parental leave program. That’s not the case for men. Prior to my wife giving birth, I was told I could get up to 14 days of unpaid time out of the office to spend with my newborn daughter because I wasn’t the primary caregiver. HR told me this was extremely generous. Partners scolded me when they found out I was planning to take the full two weeks off to bond with my baby. My commitment to the firm was questioned. What the fuck?

For the sake of comparison, women at this firm get 6-8 weeks of paid time off.

I’m at a small firm on the East Coast (15-20 lawyers in the tri-state area, to be specific). My wife had a very high-risk pregnancy and was put on bed rest early on. We live within a 10-minute drive of the office, and I was constantly sneaking out to help her. I’d discussed paternity leave with my boss, a guy in his mid-70s, and he told me to “man up” and “stop acting like a little sissy boy” because “this is not what breadwinners do, son.”

My twin boys were born prematurely. I was afraid that I’d lose my job if I attempted to bring up paternity leave again, so I took my one week of vacation time to see my kids in their incubator and help my wife. Not standing up for myself in this situation is the worst thing I’ve ever done in my life. I feel like I am a little sissy boy. I wish I would’ve manned up. I wish I would’ve quit.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
My firm offers an extensive paternity leave policy on par with what women receive, something like 8-12 weeks of paid time off. When I broached the subject with a partner who I trust, she told me that she didn’t think my taking even the lowest portion of the available leave would fly with some of the older partners supervising matters I was working on, but encouraged me to do what I thought was right for my family. She said I owed it to my wife and daughter to be there for them. I made the decision then and there to take 4 weeks off. Gossip goes around quickly in my office, and when people found out I was planning to take 4 weeks, I’d heard that through the grapevine that I was taking advantage of the system and that I’d never make partner considering my low commitment to the firm. Why am I still at this firm?

I’m at a very, very small firm. When I asked about paternity leave, the partner in charge looked like he was trying not to laugh in my face, but said he’d consider it. He considered it until my wife was eight months pregnant, and then told me there would be no paternity leave. I took a total of 4 days off, unpaid, to see my wife and newborn son. I feel like a complete fuck up. But what was I supposed to do? It wasn’t like I could leave, we need the money desperately. I hate this shithole.

Proskauer Rose has no intention of taking a gender discrimination lawsuit lying down. Back in 2017, the firm was slapped with a [$50 million gender discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/inside-the-50-million-gender-discrimination-case-a-partner-filed-against-proskauer-rose/?rf=1) alleging “substantial gender disparities,” including being objectified by male partners and a substantial gender pay gap. (It was initially styled as a Jane Doe case, but in an amended complaint filed last month, Connie Bertram, head of the firm’s labor and employment practice in D.C., [was revealed](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/26/proskauer-partner-reveals-identity-adds-claims-in-50m-gender-bias-suit/) to be the partner behind the suit.)

But now the firm has come out swinging, saying the amended complaint misses the boat and “cherry-pick[s]” the stats it uses. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/05/24/proskauer-says-partner-in-50m-gender-bias-suit-cherry-picked-pay-data/) Law.com:

Specifically, the firm wrote that Bertram’s originated revenues grew in 2014 and peaked in 2015 at about $9.2 million. But they then began to drop off, falling to $8.4 million in 2016 and to $4.15 million in 2017. The 2017 figure, Proskauer wrote, marks a 55 percent decline as compared to Bertram’s peak revenue origination in 2015. Despite the drop in 2016, Proskauer said it actually increased Bertram’s allocation of the firm’s profits, and despite an “enormous decline” in 2017, Bertram’s share of profits dropped by just 2 percent that year.

“Plaintiff’s claims disregard the allocation system to which she agreed, as she focuses on those metrics most favorable to her, ignores others that expose weaknesses in the profitability of her practice, and affords no recognition to non-metric factors critical to the allocation decisions,” Proskauer wrote in its answer. “Plaintiff also ignores the financial rewards that she obtained by joining Proskauer.”

Of course plaintiff’s attorney, David Sanford of [Sanford Heisler Sharp](https://sanfordheisler.com/) — the firm that’s making a[ name for themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/sanford-heisler-sharp/) suing Biglaw firms over gender discrimination — had a great sound bite ready in response:

“Proskauer is excellent at spinning a tale,” he said. “We look forward to discovery in this case and to a jury’s evaluation of all the evidence.”

We’re looking forward to discovery too.

… But we might not get full discovery. The Biglaw firm argues that, as a partner, Bertram is a business owner and therefore not protected by the anti-discrimination laws she’s suing under. Bertram argues that the centralized leadership structure of the firm means that the majority of partners do not act as business owners. The judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, has ordered limited discovery into this specific question.

# Federal Judge Lashes Out At Biglaw Attorney For 'Huge Waste Of Time'
## The judge is unimpressed with the organization of the case.

It doesn’t seem like [Jeremy Elman](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/people/Jeremy-Elman), of counsel at Allen & Overy, had a good time in federal District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’s courtroom the other day. Elman was representing his client, Carl Zeiss Meditec, at a hearing in front of Judge Gonzalez Rogers seeking a preliminary injunction for violations of trade secrets. But, as [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1584737) Law360, the judge was unimpressed by the way the briefing laid out the various trade secrets at issue, retorting, “Mr. Elman, it is not my job to assume what you want.” “It is my job to evaluate what you present. There is a difference.”

But that was far from the only thing Judge Gonzalez Rogers had to say. She seemed particularly perturbed by the lack of clarity in Elman’s filings:

Elman pointed to various trade secrets arguments made in different pleadings and the complaint, but the judge again appeared irked that those allegations weren’t clearly laid out in the preliminary injunction motion.

“It is not my job to scour the record in this case,” she said. “I have a motion in front of me, and that’s the motion I’m going to evaluate. We all have law clerks. They come and go. It is your responsibility to prove your case.”

She lost her patience with Elman’s explanation of the various trade secrets at issue and characterized the lack of organization as a “huge waste of time”:

Judge Gonzalez Rogers then walked through the various alleged trade secrets she believed were listed in the motion, but paused and told Elman, “You look confused.”

He replied with a grin and said he was confused by the judge’s summary of the allegations, but the judge wasn’t amused.

“It’s not funny,” she said. “It’s a huge waste of time. You never just say, ‘Our trade secret is the source code.’ You don’t say it until the reply [brief].”

And she’s uninterested in looking in multiple locations for the information she needs for the current hearing:

Elman replied by pointing out that the judge had indicated during a prior hearing in January that the trade secret was the software, but Judge Gonzalez Rogers again appeared frustrated by the attorney’s explanation.

“So I’m supposed to go back — with hundreds of [other] cases [on my docket] — to reread transcripts from two months ago?” she asked.

Elman again argued that there could be three separate trade secrets depending on whether the software is encrypted or decrypted, or the judge can consider the software to be one trade secret in itself, but the judge told him, “You’re really not getting what I’m saying here.”

But that wasn’t the end of her frustration, particularly since in a technology heavy case, courts are “trying to learn this stuff.” And the overall organization has been problematic for the judge, since, the “docket is somewhat a mess,” and “I would suggest that the senior lawyers go back and pull up the docket, and [view] it how I have to see it.”

Ultimately, the judge took the arguments under submission and will issue a written opinion.

Practice pointer for the future: make sure you have all your ducks in a row when you’re in front of Judge Gonzalez Rogers — she’ll take kindly to it.

# Above The Law’s 10th Annual Holiday Card Contest
## We look forward to your submissions. Thank you, and happy holidays!

It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Thanks to a bonanza of [bonus news](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/associate-bonus-watch-2018/), the holiday season is off to a great start. Jolly Old Saint Cravath was very kind this year, stuffing associates’ stockings with good cheer and [wads of cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/). The law firm holiday parties are about to start kicking into gear, but the parties and paychecks pale in comparison to what’s about to get underway: Above the Law’s tenth annual holiday card contest. We’ve already received several emails asking about when this year’s contest would start. The answer: It starts today.

We are a legal website, so of course there are some rules to follow:

1. Because we are committed to the environment here at [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/), we will consider ONLY E-CARDS. You can certainly send us paper holiday cards via snail mail — our address is Above the Law / Breaking Media, 611 Broadway, Suite 907D, New York, NY 10012 — but they won’t be considered for this contest.

2. To submit an e-card, please email either a link to the card or the card itself (as an attachment) — but note that WE PREFER LINKS, if available — to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest), subject line: “Holiday Card Contest.” The subject line is very important because it’s how we will comb through our inbox to collect the entries when picking finalists. If you don’t use the correct subject line, expect a lump of coal in your stocking.

3. Please limit submissions to holiday / Christmas cards that you view as WORTHY CONTENDERS. We’re looking for cards that are unusually clever, funny, or cool; we’re not interested in cards that are safe or boring (e.g., a beautiful winter landscape, a “Happy Holidays 2018,” and the law firm name). We’re seeking cards with some attitude, with that extra je ne sais quoi. If you send us a banal card, don’t be surprised if we [make fun of it](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/atl-holiday-card-contest-honorable-and-dishonorable-mentions/).

4. In your email, please include a BRIEF EXPLANATION of why this card is compelling — an explanation that we MIGHT QUOTE FROM if your nominee makes the finals (if you want to be anonymous, let us know). If you can’t offer an explanation, please rethink whether the card is a worthy contender (see rule #3, supra).

# Ropes & Gray Offers Voluntary Buyouts Amid Coronavirus Crisis
## A kinder, gentler way of parting with employees during a pandemic.

Thanks to the COVID-19 outbreak, Biglaw firms the world over have been forced to initiate all kinds of cost-cutting measures, ranging from salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs, to ensure that they’ll be able to keep their heads above these dark waters. While we’ve seen a few voluntary leave programs here and there, we haven’t seen any outright buyout programs — until now.

We’ve been told that Ropes & Gray, which came in at No. 13 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings with $1,903,616,000 in gross revenue, will be offering a voluntary separation incentive program to all of its U.S. support team employees. Those who are approved for these buyouts will receive one week of severance pay per year of service, plus an additional four weeks’ worth of pay (with a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 30 weeks). Most departures related to this program will occur between June 19 and August 3. The firm will continue to pay its share of the employee’s medical, dental and/or vision insurance premium cost through December 31, 2020. It’s important to note that attorneys are not eligible to participate in the program.

(Flip to the next page to see a copy of the email announcing the firm’s voluntary separation incentive plan.)

We reached out to Ropes & Gray for comment on the firm’s buyout plan. “We’re being proactive. We need to take steps now to address our new reality,” a firm spokesman said. “This offer of voluntary separation for our U.S. business support teams is one. Our firm is strong economically, and as a community.”

We wish all of the legal professionals at Ropes & Gray who accept and are approved for the buyout the best of luck should they seek new jobs in the legal industry.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Let Me Tell You Something Brother, The Hulk Hogan Victory Is Going To Be Reversed On Appeal

Late Friday evening, [Hulk Hogan won](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/business/media/gawker-hulk-hogan-verdict.html?_r=0) his $100 million lawsuit against Gawker. It took a jury just six hours to find Gawker.com liable for invasion of privacy. The jury awarded Hogan (real name: Terry Bollea) $115 million in damages because Gawker published a sex tape of Hogan and another women, the wife of Tampa area D.J. Bubba the Love Sponge (a.k.a. Todd Clem).

The Hulkster cried.

Gawker founder Nick Denton has already released a statement about the company’s intention to appeal. He and then editor-in-chief, Albert J. Daulerio, were found personally liable as well:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Given key evidence and the most important witness were both improperly withheld from this jury, we all knew the appeals court will need to resolve the case. I want to thank our lawyers for their outstanding work and am confident that we would have prevailed at trial if we had been allowed to present the full case to the jury. That’s why we feel very positive about the appeal that we have already begun preparing, as we expect to win this case ultimately.

Full disclosure: [Above the Law enjoys a business relationship with Gawker Media](http://www.atlredline.com/). Additional disclosure: I believe it’s critical to live in a world where news value is determined by publishers and not famous ex-wrestlers. Diaper disclosure: HOLY TYPEBALLS THIS IS BAD for anyone who writes about public figures. Did I miss the part where Donald Trump was already elected and “opened up” the libel laws?

But even without those caveats, it seems likely that Gawker will either prevail on appeal, or at least have the award significantly reduced. Hogan is a public figure, the existence of the tape was a matter of some discussion long before Gawker published it, and there were some questionable exclusionary decisions. Yada yada. Even if there was “harm,” $115 million of flying leg drop harm seems excessive.

Still, the immediate reality for any media professional has to be: hang onto your butts. Juries are taking the privacy of their beloved celebrities very seriously. The public, beset by a world where nothing feels private anymore, has little patience for paparazzi “journalism.”

At least, they don’t want to support that crap when they put on clothes and go to jury duty. When they’re surfing with one hand, Google analytics notes different preferences.

If I was me ten years ago, I’d tell me to throw out everything I know about free speech, regardless of what happens on appeal. The nutjobs with guns protect the Second Amendment, not the First. Standards of decency and standards of liability have been blurred. If someone sent me a video of Obama boning Vladimir Putin while two Grey aliens looked on, I’d be more afraid of the privacy implications than the intergalactic gestapo. I trust my news instincts, but I sure as hell wouldn’t trust a judge or jury to understand.

Now, if you’ll excuse me I’m going to go back to Tweeting obscenities at college kids who are busting my bracket. Most of them aren’t famous enough to try sue me for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

# Will Biglaw Firms Require Lawyers And Staff To Get The COVID-19 Vaccine?
## Law firms seem to be playing a game of wait and see when it comes to their vaccine plans.

With the COVID-19 vaccine rollout underway across the country, lawyers and staff members alike are wondering what their Biglaw firms are planning to do. The move to work remotely due to the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus came quickly, but decisions related to vaccination plans seem to be moving at a glacial pace.

What could possibly be taking these firms so long to tell employees that they’ll be requiring or encouraging them to get vaccinated? As it turns out, Biglaw vaccine decisions may be just like their year-end bonus decisions: They’re all waiting for another firm with clout to do it first.

April Campbell, the executive director of the Association of Legal Administrators, recently discussed this phenomenon with [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/1344774/why-law-firms-may-not-require-vaccine-for-attys-and-staff).

Firms appear to be waiting for a first mover to take the lead, and most are still gauging the temperature in the room, or more specifically the temperature at their firm and in their particular geography, Campbell said.

“Everyone is thinking about it. Many are getting pressure from staff to have a response or answer on whether the vaccine will be required to come back into the office,” she said. “But as with everything law firm, they want to know what everyone else is doing.”

But there’s only a limited amount of time left for law firm leadership to hem and haw over their COVID-19 vaccine policies. After all, the CDC has recommended that lawyers, judges, and legal professionals be included in vaccine distribution group 1C, and it won’t be long before that time comes.

“While I understand they don’t want to finalize anything yet, we should not be doing nothing,” said [Michael Cohen](https://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/michaelscohen.html), a Duane Morris LLP partner, who suggested that firm committees must at least start talking about “what makes the most sense — to mandate, to encourage, and if they choose to encourage how to do that most effectively.” [Noah Fiedler](https://www.hinshawlaw.com/professionals-Noah-Fiedler.html), a partner at Hinshaw & Culbertson, said that while “[i]t is true to say most don’t know yet … it’s also true to say most firms have spent months thinking about it.” Options are on the table, according to Fiedler, but decisions have yet to be made. But while actual guidance is lacking, surveys abound on this issue.

[Fiedler] said the larger firms he’s working with are actually conducting surveys to figure out what their employees and attorneys are thinking — do they want to get it? Would they be afraid to come back into the office if it is not mandated?

And the ALA’s Campbell says she has seen the same thing, with some of the organization’s law firms conducting surveys.

That said, Above the Law will run its own survey on this important issue. What are your law firm’s plans when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines? Please let us know.

We are delighted to welcome Bill to the Firm. He is a highly respected lawyer whose long and distinguished history of public service, record of board service and experience as a General Counsel make him especially attuned to the needs of our clients.

— [Neil Barr](https://www.davispolk.com/lawyers/neil-barr), managing partner of Davis Polk, in a [statement](https://www.davispolk.com/news/davis-polk-welcomes-william-j-hochul-jr-new-york) concerning [William J. Hochul, Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Hochul_Jr.). joining the firm’s White Collar Defense & Investigations practice in New York as counsel. Hochul, who recently stepped down as general counsel for hospitality company Delaware North, is husband to New York Governor [Kathy Hochul](https://www.governor.ny.gov/about-governor-hochul) (D). “I look forward to joining Davis Polk’s formidable white collar defense team and working together to help clients navigate their most complex investigations and advisory matters,” Hochul said of his new role.

# White & Case Matches Special Bonuses -- Which Payout Method Did They Choose?
## That's a late one.

As firms continue throwing their lot in with the new special bonus schedule, about the only drama left is figuring out how firms elect to pay out their bonuses. Will they be April-September or May-November? Will they be equally divided payments or backloaded to the latter date?

White & Case has matched the prevailing market rate, but how did they answer these questions?

It’s a June 28 and December 28 payout — a bit on the late side — and it’s a backloaded payment, so associates had best be ready to stick it out until 2022.

Weil Gotshal got some good news earlier, learning that the Chinese hackers who breached the firm are [going to have to pay up](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/morning-docket-05-11-17/). Hopefully that will salve the pain they suffered on Tuesday, when Bankruptcy Judge [Anita Shodeen](https://ballotpedia.org/Anita_L._Shodeen) laid down the hammer on Weil Gotshal for requesting, we don’t want to say “unreasonable” fees, but Judge Shodeen already called them that, so what the hell!

From [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/922771/weil-s-high-fees-bid-in-bankruptcy-case-gets-bench-slap) (sub. req.):

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Anita L. Shodeen ripped into the firm’s $976,000 request for fees for its representation of TCTM Financial FS, Wellman’s senior secured lender, during the months of September and October of last year.

Calling “overstated” the firm’s portrayal of the bankruptcy case as “overly complex,” the judge rued Weil’s billing rates, the number of attorneys assigned and its lack of specificity in billing entries, trimming its fees to $488,452 while denying about $32,200 in additional costs.

“Based simply upon the number of attorneys and hours billed leads to the inherent conclusion that there was a distinct lack of billing judgment exercised by Weil in its representation of TCTM,” Judge Shodeen wrote in her 14-page order.

Apparently “we’ll get you and mangle you” applies to diaries as well.

“By any measure the fees requested in Weil’s motion are staggering,” Judge Shodeen said. “An oversecured creditor is certainly entitled to determine the level of services it wants provided in any given bankruptcy case. Whether such fees were sensibly incurred is another matter.”

She noted that of the 35 motions filed by the firm between Sept. 13 and Oct. 31, most were “applications seeking employment of professionals or requests to appear pro hac vice.”

She pointed out that multiple attorneys were assigned for telephonic attorneys although the use of recordings and transcripts made that effort seem duplicative. She also questioned why many attorneys were used for “ministerial tasks” such as gathering and providing documents to local counsel in the case, when paralegals were much cheaper for such routine work.

It’s always fantastic when a Biglaw firm finds itself in Iowa. Weil should consider themselves lucky they won’t have to do any form of public shaming. It feels like only yesterday when Judge Mark Bennett ordered Jones Day to [make a video apologizing for discovery abuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/biglaw-firm-ordered-to-make-a-video-apologizing-for-discovery-abuses/). The Eighth Circuit cruelly reversed that sanction, but firms should have considered the message sent.

The overlawyering that we take for granted in the Acela corridor doesn’t hit the ear the same way in most of the country.

“Yes, was the start of my last jam / So here it is again, another def jam / But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked / They still consider me a new jack.” — [Public Enemy](http://genius.com/5041966)

Later this month, [Parr Brown Gee & Loveless PC](http://parrbrown.com/) shareholder Bentley Tolk will launch the second season of his popular legal podcast, [Legal Marketing Launch](http://www.legalmarketinglaunch.com/), which has twice been ranked #1 in the Technology category for audio podcasts in New & Noteworthy on iTunes. The show is downloaded on a daily basis all across the country and around the world. In [episode 98](http://www.legalmarketinglaunch.com/098-diversity-in-the-legal-profession-renwei-chung/), Tolk and I discussed various issues affecting diversity in the legal profession and how content marketing can benefit everyone.

Whether you are a recent law school graduate or a cagey veteran, Legal Marketing Launch is focused on helping you expand your legal practice. The premise of the podcast is: Since law schools and law firms don’t teach law students and lawyers in an effective way (or much at all) about how to develop and market their legal practices within the context of a law firm, lawyers in law firms need to take individual initiative to learn how to develop their own, independent book of business within their law firms. Tolk’s hope is that his free podcast fills that need.

When you listen to his podcast, you will notice Tolk has quite a professional voice. Maybe this was developed from his days singing as part of the [Harvard Krokodiloes](http://www.kroks.com/), Harvard University’s oldest and finest a cappella singing group. Not only did he accompany the Krokodiloes to Europe and Asia on their 1988 Summer World Tour, but he made Krok history by getting down on one knee for a [show-stopping marriage proposal](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1988/2/16/krok-proposes-during-concert-pjohnny-oconnor/) to his then-girlfriend and now wife, Jenny Tolk, during the a capella group’s 1988 Valentine’s Day concert.

This week, I had the opportunity to reconnect with Bentley Tolk. From Tolk’s favorite podcast episodes to his business development and technology tips, I found our discussion very practical and learned quite a bit from him. I believe you will as well. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Bentley Tolk (BT): I was attracted to law school because it seemed more academic than business school, and because I believed it would allow me to use research, writing and speaking skills. My wife and I applied to law school as a “package deal,” and the University of Chicago Law School was one of the fine law schools that accepted both of us. We were the only “married couple” in the first-year class.

RC: After 22 years of the legal practice, what motivated you to begin podcasting?

BT: I believe that audio podcasting is one of the best business development platforms for lawyers, because many potential clients don’t have time to sit at a computer to read or watch a lawyer’s content. Audio podcasting literally allows busy lawyers, clients and potential clients to listen to a lawyer’s content while multi-tasking.

Thus, if a lawyer would like to reach other lawyers or busy potential clients, the advantage of podcasting is that other lawyers or potential clients can listen and learn while commuting, exercising, getting ready for work, walking the dog, preparing for bed, or even brushing their teeth! As a business development tool, podcasting can be unmatched in that potential clients can hear a lawyer’s voice on a consistent basis, helping potential clients come to know, like and trust the lawyer. Articles, videos and speeches don’t allow lawyers the same convenience and consistency of contact with potential clients.

RC: For those who plan to produce their own podcast one day, what advice do you have for them?

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
BT: First, choose several podcast topics that interest you. Second, use Google or some other source to research several topics that would be of interest to your target audience. Third, choose a topic that overlaps between your interests and those of your target audience. Fourth, invest in a paid course or courses from someone who is already podcasting.

Finally, once you have chosen your topic and have received some training, start the process of podcasting before you believe you are ready and before your product is “perfect.” Per the quote attributed to Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.”

RC: Who have been some of your most interesting or notable interviewees and why?

BT: Paul Anderson ([episode 69](http://www.legalmarketinglaunch.com/069-lessons-from-marketing-a-concussion-litigation-practice-paul-anderson/)) and Lindsey Zahn ([episode 132](http://www.legalmarketinglaunch.com/132-lessons-from-marketing-a-wine-and-beverage-law-practice-lindsey-zahn/)) are good examples of lawyers who chose a narrow niche and became thought leaders in that niche through blogging early on in their legal careers: concussion litigation for Paul, and wine law for Lindsey. John Scannapieco ([episode 49](http://www.legalmarketinglaunch.com/049-global-legal-marketing-john-scannapieco/)) explains how a lawyer can think big and create a thriving international practice, starting from square one.

Finally, Jordan Furlong ([Episode 63](http://www.legalmarketinglaunch.com/063-the-effect-of-current-and-future-trends-on-legal-marketing-jordan-furlong/)) provides timely advice on how current and future trends in the legal profession should affect one’s business development strategies.

RC: Season I was absolutely fantastic for law firm marketing and client development tips and advice. For Season II, what can listeners expect to hear or learn about when they [subscribe](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/legal-marketing-launch-bentley/id1006640170) to your podcast?

BT: In my opinion, and due to the high quality of the interviewees, Season I contains one of the most comprehensive libraries in existence of cutting-edge business development ideas and motivation for lawyers.

Season II will include more of the same, along with an additional focus on (1) client development strategies from leaders in bar associations and special-interest groups in the legal profession; and (2) how third-year law students and new lawyers plan to build their legal practices.

Of course, Season II will continue the tradition of asking my interviewees their recommendation on what listeners should do over the next seven days in terms of business development, along with recommendations of a book and an internet resource for the listeners.

RC: What career or business development advice do you have for law school students and young lawyers?

BT: Law school doesn’t teach much about business or practice development. In the next seven days, I recommend that you:

(1) write down where you would like your individual legal practice to be within the next year, five years, and ten years, and post that document somewhere where you will look at it each day;

(2) taking into account what you wrote in step one, write a list of goals – for the next 12 months – for your individual law practice within your law firm;

(3) write down the weekly actions you will take to accomplish each of those goals over the next 12 months; and

(4) set up a system to hold yourself accountable on a weekly basis in working toward those goals. In the meantime, become a student of business development and implement the strategies you are learning, so as to help you reach your goals.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

BT: As you set business development goals for your practice, emphasize “content marketing.” In other words, find ways to provide high-quality, relevant, free content to your clients and potential clients on a consistent basis, whether through blogging, writing articles, speaking at conferences, etc. Find ways to become known as a “thought leader” in your area of practice.

RC: On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Bentley Tolk for sharing his experience and wisdom with our audience. We wish him continued success on the second season of Legal Marketing Launch.

# Biglaw Firms Now Offering Rainmaker Partners Forgivable Loans To Prevent Them From Leaving
## A little extra cash never hurts -- especially if it'll keep top rainmakers from heading to rival law firms.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

You could have someone who wasn’t a partner before and used to getting money on a regular basis … so the firm looks at giving them a forgivable loan. That’s where the firm is trying to address the challenges of a transition.

But there are also forgivable loans when they’re trying to retain somebody and you have to give some back if you don’t stay for a certain amount of time.

— Alisa Levin, principal at Greene-Levin-Snyder Legal Search Group in New York, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/19/bonuses-with-strings-attached-play-role-in-partner-retention/) on bonuses structured as forgivable loans that have been used as partner retention tools. Firms like Kirkland & Ellis and DLA Piper have reportedly used forgivable loans to keep partners from exiting to rivals, and Shearman & Sterling did the same just prior to its merger with Allen & Overy as a way to “incentivize” partners to stay.

# Elite Biglaw Firms Are 'Likely' To Match Milbank, But Will Anyone Raise Salaries Even Higher?
## When will Biglaw firms match the $225K salary scale? All it takes is one firm to start a 'domino' effect.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

[I]f every other firm from this moment forward, just held their fire and didn’t raise, it would just be Milbank raising, and no one would need to raise. But history suggests at least one more firm will match, and that’ll cause others, and it’ll domino across the industry.

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/people/kent-zimmermann), a law firm management consultant with the Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/08/top-performers-likely-to-raise-associate-pay-after-milbank-but-broad-hesitancy-lingers/) on the likelihood that other elite Biglaw firms will match Milbank’s recent [salary raise for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/). Given the state of the market, Zimmermann said, it “[doesn’t] suggest to most firms that they need to raise compensation in the absence of other firms raising compensation.” Legal analysts believe it is “likely” or “very” likely that at least the top 25 Am Law firms will match the new salary scale, and some firms may even try to go above Milbank’s scale.

# Harvard Law Grad Fired From Biglaw Job After Failing Bar Loses Disability Bias Suit Against Bar Examiners
## It turns out it's not so easy to sue the bar examiners.

A Harvard Law graduate who failed the New York bar exam twice, lost her Biglaw job because of it, and filed a disability bias suit against the state’s Board of Law Examiners has now had that suit tossed out — and you might be able to guess why if you’re deep into studying for the bar exam right now.

First, we’ll provide some background. If you recall, back in 2016, the plaintiff in this case, now identified as T.W., sued the New York BOLE, alleging that she’d been denied testing accommodations on the bar exam that she’d received while in law school. It was because of this denial, she claimed, that she failed the bar exam twice in a row, which led to her losing her job at Ropes & Gray. “Once you are in a big, white-shoe law firm and you’re forced to leave, you are out of sync,” her lawyer [said at the time](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/biglaw-associate-fails-bar-gets-fired-sues-bar-examiners-for-causing-job-loss/). “The likelihood of getting another job at a big firm is slim to none. This has really derailed her career.” T.W. passed the exam on her third try, but a career in Biglaw had already passed her by.

So, why was this lawyer’s bar exam suit banished from court? According to Judge Raymond J. Dearie of the Eastern District of New York, the BOLE is like an arm of the state, and that means it’s entitled to sovereign immunity against ADA claims like the plaintiff in this case had levied.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
On top of Dearie booting T.W.’s last remaining cause of action — the Second Circuit kicked another one of her claims in 2021 — he went ahead and denied her the injunctive relief she sought to stop the BOLE from reporting her past exam results. An expungement, he noted, would simply not undo what had already been done. The [ABA Journal](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/harvard-law-grad-loses-suit-claiming-lack-of-bar-exam-accommodations-nixed-her-biglaw-career) has the money quote from the judge:

“T.W. submits that she faces continuing injury because the record of her bar examination failures has hindered her job search and career prospects,” Dearie wrote. “But T.W. never alleges that a prospective employer has inquired about her bar examination record, much less made a hiring decision based on that record. Instead, she alleges that law firms have learned ‘that she did not have the opportunity to gain the experience they seek from a 2013 graduate due to the disruptions caused by her bar examination failure.’ … The court cannot rewrite history; expungement will neither alter T.W.’s level of experience nor undo the fact that she did not successfully pass the bar until 2015. Moreover, the injunctive relief T.W. requests would suppress a record that, according to the board, it is prohibited from disclosing to employers.”

T.W. may have spent the last few years of her life litigating against the New York BOLE and ended up with a loss, but it wasn’t exactly all for naught. At least future bar exam candidates in the state will know just how difficult it is to sue the bar examiners. That’s not what she was hoping for, but it’s something.

The dream of Biglaw isn’t the panacea you imagine it to be. Sure, the money’s good — and only getting better — but the hours, stress, and culture often leave a lot to be desired. Plus, there’s the added hassle of heading back to the physical office after a year+ proved Biglaw functions just fine in a virtual environment. It’s almost enough to make you want to quit…

Well, that’s exactly what one Biglaw associate did.

On the very same day she went back into the office for the first time since March 2020, Kim Daily — now a [former Eversheds associate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-daily/) — handed in her resignation.

[A post shared by Kim Daily (@iamkimdaily)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRARGSqF7Dd/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

So what’s next for this recovering Biglaw associate? She’s launched a brand [For the Qulture](http://www.forthequlture.com) and she’s dropping a tune that references her legal career, the MCU, and Lizzo.

The key line you’ll really feel?

$300k on the shelf, I quit my job for my health, but tell me is it really gamblin’ when you bettin’ on yourself?

Law firms continue to reverse course and change their plans when it comes to the reopening of their offices across thanks to the emergence of the COVID-19’s Delta variant. Vaccination mandates now seem to be the way of the future, and one by one, law firms are joining in to protect their employees and their local legal communities.

For reference, the following firms are requiring all employees to be vaccinated before they return to the office: [Akin Gump](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Arent Fox](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ballard Spahr](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Boies Schiller Flexner](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Carlton Fields](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/skadden-mandates-vaccines-for-all-sidley-remains-mum-on-vaccination-but-pushes-back-reopening-date/), [Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Cozen O’Connor](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Crowell & Moring](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Davis & Gilbert](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Debevoise & Plimpton](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Dickinson Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Fenwick & West](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-will-require-employees-to-be-vaccinated-some-push-back-reopening-dates/?rf=1), [Hanson Bridgett](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/more-biglaw-and-boutique-firms-add-vaccination-requirements-for-employees-to-return-to-office/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [McDermott Will & Emery](https://abovethelaw.com/company/social-meteor/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Norton Rose Fulbright](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Patterson Belknap](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/vaccine-mandates-are-trending-across-biglaw-firms/?rf=1), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/top-biglaw-firms-chair-beseeches-lawyers-staff-to-get-vaccinated/?rf=1), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), [Schiff Hardin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-mandate-vaccines-for-lawyers-and-staff/), [Seyfarth Shaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Sheppard Mulllin](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-heavy-hitters-add-vaccine-mandates-to-their-reopening-policies/), [Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1), [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/skadden-mandates-vaccines-for-all-sidley-remains-mum-on-vaccination-but-pushes-back-reopening-date/), [Stroock & Stroock & Lavan](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/biglaw-firms-continue-to-roll-out-vaccine-mandates-delay-reopenings/), [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/), [Wilson Sonsini](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/wsgr-delays-opening-delta/), and [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/more-biglaw-firms-delay-openings-lay-down-strong-vaccination-policies/?rf=1).

The latest firm to issue a vaccine requirement is Greenberg Traurig, the first Florida-based Biglaw firm to announce such a measure. With Florida continuing to set COVID-19 case records and state government staunchly against mask mandates and other rational restrictions and safety measures, it’s no wonder that GT announced this new policy.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
According to the Daily Business Review, the firm has mandated COVID-19 vaccines for all employees across each and every one of its U.S. offices.

A firm spokesperson said individual office leaders were asked to consider mandating vaccines after the Delta variant caused a spike in case numbers and hospitalizations. The firm is nearly 90% vaccinated, the spokesperson said.

Holland & Knight, another Florida-based firm, is reportedly considering a vaccine requirement for employees but has not yet come to a final decison on the matter.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# New White & Case Leader Reduced To Nameless 'Female Litigator' In Media Coverage
## This almost certainly wasn't intentional... which is the problem.

Yesterday, [White & Case announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/change-in-leadership-at-white-case/) that Hugh Verrier would step down as the firm’s chair in September and Heather McDevitt would take over the firm’s top job. It’s exciting news in Biglaw when one of the top 10 firms by any metric embarks on a leadership change. All the legal press covered it.

One outlet’s coverage… left a little something to be desired.

The replies tell the story of what happened next. Elon Musk won’t let the public see the number of replies anymore because he was tired of getting ratioed to death, but trust that they’ve accumulated for hours at this point. Here’s a slice of only the most recent…



The word is technically “litigatrix” per Black’s Law Dictionary ([via Above the Law itself](https://twitter.com/BryanAGarner/status/427931465989357569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E427931465989357569%7Ctwgr%5E5d416f2b833dc70ba0c94c671a6004059a6cc9d4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshblackman.com%2Fblog%2F2014%2F01%2F27%2Fdavid-lat-has-coined-three-words-in-blacks-law-dictionary-and-i-got-a-slang-tweet-from-garner%2F)) — though I’ve never liked it when “litigator” is right there — but we’re pretty sure the commenter means something along the lines of “bias” or “sexism” in this instance.

Now, I suspect what happened here is that somewhere along the line, this conversation happened:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Social media author: We’ll put “White & Case elects new leader”
Supervisor: Hmm. That’s a little bland. Is there anything interesting about this new leader?
Social media author: Well, Heather McDevitt is a female litigator… that might be a first for the firm?
Supervisor: Yeah… but if we tell them who is taking over in the Tweet, they might not click.
Social media author: Right, right. We could just say Hugh Verrier is stepping down.
Supervisor: That’s better, but then we lose the “female litigator” hook. Tell you what — say Verrier is stepping down and point out that his successor is a female litigator and then people will click to find out who she is.
Social media author: Brilliant, boss!
Supervisor: I know.

Had this headline just said “female litigator” and not mentioned Verrier, it would be a little weird — are people really not going to click if they see her name in the Tweet? — but I think most folks would write it off as an effort to preserve a little mystery for the readers. It’s the contrast that made this problematic because it grants a name to one party and not the other… while simultaneously reducing the latter to a demographic.

And this might be a bit of a trend. Compare:

Baker Botts LLP has elected litigation department co-chair Danny David as the firm's 16th managing partner. [https://t.co/K3Rql2cNtL](https://t.co/K3Rql2cNtL)

It’s not even limited to enticing readers to click to figure out about the “new” leader:

[](https://twitter.com/Law360/status/1631061785267650561?s=20)

To be clear, I doubt Law360 harbored any ill-intent here. There is a fine line to walk when it comes to coaxing readers to click on a story, and highlighting that the story features a successful lawyer from outside the white male box can draw an audience. Deftly phrased, zeroing in on “Woman Global Leader” or “Female Litigator” can celebrate achievement in a profession that often flops on diversity.

But… there’s not really any reason not to also name these lawyers and there’s certainly no reason to give that benefit to the white dudes’ names and not anyone else.

To be fair, Law360 generally makes it a habit to not name the incoming leader in these headlines (the Baker Botts story, while recent, is an outlier). And that’s fine if it’s the consistent practice.

This sort of thing happens when scrambling to produce content fast for a voracious audience. Above the Law has certainly had unintentional issues like this too. And they can get complex. Recently I used a generic stock image of a white person in a story and someone pointed out that the subject of the story was non-white. But the story was negative and dealt with ethical violations… should the generic image reflect the subject’s race even though race had nothing to do with the infraction and using the image could inject racist baggage on its own? It can be tough.

That said, this is not so tough.

The problem isn’t really that it happens in the first place — though that’s not good! — it’s how you approach it once it’s brought to your attention and avoid it going forward.

I think we’ve got sufficient notice now.

# Biglaw Firm Matches The Cravath Scale, With No Special Bonuses In Sight
## Associates really aren't pleased by this.

It’s mid-January, and here on the East Coast, it is C-O-L-D, cold. Coincidentally, Biglaw is still matching the weather with cold, hard cash as bonus season continues and the largest law firms in America reward associates and counsel for all their hard work.

Our latest featured bonus comes from Crowell & Moring, which brought in $514,391,000 in gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 77th place on the Am Law 100. When we last checked in with the firm, it had decided to implement a [two-tier compensation system](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/crowell-raises/) based on billable hours, effective September 1, 2021. Those who billed 2000 or more hours would be compensated on the Davis Polk scale, with cash ranging from $205,000 to $365,000, while those who billed 1900 hours would receive somewhat reduced compensation, ranging from $185,00 to $340,000.

As it turns out, Crowell announced bonuses via email quite some time ago, before [Davis Polk’s scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21) yet again became the prevailing market rate after the firm announced that it would be adding special bonuses on top of the already generous [Cravath year-end bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/). Perhaps associates were waiting for the firm to change its tune and raise up bonuses to the market standard before reaching out to us but unfortunately, those revisions never came.

One frustrated source — who claims that Crowell & Moring was also undermarket on previous special bonuses — tells us that with respect to year-end bonuses, the firm “[d]id not adjust to the new scale” and there has been “no word at all on adjustments.” Eek. Hopefully associates will be able to hold on for more money but if not… the lateral market is certainly hot, hot, hot enough to put a little pep in their step and bring their bank accounts back to life.

UPDATE: Another source tells us that while Crowell matched the Cravath scale, it was the old Cravath scale that went up to $100K for senior associates, not the current scale that goes up to $115K for senior associates. Ooof!

# Stat Of The Week: Growing Discontent
## Rising burnout takes its toll.

Lawyers soured on their work early this year, with increasing burnout likely weighing on their short-term job satisfaction, according to a new report. 

Bloomberg Law’s second [Attorney Workload & Hours Survey](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/analysis-survey-finds-lawyer-burnout-rising-well-being-falling) reveals a disparity between lawyers’ overall job satisfaction and how they felt about the first quarter of 2021.

For overall job satisfaction, the survey has some good news: Almost 60% of respondents rated it at least 7 out of 10, mirroring previous results. 

But when asked about job satisfaction in Q1, that number plummets to 44%. 

Unsurprisingly, this drop coincides with a rise in burnout — respondents said they experienced burnout 50% of the time in the Q1 survey, compared with 40% of the time in a prior survey looking at 2020.  

As Bloomberg notes: 

“This increase in burnout may be negatively impacting how satisfied attorneys are presently, but if conditions leading to increased burnout are directly related to the pandemic, respondents’ overall job satisfaction may not wane as they realize (or hope) that their work/life balance will return to pre-pandemic levels sooner rather than later.”

# How Law Departments Can Make Innovation Stick
## Closing the gap between *buying* technology and *using* technology.

Tech advocates on in-house teams face unique challenges.

How can they ensure the changes they push for are not only implemented, but also are effective in improving workflows? 

How can they avoid the dreaded long-term fallout from a failed implementation? How can they ensure that buying technology equates to using technology — and doing so effectively? 

In “How Today’s Challenges Are Forging Tomorrow’s Top GCs,” legal tech experts Michele Alwin of Wolters Kluwer and Lucy Bassli of InnoLaw Group explored these questions with the legal tech journalist Bob Ambrogi.

Here, we share a few of their insights on making innovation stick. 

[(View the full webinar here.)](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/how-todays-challenges-are-forging-tomorrows-top-gcs/)

Focus on Education

While lawyers handle highly sophisticated work, they are often inexperienced when it comes to technology. As a result, the panelists noted, vendors have an obligation to provide a thorough educational journey to their clients.

“Just like I hope that when my plumber comes over, they won’t just give me the invoice and say, ‘Sure, I can fix that,’” Bassli says. “Give me some options. Tell me why. Tell me what happened! What am I going to do to prevent it next time?”

Bassli also notes that failed implementations can leave “deep scars” for organizations, harming the credibility of a project’s advocates and creating resistance to future change. 

In her work with Wolters Kluwer’s Legisway, Alwin hears some “bad back stories” from customers about past experiences with technology. This can in turn create challenges in helping customers understand how Legisway is different from these prior experiences, she says. 

“I think one thing that sometimes gets a little bit lost is: We’re talking about legal tech here, and that’s important, but to the buyer it’s a lot less about legal tech than it is about solving a problem, about improving their workflow.” 

Once new tech has been successfully implemented and the necessary support infrastructure is in place, it’s crucial to produce tangible results. 

“I want to see real progress. I want to see a lawyer go: ‘Thank God I don’t have to review another NDA,’” says Bassli. “That’s progress … I want to see those outcomes, those values, those benefits.”

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

To avoid litigation, the Alliance hopes these law firms will immediately modify their programs to bring them into compliance with our nation’s civil rights laws. No student should be treated differently because of their race or ethnicity.

— Edward Blum, leader of the American Alliance for Equal Rights, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/blum-threatens-more-law-firms-over-diversity-hiring-programs) over the organization’s threats against diversity fellowship programs at Winston & Strawn, Hunton Andrews & Kurth, and Adams and Reese. In response to the threat of litigation, Adams and Reese decided to do away with its program, saying it will not be accepting applications for its “1L Minority Fellowship.” The Alliance has already [filed suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/two-biglaw-firms-sued-over-diversity-initiatives/) against Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie, which [both](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaw-caves-morrison-foerster-changes-diversity-fellowship-criteria-following-lawsuit/) [revised](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/perkins-coie-diversity-fellowship/) their DEI fellowships to remove race as a factor, leading to the lawsuits being dropped.

# Americans Rank Law Firms Dead Last In Commitment To Diversity
## According to a new survey looking at 11 major industries, law firms are perceived to have the lowest commitment to diversity when it comes to hiring and retention.

“First I took the time out, then I put the time in / Money ain’t everything, it’s more about the timing.” – [Fabolous](http://genius.com/20528)

This week, research experts [McGinn and Company](http://mcginnandcompany.com/Default.aspx) and [Repass Research](http://repassinc.com/) published a [survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-d54rTHlQeYdVpMdWIwWERYaWc/view?usp=sharing) revealing that — among 11 major industries — law firms are perceived to have the lowest commitment to diversity when it comes to [hiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/3-things-law-firms-can-do-right-now-to-increase-diversity-in-the-legal-profession/) and [retention](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/high-minority-attrition-rates-continue-to-plague-large-law-firms/).

We already know that representation of minorities in the law [has barely budged](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/minorities-in-the-legal-profession-have-increased-by-less-than-one-percent-since-2000/) since 2000, and the [2020 data](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/without-significant-changes-diversity-in-the-legal-profession-will-remain-on-life-support/) about our profession probably won’t be much different. “This should be a wake-up call for the legal profession. The public simply doesn’t believe that law firms care much about diversity,” said Dan McGinn of McGinn and Company. “Expectations are rising in this arena and the legal profession needs to move from laggard to [leader](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/tech-industry-leaders-are-beginning-to-accept-the-diversity-challenge-u-s-law-partners-should-do-the-same/?rf=1).”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“One irony of this nation’s continuing struggle for diversity and gender equity in employment is that the profession leading the struggle has failed to set an example in its own workplaces,” [according](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2674201) to [Deborah L. Rhode](https://www.law.stanford.edu/profile/deborah-l-rhode), director of the Program in Law and Social Entrepreneurship at Stanford University. “In principle, the bar is deeply committed to equal opportunity and social justice. In practice, it lags behind other occupations in leveling the playing field.”

In the McGinn-Repass national diversity survey, 1,156 adult respondents rated eleven different industries — based on what they read or heard, or their own experience — on each industry’s respective efforts to attract and retain a diverse workforce. Based on these ratings, the industries were ranked by largest percent above average to lowest percent below average for perceived commitment to diversity. The final results were weighted based on gender, age, race and household income to be representative of the U.S. population.

Law firms came in dead last with a net-minus 1 score. Even with [#OscarSoWhite](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/what-do-the-oscars-and-the-legal-profession-have-in-common/), the [media](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/minorities-in-journalism/399461/) and [entertainment](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/92-of-biglaw-partners-are-white-is-this-problematic/) industries ranked significantly higher for perceived commitment to diversity than the [legal profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/for-most-law-students-will-the-value-of-a-law-degree-exceed-its-cost/). Noticeably absent from this list is the [technology industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-curious-case-of-ellen-pao-one-year-later/). Do you believe the legal profession has a better or worse public perception of commitment to diversity than the technology sector?

Without further ado, here are the rankings (with percentage from average indicated parenthetically):

On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to catch up with research expert Dan McGinn to discuss this survey. Here is an excerpt from our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): According to your survey, Americans see the legal profession as the least committed industry to diversity in the nation. How would you explain these results?

Dan McGinn (DM): The public simply doesn’t believe that law firms care much about diversity. Our experience is that people are pretty savvy. They see government, higher education, and the entertainment and hospitality industry as more receptive to hiring a diverse workforce.

RC: What surprised you the most about the respondents’ answers to your survey?

DM: There were two surprising results. On a positive note, more than 7 out of 10 people believe that workplaces with a diverse employee base will be more successful. On a troubling note, the public believes that recent protests such as the Black Lives Matter campaign and the protest around the Oscars will make it harder to achieve an improvement in race relations.

RC: From your perspective, what can law firms do to change the public’s perception of their inclusiveness and also affect real change in their cultures and environments?

DM: The first thing law firms should do is recognize that diversity is a priority issue with the public. Pressure on professional firms of all types to increase their commitment to diversity will rise rapidly in the years ahead.

RC: Why do you believe diversity and inclusion is important to an industry?

DM: I won’t make the social, moral argument. I think that is self-evident. And I won’t make the economic argument either. My view of the importance of diversity is more fundamental. The 21st Century is about the race for brainpower. It’s true for every organization, community and country. And brainpower isn’t determined by race, gender, sexual preference, ethnicity, or religious views. There is only strategy for winning the brain race — hire the smartest people. Period.

At the end of our conversation, McGinn reminded me that this survey is purely about perception. There is a public awareness and concern about how law firms are dealing with diversity and inclusion, according to McGinn. He further stated that the margin of error and time to deal with these issues appropriately is whittling down.

This public perception poll should make clear to us in the legal profession that diversity and inclusion are no longer just internal issues that we on the inside are struggling to address. There is a public perception that the [legal universe isn’t inclusive](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/for-most-law-students-will-the-value-of-a-law-degree-exceed-its-cost/). In this case, is the public’s perception our [reality](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/92-of-biglaw-partners-are-white-is-this-problematic/)?

I happen to believe there are a [number of law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2016/) that are beginning to proactively address these issues, but as an industry we could do more. Law firms must [substantively do more](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/4-thoughts-about-closing-the-diversity-gap-in-the-legal-profession/) and do a [better job](https://hbr.org/2015/10/firms-are-wasting-millions-recruiting-on-only-a-few-campuses?utm_source=Socialflow&utm_medium=Tweet&utm_campaign=Socialflow) of telling their story if they wish to [effectively address](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/5-takeaways-from-mckinseys-diversity-matters-report-for-the-legal-profession/) the [diversity crisis](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/3-things-law-firms-can-do-right-now-to-increase-diversity-in-the-legal-profession/) in our industry.

The time is more than ripe for us to [change the narrative](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/can-millennials-disrupt-the-biglaw-status-quo-bias-toward-diversity/).

[Renwei Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taichung/) is the DEI Columnist at [Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/author/renweichung/). He currently serves as a Board Advisor for [The Diversity Movement (TDM)](https://thediversitymovement.com/dei-navigator/), whose integrated approach enables law firms to build and strengthen culture by tying real-world business outcomes to DEI initiatives via a scalable subscription-based employee experience platform. And he is excited to host TDM’s and Footnote 4’s new podcast Charge the Wave — focused on entrepreneurs, executives, and icons who are assiduously building companies, cultures, and communities.

# Two Firms Opened Up The Bonus Coffers Right Before The Holiday
## The holidays were bright for associates at these firms.

After most of us took a break to begin the holiday festivities, we got news of a few more bonuses out there. And it turns out there’s some connective tissue among the firms we heard from. We’ve already talked about [AZA](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/aza-bonus-2021/) — the Texas-based boutique issuing its bonuses. But we’ve also heard from Haynes and Boone and Locke Lord about their matches.

Both firms handle bonuses individually, but it sounds like both staked their claim to play with the rest of Biglaw:

First, Haynes and Boone, which opts for a black-box structure:

Blackbox bonus structure, but seems like it was full match across the board. Full market bonus and special bonus. No bonus for billing above the 2000 hour threshold, which many find disappointing. Generally, associates seem happy that HB continues to match the standard market and special bonus amounts – but frustrating that things aren’t always clear in this “black box” model.

We couldn’t agree more when it comes to transparency.

Locke Lord may send out a memo eventually, but for now they’re handling via phone. The firm offered even more cash, catching up on Fall bonuses:

Some associates received the call today about bonuses and they are ecstatic to say the least. Included in the bonuses are a fall bonus, Covid bonus, and our regular bonuses. We did not know a fall bonus was coming. Many mid levels associates in the mid six figures. I got 30% more money than I was expecting if that gives you an idea. I’m very, very happy. Locke lord has always been a great place to work but this is above and beyond.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to Good2bSocial’s 2023 Social Law Firm Index, which Am Law 200 firm performs the best on Twitter (X)?

Hint: According to the firm’s Senior Marketing and Communications Manager, “We have launched X pages for select practice groups to give them the opportunity to enhance their reputations and achieve stronger client relationships by sharing targeted content. This has allowed us to develop best practices for our other platforms and to engage with followers that we do not see elsewhere. Our strategy changed after we experienced a surge in followers last year that led us to focus more on our firm page instead of practice group offshoots.”

# Another Biglaw Firm Admits It Overreacted To COVID-19, Will Partially Walk Back Salary Cuts
## Not a surprise that law firms were overly cautious in the face of uncertainty.

The trend of Biglaw firms pulling back from the height of their COVID-19 economic concerns continues. More and more, we’re seeing firms that decided to cut salaries when faced with the economic uncertainty of the pandemic change course, and re-institute at lease some of the cuts.

[Back in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/biglaw-firm-announces-up-to-20-percent-pay-cuts-to-avoid-layoffs/), Loeb & Loeb announced some salary cuts, as a way to avoid layoffs. Partners took the hardest hit, with draws slashed by 20 percent. Income partners, senior counsel, of counsel, associates, and senior staff had their salary cut by 15 percent and paralegals and other staff saw 10 percent cuts. But that’s changing.

Yesterday, firm chair Kenneth Florin announced via memo that “the impact of this pandemic on our business has not been as damaging as we had feared.” But that the firm is “very much aware that this pandemic is far from over and its overall impact not yet clear.” So, as a result, as [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/loeb-loeb-latest-law-firm-to-roll-back-pandemic-salary-cuts) Bloomberg Law, Loeb & Loeb will see a partial reversal of their salary cuts.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Effective September 1st, the cuts will be reduced by 60 percent for income partners, senior counsel, of counsel, associates, paralegals and staff. The reductions to the monthly capital partner draws will remain in place. Florin also said the firm plans to award their annual year-end bonuses.

Let’s hope it’s only a matter of time before full salaries are restored.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Professional Paralegals Deserve More Respect
## Professional paralegals can be extremely valuable to law firms, and more shops should respect and invest in professional paralegals.

Law firms typically take a few different approaches to how they treat paralegals. Some shops view paralegals as temporary, somewhat transitional employees, who will likely depart the firm after a certain period of time. Indeed, some prospective law students often take paralegals jobs to get legal experience before heading to law school, and others may wish to work as a paralegal for a year or two to see if they want to become attorneys. Moreover, there is an extremely inaccurate and unfair perception among some in the legal community that many paralegals are simply individuals who did not have the skill, time, or patience to become lawyers (which I always thought was weird, since many attorneys regret their own career choices!). However, some firms view paralegals as integral, long-term members of their team and invest time and resources to develop their paralegal staff. For a variety of reasons, professional paralegals can be extremely valuable to law firms, and more shops should respect and invest in professional paralegals.

Legal Knowledge

As many attorneys know from first-hand experience, professional paralegals often learn valuable information about the practice of law. This can be important to shops, especially if there is a high rate of attorney turnover at a firm. For instance, after leaving Biglaw, I landed at a “street law” shop at which I had to appear in court several times a week and understand the hands-on mechanics of litigation. As an associate in Biglaw, I basically just wrote memos and conducted legal research, and I did not learn any practical know-how about litigating cases.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Within my first week of working at this “street law” firm, I was given the simple task of drafting and filing a stipulation extending the time for us to oppose a summary judgment motion. I had absolutely no idea how to write such a document or how to file the stipulation with the court. However, the paralegal (and secretary) assigned to my team helped me draft the stipulation and told me what provisions needed to be included in this document. They then provided me with detailed instructions on when I needed to submit the document to the court, which courtroom I had to submit the document to (Room 130, of course, as my New York City colleagues would know!), and what I had to say to the clerk when I submitted the document. I relied on my paralegal (and secretary — I might have to do another article on how valuable legal secretaries can be!) heavily during my first few months at that “street law” firm before I learned the ropes of litigation, and that shop benefited greatly from the professional paralegals who were working there. Moreover, when I moved to a different firm that focused on a few mass torts matters, the paralegals provided invaluable advice on how procedures worked in those cases. Mass torts cases often develop their own rules and procedures, and professional paralegals can help attorneys stay on top of how issues are handled in those matters.

Client Relationships

Professional paralegals are also important because they can forge long-term and strong connections to in-house counterparts. If a paralegal leaves a firm after a year or two, it might be difficult for in-house professionals to forge connections with paralegals, which can influence a client’s decision to stay with a given firm. However, if paralegals stay at a firm for years, these connections are easier to make.

For instance, I once worked at a mass torts shop that handled a few large mass torts matters for several big clients. Even though the other associates and I rarely had contact with individuals who worked for our clients, the paralegals were in communication with in-house people all the time. Our paralegals would consistently send reports, notes, and other materials to in-house people and answer all kinds of questions. In addition, the paralegals were very familiar with the procedures that in-house professionals wanted us to use for billing and other administrative tasks. Since mass torts matters can take many years to be resolved, the paralegals at my firm were well-acquainted with some of the folks who worked for our clients. I am sure that this connection helped our firm retain these clients over the years because clients appreciate the relationships they had with professionals at our firm which would disappear if the clients went elsewhere.

Knowledge About A Firm

Professional paralegals are also valuable because they can develop a deep understanding about a firm and the people who work there. It might be difficult for new associates at a shop to ask other attorneys how they should approach specific situations or deal with certain people at a firm. However, paralegals that have a familiarity with practices and people at a firm can suggest to attorneys how they can handle a variety of situations. In addition, every law firm has different practices when it comes to billing, document management, organizing work product, and other matters. It can be a lot easier for newer attorneys to inquire about such practices of paralegals than other attorneys at a given shop, since associates often rely on other lawyers for work and may not want to bother senior attorneys about certain matters. The institutional memory of professional paralegals, and the fact that they are not part of the attorney “chain of command,” can help a law firm operate more efficiently.

All told, professional paralegals can be an invaluable resource for many law firms, but many shops do not invest too many resources in paralegals. Indeed, numerous firms do not pay paralegals bonuses, professional development expenses for paralegals, and other costs needed to train paralegals and ensure that they are long-time fixtures at a law firm. However, professional paralegals can not only help law firms provide the best possible legal services to clients but also assist attorneys in navigating administrative challenges.

# Ex-Biglaw Associate Gets Handsy With Colleague At Work Event, Gets Banned From Profession
## Yeah, you can't go around grabbing colleagues in a sexual manner without their consent.

A former Dentons corporate associate, Gordon Herd, has been banned from the profession in England and Wales. The disciplinary move comes after a September 2021 work event at a London bar.

There, it’s alleged, Herd touched the thighs and backside of a colleague, without her consent. As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/ex-dentons-lawyer-banned-law-rubbing-colleagues-thighs) Roll on Friday:

A female colleague complained that at the party he placed his leg between her legs and rubbed her thighs, then rubbed her back and bottom, and “stood so close to her that she felt uncomfortable”.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Dentons investigated the incident, but Herd resigned from the firm before action was taken. However, the firm reported what happened to the British regulators — the SRA — and the Law Society of Scotland, as a spokesperson confirmed:

“We take such incidents very seriously and are committed to providing a working environment free from harassment and ensuring that all staff are treated, and treat others, with dignity and respect. The Associate in question left the firm following an internal investigation and we reported the incident to both the SRA and the Law Society of Scotland”.

The SRA determined it is “undesirable for [Herd] to be involved in a legal practice” without prior approval. And Herd’s conduct “was serious because during a work event he repeatedly touched a female colleague in a sexual manner without her consent.” The regulatory body continued, “He was directly responsible for his own conduct which made his colleague feel vulnerable, uncomfortable and distressed.”

However, Herd remains on the Scottish Roll. A spokesperson for the Law Society of Scotland said they “cannot confirm or deny individual complaints cases.” But, “In any case where we have reason to believe that one of our members has not met the high professional standards expected of them we will take action.”

# Biglaw Firm To Offer Reduced Work Schedule -- With Reduced Pay, Of Course
## This shouldn't be a radical idea, but in Biglaw it is.

Biglaw firms are known for their demanding workload and, at times, unpredictable hours. Sure, they pay you an awful lot of money, but that doesn’t always make up for it — that’s why burnout and associate turnover are a perennial issue in the industry. For a bunch of attorneys, the Biglaw juice is not worth the squeeze, which begets a thriving lateral job market where so-called “lifestyle” firms are able to attract quality candidates at a lower sticker price by offering a more reasonable schedule.

But what if that deal — reduced hours for reduced compensation — was available at a major law firm? Slaughter and May is betting on the appeal of exactly that.

As [reported by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/12/slaughters-makes-reduced-hours-for-reduced-pay-permanent-option-for-lawyers/) Legal Cheek, the Magic Circle firm has had a pilot program since 2021 which allows its attorneys that flexibility:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The option, dubbed ‘Switch On/Off’, enables eligible associates to reduce to either a 0.9 or 0.8 full-time equivalent, with pay and holiday entitlement pro-rated accordingly. The firm has been trailing the system since early 2021.

Lawyers who take up the option will continue to work five days as week with non-working days taken in up to two pre-agreed blocks over a 12-month period. Associates remain on the scheme for a year.

After the success of the pilot program, the firm has decided to make the option a permanent one. As Slaughter and May chief people officer, Jonathan Clarke, said, “Following a successful trial period, we are delighted to introduce the Job Design Scheme as a permanent offering for our associates. The new working arrangement provides our lawyers with a different approach, which enables them to develop their careers and deliver value for our clients, whilst simultaneously having the time to pursue other interests and maintain a greater work-life balance.”

It’s great to see a major law firm thinking outside of the the bill, bill, bill mindset in an effort to keep talent.

# Women Lawyers: Slowly Chipping Away At The Glass Ceiling
## Kudos to the brave women lawyers who filed suit and are the instigators of change in the legal profession.

Employment discrimination and sexual harassment allegations have been making headlines for weeks now, and it’s about time. These are systemic issues that need to be addressed, a task that is far easier said than done. But the recent slew of allegations are just a start. Shedding light on the pervasiveness of the problem is the first step toward eradicating it.

Not surprisingly, the legal profession is not immune from gender discrimination and women lawyers often encounter it on the job. That women lawyers encounter discrimination is not surprising to me and shouldn’t be to anyone else. Nearly every woman attorney I’ve spoken to has faced gender discrimination at various stages of her legal career.

What is surprising, however, is [the spate of class-action lawsuits](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/another-biglaw-firm-gets-hit-with-a-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1) alleging gender discrimination that have been filed against large law firms in recent years. After learning of the latest lawsuit, I wondered: why now?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

And then last week I stumbled upon an [article from Time](http://time.com/5016735/when-women-reach-a-critical-mass-of-influence/) in my RSS feed. That article in conjunction with the recently released McKinsey and Company [2017 Women in Law Firms Report](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.womenintheworkplace.com_&d=DwMFaQ&c=4ZIZThykDLcoWk-GVjSLmy8-1Cr1I4FWIvbLFebwKgY&r=lXjgESBuysUrWr2JEWirSoc7rRneuGLg4D7dwWj7ORs&m=pqnqndg9DuUYmdabPxGywpo60re59eiBwZndiRBxWWU&s=CPRIeb1Qn7sI0crctpB9GONnk5Cv1hIrHaZ5r1tws0w&e=) answered that question for me.

According to the Time article, the recent tidal wave of sexual harassment and assault allegations across various industries and the law firm gender discrimination lawsuits are the result of increasing numbers of women in higher-level positions across professions. When the percentage of women in positions of power reaches “critical mass,” change begins to occur at an increasingly rapid pace:

If it seems like the structures that enable sexism are exploding, that’s because they scientifically are, according to the theory of critical mass. When women reached 20% in the Senate, they went after the Pentagon to reform the military’s sexual-assault protocol. When they reached 25% of Hollywood producers, they took down Harvey Weinstein and his casting-couch culture. And when they reached a third of the White House press corps, Fox’s Roger Ailes, NPR’s Michael Oreskes and other serial harassers in the media began to get called out. Somewhere in that zone, when women comprise 20% to 30% of an institution, things begin to change.

The results of the Report support this conclusion. Women lawyers have, in recent years, reached that “critical mass” in positions of power and leadership in law firms:

Women are relatively well represented at all three associate levels (junior, midlevel, and senior), where they account for about 46 percent of attorneys. However, this picture changes sharply as attorneys advance to more senior levels. Only 19 percent of equity partners are women, and women occupy only 25 percent of 2 Women in law executive-leadership positions (management committee and practice leadership).

That being said, although the numbers of women lawyers at higher levels of the legal industry may be reaching a level that induces change, the overall statistics regarding the advancement of women and minority lawyers remain depressingly abysmal. As shown in the chart below, white men still rule the roost:



Importantly, according to the Report, the majority of women lawyers surveyed were more likely than their male counterparts to believe that the playing field is uneven and as a result, they will be or have been denied the opportunity to advance because of their gender. The slower advancement was caused by number of different factors, all of which contributed to their predicament:

More than 60 percent of women surveyed think that their gender will limit their advancement opportunities; only 14 percent of men have such a concern (Exhibit 5). Women are considerably less likely than men to think that promotions and assignments at their firm are based on fair and objective criteria. The strength and depth of client relationships is perceived by female attorneys as the number-two factor in the partner-election decision (second only to profitability), and they believe they have fewer opportunities than male attorneys to network with clients (57 percent compared with 67 percent).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Also covered in the Report are the myriad of work/life balance issues encountered by women lawyers working their way up the ladder. As explained in the Report, firms have approached these issues in a variety of ways, but none have been particularly effective. This is because the gender diversity issue is typically viewed as one that is unique to women lawyers:

Until firms find ways to make diversity a firmwide issue, not a “women’s issue”—and an issue that galvanizes the partnership and demands accountability for progress—they
will likely struggle to translate programs and policies into results.

In other words, it’s unlikely that the solution to the gender diversity and discrimination issues faced by women will be solved internally. Enter the external solution: multiple employment discrimination lawsuits against Biglaw.

Those allegations and the end result of the lawsuits are what will likely bring about change. The pace of change may not be as rapid as we’d like, but it will be change nonetheless. So kudos to the brave women lawyers who filed suit and are the instigators of change. After decades of stagnancy, it will be a welcome change — and one that is long overdue.

# Most Lawyers Believe A Diverse And Inclusive Workforce Should Be A Priority
## But how well do they think their law firms are doing?
By [Vera Djordjevich](https://abovethelaw.com/author/vdjordjevich/)

Last month, we released the results of the [2023 Millennial Survey](https://info.abovethelaw.com/searching-for-balance-millennial-lawyers-perspectives-on-the-legal-industry), the latest in the series of biannual surveys we conduct together with Major, Lindsey & Africa.

A majority of the attorneys surveyed agree that a diverse and inclusive workforce should be a priority for law firms. However, they don’t necessarily agree on how far the industry has advanced in this regard, with some of the results exposing fault lines of gender and race/ethnicity.

For instance, 71% of respondents of color believe that law firm culture is inherently biased against diverse attorneys, compared to 55% of white attorneys. Almost 35% of attorneys of color do not believe their firm is dedicated to the training and development of minority attorneys, and less than half say their firm treats people of color and non-minority attorneys equally when it comes to staffing.



Similarly, nearly 84% of female respondents—but just 46% of men—believe that law firm culture is biased against women. In addition, 68% of women believe there is a persistent pay gap at law firms, compared to 29% of men. Men were more likely than women to report having strong access to meaningful work, while women were twice as likely as men to say their access to such work is either weak or nonexistent. In light of such feedback, it may not be surprising that fewer women than men envision themselves becoming partners at their firms.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Young Lawyers Should Use COVID-19's Biglaw Disruption To Their Advantage
## Maybe you should quit your law firm before your law firm quits you?

The pandemic has hastened many changes that were on their way in the legal industry. Law firm partners who once compared hours at the office are now embracing flexible work time, particularly as they witness rates of productivity outside of the office similar to those productivity rates at the office. Law firm owners are reevaluating whether the cost of overhead, such as the office lease, is necessary going forward, and they realize that profits may increase if they are willing to give up office real estate. Other law firm leaders are now forced to acknowledge that both male and female attorneys face challenges when they lack child care and, as employers, firms must permit greater flexibility or solve for the lack of child care in order to keep their lawyers billing.

These responses to the pandemic may create a more tolerable and flexible law firm work environment in the years to come. However, as cases continue to rise and plans to return to the workplace remain in flux, young lawyers should embrace this as a time to reflect on their career, the path they may be on, and the path they ultimately wish to pursue. Given the inevitable slowdown and resulting job losses, young lawyers would serve themselves and their colleagues well to proactively evaluate their careers and their firms sooner rather than later.

— words of wisdom from the Young Lawyer Editorial Board of the American Lawyer, where they encourage young lawyers to [reconsider their career paths](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/26/the-pandemic-gives-young-lawyers-a-chance-to-reconsider-their-career-path/) now that the coronavirus crisis has given them the unexpected chance to do so.

# Obsessed With Data: Catching Wild Butterflies
## Data has always existed within law firms but, like a wild butterfly, was unreachable. Now, law firms have harnessed the ability to capture the data.

In 1984, one hit wonder Animotion sang: “I will have you. Yes, I will have you. I will find a way, and I will have you. Like a butterfly, a wild butterfly, I will collect you and capture you. You are an obsession.”  That obsession may have been fleeting, but law firms’ new found obsession with data is likely to have staying power.  As the next generation of law firm leaders go to sleep at night thinking about flat and volatile demand, along with the growing need to focus on value, they are realizing that the treasure trove of value in all of the data they collect can help generate revenue without regard to billable hours and can enhance the value of lawyer time, including creating opportunities where billing for hours makes little sense, much to clients’ delight.

The data has always existed within law firms but, like a wild butterfly, was unreachable.  And no one thought to even try to catch it.   It was unstructured, uncatalogued and dispersed across a multitude of Windows Explorer file folders — possibly folders in some document management system, but to no avail.  Now, as the conversations around data analytics percolate and legal minds churn, we are hearing remarks like — “Wait a minute, I have thousands of documents with all of this data on…”  Pick a topic and law firms have extensive data on it — M&A deal terms, gender wage disparity, real estate loan origination.  The list goes on.

Think about a large M&A practice having negotiated hundreds of deals with parties represented by competing law firms.  Those documents contain the negotiating positions of those firms on a number of terms in the context of different industries, regions, and various other circumstances.  Extracting data from those documents and housing that data in a dynamic analytics platform like the one offered by Matterhorn Transactions[[1]](#f1) enables lawyers at several firms using the platform to come to the negotiating table with a real competitive edge.  The same platform is being utilized by law firms to keep track of data relating to court proceedings — in any given proceeding, who was the lawyer, who was the judge, what motion was filed on what argument, and what was the outcome.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We have, in prior columns, made reference to contract authoring tools like Thomson Reuters’s Contract Express and competing products such as Leaflet — products that automate much of the mundane work that goes into the production of contracts and litigation documents.  But we have not focused on the resulting structured data.  Yes, these tools enable lawyers to produce documents that are better, faster, and cheaper, but they also enable lawyers to automatically build a structured database containing the contents of those documents, which can be utilized for other value-added services or which can be sold for various purposes.  For example, a firm that generates all of a company’s executive employment agreements utilizing a contract authoring tool that automatically reposits each clause of the contract in its system ends up with a a database of key legal and commercial terms by region, department, class of employee, gender, among other things.  Other examples include: venture capital fund raising document negotiated terms which can signal a trend in the abundance or scarcity of capital in the VC market or changes in the terms surrounding venture investing, or bank loan document data which can provide early market signals regarding the variance in interest rates, availability of loans, and the level of development activity by region or industry.

Several law firms are already offering such content through subscription services to clients and prospective clients as a way to demonstrate depth of expertise beyond just being another group of smart lawyers.   Utilizing data to distribute unique perspectives or judgments on developments within a particular market or industry enables lawyers who adopt the tools to stand out from their peer firms, which often merely publish traditional notes about new law or precedent.  Demonstrating that they are market leaders that can offer market insights, and not just great lawyers, enables forward-thinking lawyers who use their data effectively to generate client wins and grow revenue.   Interestingly, as law firms continue to ponder alternatives to the billable hour and the value in their data, they are also starting to consider the notion of selling subscriptions to data-enhanced content rather than just using data as a marketing tool.

The traditional resellers of content (e.g., Thomson Reuters, Wolters Kluwer, Lexis, Bloomberg etc.) are taking note — they were once the only ones who knew how to catch butterflies.  And so, they thought only of one another as competition.   Those content resellers typically negotiated exclusivity arrangements in licensing agreements with content and tool providers limited only to their own circle of competitive content resellers.  More recently, however, these resellers have been insisting on exclusivity arrangements that preclude content and tool providers from enabling any law firm to publish data that may be competitive with these resellers’ offerings.  Clearly, the likes of Thomson Reuters, Wolters Kluwer, Lexis, and Bloomberg have come to appreciate that the law firms have figured out how to catch butterflies too.

# Furloughed Biglaw Associate Charged In Molotov Cocktail Attack Released On $250K Bond
## 'This is not the environment into which we want to release bomb-throwers,' a federal prosecutor said.

Peaceful protests and rioting and looting alike continue to take place across America in the wake of the officer-involved killing of George Floyd, with the president now threatening to bring in the military to enforce law and order. A furloughed Biglaw associate was charged for allegedly taking part in some of these violent crimes, and he had his first appearance in court yesterday.

Please note the update below.

[Colinford Mattis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinfordmattis/), 32, who was [furloughed in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/?rf=1) as part of Pryor Cashman’s austerity measures against the pandemic, stands accused of damaging a New York City Police Department vehicle with a Molotov cocktail during a Brooklyn protest. Mattis was allegedly behind the wheel of a van while his passenger, Urooj Rahman, 31, a 2019 graduate of Fordham University School of Law who’s been identified as a human rights lawyer, allegedly threw an incendiary device at an unoccupied NYPD vehicle.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
During his appearance at the Eastern District of New York, federal prosecutors argued that Mattis should be detained because he had “not demonstrated himself to be a rational person” during the attack, with an assistant U.S. attorney arguing that the “evidence against [Mattis and Rahman] is extremely strong and they are seeking relief back into the same community that is still suffering from the same tensions.” Amid all of the ongoing unrest, the prosecutor said, “This is not the environment into which we want to release bomb-throwers.”

Judge Margo Brodie, however, was not convinced, ordering Mattis’s release along with Rahman, countering that while “[t]he conduct was reckless, it was violent, it was completely lawless,” as attorneys, they both had stable lives prior to these alleged acts.

Brodie upheld U.S. Magistrate Judge Steven Gold’s ruling that Colinford Mattis … could be released to confinement in his Brooklyn home on a $250,000 bond. She denied prosecutors’ request for a one-day stay to allow them to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but spokesman John Marzulli of the U.S. Attorney’s Office confirmed they intend to appeal regardless.

At the time of publication, Pryor Cashman had no update on the status of Mattis’s employment with the firm. Please note the update below for more details.

# Morning Docket: 09.17.18
## * [Sexual misconduct allegations](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/the-details-behind-the-sexual-misconduct-allegations-against-brett-kavanaugh/) against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh were recently brought to light and while he may be spending his time ""hoping and praying"" before the vote, his supporters say it's highly likely he'll be confirmed anyway. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/no-rest-for-kavanaugh-as-he-awaits-confirmation-vote/)] * Well, except for the fact that senators are calling for the delay of Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote now that [his accuser has come forward](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-accuser-comes-forward/) to reveal the details of the judge’s alleged attack on her when they were students in high school. [[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/senators-call-delay-kavanaugh-confirmation-vote-after-woman-reveals-sexual-n910026)] * And was Judge Kavanaugh a member of Judge Alex Kozinski's sexually explicit ""Easy Rider Gag List""? Kavanaugh says he doesn't remember receiving any of those emails, but Heidi Bond, one of Kozinski's former law clerks, thinks that there could be a very easy way to find out if the would-be SCOTUS justice is lying. [[Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-kozinski-gag-list-emails-senate-hearings.html)] * The most controversial Biglaw firm? Federal prosecutors are considering bringing charges against former Skadden partner Greg Craig and taking action against the firm itself in a probe related to Paul Manafort. Will the prestigious Biglaw firm wind up with a civil settlement or a deferred prosecution agreement? [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/14/politics/greg-craig-foreign-agent-registration-investigation/index.html)] * Shearman & Sterling has announced that the firm will soon bring Sandra Bang, its first-ever chief diversity and talent strategy officer, into its C-suite. She'll be leading a new global task force aimed at increasing diversity at the Wall Street firm. Congratulations! Perhaps additional firms will follow their lead. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/09/14/shearman-sterling-aims-to-boost-diversity-with-new-c-suite-role/)] * The body of Brian Lewinstein, the rising second-year student at Berkeley Law who crossed a safety line and [fell while trying to get a picture of Toketee Falls](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/t14-law-school-mourns-the-presumed-death-of-a-student-after-he-fell-from-a-waterfall/) from above, has been found.

* [Sexual misconduct allegations](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/the-details-behind-the-sexual-misconduct-allegations-against-brett-kavanaugh/) against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh were recently brought to light and while he may be spending his time “hoping and praying” before the vote, his supporters say it’s highly likely he’ll be confirmed anyway. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/no-rest-for-kavanaugh-as-he-awaits-confirmation-vote/)]

* Well, except for the fact that senators are calling for the delay of Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote now that [his accuser has come forward](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-accuser-comes-forward/) to reveal the details of the judge’s alleged attack on her when they were students in high school.

* And was Judge Kavanaugh a member of Judge Alex Kozinski’s sexually explicit “Easy Rider Gag List”? Kavanaugh says he doesn’t remember receiving any of those emails, but Heidi Bond, one of Kozinski’s former law clerks, thinks that there could be a very easy way to find out if the would-be SCOTUS justice is lying. [[Slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-kozinski-gag-list-emails-senate-hearings.html)]


* The most controversial Biglaw firm? Federal prosecutors are considering bringing charges against former Skadden partner Greg Craig and taking action against the firm itself in a probe related to Paul Manafort. Will the prestigious Biglaw firm wind up with a civil settlement or a deferred prosecution agreement? [[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/14/politics/greg-craig-foreign-agent-registration-investigation/index.html)]

* Shearman & Sterling has announced that the firm will soon bring Sandra Bang, its first-ever chief diversity and talent strategy officer, into its C-suite. She’ll be leading a new global task force aimed at increasing diversity at the Wall Street firm. Congratulations! Perhaps additional firms will follow their lead.

We know it’s only been a few days, but at this point, it looks like [Willkie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/willkie-announces-fall-bonuses-blowing-off-cravath-followers/) is going to be the sole firm to blow off Cravath’s guidance. Which firm is pissing off its associates today?

That would be Ropes & Gray, a firm that landed at No. 13 in the 2020 Am Law 100 rankings, having brought in $1,903,616,000 in gross revenue in 2019. Sources tell us the firm has decided to politely pass on fall bonuses. Chair Julie Jones and managing partner David Djaha sent out a memo (available in full on the next page) just before 5 p.m. yesterday, leaving associates feeling quite discouraged:

Here’s one of the immediate reactions we received from an associate at the firm:

Predictable yet annoying. I’m on track to bill 2300 hours and crickets from the policy committee. It’s especially disheartening given how little support the firm has given its associates this year.

Eek. It sounds like the powers that be at Ropes & Gray should have given some additional thought to handing out these bonuses. At least the firm is committed to matching these bonuses in the future. Hold on, associates, because Ropes “remain[s] committed to being a market leader in compensation.”

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Ropes & Gray.)

# Quinn Emanuel Is Quick To Fall In Line With New Market Salaries
## It's 5 p.m. -- do you know where your salary announcement is?

Promptly at 5 p.m. Eastern (wouldn’t want to ruin a perfectly good work day with associate exuberance), Quinn Emanuel sent around an email to all U.S. associates that they too are among the lucky in elite Biglaw firms that will see their salaries rise this summer.

As you might expect, Quinn has fallen fully in line with the top of the market standard — or as my colleague Joe Patrice [calls it](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/sullivan-cromwell-matches-salaries-we-think/) “the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), as [amended with regard to bonus structure by Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/), as further modified [for senior associates in accordance with Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale.” If you don’t yet have that memorized — for shame! what kind of gunner are you? — here are the numbers Quinn announced today:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As we predicted, once Cravath threw its hat into the compensation ring the rest of the market — or at least those firms [doing well enough to afford it](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-billion-dollar-biglaw-firms-that-have-not-raised-associate-salaries/) — are having their come to Jesus moment, and ponying up the big bucks. (And the firm waited juuust long enough that they were able to[ come over the top — barely — of Selendy & Gay](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/selendy-gay-raise-associate-salaries-and-i-cant-wait-for-the-quinn-emanuel-response/), the firm created by two Quinn alumni earlier this year, much to [John Quinn’s chagrin](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/john-quinn-is-not-happy-about-selendy-gay-and-he-sent-the-angry-reply-all-to-prove-it/?rf=1).) It remains to be seen how salaries will shake out in [those firms outside the Am Law 50](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-am-law-200-is-out-what-does-it-tell-us-about-the-legal-landscape/) (excepting, of course, [select](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-first-firm-has-matched-the-new-milbank-scale/) elite [boutiques](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/first-firm-matches-the-new-and-improved-cravath-pay-scale/)).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”).

Walter Chet Little

[In November,](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/former-biglaw-partner-pleads-guilty-to-insider-trading-conspiracy/) former Foley & Larder partner Walter “Chet” Little pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring to commit insider trading as part of a [plea agreement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4196723-Walter-Little-Plea-Agreement.html) with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. Yesterday, Little was sentenced to 27 months in prison by Judge Katherine Polk Failla and must forfeit ~$453,000 in illicit proceeds .

Little’s legal troubles began while he was a partner at Foley & Lardner. In June 2016, the Biglaw firm opened an investigation after learning about his trading activity. Little now admits he accessed the firm’s document management system to find and trade on non-public information, though not related to matters he worked directly on.

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1015399/ex-foley-lardner-partner-gets-prison-for-insider-trading-) Law360, though Little’s attorneys argued for no jail time, the judge felt the ethics breach was too great for that to be an appropriate sentence:

While Little’s attorneys relied heavily on arguments that his misdiagnosed mental health problems and substance abuse issues were largely to blame for his reckless behavior, Judge Failla said they’re a basis for a variance from the approximately three- to four-year guideline range, but don’t warrant a nonincarceratory sentence as Little had requested.

“There were so many oaths that were broken when he committed this offense,” Judge Failla said, citing Little’s obligations to his clients, his old firm and the Florida Bar.

She also noted Little’s actions were “calculated, repeated and persistent.”

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey H. Berman was pleased with the judge’s sentence saying it “underscores the seriousness of insider trading, as Little will now serve serious time in prison.”

# Skadden's Awkward Product Placement

Who doesn’t love a good scam docuseries these days? They’re all the rage right now, and I’m here for them all — Inventing Anna, The Dropout, LuLaRich, Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal — whatever Netflix or Hulu or Apple+ will pump out. And, as you might imagine for a subsection of [the true crime genre](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/best-true-crime-documentaries/), lawyers often play[ a key role](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/the-real-biglaw-partner-in-inventing-anna/) in the cases and how those stories ultimately get told to the public.

That’s also true in WeCrashed, the story of the rise and fall of WeWork. The docuseries has A-list talent: Jared Leto stars as co-founder of WeWork, Adam Neumann, and Anne Hathaway portrays his wife, Rebekah Neumann. The stars certainly seem to have enjoyed their time filming.

While I’m not expert enough in Skadden’s conference room layout to suss out if the show was filmed in their office or if movie magic just makes it look that way, it’s no surprise the Biglaw firm is referenced. Skadden advised the company on a [number of matters](https://www.skadden.com/about/news-and-rankings/news/2017/08/wework-receives-4-4-billion-investment-from) and played a key role in the attempted [WeWork IPO](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/skadden-simpson-thacher-snag-roles-on-wework-ipo), and the eventual [SPAC deal](https://www.reuters.com/article/wework-ma-skadden/skadden-cooley-lead-on-wework-blank-check-merger-with-bowx-idUSL1N2LO1D5).

Still, I didn’t imagine writing about the guy from My So-Called Life and Biglaw giant Skadden Arps in the same sentence when I started this job, so… achievement unlocked?

# Coronavirus Adds Uncertainty To Biglaw's Plans For A Recession

The coronavirus exists outside of a natural economic downturn. We don’t know yet how it will effect our business but we’re watching it very closely.

— Reed Smith global managing partner Sandy Thomas [tells law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/02/28/coronavirus-election-jitters-have-law-firm-leaders-pondering-a-downturn/) that the rapidly spreading coronavirus is throwing a kink into Biglaw’s recession planning. And, yeah, that recession is coming. As Chase Simmons, tCEO and chairman of Polsinelli said, “Everyone always says old age does not kill an expansion or a bull market. But one of the reasons why we’re talking about there’s going to be a recession is it’s been so long. We also see our distressed practices were up this year. We had a lot of bankruptcy activity. We had a lot of loan enforcement activity. We saw that click up right at the same time we saw a ton of continued debt lending.”

# Jonathan Turley Is So, So Close To Figuring Out Free Speech... And Yet So, So Far Away
## The constitutional law dilettante laments USC canceling its graduation, but doesn't quite grasp the basic problem.

This morning, Turley took a break from sitting outside Fox News headquarters with his “Will say anything about Hunter Biden for food” sign to highlight the grave free speech concerns implicated by the University of Southern California’s recent decision to cancel its general commencement ceremony.

Or, more accurately, he botched the actual grave free speech concerns while offering up some vague pablum about the “mob.” But in this house, we believe in partial credit!

The sad situation at USC all started when the school realized that its valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, was both a Muslim woman and a minor in genocide studies, prompting the school to freak out that she might use the speech to address the war in Gaza. So the school first barred its valedictorian from speaking. When the decision to revoke Tabassum’s earned spot in the ceremony drew scrutiny as blatantly discriminatory, the school canceled its other invited speakers, testing its “it can’t be viewpoint discrimination if we cancel all the speakers, right?” defense. It’s a serious question for the school’s lawyers since, due to a quirk of California law, [the standards of the First Amendment fully applies to private universities](https://web.archive.org/web/20090430235943/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=edc&group=94001-95000&file=94367), robbing USC of a lot of the latitude private schools lean on when trying to squelch students. Finally, having whipped up general outrage over its botched handling of the event, the school nixed the whole ceremony.

Meaning the class of 2024 will end its college journey the same way it ended its time in high school as the class of 2020 — with graduation canceled at the last minute.

[From Turley](https://jonathanturley.org/2024/04/26/problem-solved-usc-cancels-graduation-to-avoid-pro-palestinian-protesters/):

The problem of violent protests and threats on campus is not solved by removing the potential victims. To yield this ground is to surrender control over not just the campus but the academic operations of the school. Higher education has to aspire to be more than a mere mobocracy where threats not logic prevail.

This is correct! Assuming he’s denouncing the school’s initial decision to cancel the valedictory speech. Predictably and unfortunately, Turley has no apparent qualms with that decision, focusing his disdain on the school’s decision to cancel the ceremony over fear of the “mob,” even though said mob wouldn’t be there if the school complied with longstanding custom and just let the woman speak in the first place.

Turley never uses the phrase heckler’s veto in the piece because, while he likes to toss it around a lot, [he doesn’t understand it](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/legal-experts-need-to-stop-deliberately-misleading-people-about-the-first-amendment/).

Which is a shame because USC’s treatment of Tabassum is what the heckler’s veto is all about. As a legal concept, the heckler’s veto is the situation where authorities stop a speaker, citing the risk that the speaker will incite some sort of dangerous response. This is a First Amendment violation because governments can’t use hypothetical third parties as a shield to engage in prior restraint.

By contrast, Turley and his fellow travelers deploy the phrase to mean “people heckling a speaker.” The rhetorical trick is to expand the narrow legal concept of the “heckler’s veto” — which is a constitutional violation — to cover “protesting a speaker” — which is not a constitutional violation — in the hopes that blurring the lines will carry the constitutional baggage of the former onto the latter.

Turley gets so very close to describing the contours of a heckler’s veto but he just can’t get there because he’s hung up on his priors:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The University of Southern California (USC) is under fire this week after announcing that it had a solution to the possible pro-Palestinian protests at the graduation: it cancelled the graduation. It is both enabling and irresponsible. Rather than protect students and their families at this important and well-earned event in their lives, the university is yielding to the mob. It is a feckless and feeble response to what should have been an easy decision for any administrator.

It’s not “yielding to the mob” when there aren’t any actual or necessarily even credible threats. “Protect[ing] students and their families” sounds ominous except we’re talking about a hypothetical risk that some students start picketing the event, which is about as threatening as USC’s defense under Lincoln Riley.

Which, unintentionally, provides an even better distillation of the heckler’s veto in action. Because the heckler’s veto in practice was not, generally speaking, a response to any actual threat of anti-speaker violence as much as the government citing flimsy “safety” concerns to justify prior restraint. White Southern sheriffs weren’t really worried that the Klan members — who they almost certainly hung out with on Wednesday nights — were going to engage in mass violence. But they thought by saying they were worried about the racists they could shut down civil rights events without drawing the ire of the courts.

You’d think Turley would remember this disgraceful tactic of the civil rights era, but he [literally didn’t remember that crooked cops used to arrest Martin Luther King Jr.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/remember-when-martin-luther-king-was-arrested-because-jonathan-turley-sure-doesnt/) or [who was vice president in 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/jonathan-turley-forgets-joe-biden-2018/), so maybe we shouldn’t rely on his grasp of history.

It’s a sham intended to skirt free speech obligations. It’s a school banning a speaker, citing the vague trouble her words might trigger from the audience, and then later canceling the whole event over fears that a protest might break out.

So when USC’s Provost tried to shrug off the decision to silence the valedictorian by saying the decision “[was aimed at protecting campus security and ‘had nothing to do with free speech,’](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-04-25/usc-cancels-main-commencement-citing-safety-measures)” he joined a long and ignominious tradition of bad faith actors using “security” to enforce decisions that have everything to do with free speech.

A tradition that Turley either doesn’t understand or just doesn’t want you to understand.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Summer Bonuses Are Officially Here!

Last year, amid the 2018 associate salary wars, Simpson Thacher & Barlett introduced [special summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/) in a bid not to be outdone by the competition. Ever since, associates have wondered if summer bonuses would be making a return. Wonder no more, because it seems like at least one firm has decided to start the trend before summer has even started.

Which firm could possibly be so generous?

Sources tell us that [Miller Barondess](https://www.millerbarondess.com/), a Los Angeles litigation boutique, announced summer bonuses on Friday. So, just how big of bonuses are we talking about? We’re hearing that everyone received $15,000, regardless of class year. Congratulations!

Is your firm thinking about awarding summer bonuses to associates this year? Please let us know. We’re hearing rumors that Simpson Thacher is considering doling out summer cash again this year, and that firm paid up to $25,000 in bonus bucks.

Remember: If and when your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Early Morning Biglaw Raises Are The Only Way To Start Your Friday
## But not everyone at the firm is getting the same treatment.

Nothing good ever happens when you get an early morning buzz from your work email. It’s either spam or a cause for concern — some terrible turn on that deal or an irate client that needs immediate attention. But Biglaw associates at one firm got a pleasant surprise this morning from a pre- 8 a.m. work email — a raise announcement!

Gibson Dunn — one of the few Am Law Top 25 firms by profitability (and boasting an impressive $1,642,585,000 in gross revenue) who hadn’t yet increased associate salaries — has finally gotten on board with the new top of the market standard set by a trio of Biglaw firms that we are unoriginally referring to the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale.

This means, of course, that associates will be getting a raise ranging from $10,000 to $25,000, depending on class year. Plus there are those delightful special bonuses that will brighten up any associate’s bank account in the range of $5,000 to $25,000, again, depending on seniority — but not every office is being treated the same.

See, how you actually get the bonuses depends on where you work. The New York office — all associates and of counsel — received a version of the announcement that just says associates need to be in good standing at the firm on July 6th (the payment date) to get their bonus. A different email went out to Dallas, DC, Denver, Houston, LA, and Orange County, all associates and of counsel as well as to San Fran and Palo Alto of counsel that sets a billing requirement of 1950 hours, annualized through June 30th, to receive the special bonus. Associates that don’t hit that target will have the opportunity to make up the hours by year end to get the special bonus.

A tipster (not based in New York) said they weren’t surprised the Big Apple was getting more generous treatment:

That office burns through associates like kindling.

Another (non-NYC) tipster noted that New York never has an hours requirement for bonuses, so this decision is in line with past practices. But that doesn’t mean folks aren’t salty about it:

Must be nice to be the favorite child.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Biglaw Firm Announces Mass Buyouts, Almost 200 Affected
## Which firm could it be?

It’s the first quarter of the new year, and rather than conduct outright layoffs, one global Biglaw firm has chosen a gentler way to oust up to 180 employees who are no longer considered as “efficient.”

Which firm could it be?

As part of a plan that began in October and is expected to conclude by the end of this month, [Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/freshfields-bruckhaus-deringer/) has offered voluntary buyouts to all of its secretarial staff (employees who are referred to as personal assistants in England) at its headquarters in London. Like many Biglaw firms, Freshfields opened a legal operations center last year to house its back-office functions, and these cuts serve to reduce headcount prior to the vast majority of these secretarial jobs being moved to Manchester, England.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Here’s some additional information on the buyout program from [Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/01/09/freshfields-offers-voluntary-redundancy-to-180-london-secretaries/?slreturn=20170011135152):

All of the firm’s PAs in London have been offered a choice to either: take voluntary redundancy; apply to be considered for an executive assistant (EA) role that comes with more money and responsibility; or stay in their current roles. …

The terms of the voluntary severance package on offer are not known.

We wish all of the legal professionals and affected individuals at Freshfields the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Merrick Garland Asked To Put A Stop To Biglaw Revolving Door... He Won't.

It’s a shame that the Merrick Garland confirmation hearings will be remembered for John Cornyn asking about the barely remembered Trump pee tape dossier and Mike Lee trying to school the Jewish federal judge on what anti-semitism really means, because there are some important issues facing the Department of Justice that the performative politics sideshow will overshadow. Maybe this is all a masterstroke by Biden. Any serious criticism of Neera Tanden’s OMB nomination has fallen aside as folks galvanize around the insanity that the people who voted to acquit Donald Trump weeks ago are incensed by mean Tweets all of a sudden. That one may not work out in the end, but if the administration’s whole goal is to quash substantive dissent by letting hearings get overtaken by scurrilous nonsense, it appears to be working.

Unfortunately, the Department of Justice should face a reckoning when it comes to the ongoing revolving door between Biglaw and the upper echelons of leadership. Biden’s initial leadership picks — Judge Garland, Kristen Clarke, and Vanita Gupta — all come to their new posts from outside the corporate legal superstructure. But they’re seemingly the exceptions rather than the rule.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

A coalition of 37 racial, worker, environmental, and social justice organizations has [sent a letter to Garland](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/merrick-garland-asked-to-put-a-stop-to-biglaw-revolving-door-he-wont/2/) calling on him to reject “Filling the Department with corporate lawyers who profited defending powerful industries puts the fox in charge of the hen house — or at least the counsel who won the fox’s business over dozens of other attorneys.”

“If you’re a multimillionaire because you help corporations and corporate executives evade or violate the law, you should not be in charge of enforcing the law,” said Revolving Door Project Executive Director Jeff Hauser. “Lawyers at BigLaw firms, especially those with ‘government affairs’ practices, spend all day working to weaken and hamstring enforcement of white-collar criminal law, environmental law, antitrust law, and anything else which gets in the way of the biggest businesses’ bottom lines. These lawyers use tours through the Justice Department to refresh their insider knowledge, then take those insights back to corporate clients who want to dodge basic democratic accountability. It was an unacceptable practice when perpetrated under Trump, and it should have no place in the Biden administration.”

Reportedly, Garland had planned to hand leadership over antitrust efforts to a Susan Davies, who already defended Facebook against antitrust allegations. Garland said that’s not the case, but noted that, “Fortunately or unfortunately, the best antitrust lawyers in the country have some involvement” [with the tech giants most deserving of antitrust inquiry](https://prospect.org/cabinet-watch/corporate-lawyers-line-up-for-justice-department-top-slots/).

On the one hand, I’m a believer in the [old Vulcan proverb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_gwnFSFzv0) that “only Nixon could go to China” and its American legal corollary “only Joe Kennedy could make the SEC.” Putting the notorious stock market speculator in charge of writing and enforcing the rules reined in post-crash Wall Street. At a certain point, there’s expertise that can only be earned by sitting on the other side of the table.

In the reverse, lawyers exiting government service can and do use their experience to help clients skirt the system, but that’s hardly universal. I worked under a former SEC General Counsel and can vouch for the fact that his advocacy was always grounded in advising clients to do what the SEC rules expected rather than seeking out some sort of advantage. And getting it right the first time so they never had to find themselves on the wrong end of an enforcement action was the whole reason to hire him.

On the other hand, especially in enforcement roles, the temptation to pull punches to maintain employability on the back end is far too high. It’s an appearance of impropriety issue. Add in the smoothing of zeal that comes from recruiting from the ranks of people who built relationships with those they’re asked to regulate over the course of decades and there’s more than enough reason to impose a moratorium of Biglaw hiring at senior positions. As the letter states:

Rather than empower conflicted BigLaw attorneys, we urge you to instead appoint attorneys with a longstanding and consistent commitment to carrying out the missions of the divisions they will run. Public defenders running the criminal division, environmental lawyers leading the environment and natural resources division, plaintiffs attorneys running the antitrust division, and so on will produce more equitable outcomes. Alternative career paths which take attorneys outside of the fancified halls of corporate law firms better prepare them for the actual work of representing the federal government, and are statistically more likely to bring sorely-needed diversity to the Department’s halls. A Department which looks like America, including coming from life experiences similar to those of most Americans, is more likely to earn the trust of America.

Ethical rules that block people from taking clients averse to their government positions for a period of time are all well and good but they’re easily skirted and hardly long enough. Frankly, it would be ideal if we could have a shadow government structure where Biglaw attorneys interested in a post with a future administration have to depart their private sector job for a period of time before being eligible for a government position. It’s not that every private sector lawyer is corrupt, it’s that we can all do better when it comes to something as important as the Department of Justice.

But instead we’ll deal with Tucker Carlson yelling about Merrick Garland and Russiagate and just keep the revolving door twirling.

# Reed Smith Merger Talks Fuel Discontent At Firm
## There has been lots of criticism about the way Reed Smith handled this potential merger.

If the powers that be at Reed Smith were hoping a [potential merger with Pepper Hamilton](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/can-a-merger-move-improve-morale-at-reed-smith/) would be greeted with excitement and as a course change, a cure for the low morale [attorney layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/nationwide-layoff-watch-biglaw-firm-cuts-headcount-attorneys-among-the-victims/) and [lateral losses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/more-shakeups-at-reed-smith/) they’ve experienced earlier this year, it seems they were mistaken. The response from tipsters embedded at Reed Smith has not been positive.

We got word from a partner there criticizing the way the powers that be handled the news of the merger:

I work at Reed Smith and was embarrassed to hear this news for the first time today from a friend at another firm. I looked foolish having no idea what he was talking about as he pulled up his phone to show me the [Law360 article](http://www.law360.com/articles/783387/reed-smith-and-pepper-hamilton-discussing-a-merger). I know it’s early stage, but a heads up at our partner retreat two weeks ago would have been nice.

I cannot imagine the partnership was excited to learn about the merger from sources outside of their firm. I guess this partner knows now how little Reed Smith thinks of them.

The discontent over the merger is not contained to a single office either. We’ve had reports from multiple Reed Smith locations, and it isn’t going over well anywhere. One source reports:

So far the merger has led to bickering in the hallway. Morale has taken another nosedive.

The lack of substantive information from leadership at the firm has led to rampant speculation from the rank and file:

I mean the partners are happy cuz they can avoid bringing in business again, just buy someone else’s. The associates are just like great, dust résumé off.

Dusting off your résumé is not a terrible idea. Many, including the [Legal Intelligencer](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/home/id=1202754914028/Will-Reed-SmithPepper-Hamilton-Merger-Leave-Some-Behind), have surmised there may not be room for everyone at a combined firm:

And in a time when firms are looking to deal with overcapacity issues, as evidenced by Reed Smith’s layoffs earlier this year of 45 lawyers, the merger may be a vehicle for both firms to cut underutilized partners under the guise of them not fitting into a combined firm’s strategic vision, one ­person familiar with both firms said.

While people are [busy worrying](http://lawandmore.typepad.com/law_and_more/2016/04/reed-smith-merger-no-way-to-improve-morale-productivity-could-be-off-at-pepper-hamilton-too.html) about whether or not they even have a job, they aren’t out there, billing their best selves.

# How Biglaw Firms Can Think Like A Startup
## Small, scrappy spinoff companies might help save Biglaw.

Is it possible that the way we drag Biglaw into the modern age is as simple as swapping our suits and ties for hoodies and sneakers?

The legal industry is about as stodgy as it gets. We’re mahogany desks, marble floors, precedent, tradition, and all the things that scrappy Silicon Valley startups aren’t. Because of Biglaw’s approach, it’s not law firms that have been blazing the trails of the legal industry for the past generation. If you want to find new, creative paths forward, you’re not likely to get there by sitting in a corner office leafing through briefs. You’re better off hacking together solutions in a garage, breaking things and putting them back together, experimenting, iterating, and failing all day until you start to fail a little less, and maybe even succeed.

Of all the things preventing law firms from being innovative and experimental, one of the chief impediments is the weight of this tradition and precedent. The classic law firm model discourages innovation, long-term thinking, or risky experimentation. That’s why the biggest drivers of legal industry change are generally not law firms but rather legal tech companies and alternative legal service providers.

Doing It Differently

It used to be that if someone in a law firm was talking about a spinoff, they were probably discussing “Frasier” or whatever new “CSI” is debuting this week. But clever firms have been leveraging the possibilities of spinning off entities outside the traditional law firm structure for years now, with exciting results. Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner formed [Lawyers On Demand](https://www.lodlaw.com/) (LOD), a flexible attorney staffing solution, all the way back in 2007. More recently, Silicon Valley giant Wilson Sonsini formed [SixFifty](https://www.sixfifty.com/), a spinoff entity focused on legal document automation. Plenty of other experimental startups are being formed under the umbrella of large law firms, and the benefits are easy to understand.

By organizing as a standard business rather than a law firm, legal spinoffs grant themselves significantly more flexibility than firms enjoy. Just the change of expectations that comes from no longer thinking like a law firm can be monumental. Firms need to have clients, make money, and be successful today to attract talent. But a spinoff entity can afford to adopt that hungry startup mindset. It can take big swings, make mistakes, pivot, and generally spend time finding itself and figuring out new ways to do things. It can be agile and flexible in ways that large institutions like law firms often cannot. Spinoffs have the room to experiment that’s needed to do something innovative just by virtue of not being a law firm.

Equity Changes Everything

Spinoff entities also have game-changing flexibility when it comes to equity. If the spinoff entity is not engaged in the direct practice of law, it’s likely not subject to the same fee-sharing prohibitions as law firms. This means the spinoff entity can offer equity to specialized nonattorney business professionals to run their operations. This can give spinoffs a more diverse and talented pool of management to draw from, and it avoids the problem of firm management also having to maintain their book of business. It’s always going to be an advantage to have better, more-focused management.

Spinoff entities can also get creative with [permanent equity](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/is-the-problem-with-partnerships-the-partnership/) in ways that most firms can’t structurally afford to. Most partnerships cash out at year end, and when an attorney stops working, they stop getting paid. That incentivizes making money today over investing in a firm’s future. After all, what partner wants to pay for benefits they might never enjoy? But a spinoff entity can issue shares of itself to the members of the partnership that fund its initial startup, and those shares can last in perpetuity. The promise of a stream of payments that doesn’t dry up upon retirement is an enticing one.

Spinoff entities offer the possibility of an exit strategy that usually don’t exist in the legal world. If the spinoff succeeds, its owners may be able to sell it on the open market, as happened in 2018 when Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner [sold its stake in LOD](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2018/05/30/bclp-sells-entire-stake-in-lod-as-flexible-lawyer-spin-off-gets-new-majority-shareholder/).

Failure Needs To Be A Possibility

If nothing else, spinoffs are a vehicle for experimentation and limited risk. When a firm wants to experiment and try a new practice, it could be putting the proceeds of its stable, traditional practices at risk. Spinoff entities allow firms to compartmentalize that risk while simultaneously granting themselves the flexibility to try new, untested ideas. Spinoffs allow a freedom to fail that simply doesn’t exist in traditional law firms. And without the freedom to fail, there’s rarely a chance for breakaway, industry-changing success.

The legal industry is in the process of modernizing — trying to catch up with a business world that’s increasingly leaving it behind. Part of that change with how law firms run is the freedom not to run our businesses like law firms at all. Spinoff entities aren’t the solution to all our industry’s problems, but they may be a piece of that larger puzzle. The more ways we give ourselves the room to get messy, try new things, and even fail, the more we’ll ultimately succeed.

# The Biglaw Firm Where Associates Are Putting In The Most Working Hours
## If you want a huge paycheck, you better be prepared to spend a huge amount of time at the office.

According to a new survey conducted by Legal Cheek, associates in the London offices of U.S.-based Biglaw firms are working themselves to the bone, regularly averaging 12-hour days. At which white-shoe firm do associates have the longest workdays?

Hint: If you’re expecting to receive a year-end bonus that will “shatter the market,” you’d better be prepared to work hours that will shatter any concept of work-life balance.

See the answer on the next page.

# Biglaw Partner Allegedly Sexually Assaulted By Another Biglaw Partner During Firm Retreat

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we have a story from a Biglaw partner who is coming forward with her account about a sexual assault that was allegedly committed against her by another partner at the firm. She was inspired to do so by the women who chose to tell the world about their experiences with Brett Kavanaugh. This was taken from her public posting on Facebook that was sent to us by a reader. We’ve reached out to the firm in question for comment, and will publish an update here if we receive a response.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Over a decade ago, at a law firm “retreat” which was in Pittsburgh that year, a man — my partner at [an Am Law top 50 firm], someone I considered a friend — took advantage of the fact that we both were in an unpopulated part of the hotel. I was coming back from the ladies room when I happened across him. He was drunk. He pushed me into a conference room, threw me face first onto the conference room table, and ripped open the top of my dress. I was really scared. I reminded him that he had met my father. I only escaped that situation without much worse happening because more people happened to walk by outside. My then-husband, also then a partner of the law firm, was livid and wanted to call the police. Most definitely I had been seriously assaulted. I told him we weren’t doing that. Why? Because I managed to escape the worst and I didn’t want to ruin his life – he has children and I thought about that too.

Several years later when the same man was inappropriate with me at another retreat in Arizona, I told my friend. She was then the managing partner’s assistant and felt compelled to inform management about it, and the earlier event, which I also told her about.

What did the firm do?

They sent the guy UNACCOMPANIED to my office to apologize. Utterly ridiculous.

A couple years later, the firm’s then-general counsel, now managing partner, watched, and neither said nor did anything, as a member of the management committee openly groped me at a social event.

I don’t know whether Kavanaugh assaulted anyone. But we cannot live in a country where women are afraid to tell people they have been assaulted, even if time has passed.

# World's Largest Law Firm Conducts Layoffs
## We wish all affected individuals at the firm the best of luck.

As more law firms begin to open international back-office business hubs, it’s come to be expected that layoffs would soon follow. Earlier this fall, for example, DLA Piper announced that it would be conducting one of the largest mass layoffs since the Great Lathaming of 2009, [slashing about 180 business support roles](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/biglaw-firm-announces-mass-layoffs-almost-200-left-jobless/) in the United Kingdom in order to shift jobs to its new back-office hub in Poland.

Yet another Biglaw firm — the biggest one of them all, actually — opened a business center in Warsaw this week, and just like DLA Piper before it, the firm expects to cut business support roles in the U.K. to transition job functions to its Poland outpost, which has about 70 staff members working there in business development, marketing, human resources, and IT functions. Which firm could it be?

It’s Dentons, the 7,500-lawyer Biglaw behemoth, and the firm is so large that the number of layoffs accounts for but a fractional percentage of its overall footprint on this earth in terms of support roles. Here’s more information from [Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2016/11/21/dentons-to-cut-25-uk-roles-as-warsaw-support-centre-opens-doors/?slreturn=20161022100139):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Dentons is cutting approximately 25 UK jobs after a business services consultation prompted by the launch of a new shared services centre in Warsaw, which opened this week. …

When the consultation was announced this May, it was thought that a greater number of jobs would be lost. However, in a statement the firm said: “While initial proposals indicated that around 50 roles could be affected, the final outcome is anticipated to be approximately half this number.”

We wish all of the legal professionals and affected individuals at Dentons the best of luck while they seek new job opportunities in the legal industry and beyond.

If your firm or organization is closing its doors or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# The People Who Are Being Left Out Of Biglaw's Wellness Initiatives
## These resources should be available for everyone at a law firm -- not just the lawyers.

The topic of mental health and substance abuse in the legal industry is getting some much-needed light…. However, in an industry where the professional staff are still often referred to as “non-lawyers” or simply “staff,” it should not be a surprise that the professional staff are often left out of this growing movement, nor should it be that they have fewer resources available to them from the law firms when it comes to mental health and substance abuse.

— [Erin Hichman](https://www.law.com/author/profile/Erin%20Hichman/), a senior analyst with ALM Legal Intelligence, commenting on the lack of wellness initiatives, resources, and support that are [targeted toward law firm staff members](https://www.law.com/2018/10/11/when-it-comes-to-mental-health-and-substance-abuse-support-in-legal-what-about-the-staff/). As [Kathleen Pearson](https://www.pillsburylaw.com/en/lawyers/kathleen-pearson.html), Chief Human Resources Officer at Pillsbury notes, “regardless of a person’s particular role, they are inevitably going to experience some stress, whether professional or personal.” Hichman offers advice from industry experts on the steps law firm leaders should take to make sure their firm is a “more pleasant working environment for all.”

# It's Time For All Vacations To Be Billable And Bonus Eligible
## This is necessary for attorney mental health. Take action!

Imagine a world where you don’t have to worry about billing while on vacation.

Attorneys are spending much more time with a bunch of things at home. There’s not a corresponding decrease in professional responsibilities. That’s a mathematical formula for disaster. You can give people thousands of vacation hours a year. But if you don’t want to decrease billable hours, then nobody will take it.

— Jarrett Green, a wellness consultant and former Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom attorney, commenting on the [negative role that billable hour targets play](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/04/27/law-firms-seek-to-address-the-root-cause-of-burnout-time/) on attorney mental health in the legal industry. As [first reported](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/top-50-biglaw-firm-rolls-out-incredible-bonus-eligible-time-off-policy/) here at Above the Law, some firms, like Orrick, are taking action on this front, and have added 40 billable, bonus-eligible vacation hours to attorneys’ schedules.

# Struggling To Retain Associates? ALSPs May Be A Non-Obvious Secret Weapon.
## Don't overlook the importance of good, career-advancing work.

Law firm business is booming and the frenzied tussle for associates — particularly transactional talent — already brought us a few rounds of special bonuses and a still raging raise cycle. But as much as firms can sway associates with money to pay down their lifetime debt load, at a certain point firms might need to think outside of the compensation box.

Again, there’s [no substitute for salary](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/attracting-top-associates-without-raises-and-other-total-myths/) when trying to pry someone away from their current employer, but keeping someone inside the tent is a little different. This is where some well-crafted perks — like an office policy that embraces the remote working model that we all saw succeed in 2020 — might make a difference.

But another weapon available to firms might not even be on their radar: ALSPs.

Speaking with Ed Sohn from [Factor](https://www.factor.law/) recently, he described what the “scale up” — it can hardly be a start up having grown out of Axiom — is doing with [Legal Transaction Optimization](https://www.factor.law/solutions/legal-transaction-optimization) and while its primary advantages come in the form of high-quality work product at reasonable cost, the implication for associate retention stood out as a powerful fringe benefit.

As the name suggests, Legal Transaction Optimization aims to make the transactional workflow more efficient. Specifically, Factor provides value through slicing off the perfunctory work currently performed by first- and second-year associates, reducing costs without reducing rates.

By unbundling transactional tasks from legal advice, law firm juniors billing at high rates are replaced with tech-enabled teams specialized in producing better output. Unbundling means law firms win more advisory work and clients get better value.

Handing this work to junior associates does little for the firm that’s writing it all down anyway or for the associate’s sense of career development and general quality of life. Move those tasks to cheaper options and allow junior associates to actually enjoy their work.

Because drudgery isn’t inevitable. Sohn shared an anecdote from a senior Biglaw partner he’d worked with who told him that back in his day, every deal was leanly staffed and juniors weren’t spending weeks doing administrative work. In a sense, slicing that work off isn’t a radical new direction for the industry, it’s returning the practice to normal.

All else equal, get associates good work and they’re not going to want to leave. Get associates good work by handing off the stuff that isn’t advancing their careers to a more efficient provider.

# Juries Are About To Get A Lot More Corporate-Friendly Thanks To COVID
## Jury pools are likely to get a lot more corporate-friendly in the short-term.

When the courts reopen and begin tackling their backlog of cases, the juries they manage to assemble are going to look a lot different. In a recent survey, nearly half said that they would not comply with a jury summons in the immediate aftermath of COVID. And while that may not be surprising, it turns out that there are some stark philosophical differences between those who would and would not comply.

Every week on our special ATL COVID Cast, we’re chatting with folks coming to the legal profession from different angles to reveal the unexpected ways the pandemic is changing the industry.

This week, we talked to [Tom O’Toole](http://www.soundjuryconsulting.com/Consultants.html#Tom), the president of [Sound Jury Consulting](http://www.soundjuryconsulting.com/) about a survey the company conducted of 1,000 jury-eligible respondents about the post-lockdown jury pool and the results suggest a palpable impact on civil litigation in the near-term. It turns out that the 45 percent of respondents who said they wouldn’t join a jury in the near-term were significantly more likely to believe that large corporations put profits over safety (86 percent v. 65 percent) and significantly more likely to believe large corporations are more likely to break the law than smaller businesses (78 percent v. 58 percent).

# Above The Law’s 11th Annual Holiday Card Contest

It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Thanks to a bonanza of bonus news, the holiday season is off to a great start. Milbank was very merry this year, stuffing associates’ stockings with [good cheer and wads of cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/). The law firm holiday parties are about to start kicking into gear, but the parties and paychecks pale in comparison to what’s about to get underway: Above the Law’s eleventh annual holiday card contest. We’ve already received several emails asking about when this year’s contest would start. The answer: It starts today.

We are a legal website, so of course there are some rules to follow:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
1. Because we are committed to the environment here at [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/), we will consider ONLY E-CARDS. You can certainly send us paper holiday cards via snail mail — our address is Above the Law / Breaking Media, 611 Broadway, Suite 907D, New York, NY 10012 — but they won’t be considered for this contest.

2. To submit an e-card, please email either a link to the card or the card itself (as an attachment) — but note that WE PREFER LINKS, if available — to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest), subject line: “Holiday Card Contest.” The subject line is very important because it’s how we will comb through our inbox to collect the entries when picking finalists. If you don’t use the correct subject line, expect a lump of coal in your stocking.

3. Please limit submissions to holiday / Christmas cards that you view as WORTHY CONTENDERS. We’re looking for cards that are unusually clever, funny, or cool; we’re not interested in cards that are safe or boring (e.g., a beautiful winter landscape, a “Happy Holidays 2019,” and the law firm name). We’re seeking cards with some attitude, with that extra je ne sais quoi. If you send us a banal card, don’t be surprised if we [make fun of it](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/atl-holiday-card-contest-honorable-and-dishonorable-mentions/).

4. In your email, please include a BRIEF EXPLANATION of why this card is compelling — an explanation that we MIGHT QUOTE FROM if your nominee makes the finals (if you want to be anonymous, let us know). If you can’t offer an explanation, please rethink whether the card is a worthy contender (see rule #3, supra).

5. The deadline for submissions is about two weeks from today: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, at 11:59 p.m. (New York time). No exceptions. If you’re reading this post after the deadline, then you don’t read Above the Law frequently enough.

We look forward to [your submissions](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest). Thank you, and happy holidays!

# Am Law 50 Firm Nearing Merger?
## Will the mergers never end?

While we’ve written a good deal about the looming [Allen & Overy and O’Melveny tie-up](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/the-allen-omelvery-merger-seems-to-be-gaining-steam/), but that might not be the only high-profile merger in the offing.

A tipster reports that a certain global Am Law 50 firm with almost $1 billion in annual revenue is nearing a merger. Unfortunately, there are no details on the proposed partner and the firm’s communications department has ducked questions about it. So here’s a blind item because we don’t want to report on the forest if we’ve only seen a couple trees. We’d need to see more forest, you know? So if you have any relevant information on this merger, let us know.

In the meantime, let’s reflect on an absolutely gangbusters year in law firm mergers. At the midyear point, [52 mergers had been announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/merger-mania-dominates-2018-in-the-legal-industry/) and the back end of the year hasn’t exactly dropped off a cliff. What’s driving this merger mania?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
To some extent, it’s the fear. The fear that the opposite of growth is death. As business moves increasingly to the concentrated elite or the dispersed niche shops, the stagnant middle is losing out. Stockpiling talent to stay in that “household name” tier of top-flight firms is the conventional wisdom. [New markets and new talent](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/how-global-biglaw-titans-are-demolishing-local-firms-and-how-to-survive-the-onslaught/).

Yet as any divorce lawyer will tell you, mergers aren’t necessarily a good idea. Increased conflicts, costs, disgruntled partners, redundancy — these are all side effects of blockbuster mergers that can throw a wrench in plans for future growth. If firms aren’t cautious with their merger plans, they can end up worse off than they were before.

Which brings us back to the merger we’re hearing rumblings about. Is this another transatlantic deal? A play for more regional coverage? An en masse boost to a specific practice area? Details are sparse, but we’re very interested in learning more about the shifting legal landscape.

‘Your firm is HUGE!’ (Image via Getty)

There are many different and exciting ways to rank law firms. How prestigious are they? How much money are they making? How much do partners earn? How much are associates earning in cash compensation? How big are they?

Yes, size matters, and because the legal profession is obsessed with every single measurable and quantifiable factor law firms have to offer, there’s obviously a ranking for that — two, in fact. So, which Biglaw firm is the biggest of them all? And which U.S.-based Biglaw firm is the largest in the nation? The National Law Journal and Law360 (sub. req.) can help us answer these questions. Last night, Law360 released its master list of the top 400 U.S.-based law firms by headcount, and this morning, the NLJ did the same, but for the top 500 law firms in the country. What did these dueling rankings reveal about what law firm headcount looks like after the wild lateral ride that was 2021?

These are the 10 largest law firms in America, according to NLJ, along with some insights on the list:

- Baker McKenzie
- DLA Piper
- Norton Rose Fulbright
- Latham & Watkins
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Hogan Lovells
- White & Case
- Jones Day
- Greenberg Traurig
- Morgan Lewis
Baker McKenzie retained the top spot, with 4,795 lawyers and only 2% growth in head count. DLA Piper stayed steady in second place, with only an 0.8% increase to 4,028 attorneys. Norton Rose Fulbright managed to remain in third place, shedding only 3% of its bench to 3,084 from 3,178 lawyers.

Of course, the larger the firm, the more lawyers it can lose or gain without impacting its overall head count too much. Yet even some large percentage swings at the top of the NLJ 500 did not translate into changes in the leaderboard. Latham & Watkins remained fourth on the NLJ 500 despite a 7.7% increase in head count to 3,078 from 2,858. Similarly, Kirkland & Ellis deepened its bench by 300 lawyers and 11%—to 3,025 from 2,725—without managing to improve its fifth-place NLJ 500 ranking, while Hogan Lovells remained in the sixth spot despite shedding 3.1% of its bench to 2,532 attorneys from 2,612.

Rounding out the top 10, White & Case improved one position to seventh, with 9.2% head count growth to 2,464 from 2,257, swapping rankings with Jones Day as it shed 3.4% of its lawyers. Greenberg Traurig and Morgan Lewis & Bockius held steady in the ninth and 10th slots respectively, with both of their benches remaining relatively steady.

And these are the 10 largest U.S.-based law firms in America, per Law360:

# Keeping Up With Change In Consumer Financial Services: Regulation, Enforcement, Litigation, And More
## Lawyers with clients in the consumer financial services sector know that regulatory, enforcement, and economic factors are constantly shifting. With a new administration on deck for 2021 and the COVID-19 pandemic keeping a tight grip on the economy, there’s never been a better time to get an update from insiders.

Lawyers with clients in the consumer financial services sector know that regulatory, enforcement, and economic factors are constantly shifting — and this means there’s always something new on the horizon. With a new administration on deck for 2021 and the COVID-19 pandemic keeping a tight grip on the economy, there’s never been a better time to get an update from insiders.

[Danielle Bersofsky Cohen](https://bit.ly/37sw3S2), Senior Program Attorney with Practising Law Institute (PLI), spoke about the upcoming [25th Annual Consumer Financial Services Institute](https://bit.ly/3lzuAy6). This popular two-day program, scheduled to take place via live webcast December 7–8, features as faculty representatives from federal and state regulatory and enforcement agencies, experienced defense and in-house counsel, and consumer advocates.

The Trump administration brought changes to the leadership and priorities of the CFPB, FTC, OCC and FDIC and federal banking agencies. What are some of the biggest changes that practitioners in this area should be aware of?

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has changed its focus to resolving more matters through supervision rather than enforcement. It has also focused on clear-cut violations instead of using its Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices (UDAAP) authority to create new requirements not expressly found in statutes or regulations. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have taken a more bank-friendly approach to how they have used their National Bank Act (NBA)/Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) authority, and also seem to have been less aggressive in the use of their enforcement authority.

What is expected to change in the first months of the incoming Biden administration?

The leadership of the CFPB and OCC will fall under Democratic control, so the effect of change may be felt most immediately there. We will find out in the next couple of months how the party balance will shift among the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioners and at the FDIC.

All agencies may take a more aggressive approach to enforcement, particularly in the area of fair lending. It is anticipated that the CFPB will try to reinstate the ability to repay provisions in the Small Dollar Lending Rule. The CFPB may also try to make the recently finalized Debt Collection Rule more consumer friendly. It is also possible the CFPB will embark on a course to supervise installment lenders.

How has COVID-19 affected the industry?

The pandemic has caused the financial services industry in general to take a more conservative approach to implementing new products and making other changes due to the combination of economic uncertainty and staffing constraints. It has also resulted in new Fair Credit Reporting Act requirements.

Overall, we have seen a rise in state regulatory and enforcement activity, perhaps as a reaction to any perceived lack of activity at the federal level.

What are the main areas in which the risk of private litigation, including class actions, remains high?

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and Fair Credit Reporting Act all remain very much on the radar. There is likely to be more litigation against creditors, particularly mortgage lenders, if the economy continues to be challenged. At this year’s program we will again hear from leading consumer advocates about the cases they have been working on and their litigation priorities going forward.

What are some key things that attorneys should know about technological innovations like Blockchain and their effects on the industry?

Technological developments such as the use of alternative data and the increasing prominence of online and mobile-app customer experiences raise new challenges, including Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP), UDAAP, and privacy issues. Our program looks at the intersection between new technologies and new products and existing regulatory frameworks.

What makes PLI’s conference unique?

This is the 25th year PLI will be offering this conference, which has become known as the premier consumer financial services CLE program in the country thanks to our exceptional faculty who represent a wide range of perspectives. This year’s event will commence with a keynote address by former CFPB Director Richard Cordray, who released a book shortly before the pandemic took hold in the United States titled Watchdog: How Protecting Consumers Can Save Our Families, Our Economy, and Our Democracy. We will also feature an all-new one-hour panel addressing diversity and inclusion/elimination of bias issues in the legal workplace (one hour of this type of credit will be offered), and we will continue to offer a full hour of Ethics credit as well.

# Robert Mueller Assembles An All-Star Legal Team
## A great team of investigative lawyers, or the greatest team of investigative lawyers?

Robert S. Mueller (via YouTube)

Working for a special counsel who’s investigating scandal in a presidential administration is one of the most interesting — and potentially career-enhancing — assignments for a young lawyer. Just ask D.C. Circuit Judge (and potential Supreme Court nominee) Brett Kavanaugh, who worked for Kenneth Starr on the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton presidency. Or leading legal journalist Jeffrey Toobin, who worked for Lawrence Walsh on the Iran-Contra investigation during the Reagan presidency (and turned that experience into his first book, [Opening Arguments: A Young Lawyer’s First Case](http://amzn.to/2sB0t21) (affiliate link)).

Now former FBI director Robert Mueller, the special counsel tasked with [investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/biglaw-partner-named-special-counsel-in-russia-investigation/), is putting together his team — and what a team it is. Writing in [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/robert-mueller-special-counsel-investigation-team/), journalist Garrett Graff — who literally [wrote the book on Bob Mueller](http://amzn.to/2sBinBP) (affiliate link) — profiles this legal “dream team.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Much of Graff’s piece focuses on Aaron Zebley, who chased terrorists around the globe as an FBI agent. But on top of his amazing war stories, Zebley has an impressive pedigree: William & Mary, UVA Law, assistant U.S. attorney (E.D. Va.), chief of staff to then-FBI director Mueller, and [partner at WilmerHale](https://www.wilmerhale.com/pages/publicationsandnewsdetail.aspx?NewsPubId=17179871980).

And Zebley’s not the only high-flying legal eagle working with Mueller, as Graff notes:

Mueller is recruiting perhaps the most high-powered and experienced team of investigators ever assembled by the Justice Department. His team began with three lawyers who also quickly left WilmerHale, the law firm where Mueller has also worked since he left the FBI in 2013—Zebley, James Quarles III, and Jeannie Rhee.

The rapid recruitment of Quarles attracted immediate attention: A famed litigator who was an assistant special prosecutor for the Watergate investigation, Quarles specialized in campaign finance research for the Watergate task force, which surely will be an area of focus for Mueller’s investigation…. In more recent years, Quarles has risen through the [WilmerHale] ranks to run its D..C office, and is an experienced manager.

As for [Jeannie Rhee](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/27/style/weddings-j-h-rhee-c-m-sclafani.html), she’s a double Yalie (college and law school) with many years of experience at the Justice Department, where she worked as both an assistant U.S. attorney (D.D.C.) and in Main Justice’s vaunted Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). Like Mueller and Quarles, she too [left the WilmerHale partnership](https://www.wilmerhale.com/pages/publicationsandnewsdetail.aspx?NewsPubId=101082) to join the Russia probe.

That’s more legal talent than you can shake a gavel at. And wait, there’s more!

More recently, Mueller has recruited Andrew Weissmann, his one-time general counsel at the FBI and a long-time adviser who once led the Justice Department’s fraud unit. In the early 2000s, Weissmann also oversaw the Enron Task Force, the storied Justice Department unit that investigated the complex machinations of the failed energy giant.

Weissmann — a Princeton and Columbia Law grad, and a partner at Jenner & Block after his government service — is a controversial figure because of his prosecutorial zeal. Former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell, who went up against him in the Enron case (when she was a defense lawyer), told [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/930213), “I wouldn’t trust Mr. Weissmann if he told me what day of the week this was.” But other lawyers praised Weissmann to Law360 for his toughness and willingness to pursue wrongdoing, regardless of the consequences.

[UPDATE (6/16/2017, 10:08 a.m.): A quick clarification about Weissmann’s time at Jenner, from a firm spokesperson: “Andrew was a partner at our firm in between stints in the government. He left the firm in 2011 after working here for five years to rejoin the government and has not been a partner again since leaving then.”]

Mueller seems to prioritize government service, as reflected in this next notable hire:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
[W]hile the Special Counsel’s office has yet to make any formal announcements about Mueller’s team, it appears he has recruited an experienced Justice Department trial attorney, Lisa Page, a little-known figure outside the halls of Main Justice but one whose résumé boasts intriguing hints about where Mueller’s Russia investigation might lead. Page has deep experience with money laundering and organized crime cases, including investigations where she’s partnered with an FBI task force in Budapest, Hungary, that focuses on eastern European organized crime.

And last, but definitely not least, here’s a boldface name from the Supreme Court bar:

Mueller added Michael Dreeben, who has worked for years in the Justice Department’s solicitor general’s office, which argues the government’s cases before the Supreme Court. “Dreeben is 1 of the top legal & appellate minds at DOJ in modern times,” tweeted Preet Bharara, the former top Manhattan federal prosecutor. Walter Dellinger, an accomplished law professor at Duke and former acting solicitor general, went one step further, telling The Washington Post, “Michael is the most brilliant and most knowledgeable federal criminal lawyer in America—period.”

Such sentiments are widely held throughout the appellate bar. It would be hard to find a more highly esteemed appellate advocate than Michael Dreeben. Like Bob Mueller, he has served across multiple presidential administrations, enjoying respect from both sides of the aisle.

What will special counsel Robert Mueller and his colleagues discover in their investigation? That remains to be seen. But make no mistake: with this kind of [bigly](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/us/politics/trump-bigly-big-league-linguists.html) big-league legal talent, if there’s wrongdoing to be found, they will find it.

UPDATE (6/15/2017, 10:48 a.m.): For additional info on this stellar team, see Rebecca Tan and Alex Ward’s piece for Vox, [Meet the all-star legal team who may take down Trump](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/15/15783384/trump-mueller-team-russia-investigation-dreeben-weissman-quarles-rhee-zebley).

# Katten Muchin Sued By Bottom-Feeding Former Client
## Payday lender feels they were taken advantage of.

There are few entities that generate less sympathy than payday lenders. Targeting desperate people looking for immediate cash flow with happy commercials where some schlub sets everything in his world right by scoring a quick $5,000 loan while ignoring the fine print laying out the 200 percent interest rate. After the bottom fell out of the economy, state governments and the CFPB started tightening restrictions on this lending.

And that created problems for CashCall. So they — at the risk of oversimplifying — moved a substantial segment of their operations to Native American land. It was the fashionable thing to do in the industry at the time, and really, when have Native Americans ever been exploited by powerful monied interests looking to use their land? Now that that’s fallen through for CashCall, they’re [turning their aim on Katten Muchin](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/katten-muchin-sued-by-bottom-feeding-former-client/2/), suing for malpractice, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty.

Like most pre-collapse consumer lenders, CashCall made its money partnering with banks around the country who would issue loans to customers and then immediately sell the loan to CashCall, who would accept the collection risk in exchange for charging “interest rates that are higher than secured loans.” And by that, they mean way higher.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
You know what, apropos of nothing in particular, please enjoy this moment of Simpsons history:



[Claudia Calloway](https://www.kattenlaw.com/Claudia-Callaway), a partner at Katten Muchin (formerly of Paul Weiss and Manatt), represented CashCall in these deals, and for many years, the company seemed pleased with Calloway’s work finding them willing partners for spreading their unique brand of mirth. But when the banks started fleeing the loan shark consumer-lending industry, CashCall alleges that Calloway and Katten recommended working with a Native American tribe. After all, these pesky regulations don’t apply on the reservation!

CashCall wasn’t alone. [Back in 2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/09/the-legal-trick-payday-lenders-are-using-to-skirt-the-law/), the Consumer Federation of America estimated that half of this business was conducted by entities claiming tribal immunity to skirt banking regulations, and Biglaw firms were deeply embroiled in helping companies use the unique sovereign status of tribal governments to their advantage.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Where CashCall differed from other lenders is in their chosen partner. In one model, a consumer lender partners with an entity set up by the tribal government itself. In the other, companies like CashCall pair with a private tribal member operating an entity in Indian territory.

CashCall partnered with a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian nation who set up a company called Western Sky to issue loans from the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation over the phone or internet that could be immediately purchased — through an intermediary — by CashCall. CashCall thought this, along with some language in lending agreements, granted their whole lending regime tribal sovereignty. Courts disagreed.

That’s why you don’t build anything on ancient Indian burial grounds, figuratively or literally.

As CashCall alleges:

But Katten and Callaway knew, or should have known, that an entity is subject to immunity as an “arm of the tribe” only if the entity is owned or controlled by the tribe itself, was created for and operates for the benefit of the tribe or serves a tribal function, or can bind the tribe or endanger the tribe’s assets. Merely incorporating an enterprise owned and controlled by an individual, even if a member of a tribe, does not make that enterprise an “arm of the tribe.”

Well… no. But wouldn’t it be great if we all got to claim the immunities of our governments? As a citizen of New York, I want state immunity so I can totally trash New Jersey the next time I’m forced to pass through that rotting cesspool.

CashCall claims Katten and Calloway knew all along that their tribal partner was wholly owned by a mere member of the tribe without any official tribal government ties and led CashCall along in believing that the “member of the tribe” model carried immunity. Which even if they did understand the structure fully, frankly, they may have had reason to believe that would hold up to scrutiny based on the state of play when they offered that advice.

Putting aside whether or not Katten and Calloway appropriately advised CashCall of the risks of their model — or even knew the precise details of the model to begin with — CashCall has an even bigger problem that they pin on the firm. The feds are arguing that CashCall was the “true lender” in these cases, thus stripping the lending agreements of the pretense of a tribal relationship. Which is ridiculous, because obviously Western Sky was a bona fide Native American lending institution, just look at their commercial:


Drums and teepees galore! How can there be any doubt?

Regardless, CashCall’s blaming Katten for not advising them of the “true lender” risk either, but to be fair, what in the preceding decades of jurisprudence would lead anyone to think courts might stop letting companies shield their actions behind fig-leaf transactions? Delaware has to pay its bills somehow.

CashCall claims that all these failures they’re laying at Katten’s feet add up to more than $500 million in damages. A Katten spokeswoman [told the Orange County Register](http://www.ocregister.com/2017/04/19/cashcall-sues-attorneys-for-malpractice-claiming-500-million-in-damages/), “We will vigorously defend our firm against this matter, and we expect to prevail.”

In the meantime, if CashCall needs money now, I know of several companies that can get you the cash you need today. Bad credit no problem!

I feel like I have been really lucky in that Mintz is on this upward trajectory and the partners are not spoiled, it is not baked in. I think some of my peers at some Am Law 50 firms have … it’s hard when partners are used to making a certain amount of money and then make less. In the real world, it is not particularly material, but it does create a problem. And unfortunately, that is something that concerns them, as it would me. You want a constant upward trajectory, and that is going to be hard this year.

Managing partners are concerned about that. And there are some firms that are going to have a hard time and, hopefully for them, it turns around quickly. There is a level of concern.

— [Bob Bodian](https://www.mintz.com/our-people/robert-i-bodian), managing member at Mintz Levin, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/12/15/mintzs-bob-bodian-on-rto-partner-expectations-and-all-those-associates/), on concerns that he’s heard of from his peers. “The one thing I always bear in mind is that we are all really fortunate when you take our problems in context and look at the world around us,” Bodian continued. “It is important to bear that in mind when confronting our own, less earth-shattering, problems.”

# Unequal Treatment Across Offices Leaves Lots Of Angry Associates
## Not in NY or D.C.? You'll have to bill a lot of hours to come close to market compensation.

It’s a neat trick to announce raises and special bonuses but still wind up with the bulk of your associates angry at you. But, judging by the extensive reaction we’ve received to Norton Rose Fulbright’s recent compensation announcement, that’s exactly what happened.

The frustration seems to stem from the unequal treatment in offices at the firm. New York and D.C. are being treated close to the market standard, while other offices — particularly those in Texas and California (markets that have largely gotten on board with associate raises and summer bonuses, at least at the elite level) — don’t fare as well.

Now, let’s break this down by office — New York and D.C. are getting raises in line with the market standard we are used to seeing:

Class of 2012: $305,000
Class of 2011: $325,000
Class of 2010: $340,000

The firm is also promising special bonuses for these offices, but isn’t giving them out until the end of the year. That sucks if an associate is thinking about lateraling to another firm this year. They’re trapped by golden handcuffs at NRF till they see that money. But at least they’ll be on top of the standard hours-based year end bonuses.

Class of 2017: $5000
Class of 2016: $7500

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In Texas and California, first- and second-year associates will get a market raise, but anyone older needs to hit their billing requirement — set at a steep 2300 hours per year — to get a bonus that will make them whole vis-a-vis a NY associate’s (of the same year) base compensation. It’s unclear if that’s a one-time 2018 bonus or if associates in those offices can expect these bonuses year after year — provided, of course, they keep billing. The firm makes no mention of special bonuses for these offices, but promises discretionary bonuses will be bigger.

In our Texas and California offices, we will adopt an increased salary scale for incoming, first-year and second-year associates (2017 and 2018: $190,000; 2016 $200,000). Associates in class years 2010-2015 who qualify for the full hours-based merit bonus will also receive a bonus equal to the difference between their current salary and the salary scale set forth above (prorated for 2018), in addition to their standard hours-based merit bonuses. We are also significantly increasing our discretionary bonus program to ensure competitive associate compensation packages for our highly performing associates in these markets. Discretionary bonuses reward excellence in performance, account for market trends and acknowledge important non-billable activities.

For associates in the firm’s other offices (Denver, Minneapolis, and St. Louis) they’re left to the murky waters of individualized compensation.

We’ve gotten a lot of reactions to the firm’s announcement.

I’m sure you’ve heard about the Norton Rose Fulbright bonus announcement by now? Is Thompson Knight hiring?

(Remember [T&K offered a full match](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/giddy-up-associate-salaries-increasing-across-texas/) of the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale.)

To the mathematical:

As a reminder, the Norton Rose Fulbright “full hours-based bonus” requirement is 2300 hours. If an associate finishes the year between 2000 hours and 2299 hours, the year-end bonus is 50% of market. As a result, a San Francisco-based 2010 grad that finishes with 2250 hours at NRF should expect to earn 87,500 less this year than a Fort Worth-based 2010 grad that finishes with 2000 hours at Akin Gump or Thompson Knight (NRF: 315k+ 50k+ 0 vs. AG/TK: 327.5k+ 100k+ 25k).

To the biting:

I am sure you have received this already, but Norton Rose Fulbright’s comp memo. Basically if you’re an associate not in the New York, DC, Texas or California offices, or are Senior Counsel and Counsel, smell ya later! And the crafty “yeah, we will give you a mid year bonus, but only at the end of the year and only if you qualify for the end of the year full hours-based merit bonus”.

To the dismissive:

So the comp memo makes no sense.  Here it is….

Seriously???!!

To the brief but effective:

People are pissed.

The firm tried to split the compensation baby, and it doesn’t look like many associates — well, except maybe those in the most favored offices — are happy.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Tech Survey Reveals The Era Of Biglaw AI Is Already Here
## Biglaw may be all in on AI but they aren't exactly sure what to do with it.

UPDATE: It turns out that one of these graphs is wrong which… sorta undermines the whole thesis of the article. We’ll have an update.

Biglaw’s jump into the world of generative artificial intelligence is much further along than you might suspect. The International Legal Technology Association just released [its 2023 tech survey](https://www.iltanet.org/resources/publications/surveys/ts23), compiling the input of 532 firms representing about 155,452 attorneys. At over 300 pages, the report provides a lot of insight into the tech driving the biggest players in the legal industry today. But its section on AI and other emerging technologies offered the most eye-popping revelations:

Eighty. Five. Percent.

So much for the idea that attorneys would tread lightly in this space after [seeing some high-profile disasters](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/chatgpt-bad-lawyering/). We had some suspicion that the number might be higher than expected after hearing that some firms are [pursuing AI like the proverbial shiny object](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/iltacon-do-something-with-ai/). That conclusion might find support in the next graph:



One read of this is that firms have identified a number of actionable use cases. Another read is that they have no idea what they actually want to use AI for. Reality is likely somewhere in the middle. The most popular response — creating initial drafts of documents — remains the tantalizing use case, and one with a ton of potential in the transactional space. But it’s [not churning out a winning appellate brief any time soon](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/the-legal-industry-has-a-long-way-to-go-before-gpt-matches-the-talk/).

To put this in context, 85 percent are using it and 60 percent have no policy to speak of. Not great.

Maybe they should ask ChatGPT to write them one?



Well. The good news is that law firms may be chasing AI but they’re not eager to put everyone in stupid headsets yet.

# When Is Enough Enough?
## Only you can know for sure.
By [Lisa Lang](https://abovethelaw.com/author/lisalang/)

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/when-is-enough-enough/&text=When%20Is%20Enough%20Enough?)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/when-is-enough-enough/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/when-is-enough-enough/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
As an in-house lawyer, you will undoubtedly be asked to do many things and wear many “hats.” Wearing more than one hat at any one time can be challenging at best. If you are confident that you can wear multiple hats well and without a negative impact on your work or your mental and physical health, good for you. Keep doing what you are doing and stop reading right here.
If, however, you are one of the many in-house lawyers today who is wearing multiple hats and feeling either that you are not wearing all of your hats well or that you have put your physical or mental health at risk to wear all the hats you wear, you should probably keep the following in mind:

- You are a lawyer first and foremost. You have more than a job to protect. You have a bar license.
- When you do more than one thing at any given time, you will likely do both things only half as well.
- You have a responsibility to yourself, your family, your co-workers, and your employer to be the best version of yourself at home and at work.
- You have to be self-aware enough to know what boundaries you need to ensure maximum success.
- You need to communicate those boundaries to your family, your co-workers, and you employer.
- If, by establishing these boundaries, it means you have to turn in one or more of your many hats, so be it.
If you are doing these things, you are not a mediocre employee who is just doing what you need to do to get by. You are a self-aware employee who knows what to do to achieve maximum result for your employer and your family.

So how do you hand a “hat” back?

You communicate with your employer.

You explain to your supervisor why you are unable to accept the added role. During that discussion, you may want to talk about your workload, capacity, and availability. You may also may want to explain why the new role could interfere or conflict with your current role.

You communicate in a timely fashion with your employer.

You schedule your discussion regarding your concerns as soon as possible. You give your supervisor as much time as possible to find an alternative solution.

You communicate fully, openly, and honestly with your employer.

You speak fully and honestly with your supervisor. You must avoid embellishing or exaggerating any issues.

You explain the impact to your employer.

You explain how the new role will affect the quality of the work you are currently assigned to do.

You ask for help if and when you need it.

If you think you can handle an additional role, but with additional resources, be sure to let your supervisor know that, too.

In my experience, lawyers have a tendency to put undue pressure on themselves to deliver results and exceed expectations. If you want to make it as an in-house lawyer, but are struggling to balance multiple hats, say something. Leaving doesn’t have to be the only answer.

Maybe you just have to hand some of your hats back.

Associates, did you click on this article hoping for some firm to beat the Cravath bonus scale? Well, it’s time for you to temper your greed, and think about your colleagues on the staff side.

Ever since Biglaw bonus season [started this past fall](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/), we’ve received a slew of emails from law firm support staff wondering what their fate may be as the Benjamins continued to rain down upon associates. After all, it takes an army for law firms this large to run, and the behind-the-scenes battalions of paralegals, secretaries, administrative assistants, and all other support staff members deserve their due, too.

After an extremely successful year, one Biglaw firm came to the conclusion that its staff members deserved a little bit more, and decided to issue special bonuses of $1,000, on top of any merit-based bonuses that will be awarded to them in June.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Congratulations to Mintz Levin for setting the bar for how Biglaw firms ought to treat their administrative staff members.

According to managing member [Bob Bodian](https://www.mintz.com/professionals/detail/name/robert-i-bodian), these bonuses were awarded in celebration of the firm’s 13 percent increase in equity partner profits. This is the second year in a row that special bonuses were given to staff members at the firm. Here’s what Bodian said during an interview with [Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/mintz-levin-gives-staff-1000-bonuses/):

“[T]his year, we were up even more, and we exceeded our budget by even more, so the policy committee decided we should do it again,” Bodian said. …

Although the special bonus is not intended to become a regular fixture, Bodian said he would be “delighted” to offer one again next year.

And we’d be delighted to cover more special staff bonuses. If you’re a staff member at Mintz Levin, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

What did your firm do in terms of staff bonuses? Does your firm have plans to dole out any additional cash to staff — or associates — this spring? Please [let us know](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus).

As a little reminder, we love continually covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cross your fingers for spring bonuses, everyone!

Biglaw associates will never get tired of their firms making more money magically appear in their paychecks.

Top-rated Magic Circle firm Clifford Chance — the No. 10 firm on the 2021 Global 200 — is wowing U.S. associates with a brand new Cravath salary match. If you recall, the firm [matched the Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/clifford-chance-raise-2022/) less than two weeks ago.

Here’s what salaries for U.S. associates at Clifford Chance will soon look like:



Like its peer firms, associates at Clifford Chance will see new salaries in their accounts on March 15, retroactive to January 1. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Clifford Chance.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

We haven’t even hit the midway point on the year yet, and the firm has gone through its share of challenges already — attorney [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/nationwide-layoff-watch-biglaw-firm-cuts-headcount-attorneys-among-the-victims/) and a spate of [partners lateraling](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/more-shakeups-at-reed-smith/) to new firms are among the high (low?) points. And now there are merger rumors swirling around the firm.

According to [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/reed-smith-and-pepper-hamilton-are-in-merger-talks-source/), Reed Smith approached Pepper Hamilton about a potential merger, but the talks are still in the early stages. Both firms confirmed the reports last night in statements:

“Based on these preliminary discussions, we see many potential benefits to joining forces,” said a Reed Smith spokesman, in a statement. “There remains a significant amount of work to do with Pepper Hamilton to assess those benefits and before any transaction would be ready to bring to the Reed Smith partnership.”

A statement on behalf of Pepper Hamilton was also issued that confirmed “preliminary discussions” with Reed Smith.

Will this move change the course at Reed Smith? Though associates at Reed Smith have [long complained](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/associates-challenge-biglaw-management-we-have-the-memo/) about the thin ranks of mid-level and senior associates, this merger — if successful — may not turn the tide of sinking morale at the firm. Big changes, such as a merger, naturally bring worry to the rank and file. One tipster shared news of the merger with us using a series of unflattering emojis. Can the injection of Pepper Hamilton’s 490 attorneys make a difference to the issues Reed Smith has faced?

If you work at either Reed Smith or Pepper Hamilton and want to sound off on the potential merger, please feel free to email us at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or send an SMS/text message to (646) 820-8477. As always, we’ll keep your name strictly confidential.

# 5 Biglaw Firms Make Fortune’s List Of The ‘Best Companies to Work For’ (2018)
## Which law firms made the cut this year?

Which law firm offers big money AND big fun?

For more than 20 years, Fortune has released a list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For. Each year, a few law firms manage to sneak their way onto a list that includes employers like Wegmans, Cheesecake Factory, and Deloitte. With companies like that on the list, each year we wonder if the people at Fortune have any idea what they’re talking about — after all, there’s no way a law firm could possibly perform on a similar level.

We try to cover this list every year (see our posts in [2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/which-biglaw-firms-are-the-best-places-to-work/), [2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/which-law-firms-are-considered-some-of-the-best-companies-to-work-for/), [2014](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/6-law-firms-make-fortunes-list-of-the-best-companies-to-work-for/), [2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/fortunes-annual-%E2%80%98100-best-companies-to-work-for%E2%80%99-list-includes-four-law-firms/), [2011](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/annual-best-companies-to-work-for-list-includes-four-law-firms/), [2010](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/fortune-recognizes-six-firms-as-least-worst-best-companies-to-work-for/), [2009](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/01/fortune-lists-top-100-companies-to-work-for/), [2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/01/everyones-a-winner-at-these-five-law-firms/), and [2007](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/bingham-mccutchen-land-of-the-amazons/)). In [2017](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/best-workplaces/100-best/2017), five law firms made the list: Cooley (#25), Perkins Coie (#53), Alston & Bird (#65), Baker Donelson (#95), and Orrick (#96).

This year, five Biglaw firms made the list. Which firms had pay that was high enough, perks that were good enough, and environments that were nurturing enough?

The five Biglaw firms on this year’s list are… the five firms that made last year’s list. It’s worth noting that most of the five firms from last year’s list more or less retained their Fortune ranking, give or take a few slots, but one of them has continued its meteoric rise to the top for the third year in a row.

Congratulations to the following five firms on being fun enough for Fortune:

- [Cooley](http://fortune.com/best-companies/cooley/): ranked #18, up from #25 last year
- [Orrick](http://fortune.com/best-companies/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe/): ranked #31, up from #96 last year
- [Perkins Coie](http://fortune.com/best-companies/perkins-coie/): ranked #58, down from #53 last year
- [Alston & Bird](http://fortune.com/best-companies/alston-bird/): ranked #79, down from #65 last year
- [Baker Donelson](http://fortune.com/best-companies/baker-donelson/): ranked #96, down from #95 last year

Cooley is now listed among the top 20 companies evaluated by Fortune, and Orrick now ranks among the top third of all companies on the list.

At Cooley, “karaoke matters as much as contracts,” and 67 percent of its workforce are women, while 32 percent are minorities. Even partners at Cooley like to have fun:

At Orrick, the firm gives away $50,000 each year for the best office innovation idea. Mitch Zuklie, the firm’s chairman and CEO, says that the firm is “innovating to attract, retain and inspire both lawyer and staff talent.” Check out the firm’s D.C. office, hanging out with summer associates on a boating adventure:

My husband is eager to take our fourth-grade daughter to attend her first soccer game, because our hometown of Kansas City finally has a professional women’s soccer team. He is excited for her to see female representation in professional sports. It’s something I honestly had never given much thought to. Unlike my male peers, a career in sports never once crossed my mind as a girl growing up in the ’80s and ’90s.

Lack of representation mattered.

I didn’t view sports as a realistic path to scholarships, fame, and fortune, so I threw myself into academic pursuits instead. My dedication paid off, and I received sizable academic scholarships to help pay for engineering school. I chose engineering because my mom’s best friend since high school was an electrical engineer. It was a career that paid well enough for her to afford a nice house, a boat, and a family trip to Disney World every year. “I’m good at math. I could do that,” I thought.

Representation mattered.

When I started engineering school in 2000, I was one of only a handful of women in the electrical engineering and computer engineering programs at the University of Miami. I recall having only one or two female engineering professors during my entire four years in the program. My male classmates were generally nice, and I never noticed any overt sexism directed my way. Nevertheless, I felt awkward, out of place, lonely, isolated, and unhappy in engineering school.

Lack of representation mattered.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I still finished the program, graduating with honors, while simultaneously plotting my immediate exit from the profession. One of my female engineering professors taught a “Writing About Science” course, and I was intrigued. I wrote for several industry magazines my first few years out of college before stumbling upon a job ad for a “patent agent,” requiring both an electrical engineering degree and writing experience. It was a perfect fit. Being a patent agent required me to become a combination technical expert, writer, and legal expert, drafting and prosecuting patent applications before the U.S. patent office. It was challenging, engaging, and paid relatively well. I also appreciated that the intellectual property law firm I joined had a good mix of men and women among its attorneys and patent agents.

Still, after nearly a decade in the field, I was ready to take on new challenges and admittedly grew a little tired of trying to explain to people what I did for a living. While my male coworker who was also a patent agent would occasionally be mistaken for the attorney, I was more likely to be asked, “So you’re like a paralegal, right?” Just as all women in medicine are too often presumed to be nurses, the underrepresentation of men as paralegals and legal assistants results in similar assumptions about women in law.

Lack of representation mattered.

To eliminate any confusion about my technical and legal credentials (and further my career), I decided to become a patent lawyer. By this point, my husband and I had a young daughter at home and a mortgage to pay. The prospect of returning to school full time as a mom in my mid-30s felt a little daunting, but I knew it was possible because I had witnessed my own mother return to school in her late 30s. I reasoned that if she could earn her undergraduate and then graduate degrees while raising three kids, maybe I could make it work too.

Representation mattered.

Upon graduation and passing my state bar exam, I took a Biglaw job at a firm with a woman at the helm for the first time in that firm’s 150-year-plus history. There I met numerous lawyer moms managing some of the firm’s largest clients. When I later accepted an amazing offer to return to my previous intellectual property law firm, the number of female partners there had grown exponentially since a decade and a half earlier when I had started there as a patent agent.

These women continue to inspire me as I reach for the next rung on my career ladder, and I hope that my career path will inspire someone else. There is still much work to be done when it comes to diversity and inclusion within law and STEM fields alike. I am in a position today to help do that work only because of the trailblazers who became that representation that I needed to see.

When I look at the gains made by women in the legal profession and professional sports alike over the past few decades, I feel so hopeful for my daughter’s future. The norm for her growing up will be watching women make a living playing sports, running for office, becoming doctors, becoming engineers, or becoming lawyers, like her mom. Seeing women in traditionally male-dominated sports and careers may not change her entire life trajectory, but I know from experience that it can. My hope is that her life is less defined by a lack of female representation and more enriched by its abundance.

It’s pretty clear that the #MeToo movement has left an imprint on Biglaw. Not only are Biglaw firms [unwilling](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/biglaw-partner-fired-for-inappropriate-personal-conduct/) to put the size of a partner’s book of business ahead of their inappropriate conduct, but more and more are doing away with mandatory arbitration agreements as a condition of employment.

After Munger Tolles was [called out for the practice ](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/)and changed their policy, other firms [voluntarily did away](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/this-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-step-forward-and-do-away-with-mandatory-arbitration-for-all-employees/) with the practice. Others [required some good, old fashioned pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/law-school-students-stand-up-to-biglaw-firm-win/), but eventually eliminated the agreements. While there have been some [notable holdouts](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/), the tide might finally be turning against mandatory arbitration agreements.

And McDermott Will & Emery is right on trend.

Late last week, the firm announced they were ending the policy of mandatory arbitration. In an email to all employees, the firm’s General Counsel [Linda Doyle](https://www.mwe.com/people/doyle-linda-m/) said they are making the move to “ensure that our people have the confidence to raise challenges that, once surfaced and addressed, will make our Firm better. It will also allow us to continue to operate with the radical transparency that has enhanced our culture and our performance.”

Kudos to MWE, let’s hope even more Biglaw firms get onboard.

The practice and business of law are being transformed by several major forces, including technological change and globalization — and commercial litigation is no exception.

This coming Tuesday, June 20, at 12 p.m. (Eastern), join seasoned law firm and in-house litigators, David Tsai (Vinson & Elkins) and Mark Herrmann (AON), who will share what they are seeing in their practices and offer insights on the broader litigation landscape. (Their views are their own and not those of their organizations, of course.)

The webinar will include a demonstration of Lex Machina’s award-winning Legal Analytics® platform, which is expanding into its largest practice area yet: commercial litigation. Legal Analytics is a combination of data and analytics software that provides unprecedented strategic insight at your fingertips to craft winning litigation strategy.

# Am Law 100 Firm Announces True-Up Cash Will Be Deposited On Christmas Eve
## Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, associates!

It’s now mid-December, and another Biglaw firm has decided to reward its employees cold, hard cash this holiday season. Not bonuses, mind you, but the salaries they went without thanks to the firm’s COVID-19 austerity measures.

You may recall that back in April, Seyfarth — a firm that posted $717,370,000 gross revenue in 2019, earning it the 60th place on the latest Am Law 100 ranking — rolled out [firmwide cost-cutting measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-u-s-lawyers-staff-cuts-pay-for-all/) effective May 1, ranging from salary cuts to furloughs of attorneys and staff. Equity partners reduced their monthly draws by 20 percent, all U.S. lawyers had their pay reduced by 10 percent, and staff salaries were cut up to 10 percent based on earnings. The firm also furloughed 10 percent of its U.S. employees, and at the time, sources told us that 180 staff and 50 attorneys were taken out of play.

In September, the firm announced a mix of bad news and good news, specifically, that effective October 1, some of those who had been furloughed — including attorneys — would be laid off, but that [all salary cuts would be reversed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/am-law-100-firm-announces-attorney-layoffs-salary-cut-rollbacks/) and everyone’s pay would be restored to their regular compensation levels.

Now, the firm has announced some very happy news for all employees: Seyfarth will be making retroactive salary adjustments for everyone whose salary was reduced in May, and that those payments would be made on December 24, Christmas Eve. Those big fat deposits should make for a very merry holiday indeed.

Here’s a holly-jolly statement from Pete Miller, Chair and Managing Partner of Seyfarth Shaw, who will be figuratively sliding down chimneys to reward employees:

Based on our continued strong performance, we will be making retroactive salary adjustments to all employees whose salary was reduced. Without the commitment and teamwork of our people, the firm’s ongoing success would not be possible.

Congratulations to everyone at Seyfarth on this fantastic news!

# Prominent Law Firm Paid Female Employees 30 Percent Less In Bonuses
## And women get 19 percent less in average hourly earnings.

This is the impact transparency can have. In compliance with a recent U.K. regulation requiring employers with over 250 employees to submit data on the gender pay gap, Silver Circle law firm Herbert Smith Freehills [reported](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/our-2017-uk-gender-pay-gap-report) that in 2017 women employees made 30 percent less in bonuses than male employees, and 19 percent less in average hourly earnings.

According to the firm, the attention grabbing difference is due to a difference in roles, with 22 percent of the women at the firm occupying secretarial roles. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/sites/legalweek/2018/01/08/herbert-smith-freehills-pays-out-30-less-in-bonuses-to-women-than-men/):

HSF said that its mean gender pay gap is skewed by the distribution of women and men within different types of roles in the firm. While gaps within each pay quartile are relatively small, the firm has a large proportion of women in the lower and lower middle quartiles, taking the female mean average down.

But here’s the bad news: even if you were to exclude employees in those roles, there would still be a pay gap of 8.8 percent. The (relatively) good news is that women employees were (slightly) more likely to receive a bonus than men — 77 percent of women got bonuses compared with 71 percent of men.

In a statement about the numbers, managing partner for the UK, US and EMEA, [Ian Cox](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/our-people/ian-cox), said:

We welcome the introduction of gender pay gap reporting as an important contributor to transparency, and we are committed to working to reduce or eliminate any gap that exists.

We are committed to gender diversity and the attraction, promotion and retention of women across all levels of the firm, and we will continue to ensure we attract a diverse pool of candidates to all types of job roles. As part of our ongoing work to foster gender balance across the firm, we monitor the gender impact of our reward processes, and we run a wide variety of initiatives aimed at helping all our employees reach their full potential.

But this isn’t the only bad news for the firm on the gender equality front. In 2014 the firm set a target that 25 percent of the partnership globally should be women by 2017, and while the overall percentage of women partners has increased, they’ve fallen short of that target, though they are clearly working on improving. As the firm’s report reveals:

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
In 2014, we set a target to have 30% women in our global partnership by 2019, with an interim target of 25% by 2017. Globally, 22.5% of our partners are women – up from 17.5% when we set the targets – and the majority of our global practice groups and regions have hit the interim target. In Business Services, we set a target that neither gender would represent more than 60% or fewer than 40% of senior roles. In 2017, women are in 54% of senior Business Services roles.

Part of the firm’s effort to address the pay gap includes a variety of networking opportunities for women, as well as a variety of other resources to ensure women are recruited and retained:

There are many other initiatives that underpin our efforts to address the gender pay gap – our agile working policy, for example, gives people greater flexibility and more control over how they work. In addition, we offer benefits such as childcare assistance and maternity ‘coaching’ – support for planning and managing the departure and return to work – to help people balance the demands of their professional and personal lives.

There is obviously still a gender-based pay gap at this and many other law firms. But it is only through transparency that we can begin to address the issue.

# Jones Day Wants Gender Discrimination Plaintiffs To Reveal Themselves To The Public
## The firm thinks that plaintiffs should be forced to come forward.

The Biglaw firm of Jones Day has a lot of irons in the gender discrimination fires. [Former partner Wendy Moore](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-hit-with-explosive-gender-discrimination-case/) filed lawsuits in both federal and state courts last year, alleging the firm’s infamous “black box” compensation system is used to pay women partners less than their male counterparts. [Last month, an additional lawsuit was filed against the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/jones-day-facing-second-class-action-lawsuit-over-fraternity-culture-of-the-firm/) by six former associates which also goes after the compensation system as well as what is described as the firm’s “fraternity culture.”

The associates’ lawsuit was filed by six plaintiffs, two named — Nilab Rahyar Tolton and Andrea Mazingo — and four anonymous. The Jane Doe plaintiffs received permission from U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Chief Judge Beryl Howell to use pseudonyms. But now Jones Day is objecting to the use of anonymous plaintiffs:

“For one thing, the court’s approval of the pseudonyms itself impugns Jones Day’s reputation by implying, without basis in evidence, that Jones Day would improperly retaliate against the Jane Does if their identities were made public,” the motion said. “For another, pseudonyms prevent the public—including clients, potential clients, lateral recruits, and law students—from fully evaluating the Does’ allegations and credibility.”

And, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/05/20/jones-day-presses-plaintiffs-to-go-public-in-latest-gender-bias-case/) Law.com, the Biglaw firm is also taking aim at the public relations strategy of the plaintiffs, which they argue makes keeping some of the complainants anonymous problematic:

Jones Day also said that the plaintiffs’ public relations strategy surrounding the lawsuit made protecting the identify of the four plaintiffs particularly inappropriate. The firm noted that while it has yet to be served with the complaint, the plaintiffs gave it to the media before it was filed, and the two other plaintiffs have spoken to the press about their reasons for bringing the suit. This, according to Jones Day, is unfair to both the firm and the public, who can’t assess the credibility of sources who are publicly attacking the firm without knowing their identify.

“Waging a public relations war is plainly a key part of plaintiffs’ litigation strategy,” it said.

In making the case to have the plaintiffs reveal themselves, Jones Day points to [another Biglaw gender discrimination case](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit-against-mofo-spirals-and-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/). The [pregnancy discrimination](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/mofo-hit-with-100-million-pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit/) lawsuit brought against Morrison & Foerster was filed by Jane Doe plaintiffs. In that case, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California has already made comments during a recent hearing suggesting the plaintiffs in the case cannot remain anonymous indefinitely and said the plaintiffs in Biglaw gender discrimination lawsuits were in the same position as any plaintiff who is named in an employment litigation.

Plaintiffs have until Thursday to respond to Jones Day’s motion.

# Biglaw Firm To Dump Kanye West As Client By Publishing Ads About It In Local Newspapers
## Biglaw firm forced to bid adieu to celebrity client in an interesting way.

What’s a Biglaw firm to do when it wants to part ways with a celebrity client who’s completely MIA? It looks like the answer here is to treat that celebrity like an average joe and take to the local newspapers to dump him.

That’s what’s currently going on between Greenberg Traurig and Ye (fka Kanye West). This past fall, Biglaw firm after Biglaw firm (i.e., [Brown Rudnick](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firm-passes-on-representing-kanye-west-after-rapper-refuses-to-back-away-from-antisemitic-remarks/); [Cadwalader](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/second-biglaw-firms-dump-kanye-west-over-antisemitic-remarks/); [Pryor Cashman](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firm-parts-ways-kanye-west/); and [Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/fourth-biglaw-firm-dumps-kanye-west-as-client/)) pulled the plug on their representation of the troubled musical icon following his antisemitic remarks. Greenberg Traurig — the fifth Biglaw firm (that we know of) that’s attempted to step away from Ye — has been [trying to withdraw](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/fifth-biglaw-firm-says-goodbye-to-kanye-west/) from the rapper’s ongoing matters for quite some time now, but it’s proven incredibly difficult due to the star’s seclusion in the wake of his outright praise for Hitler on Alex Jones’s “Infowars” show. [TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2023/01/16/kanye-west-lawyers-drop-client-newspaper-ad/) has the scoop:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
According to legal docs, obtained by TMZ, Greenberg Traurig, LLP claims there’s been “a breakdown in communication” with Kanye, as they attempt to let him know they’re off of the case. They say Ye apparently deactivated the phone number they previously used to get in touch with him.

As a result, the docs say the company’s looking to use “alternative means” to reach him … which includes putting ads out in 2 L.A.-based newspapers, and publishing the order from the judge, which allows them to withdraw from the case, for all to see.

The docs say the goal is to inform the rapper about the order — and seeing as he’s incommunicado, this is the best option left to give him notice. The firm says it’s aware the publication would “likely garner significant media attention, resulting in broader publication.”

Greenberg Traurig previously issued a statement on Ye’s comments, noting that the firm “condemn[s] antisemitism and all hate speech or bigotry, which is repugnant to the core values we believe in and live.” Hopefully with the widespread newspaper publication and media coverage of the firm’s withdrawal, GT will be able to wipe its hands of Ye and all of his hateful stances.

# Why You Shouldn’t Wait Until January To Start A Lateral Search
## So many candidates have the misconception that it’s best to wait until January. Allow me to address some of the main objections I hear to starting a fall lateral search.

With a month to go until Thanksgiving and two months until Christmas, I’ve lately been having similar conversations with many law firm associates. They’re interested in exploring a lateral move, they tell me, but it wouldn’t make sense to start the process this late in the year, right? Wrong!

In fact, now is the perfect time to start looking for lateral opportunities. Because so many candidates have the misconception that it’s best to wait until January, those who begin the process now will get a jump on the competition. And the odds are typically quite good that you won’t end up starting at your new firm until 2023, anyway.

Allow me to address some of the main objections I hear to starting a fall lateral search.

Wouldn’t it be weird to start a new job in December?

Many candidates envision themselves starting at a new firm in the midst of the holidays and don’t like that idea. But it’s important to understand that December start dates are typically less common than January start dates. Barring a scenario where your new practice group is exceptionally stretched and needs help as soon as possible, firms will typically be fine to have you start in the new year. All else equal, the new firm would rather that your current firm pay your 2022 bonus, so a January (or even February) start tends to work well for everyone.

What about my bonus?

Having already accrued most of their hours for the year, candidates are naturally averse to doing anything that would jeopardize their bonus. But this really should not be a concern. One of two things will happen. In the event the new firm is desperate for you to start immediately, it will make you whole on the bonus you sacrifice by leaving your current firm. More likely, as discussed above, the new firm will make it possible for you to collect your bonus from the current firm and then make the switch. There is an obvious financial incentive for them to do so.

Will firms even want to interview late in the year?

Candidates often assume that everything will slow down towards the end of the year, so if they apply now they risk entering a dead market. Although it’s certainly true that few firms conduct interviews in late December, the fall is a different story. New openings continue to arise in this period, and firms will also have unfilled searches from earlier in the year. With relatively few new candidates joining the market, there is a real opportunity to stand out in a window when firms are absolutely still looking to interview.

I’m tired. Can’t I just wait until January when I’ll have more energy?

It’s obviously important that you project a positive and energetic attitude when interviewing, so this is definitely a factor to consider. However, I find that candidates who are new to the lateral search process often imagine the experience will be more burdensome than it actually is. If you are feeling a little overwhelmed and you aren’t sure you’re up for a search right now, it’s still worth having an initial conversation with a recruiter. There is a randomness to when opportunities arise, especially if your practice is more specialized. It may happen that the recruiter knows about a current opening that could be an especially good fit for you. And you might find that hearing about that opportunity energizes you to a degree that you aren’t feeling now. Regardless, a 20-minute phone call will give you valuable individualized insight based on your specific practice area and market.

This … and this … and this … oh, yeah, this too.

Jordan Rothman’s [post about](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/youth-and-inexperience-can-be-a-resource-for-some-lawyers/) how being an inexperienced lawyer can be a good thing (yes, it can) reminded me of my very first criminal jury trial when I was a baby DA.

It was a petty theft case and there were two defendants, two defense lawyers, and me at the opposite table, alone. The police officer, also my investigating officer, was testifying about something he observed. I don’t remember what, but whatever he said was not in the copy of the police report provided to defense counsel.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Using what I always called the “jack in the box” method of objection, first one defense attorney and then the other jumped up and objected to the testimony since it was not in the police report. They both then moved for a mistrial. What was a mistrial? I was mystified, and so I asked the court for a brief recess, and raced out into the hallway, while I looked for the first deputy DA I could find. Fortunately, Harry was walking down the hall, and I dragged him into the courtroom while trying to explain the situation. The matter was resolved with the two defendants pleading to lesser charges, and I learned what a mistrial was.

Another DA colleague of mine was busy voir diring the prospective panel. She introduced herself to the venire. One of the prospective jurors asked if she didn’t use to be somebody else. Hmmm. Say what? No, she didn’t used to be somebody else, and that juror was excused.

There is so very much to learn as a lawyer, especially if you plan or do trial work. That is why preparation is key. I don’t think you can overprepare for trial. Trial notebooks, outlines of direct and cross, references to depositions, page and lines, references to written discovery, pinpointed, and on and on it goes. Understanding what objections may be made and how to rebut them. Trial prep and then the actual trial are not things you can do on the fly. Nor should you. Now your prep can all be contained on a laptop, instead of schlepping a multitude of boxes as in dinosaur days.

Every lawyer has a horror story about bar exam screw-ups; too bad if you are not in this group, as you have no horror story to share. What could be worse than bar exam horror stories? How about a [law school losing exams](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/law-school-wants-you-to-know-they-lost-your-exam-k-thx-bye/)? GWU lost some exam papers recently. Whoops. How could this happen? Easy-peasy. Except to the students whose exams were lost. Now what? Do these students have to retake the exam? Any reason to think that the exam papers might not be lost again? What confidence would the students have in any retaking? Same exam questions or different? How do you balance equities in this snafu?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While there are law schools that are strongly supportive of women as shown by this listing of the [best law schools for women](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/the-best-law-schools-for-women-2022/), the graduates need to practice for [30 years or so](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/if-trends-persist-there-wont-be-gender-parity-among-lawyers-arguing-at-7th-circuit-until-2059?utm_medium=email&utm_source=salesforce_474033&sc_sid=04744929&utm_campaign=weekly_email&promo=&utm_content=&additional4=&additional5=&sfmc_j=474033&sfmc_s=83087486&sfmc_l=1527&sfmc_jb=29017&sfmc_mid=100027443&sfmc_u=13798963) before there’s parity between men and women lawyers appearing before the Seventh Circuit. That’s not exactly an encouraging statistic.

A recent study in the 7th Circuit by the ABA Commission on the Status of Women reported that in 2009, 24% of the attorneys appearing in that circuit were women, and in 2019, only 28% of the attorneys appearing were woman. Hardly something to crow about. How to correct this gender imbalance? Law schools and firms that are considered best for women, in fact all law school and firms, should implement these suggestions:

- “Law schools should work to correct gender gaps in students’ experiences and achievements, should provide opportunities for hands-on argument experience, and should help women obtain federal clerkships.
- Law firms could provide appellate argument experience to female attorneys by allowing them to argue in court-appointed cases, by giving them credit for participating in pro bono cases, and by giving split argument time to senior and more junior attorneys.”
Oh, puhleez. Do these suggestions sound familiar? Of course they do; they are just a restating of what has come before, more times than any woman lawyer would care to count, for years and years, even decades. Frustrating? Of course. Explaining the obvious? Yet again. Has anything substantively changed since a 2015 report on the [dearth of women as lead trial counsel](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/women_underrepresented_in_lead_trial_lawyer_positions_aba_study_reports) in federal cases?

Are any other women lawyers as tired as I am in trying to change an incredibly hide-bound profession? Are we truly having any luck doing so? What else should we do? What else can we do? To me, it’s all just blather, rinse, repeat.

And now, as we careen into the new year with omicron all around us and delta refusing to let go, what will be the prognosis for women and minority lawyers in 2022? We’ll still be working from home, at least for a while, still exhausted from billing hours, still exhausted from zooming, still exhausted from parenting, still exhausted from watching over elders, while hoping for light at the end of this seemingly never-ending COVID tunnel.

And for all of you vaccination holdouts, stop whining and [get those shots](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/partner-quits-law-firm-over-vaccine-requirement-his-farewell-email-is-something-to-behold/).   Although we lawyers are not known for our empathy gene, concern and compassion should trump over selfishness. And, speaking of Trump, even the former president got his booster. What does that tell you?

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

Recently, I was cleaning out some of my old things, and I stumbled upon the offer letter I received for the first Biglaw job I had at the beginning of my career. The five-page offer letter included a lot of the expected legalese, such as my salary information, how bonuses would be calculated, and other matters. The offer letter also said that I would be considered for partnership eight years after starting work as an associate. As it turns out, I only worked at that shop for a little over a year, but reading that language reminded that most law firms used to stick to an eight-year partnership track. From discussions with my friends and colleagues, very few firms outside the elite shops still stick to an eight-year partnership track, and there are likely various reasons for this.

Perhaps the biggest reason is because partners these days seem less willing to share ownership of a law firm with other lawyers. In the past decade, positions not on the partnership track have flourished as law firms attempt to hire new attorneys without fear that these lawyers will one day share a piece of the ownership pie. In recent years, there has also been an explosion of two-tracked partnership systems at law firms as some partners are equity partners of a shop with an ownership stake and others are simply contract partners who pull a salary. Awarding partnership after longer periods of employment at a shop means that a firm does not have to give away its crown jewels to lawyers anytime soon and that attorneys really need to work hard to earn partnership.

Another reason why so few law firms seem to still stick to an eight-year partnership track is because numerous law firms have moved away from explicit and defined employment benefits. Many law firms have benefits from promising employees more fluid employment benefits so that expectations are low among those who work at a shop. For instance, I once worked at a law firm that did not have a defined vacation policy. The firm reasoned that everyone could take as much time as they wanted off from work so long as they completed all of their assignments.

At first, this seemed like a windfall, since employees could theoretically take off more time than at other shops. However, in practice, this meant that workers took far less time off from work since vacation benefits were not defined. This also meant that the firm did not need to pay workers for unused vacation time when workers left the firm since no employee had a defined amount of time they could take off for vacation each year.

This same law firm did not have a defined partnership track. Law firm management said that this was a benefit to workers, and that theoretically, associates could be elevated to partnership after say five years instead of the eight years that was standard at many shops. However, in practice, the lack of a defined partnership track meant that far fewer people were elevated to partner. Sometimes, the law firm would elevate more senior people to “of counsel” or similar positions, but in many instances, there were attorneys working at the law firm for a decade or longer who were in their 40s and were still being called associates. The lack of a defined partnership track made it easier for the law firm to deprive associates of a promotion since there were no expectations about when it was reasonable for someone to be promoted to partner.

Although some top firms still have an eight-year partnership track, many have moved to undefined and fluid time horizons for making partnership determinations. Such practices undoubtedly benefit management of law firms since it helps deprive attorneys of promotions and makes it more difficult for associates to bargain for better job opportunities.

# Leading Biglaw Firm Is One Of The First To Match Cravath's New Salary, Bonus Scale
## Biglaw compensation news is coming fast and furious, and now Paul Hastings, one of the most profitable firms in the world, is on board with raises and bonuses.

Cravath announced its [new salary scale and bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) earlier this afternoon, and Biglaw firms are finally weighing in with their own compensation updates.

We’ve now confirmed that Paul Hastings — which reported $1,665,983,000 in gross revenue and profits per partner of $4,891,000 in 2022 according to the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, as of February 1:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000

# Agonizing Over Low-Stakes Decisions
## Fish or chicken. Sidney or the bush. Yellow legal pads or white legal pads. It's a veritable thicket!

Should we buy the $5 billion company? Should we fire the CEO?

You should agonize over those decisions. They matter.

But there are low-stakes decisions.

Who should we call first about the threatened protest at our building — security or the other tenants? Shall we send Pirrip or Magwitch to the meeting? Should we buy white legal pads or yellow?

You should not agonize over those decisions. They don’t matter.

Remarkably, many people seem unable to tell the difference between decisions that matter and decisions that don’t.

Here’s the nasty part: The fact that decisions are low stakes doesn’t mean that they’re easy.

It could be very hard to decide whether to buy white legal pads or yellow.  The pads might have different absorbency or reflectivity characteristics.  Jarndyce might prefer white, while Summerson might prefer yellow. If we buy white, what will Summerson say? How will we answer? What will Summerson say next? Will Summerson be distraught?

Faced with a difficult — but low-stakes — decision, an intelligent person might well say: “Flip a coin, for God’s sake! We’ve already spent more time discussing this than the issue warrants. Let’s spend our time thinking about the high-stakes matters!”

But that intelligent person would surely be criticized: “Flip a coin? On a matter that affects this institution? And something that’s actually very difficult to decide? How dare you say such a thing? We must continue to debate this, on into the night, until we reach the right decision on the legal pad question!”

Let it go.

Think first about whether the decision makes any difference. If it doesn’t, just decide and be done with it.

On the other hand, if the decision does make a difference, then fret. It’s worth the effort.

Don’t get caught up in things that don’t matter.

(I read somewhere, but I can’t find a link, about a World War II handbook on how corporate executives stranded in Europe during the war, but supportive of the Allied cause, should contribute to the war effort. Those corporate officers, the manual said, should insist on debating every last item to exhaustion. No issue was too small to ignore. Once a decision was made, revisit it! Have people start the debate again. By debating and reconsidering every insignificant item, folks would ensure that no products were actually made, and the Nazi war effort would be crippled.

When you start to feel that way at your firm or corporation, advocate intelligence. Fret about the things that matter. For things that don’t matter, simply decide, and move on. You may have decided wrong, but you’ve decided. Remember: It doesn’t matter.)

As the summer associate season comes to a close, I’d like to share some intern stories that everyone may be able to relate to.

In past recruiting seasons, Above the Law has published some memorable [law student interview stories](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/5-on-campus-interview-fails-and-5-oci-tips-for-law-students-this-summer/) as well [as tips for how to survive OCI](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/04/11-tips-for-the-biglaw-interview-day/?rf=1). And of course, we have a slew of subsequent [summer associate stories](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/summer-associate-stories/) in our archives.

Whether it’s consulting, finance, medicine, media, or another apprenticeship experience, every summer cohort surely has memorable moments. This spring, an HBO [intern inadvertently sent a test email](https://scoop.upworthy.com/hbo-max-intern-email-mistake-overwhelming-support-goofing-interns-love-540481-540481) to the HBO Max mailing list. In a prompt follow-up, HBO Max [tweeted](https://twitter.com/maxhelp/status/1405712235108917249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1405712235108917249%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhbo-max-intern-test-email-mistake-subscribers-respond%2F):

We mistakenly sent out an empty test email to a portion of our HBO Max mailing list this evening. We apologize for the inconvenience, and as the jokes pile in, yes, it was the intern. No, really. And we’re helping them through it.

As highlighted by [UpWorthy](https://scoop.upworthy.com/hbo-max-intern-email-mistake-overwhelming-support-goofing-interns-love-540481-540481):

The internet responded by showering support on the anonymous intern, with many people, including celebrities, sharing their own stories of messing up at work. Monica Lewinsky, whose internship at the White House turned into a nightmare, rallied around the intern, [tweeting:](https://twitter.com/MonicaLewinsky/status/1405969371621638147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1405969371621638147%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fhbo-max-intern-test-email-mistake-subscribers-respond%2F) “Dear intern: it gets better,” followed by a heart emoji, adding. “ps. don’t wear a beret for a while, k?” she concluded, referencing the image of her wearing a beret and standing alongside then President Bill Clinton. It was one of the defining images of the scandal.

8yrs ago I changed the song you hear when placed on hold to “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer” for my entire organization, and then I couldn’t figure out how I did it, nor how to undo it. It’s still the hold song. 😳

[#dearintern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dearintern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) I accidentally blocked the entire United States from placing orders for 7 hours at a company I worked for. It prevented thousands of sales. I was promoted a year later.

[#DearIntern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DearIntern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), one year I typed an extra 0 for a giveaway, and instead of giving $400 in Groupon Bucks, we gave away $4,000 in Groupon Bucks — My mistake, their reward! 💚

Dear Intern,

When I was 25 I commented on different versions of an Annual Report. My email went to the whole company, including the CEO and board members. Instead of my subject line reading, I love all versions, it read, I LOVE ALL VIRGINS. And yes. It was in caps. [#dearintern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dearintern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

[#dearintern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dearintern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) I was once on a Teams call with a good friend and colleague. His Internet was acting up so I told him to call my desk phone. 30 seconds later it rang and I answered it with “alright knobhead”. It wasn’t him – it was one of our suppliers 😬

[#DearIntern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DearIntern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) years ago I had a hobbies section on my resume that I used to apply to dozens of jobs. One of them was “Cocking” instead of “Cooking.” Lesson learned, don’t put hobbies on your resume, focus on your achievements, strengths, and thoroughly proofread before sending.

Dear intern, one of our interns (from an Ivy League school) set up a new conference room in the NYC office. They peeled the film off the new tv only to realize it wasn’t the film, it was the actual tv screen. [#dearintern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dearintern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

When working as an intern for [@bigmachinemedia](https://twitter.com/bigmachinemedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) I forgot to bcc 100s of music bloggers email addresses. People replied en masse.

[#dearintern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dearintern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) I’m a recruiter and once after an interview, I accidentally emailed the candidate the notes I had made about them during the interview. Thankfully, he was really nice about it, but that could have gone very wrong.

I was once asked to deliver a time-sensitive document to a meeting going on involving senior leaders. I tried to sneak in unnoticed and set it on the desk, but my clunky necklace got caught on a metal garbage can lid and it clanged for a good 15-20 seconds. I was 24.

In my first job, I saved the day in a crunch by completing payroll for 7 national offices in record time, even overnighting paper checks to those without direct deposit.

Then the Controller asked me for the checks so he could sign them…

[#dearintern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dearintern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) my mobile was unlocked and in my pocket and I somehow butt-added the entire senior leadership team, including the CEO, on to my friends football WhatsApp group where everyone was dissing each other badly. 🥲

[#dearintern](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dearintern?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), just a few months ago, I was in a meeting that was not going well. My boss and I were messaging back and forth, when I suddenly had to share my screen and it was frozen on the exact slack thread where we had just called someone ridiculous. I’m still employed.

# Risky Business
## Risk has always been a part of every conversation, every strategy, every piece of advice that lawyers give clients. But now use of the word 'risk' is far more widespread, given the events of the past few months.

Consequences, schmonsequences …

Everyone is now assessing risk: to themselves, to family members, to the community, to friends, and so on. Every decision is now fraught with deciding whether it’s worth the risk to go to the store, to get gas, to hang out with a few friends while socially distancing, to run an errand or two. Do we send our kids back to school? Do we get tested? Do we mask up? How to evaluate risk in each one of those situations? “What do you think?” “What do YOU think?”

Everyone is worried about the coronavirus and with good reason. How do you determine what your risk is just by doing normal, or at least what were normal, things pre-pandemic? We didn’t give a second thought to grocery shopping, going to the ATM, opening packages from Amazon, going to work, or going to court. Now, every decision is fraught with some sort of risk assessment as to the possible jeopardy of doing those very mundane tasks. We took for granted hanging out in the courthouse hallways, the cafeteria, schmoozing with counsel that we saw in the courtrooms, and standing in line at the Starbucks without a second thought as to whether there was any risk. There was then. This is now.

The internet has exploded with articles about assessing risk in this time of the pandemic. Just Google “risk assessment” and links abound about the coronavirus and risk. There are lots of questions and no good answers, at least for those who are trying to wend their ways through thickets of information, some good, some not so good.

Deciding how to manage your practice and your clients during this time is not easy. Lots of courts are encouraging counsel to appear remotely, which, while attractive to some, is not appealing to all. Thinking of my court system — the largest trial court system in the country — and how to navigate in-person appearances can be daunting. Only those with business before the court should be there. While masks are required, the court is not requiring temperature checks, but hospitals and medical offices are.

Pondering risk and possible outcomes has taken different meanings now. We have always told clients the “risks versus rewards” of going to trial or resolving it. Risk looks different now. Do we continue working from home as the virus spikes across the country?

In assessing risk, what are the options? Is the client better off rolling the dice at trial? What does the client think will happen? As we all well know, client expectations often have little to do with the reality at hand. Getting the client off that ledge is often an essential part of our jobs.

What are the possible outcomes? It’s often good to create a decision tree, but in the case of coronavirus, which is akin to whack-a-mole, outcomes can be hard to predict and even more uncertain today when prospective jurors are more loathe than ever to report for jury duty.

What does the client believe about the possible outcomes? If your client thinks that you will win summary judgment and wants to be in the courtroom with you when you argue the motion, then you will be in that courtroom, whether you want to be or not. Perhaps telling the client that the court strongly urges the use of technology for remote appearances might help.

Every decision carries some degree of uncertainty. The issue then becomes — and this is personal to everyone — what is your tolerance for ambiguity, for risk? That’s the question we ask every client and ourselves.

The presiding judge here in Los Angeles has issued a [new emergency order](http://www.lacourt.org/newsmedia/uploads/14202071016373320NRGODELAYINGJURYTRIALSUNTILAUGUST.pdf) continuing matters until August 8, 2020. Given how the virus has exploded in Los Angeles County, that date may be extended. Notice the headline in the news release: “Covid 19 pandemic continues unabated.” How does that headline affect your definition of risk?

Wear a mask? It’s required in the Los Angeles County courtrooms, but there are inconsistencies in other courthouses around the state. For example, in San Joaquin County, in the middle of the state’s farmland, a deputy public defender toured every open Superior Court department to check for compliance. Although there’s a [statewide mask order extant](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf), compliance has not been 100 percent, especially [among law enforcement](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-11/courts-masks-coronavirus-public-defenders). When you go to court, do you take an inventory of compliance? Perhaps you should, since the risk of going without a face covering is high.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Is it safe to sit for a bar exam in one of [those states](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/over-1500-sign-letter-demanding-new-york-high-court-hold-bar-exam-hearing/) that insists on going forward with a July bar exam? Your future or your life? Which is it?

The Los Angeles Times has endorsed the concept of provisional “diploma privilege” for the 2020 law school graduates. The newspaper, echoing the words of many law school deans and professors, opines that “graduating from an accredited law school must surely count for something.” Yes, it should, but there are a number of unaccredited law schools in California. What happens to those graduates?

And then, after the dust has settled on this year’s exam agonies, the Times suggests that it is time to rethink [the entire rationale](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-14/law-student-diploma-privilege) for the bar exam.

It’s up to the California Supreme Court and the Committee of Bar Examiners to decide what to do about this year’s bar exam. Those two groups are surely doing a risk assessment as well. Access to justice or public protection?

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

SG Prelogar speaking at 3d Cir Judicial Conf suggests counsel should recognize that some turns of phrase should be left on the cutting room floor. Hypothetical, no doubt.

— David R. Fine (@finedr1965) [May 11, 2023](https://twitter.com/finedr1965/status/1656463425210384384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

–Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar taking the high road addressing [Hot Mess-gate](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/paul-weiss-solicitor-general-elizabeth-prelogar-hot-mess/). Paul Weiss partner Kannon Shanmugam turned in a Supreme Court brief that described Prelogar’s arguments as a “hot mess,” managing to be disrespectful and embrace sexist tropes at the same time. These remarks provide a decent lesson in how to craft a devastating response without straying from professionalism.

Today, we’ve got some unfortunate news from the Stanford Law School community, where a rising third-year law student was found dead shortly after having accepted an offer to join Wachtell Lipton as an associate after graduation.

Born in Berlin, Germany, [Leon Cain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonmcain/), 27, was a 2013 graduate of the University of Southern California and would have been a 2019 graduate of Stanford Law, where he served as editor-in-chief of the school’s Journal of Law, Business, & Finance and as a board member of the school’s Black Law Students Association. Prior to his first year at Stanford, Cain, who was “[p]assionate about increasing diversity in the legal field,” worked at O’Melveny & Myers as an SEO Fellow in a program that provided diverse incoming law students the opportunity to preview Biglaw employment opportunities. Following his first year of law school, he joined Munger Tolles as a summer associate, and this past summer, he spent his summer at Wachtell. [Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/09/10/wachtell-summer-associates-cause-of-death-remains-unclear/) has additional information on Cain’s death:


Leon Cain (Photo via LinkedIn)

At 8:55 a.m. Aug. 19, emergency medical personnel were called after a concierge at the luxury apartment complex, the Woodward Building, was alerted to an unconscious person on the building’s second-floor terrace, according to a report by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington. Cain was found unresponsive and subsequently declared dead at the scene.

Cain was later transferred to the medical examiner’s office. The details and cause of his death have not yet been released, but police confirmed that a detective has been assigned to investigate his death.

Wachtell issued this statement after learning of Cain’s death: “[Cain] was a very successful member of our summer class and we were looking forward to having him join the firm as a full-time associate next year. We mourn his passing.”

In Cain’s [obituary](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=leon-m-cain&pid=190165660), his family refers to his death as a “tragic accident.” They have created a [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/Leon-Cain-fund-for-black-law-students) to support the Leon Cain Scholarship Fund for Aspiring Black Law Students. A memorial service will be held at Stanford Law on October 14.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our condolences to Leon Cain’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

# Law Firms Should Consider Eliminating Weekly Time-Entry Deadlines
## Firms usually have different kinds of punishment if an attorney does not record their billable time by the deadline.

Numerous law firms have administrative chores that all attorneys need to complete in order to fulfill management expectations. Many law firms have attorney evaluations that associates need to complete on an annual or more-frequent basis, and other shops have business development tasks that attorneys need to carry out in order to satisfy requirements. One of the most ubiquitous requirements of many firms is that attorneys need to log their billable hours by a certain time every week. Since bills are usually sent to clients on a monthly basis, I always wondered why so many law firms have the somewhat arbitrary deadline of requiring attorneys to record their time on a weekly basis.

Each firm I worked at [before starting my own shop](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com) had a weekly deadline for recording billable time for a given week. Some firms made this deadline on Fridays, and other more forgiving firms made this deadline on a Monday so that attorneys had a little extra time after a week had concluded to record their time. Firms usually have different kinds of punishment if an attorney does not record their billable time by the deadline. Sometimes, the punishment was different managers coming by the attorney’s office and telling the attorney that expectations were not satisfied, kind of like that scene in “Office Space.”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
At some law firms at which I worked, the punishment for failing to submit time entries each week was severe. One firm gave every attorney one free pass per year for not recording their time entries by the deadline. However, each time after that, the attorney would lose a percentage of their bonus for each instance that they missed the deadline. If you wanted to provide an excuse for not meeting the billing deadline and retain full bonus eligibility, you had to write a memo to the Executive Committee of the firm, which was a daunting task. At another one of the firms I worked, each week, a firmwide email would go out listing all of the attorneys who did not record their time entries by the weekly deadline. This was pretty embarrassing since people would often poke fun at the attorneys who blew the deadline because these folks were outed in front of the whole firm.

There are a few reasons off the top of my head for why a weekly billable hours deadline makes sense. For one, this can make it less likely that attorneys will forget what tasks they performed, and accordingly, help attorneys bill for more time. We have all probably had to go through the process of reconstructing what we did in a given day far in the future, and this is not a pleasant task. Sure, you can review emails and phone logs to get a rough idea of what you did for clients in a given day, but this only captures so much. By requiring attorneys to log and submit time entries every week, law firms can ensure that attorneys are less likely to forget tasks they completed.

However, attorneys have billable hour requirements at most firms, and it is in their best interest to record as many hours as possible. As a result, they usually do not need an artificial deadline to ensure that the most amount of hours are billed. Accordingly, trying to ensure robust billable entries should not justify a weekly billable hour deadline.

Another reason why many firms may have weekly billable hour requirements is so that they can keep tabs on attorneys more frequently. Receiving reports each week can help managers figure out which attorneys are too busy with work and which attorneys may need more work. This can help managers know whom to give assignments to in order to ensure more efficient workflow. Moreover, if an attorney is not billing enough hours, managers can intervene sooner with a weekly billable hour deadline to ensure that the attorney knows that they are not meeting expectations and that they should bill more hours.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
However, billable hour requirements at many firms ensure that attorneys have an incentive to seek out more work if they need it. In addition, by setting expectations about how many hours an attorney needs to bill in a year, lawyers should know from the get-go if they are meeting — or failing to meet — expectations. Accordingly, it seems like weekly billable hour deadlines just create a hardship without solving problems.

I would love to hear from law firm partners and administrative professionals about why so many shops have weekly billable hour requirements. Perhaps law firm bosses do not realize that such deadlines can impose huge hardships on attorneys, especially if they unexpectedly cannot complete work tasks, are on vacation, or are facing a deadline with life matters that prevent them from easily submitting time entries. Law firms should only impose deadlines on attorneys if they are absolutely needed, and it seems like most shops can dispense with weekly billable hour entry deadlines.
