# Biglaw Firms Want Associates Back In The Office -- Will Mandates Work?
## If you want to really piss off associates, mandates are the way to do it.

‘You can’t force me to go back to the office!’

You can’t treat an associate who bills 2,400 hours like they are on a factory floor. If you insist on factory rules, you’ll get factory results.

— [Tom Sharbaugh](https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/faculty/sharbaugh), a professor of practice at Penn State Law, commenting in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/09/09/how-will-law-firms-enforce-their-office-returns-in-the-fall-very-carefully/), on the delicate way that Biglaw firms must handle their return-to-office edicts for associates. Many associates are motivated by having autonomy in their work lives, he said, and enacting office-return mandates is sure to sour associates’ relationships with their jobs.

The folks at McGuireWoods remain silent on the subject of raises ([by design](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/these-partners-desperately-dont-want-us-to-know-they-arent-raising-salaries/)), but they have something almost as exciting in store for their associates: made-up trophies!

Because nothing says sincere appreciation like the [First Annual Montgomery Burns Award For Outstanding Achievement In The Field Of Excellence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxgkb_lYJJE).

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
McGuireWoods is having an associate information meeting on July 18th to discuss “the Non-Equity Partnership Admissions Process and to announce the McGuireWoods Excellence Award winners.” No mention of associate salaries.

The McGuireWoods Excellence Award! While this isn’t a new invention to stave off salary pressure, announcing a meeting to figure out which associates worked so very very hard that they deserve a $40 plaque while loafers at other firms are handed $20K raises is more than a little tone-deaf. Announcing awards while associates are already grumbling that the firm trying to short them is really shining a spotlight on how your firm shows its appreciation, and it’s not a pretty picture.

Trophies are, after all, a time-honored tradition in the public sector to shower plaques on employees to justify paying them far below market. If you doubt this, step into the office of any former AUSA in your firm and check out how many office decorations say something like, “Best Prosecution of A Guy Named Tom With A Nose Piercing In 2006.” But the private sector is, ostensibly, capable of rewarding employees with a little more.

But take heart, McGuireWoods associates: if you worked really, really hard this year, you might not get paid, but you could have a nice plaque to throw on the fire to warm you through those chilly nights.

# Lex Machina Has Achieved Another Great Win For Legal Analytics With The Introduction Of Appellate Analytics
## Tackling appeals has historically been difficult and time-consuming for attorneys, and now Lex Machina has the technology to hone in on key aspects of appeals documents and pull out accurate information to help your case.

As the practice of law has become increasingly data-driven, [Lex Machina](https://lexmachina.com/) has been leading the charge to create tools that utilize data to the fullest, which provide superior insights to attorneys advising their clients in litigation.

Now, in one of their largest product releases yet, Lex Machina has added [Appellate Analytics](https://lexmachina.com/practice-areas/federal-appellate-litigation/) to its Legal Analytics platform, providing even more valuable information to attorneys crafting successful litigation strategies to win cases. Practitioners have requested appellate data, and Lex Machina delivered by layering 400,000 circuit court cases on top of the 3.2 million district cases already available in their database.

The wealth of appellate information now available from Lex Machina allows you to understand the entire history of your cases in a way that is unparalleled. This enhances your ability to provide the best possible strategies and advice to your clients.

##The Difficulty in Tracking Appeals
Tackling appeals has historically been difficult and time-consuming for attorneys.  For example, simply determining which judges presided over a given appellate case can be a challenge. PACER lacks a field for specifying the identity of the panel members who ruled on appeals cases, and the membership of specific appellate panels may vary widely.

Given their complete data set of underlying civil district court cases, Lex Machina was in the best position to bring appellate data to the market. Lex Machina has the technology to hone in on key aspects of appellate documentation and extract the relevant and accurate information. 

By matching appellate data with its comprehensive existing dataset, Lex Machina allows practitioners to derive a complete and accurate understanding of the history of any given case by easily navigating between what happened in district court and on appeal.

While Lex Machina is widely known for their detailed graphs and metrics, they also ensure the availability of the underlying documentation. The opinions, underlying briefs, and other documents are critical to generating the information available through Appellate Analytics, and Lex Machina provides those documents to users as well. You can search relevant appeals along various metrics, such as by judge or originating practice area. Then you can click through to the supporting documents to understand the full picture.

##How Appellate Analytics Enhances the Legal Analytics Platform
One of the most powerful use cases for Appellate Analytics, and one that is highly valued by users, is the ability to understand the reversal rates of specific judges.

[](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/Lex%20Machina%20Product%20Review%209.14.22/appeals_image1.png)

To begin, you can search for a specific district court judge to access their analytics.

The judge page includes total civil federal district court cases the judge presided over and the subset of cases where they were the originating judge of the appealed decision. The U.S. District Judge Dolly M. Gee of the C.D. in California has 6,326 federal district court cases of which 363 have been appealed.

[](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/Lex%20Machina%20Product%20Review%209.14.22/appeals_image2_reversalRates.png)

If you scroll down past the experience and case types that have been core components of Lex Machina’s district court Legal Analytics for judges, you’ll now see reversal rates for each specific district court judge. Appellate Analytics extracts data from the decisions of each district court judge that was appealed in Lex Machina’s 18 practice areas. The data is then used to create appellate outcome analytics, so you know whether the case went to final decision on appeal, and if so, whether the decision was reversed, affirmed, reversed in part, or affirmed in part.

Reversal rates are calculated by dividing the number of court of appeals cases that were Reversed or Affirmed / Reversed in Part this judge’s rulings by the number of court of appeals cases that Reversed,  Affirmed / Reversed in Part, or Affirmed this judge’s rulings. U.S. District Judge Dolly M. Gee of the C.D. in California has a reversal rate of 18%. 

[](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/Lex%20Machina%20Product%20Review%209.14.22/appeals_image3_reversalRates.png)

You can also see how each district court judge’s reversal rate compares to other judges in the same court, in terms of whether their reversal rate is high, low, or somewhere in the middle.

Reversal rate compared to other judge’s in that federal district court. Each bar represents a judge whose rulings have been affirmed or reversed in at least 10 court of appeals cases. Compared to other judges, U.S. District Judge Dolly M. Gee of the C.D. in California has a reversal rate on the lower end (19%) compared to other judges in the district and to the median (28%).

From here, you can link to reversals for your judge and take a look at those appeals cases in the circuit courts. You can filter down the appellate decisions for a particular judge based on area of law, date, and more, and you can further refine it to focus only on reversals. Once you’ve honed in on the most relevant reversals, the job of reviewing that universe of cases is much more manageable, allowing you to derive a clear sense of how your particular issue might fare on appeal. So, for example, if you find out that your particular judge has only an 18% reversal rate on rulings similar to yours, you can take that critical strategy information back to your client. The insights from Appellate Analytics is at once very granular as well as wide-ranging in breadth of coverage, in order to provide the most accurate, comprehensive picture of your case.

The appellate data from Lex Machina is also presented in the traditional format employed for district court analytics, with pink reversal tags that alert you to appellate outcomes from the start.

In this example federal district court case, Lex Machina’s practice area specific outcome coding of Environmental Findings are summarized. Findings are vetted through appeal with a judgment on the pleadings that was reversed, and then the case proceeded to rulings on summary judgment.

With the addition of Appellate Analytics, Lex Machina helps you understand and access the details of any case, in order to know the full story of what happened from start to finish, all the way from district court through all appeals and back again.

Another way to use Appellate Analytics is to begin your search in the circuit court data to understand what happened in other similar appeals involving your area of law. First, you can start by honing in on a particular circuit and select from the many filters that allow you to tailor your search.

Case search for Appeals Cases is empowered by the array of filters available in the list on the left.

In Appellate Analytics, you receive information on timing of appellate rulings, reversal rates, and termination patterns, which are color-coded (in favor of the appellant (red) or the appellee (blue), or if cases settled before decision (green) or had a procedural resolution(yellow)). Supreme Court activity  is clearly indicated.
Appellate Analytics for Case Resolutions summarize how the case was resolved, including whether the case resulted in an Appellant Win, an Appellee Win, a Likely Settlement, or a Procedural Resolution. To see the detailed story, you can always open up the case’s page.

You may also filter an entire court’s pool of cases by the parties or law firms involved, in order to assess how much experience they have on appeal before this particular court, as well as viewing the outcome of those cases. Essentially, Appellate Analytics provides the entire picture of what happened in a case through final appeal, with the ability to filter that information to most closely match the specifics of your own case.

Legal Analytics from Lex Machina has always been a powerful tool for understanding the big picture of federal litigation. With the addition of Appellate Analytics, they’ve made an already-indispensable tool even stronger. By capitalizing on their complete, superior existing district court data set, Lex Machina has changed the litigation analytics playing field once more by introducing Appellate Analytics.

Whether you’re looking to understand what happened in a particular federal case, before a particular federal judge, or in a federal court as a whole, there’s no better way to understand the full history of a case through final appeal than with Appellate Analytics from Lex Machina. If you represent clients in federal court, you need Appellate Analytics in your toolkit.

Stick It to the Man is to inspire people. The solution is to not wring your hands and complain. It’s to express your opinion.

— [Neel Chatterjee](https://www.orrick.com/People/9/0/8/I-Neel-Chatterjee), an Orrick IP partner, [on creating a new “practice group”](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/12/07/postelection-orrick-litigator-vows-to-stick-it-to-the-man/) after the election of Donald Trump (called Stick It To The Man or SITTM) in order to harness the power of lawyers in opposing the potential polices of the president-elect. Chatterjee is also known for his Orrick business cards that say, under his name, “Partner and very handsome man.”

# Associates Will Soon Be Making Even More Bank At This Biglaw Firm
## But some of them might not be receiving their bonuses...

Guess which Biglaw firm finally decided that it was time to join in on this summer’s salary games, “consistent with recent market changes”? It’s none other than Skadden Arps, hooray! Given the fact that the firm’s partners are bringing in about $3.471 million each, it would’ve been a bit of Skaddenfreude for the firm NOT to have raised all associates salaries and handed out summer bonuses.

Just in case you’ve somehow forgotten what the new salary scale is, we’ll provide it:

- Class of 2017: $190,000 / $5,000
- Class of 2016: $200,000 / $7,500
- Class of 2015: $220,000 / $10,000
- Class of 2014: $255,000 / $15,000
- Class of 2013: $280,000 / $20,000
- Class of 2012: $305,000 / $25,000
- Class of 2011: $325,000 / $25,000
- Class of 2010 and Senior: $340,000 / $25,000

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
For what it’s worth, per sources, some associates at Skadden may not receive their summer bonus after all:

I should note that people are confused and upset about having an explicit hours target tied to the special bonus. I’ve already received a half dozen emails and texts from colleagues trying to figure out how this will work. It strikes me as a little unfair and unnecessary; it’s not uncommon to have a slow quarter or two and then bill 700 hours the next quarter. There will certainly be associates who will be screwed out of their summer bonus due to the cyclical nature of their practice and no fault of their own.

Yikes! Hope you’ve got your hours in, Skaddenites. On the bright side, summers are getting more money, so that’s something.

(Flip to the next page to see Skadden’s memo in full.)

# Will Doing Away With The Billable Hour Cure Biglaw’s Mental Health Crisis?

If we want to improve the shared mental health of our profession, we must change our incentives. We must change how we practice law at law firms today.

I am tired of seeing our best and brightest suffer from the pressures we create by our own incentives. I am tired of watching friends suffer. I am tired of seeing good partners, talented associates, and top-notch staff fight each other and fight their own worst impulses—because that is, most fundamentally, what our industry is motivating them to do.

I know we can change and thrive. Let’s transform our profession into one that encourages and fosters mental and physical well-being and that views both as utterly compatible with productivity, performance, and profit.

— [Jana Cohen Barbe](https://www.dentons.com/en/jana-barbe), a senior partner at Dentons, in an open letter published by American Lawyer, where she argues that Biglaw firms must change not only the [structure of the billable hour](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/31/open-letter-from-dentons-partner-the-mental-health-crisis-requires-rethinking-firm-business-models/?LikelyCookieIssue=true), but also the way performance metrics are evaluated, in order to make a difference in the mental health crisis that the legal profession is currently facing.

NY Congressman Chris Collins, a.k.a. ‘Blue Horseshoe’

Congressman Chris Collins (R-NY, which I didn’t know was still a thing) was arrested this morning on charges of insider trading.

Collins represents a district in upstate New York and was a perfectly obscure elected official, until he hitched his wagon to the Trump train. Collins was the first sitting member of Congress [to publicly endorse Donald Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/21/once-obscure-rep-chris-collins-sees-his-star-rise-trump/98211040/). Collins was emphatic that Trump should not be required to release his tax returns. So, keep in mind Trump’s pardon power as we discuss Collins’s legal troubles.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The allegations against Collins represent one of the most simple insider trading “schemes” you’ll ever read about. Collins serves as a board member for Australian biotech company Innate Immunotherapeutics. Collins allegedly received information about a failed drug trial from Innate Immunotherapeutics. According to the Department of Justice, Collins then called his son, Cameron Collins, and gave him the information. Cameron passed the information to his fiancee’s father, Stephen Zarsky, and both men traded on the non-public information.

Innate Immunotherapeutics’ stock price plummeted after the failed trial was made public. Our partners at Med City News [have some great reporting about Innate Immunotherapeutics](https://medcitynews.com/2018/08/gop-congressman-arrested-on-biotech-insider-trading-charges/).

Again, that’s as textbook an “insider trading” allegation as you are likely to see: Collins, the “insider,” passed material non-public information to his boy, who then traded on that market-beating information.

Chris Collins ran for office on the strength of his business acumen. He’s a former CEO. But now, Collins would like the public to think that he doesn’t know what insider trading is at all. He’s being represented by Baker Hostetler, and the firm [put out this statement](https://chriscollins.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/statement-from-jonathan-barr-and-jonathan-new-baker-hostetler) after Collins’s arrest:

“We will answer the charges filed against Congressman Collins in Court and will mount a vigorous defense to clear his good name. It is notable that even the government does not allege that Congressman Collins traded a single share of Innate Therapeutics stock. We are confident he will be completely vindicated and exonerated.

Congressman Collins will have more to say on this issue later today.”

No, the government does not need to allege that Collins traded “a single share” of stock… because you do not need to trade a single share of stock to be guilty of insider trading, AND YOU GODDAMN WELL KNOW THAT, Baker Hostetler. Collins is in a safe Republican district (to the extent that any Republican congressional districts are “safe” this cycle). But this press release here suggests that he’s banking on the good people of the Finger Lakes region to be too stupid to know how insider trading laws work.

Ultimately, I imagine Collins’s defense strategy will be “Can’t a man talk to his own son without the GOVERNMENT hassling him? Back when America was great, a father could pass on material non-public information to his kin and it was called ‘super time,’ not an illegal conspiracy to defraud the market!”

[We have been here before in the recent past](https://dealbreaker.com/2016/08/sean-stewart-robert-stewart-insider-trading/). New York banker Sean Stewart was accused of passing material non-public information to his father, Robert Stewart. Sean alleged that [his dad betrayed him](https://nypost.com/2016/08/04/ex-banker-says-insider-trading-father-betrayed-him/) and traded on that information, without the knowledge of his son. Robert took a plea, but Sean went to trial with his sad story. [Sean Stewart was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-insidertrading-idUSKBN15W29E).

If Congressman Collins comes up with a similar story of family betrayal, it might work on some voters. He’ll probably get re-elected. But eventually, he’ll probably go to jail.

# Get Your Popcorn! Upcoming Trials!
## Donald Trump and his many upcoming court appearances...

Let’s set aside for a moment the threatened criminal cases against Donald Trump — by the Manhattan district attorney for payments to Stormy Daniels; the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney for interfering with an election; the DOJ for mishandling of documents at Mar-a-Lago; the DOJ for activities leading up to January 6; and the attorney general of the District of Columbia for inciting violence on January 6.

Whew!  You’d think that were enough to track! But, as I said, I’m setting all that aside.

Here are the civil cases, so far as I can tell, that have trial dates set, so it’s time to buy your popcorn:

First up is the case by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News, alleging that Fox knowingly or recklessly made defamatory statements about Dominion while covering the aftermath of the November 2020 election. This should be a good one! The witness list involves all of Fox’s stars, as well as Rupert Murdoch and Paul Ryan. There have been emails produced during discovery that should make excellent fodder for cross-examination. The trial is set to begin in just three weeks — on April 17! — and to run for roughly five weeks. Life’s gonna get interesting!

Next comes the case by [E. Jean Carroll alleging sexual battery](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8150702839481910182#) followed by alleged defamatory statements by Trump. Shoot! This trial may interfere with your viewing of the Dominion case; this one starts on April 25. Okay — watch the Dominion case during the day, and then tape the Carroll case, so you can watch it at night. You won’t sleep much, but you’ll get plenty of drama.

(I’m just kidding. I suspect, but don’t know, that few, if any, of these trials will be publicly broadcast. You’ll have to settle for reports by folks who were in the courtroom.)

You can take the summer off from your political trial-watching.

But come back this fall for more action!

The case by Attorney General of New York Letitia James against Trump and his business empire is set for trial on October 2, and the judge has promised that the trial will begin on that day “[come hell or high water](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/8150702839481910182#).” The judge will hear that case without a jury, so it’s quite likely to begin on the promised start date. But a nonjury case involving many complex business transactions is a different sort of beast; the trial will last a long time, may not run on consecutive days, and is likely to be tedious in parts. On the other hand, the days when Donald Trump, and Eric Trump, and Trump CFO Allen Weisselberg testify will be a hoot, as will the days when Michael Cohen, and the accountants from Mazars, and the bankers from Deutsche Bank are on the stand.

It’s hard to handicap that case, because the facts are so complex and the damages so hard to calculate, but it’s a fair bet that this lawsuit will be the first one to threaten Trump with serious economic damages.

I can hardly wait.

Then we run into cases that will probably go to trial toward the end 2023 or early 2024 but for which no trial dates have yet been set: Dominion Voting Systems against Rudy Giuliani for defamation; and the separate case of Dominion versus Sydney Powell; and the separate case of Dominion versus the My Pillow guy, Mike Lindell.

In fall 2024, we’ll probably see Smartmatic versus One America News Network, a defamation case alleging that OANN defamed Smartmatic. Smartmatic is accused of providing software to Dominion. Smartmatic also was supposedly founded by Hugo Chavez, and is owned by George Soros, and Lord knows what else. That should be a doozy.

So far as I can tell, no trial dates have yet been set for cases in which Eric Swalwell, a member of the House of Representatives, has sued Trump for his conduct on January 6; the three separate Smartmatic cases against Giuliani, Powell, and Lindell; and the two Smartmatic cases against other broadcasting networks — Smartmatic against Newsmax; and Smartmatic against Fox.  (Dominion has done a fair amount of the legwork for Smartmatic for its case against Fox, uncovering evidence that reflects poorly on Fox’s state of mind. But I really don’t know exactly what Fox said on the air about Smartmatic, which of course lies at the heart of a defamation case.) There are also cases by Dominion against the networks other than Fox: Dominion versus Newsmax and Dominion versus One America News Network.

Did I mention that some folks on the Capitol Police force have filed a case about the events of January 6? And, in a separate case, some folks on the Metropolitan Police force have filed a similar lawsuit?

And Karen Bass, and other members of the House of Representatives, are suing Trump for conspiring to prevent Congress from counting the electoral votes on January 6?

And, since I’m only human — and I’m getting tired — there are undoubtedly more that I’ve missed.

I draw three conclusions from all of this: First, we’ll see some fine political drama on television for the next couple of years. Second, it’s no wonder that the judiciary is overwhelmed. Lastly, you’ll have to start working out harder than usual for the foreseeable future, given how much popcorn you’ll be eating.

# Betting Boldly In A Bear Market
## If your firm wants to survive the coming years, start thinking like Warren Buffett.

The story of the stock market during the Great Recession doesn’t take long to tell. The markets crashed hard, with the S&P 500 dropping by roughly 50% in 2008. The economy continued to suffer through 2009 until a combination of stimulus, tax policy, and old-fashioned hard work served as the defibrillator-like jolt the economy needed to come back to life. By 2013, the market had regained its losses, and it continued trending upward until this year.

Unfortunately, during that 2007-09 bear market, many spooked investors cashed out to wait for more favorable conditions. By the time many felt comfortable investing again, the upswing was in full effect, and the price to re-enter the market was high. Not only had these overly cautious investors lost a huge portion of their starting wealth, they had also missed a crucial part of the recovery and ended up poorer long-term as a result. The average investor sold low and bought high, while those who sold their stock at the trough of the market made out like bandits.

Both these stories are quick to tell and easy to understand. So why does Biglaw seem hell-bent on repeating those same mistakes today?

Turtling Up

Don’t get me wrong, there’s every reason to be skittish right now about our country’s economic prospects. The American economy is woozy and wary, maybe even a little punch drunk. Things haven’t gone as apocalyptically bad as some expected, but it’s still been rough. The other shoe is currently set to drop at the end of this week, when [federal unemployment benefits halt](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/last-day-for-600-unemployment-benefits-is-likely-this-weekend.html), with no extension likely to happen in the short-term. While pharmaceutical companies are making progress on a COVID-19 vaccine faster than any other in history, it’s still unlikely we’ll have one by the end of the year.

When we’re sitting in the middle of a once-in-a-century adverse event like COVID-19, it’s both instinctual and easy to play defense. Cutting costs and eliminating redundancies are evergreen strategies, but they’re especially easy sells in a bear market. Halting capital expenditures and investment in the long-term is par for the course. Many businesses are hoarding cash (sometimes literally — there’s a [national shortage of loose change](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/21/880958665/the-latest-pandemic-shortage-coins-are-the-new-toilet-paper)).

More than anything, though, our instinct seems to be to simply freeze in place while we see how things develop. COVID-19 and its uncertainties have caused law firms to massively [slow down](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-law-lateral-market-may-face-shelter-in-place-moment) [lateral hiring](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/05/28/pandemic-slows-lateral-hiring-as-firms-look-for-guaranteed-winners/) and [mergers. ](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/07/01/covid-19-brings-law-firm-mergers-to-a-halt/)Large infrastructure-building projects are being paused, and expansion efforts are being put on hold. Fear has caused our industry to freeze like a deer in the headlights — which, it must be noted, traditionally doesn’t work out too well for the deer.

Reading The Room

Running a business is about balancing risk and reward. Even in a pandemic, however, the laws of supply and demand remain in effect. There are millions of other actors in the economy making their own risk-reward decisions in real time, and those decisions in the aggregate affect any decision you’re setting out to make. When a horde of investors want a single stock, that stock gets more expensive to buy.

From a management perspective, this means when the competition is putting its resources into playing it “safe,” in many real ways it becomes more costly for you to do the same. You may get more bang for your buck by getting aggressive, since doing so is likely cheaper than usual. Conversely, when the market as a whole is going full bull, safe investments may be underpriced and more worthy of your time. When everyone else is paying a premium to zig, the cost of zagging goes down.

Many, many people lost their homes, livelihoods, and hope in the wake of the collapse of mortgage-backed securities, but a number of savvy investors made big bets, and gargantuan profits, during the uncertainty that followed. Warren Buffett put $5 billion into a battered Goldman Sachs to keep them going in 2008, and [made back his investment plus over $3 billion more in profits in just three years](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-goldman-sachs-sale-billions-return-bailout-2020-5-1029212109). And Buffett was [far from the only investor](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx) to make major returns off their moves in the scary days following the market collapse. There was money to be made by those with the gumption and foresight to make it. And with the rest of the competition playing defense, the field was wide open for those who were ready to make a play.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway have leverage and cash resources that few of us can emulate, it doesn’t take billions of dollars to turn a recession to your firm’s advantage. It just takes smarts, savvy, and courage.

Bring It Back To Biglaw

So what does this mean for law firms? In my humble opinion, it means now, more than ever, is a time for smart strategic growth. If the rest of the legal market is piling into one investment class, the price of other investments presumably goes down. Smart firm managers can use that to their advantage.

Consider the lateral market, which has largely dried up save for the blue-chip, rain-making, guaranteed-profitability, turn-key practice groups. These unicorns command a hefty premium from firms that want to bring them over, even in the best of markets. In a risk-averse market like the one we’re facing today, the price to bring in a guaranteed rainmaker is as high as it will likely get.

So why buy high? Why spend firm resources on an inflated asset with razor-thin margins when you could instead spread that investment across several underpriced alternatives with bigger upside? Why not instead take a risk by bringing in some younger laterals without mega books but big potential for growth? If no one else is hiring in that market, a savvy firm manager could cherry pick an entire slate of future revenue-generating stars for the price of a single current-day blue chip partner.

Similarly, if the rest of the market is putting a pause on mergers, doesn’t it make sense to consider moving forward on the right kind of deal at full speed? If we’re fearful of a future downturn in the economy, the time to seek out or complete any contemplated merger is now. Get new staff onboarded, get redundancies reduced and efficiencies of scale in place, and be actively stronger as we prepare for the coming bear market. If we sit and wait for conditions to become more favorable, for everyone else to give us permission to be bold, opportunities will pass us by.

To be clear, I’m not saying cash out your firm’s retirement accounts, take them to Vegas, and hope for the best. Investments and risks always must be smart and calculated. I expect few, if any firms will make it through these next few years without feeling at least some pinch. But it’s during times like these that the moves get made that shape the coming decade.

Those who are bold enough to take risks will be the ones to reap the rewards.

# Morning Docket: 08.12.19
## * Accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who’d reportedly been taken off suicide watch, died by suicide this weekend as he awaited trial. AG Bill Barr is “appalled,” and has called for an investigation into the circumstances of Epstein’s death. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-suicide.html)] * In light of Epstein’s death, his victims want prosecutors to turn their sights upon Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been described as the financier’s “protector and procurer, his girlfriend and his madam.” [[Washington Post](https://beta.washingtonpost.com/politics/epsteins-accusers-call-her-his-protector-and-procurer-is-ghislaine-maxwell-now-prosecutors-target/2019/08/11/7af5968a-bbbd-11e9-a091-6a96e67d9cce_story.html?outputType=amp)] * Will the Supreme Court be able to delay hearing cases about expanding Second Amendment rights considering the fact that this country has quite the problem with mass shootings? Not too hopeful here. [[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/09/texas-ohio-mass-shootings-supreme-court-gun-debate/1943728001/)] * Joel Sanders, defunct firm Dewey’s former CFO, wants his criminal conviction to be tossed out and his $1 million fine to be vacated with it. [[New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/2019/08/09/ex-dewey-cfo-criticizing-prosecutors-and-former-defense-lawyers-seeks-reversal/)] * So much for those Biglaw raises... According to a report recently published by the ABA, lawyers’ wages have been pretty stagnant, growing slower than inflation from 2017 to 2018.

# The Tension Within Trump's Legal Team
## The relationship between McGahn and Cobb is one to watch.

In high-stakes, complex, rapidly evolving litigation, it is fairly common for a client to bring in multiple law firms — particularly if they have different specialties or areas of expertise. So it’s no surprise that the beleaguered Trump administration, under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, has a ballooning legal team whose members have different jobs and responsibilities.

What is interesting is the rumors swirling about how the various lawyers are working together. Big Law Business has a[ report](https://biglawbusiness.com/trumps-legal-team-isnt-playing-well-together/) about the tensions in Team Trump. Ty Cobb, whose [recent indiscretions](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/maybe-ty-cobb-just-doesnt-get-this-whole-client-confidentiality-thing/) have provided Above the Law with [ample fodder](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/ty-cobbs-hilarious-emails-and-what-they-say-about-biglaw/), is a [former partner at Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-incredible-growing-presidential-legal-team/), so he’s used to running his own ship and having plenty of resources to do just that. He’s bumping against the former Jones Day partner and current White House counsel, [Don McGahn](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/don-mcgahn/), in his mission to represent the president:

An added complication for Cobb is the friction he’s been having with Trump’s White House counsel, Donald McGahn, whose priorities have clashed with Cobb’s on several fronts. Tensions have been building since Cobb joined the White House this summer. He initially sought to use some lawyers from McGahn’s staff, yet McGahn balked, says a person familiar with the investigation. Cobb had to build a team from scratch and was left with the impression that McGahn was being unhelpful.

Another person says McGahn was only trying to protect his attorneys, who could be called as witnesses in the Mueller investigation and end up in the awkward position of having to pull documents on themselves, leading to potential obstruction accusations.

Also likely adding to the tension is their differing roles. McGahn, as White House Counsel, is tasked with representing the office, while Cobb is Donald Trump’s personal attorney. That might seem like a small distinction, but with a widening investigation that seems to be turning up the heat, it matters. And don’t forget McGahn, and possibly members of his staff, are potential witnesses in the investigation (McGahn has hired a personal attorney, Quinn Emanuel’s [William Burck](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/burck-william/)). McGahn was present for many of the conversations Mueller is interested in and was involved in the firing of James Comey.

For now the battle over resources seems to be resolved, with Cobb now leading a team of seven. But, given this administration’s [penchant](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/trump-pissed-sessions-conformed-to-most-basic-of-legal-ethics/) for [personal conflicts](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/tillerson-summoned-white-house-amid-presidential-fury-n808216) [blowing up](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/anthony-scaramucci/) all over the [media](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/marc-kasowitz/), the relationship between McGahn and Cobb is one to watch.

# Paul Weiss Won't Be Offering Fall Bonuses, And Associates Are ANGRY
## Is this the end of fall COVID appreciation bonuses?

Seven days ago, Cravath entered the fall bonus scene empty-handed, announcing that [associates would not receive an extra cent from the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/) until the fourth quarter. Since that time, not a single firm has issued bonus payments to associates; instead, firms have only mimicked Cravath in saying that no bonuses will be issued prior to their customary timing. It now looks like Cravath may have crushed associates’ hopes and dreams for additional compensation this fall, because yet another Biglaw firm has stepped out to say bonuses won’t be coming.

In the wee hours of the morning, under cover of darkness, Paul Weiss announced that the firm would not be offering special bonuses this fall. Instead, chairman [Brad Karp](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/brad-s-karp) offered the usual old chestnuts about associates’ dedication and the firm’s values during these trying times (even naming two colleagues who had recently passed away). Here’s an excerpt from the memo Karp sent at 1:43 a.m. (available on the next page):

Over the past couple of weeks, some of our peer firms have announced special “pandemic” bonuses, while others have announced that they would not pay such bonuses.  We have considered whether to distribute such bonuses, in advance of our regular year-end bonuses.  After consulting with the Associates Committee and our partners and after hearing from several of our clients, I have concluded that announcing such a bonus now would not be appropriate.  So many of our clients and others across our community are experiencing unprecedented economic trauma, including the shuttering of their businesses and the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, as a direct result of this pandemic.  Providing a special cash reward in direct response to the pandemic does not feel right at this time.  That said, please be assured that we will recognize your extraordinary contributions in December and we pledge to retain our position as a market leader in compensation, taking into account any special bonuses paid by our peer firms.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Paul Weiss is a firm that came in at #20 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, with $1,387,694,000 in gross revenue in 2019. On top of that, Paul Weiss came in third place in terms of profits per equity partner, with an eye-popping $4,699,000. Associates certainly kept these facts in mind because as could have been expected, they are less than thrilled with the firm skipping out on fall bonuses.

Here are just a few of their reactions:

- “Paul, Weiss won’t pay special bonuses. And invokes the names of a deceased partner and associate, and clients’ views for not paying them. But also spent the past six months talking about this is a banner year with billables up 10%.”
- “Using the death of two members of the firm to soften the blow is an all time low.”
- “Ew. He invokes the names of two deceased members of the firm as some sort of creepy guilt trip. Also, apparently billables have been up over 10% this year and he’s been bragging about that in the media. Seems like a move motivated by greed more than anything else.”
- “And what do clients think of your $5,000,000 in PPP?”
- “No fall bonus for Paul Weiss associates. Pretty interesting to see the chairman claim to be a market leader in comp while . . . not being a market leader in comp. I’m glad they’re considerate of the clients’ feelings as well, curious to see how the partners adjust their take home pay in order to be appropriate in this tough time.”
- “The partners can go to hell. So can our useless associates committee.”
- “Brad ‘s email also says that he is trying to do what is ‘right’ and ‘courageous’ by not giving fall bonuses. Associates are absolutely livid. Other partners had told associates that fall bonuses were coming for weeks so this news particularly stings.”
UPDATE (12:45 p.m.): Some associates at the firm were shocked by their colleagues’ anger. Here’s what they had to say:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- “Paul Weiss sent overnight email. Hit all the right tones and was perfectly balanced. They’ll distribute COVID bonus at the time of year end, not now. But not sure you could be upset with this email.”
- “I’m not sure why fellow associates are so ‘angry,’ Brad clearly stated in his email: ‘we pledge to retain our position as a market leader in compensation, taking into account any special bonuses paid by our peer firms.’ That reads to me that the firm will ‘make us whole’ (i.e., bonus amounts will be the fall bonus + the market year end bonus) at year end. For a firm that hasn’t taken a step wrong during COVID, the racial justice crisis sweeping the nation or our political uncertainty, this seems like an over-reaction by some of my colleagues (or at least the ones you quoted). Do people not recall the beginning of the pandemic where we were fretting about layoffs or salary cuts and Brad pledged the firm would act in a manner that they could look back on and be proud? And how he clearly stated, multiple times, that the partners were committed to no layoffs, salary cuts or anything that would cause economic hardship? Because I remember all those things.”
At least the firm will be taking the fall bonuses into account when it’s time for year-end bonuses. Plus, it looks like staff will be receiving special year-end bonuses as well for all of their hard work during the pandemic.

So, what do you think? Is this yet another sign to other firms not to match? We think it could be. Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Cravath), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Big Billers Tidal Wave Of Extra Bonus Cash
## Up to $45K over market? Yes, please!

Despite the doom-and-gloom news of layoffs that has infiltrated bonus season, associates at many firms have been working super hard this year — and this Biglaw firm is willing to reward them earnestly for it.

With a maximum bonus potential for senior associates of $160,000, Schulte Roth & Zabel is in it to win it this bonus season. The firm — which brought in $471,363,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it at No. 92 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — announced bonuses yesterday afternoon, and SRZ is offering much more than a simple Baker/Cravath match.

Here’s what the bonus scale looks like at SRZ, with lots of extra cash for the highest of billers:



As you can see, there are three levels of step-up bonuses, and each requires higher level of billable hours (i.e., “extraordinary contributions to the firm”): 2300, 2500, and 2700 hours, respectively. These above-market bonuses are quite the thank you for the dedicated work associates have been putting in this year.

The firm is also offering partial credit bonuses for those who were unable to meet their minimum hours. As noted in the memo, associates with 1600 hours will receive a 50% bonus, while associates with fewer than 1600 hours will receive a $5,000 bonus.

Last, but certainly not least, the firm is offering a special kindness to rising second-year associates due to the uncertainties they faced due to the pandemic. Here are the details:

In recognition of the special challenges faced by the class of 2021 in starting their legal career during remote work, the hours threshold for the full class bonus will be reduced to 1500 hours. More details, including hours thresholds for the step-up bonuses and 50% class bonus for the class of 2021, will be communicated separately by email.

Associates at the firm seem to be pretty happy about how their bonuses turned out. “The firm has been killing it this year, lots of people I know are super busy and looking at above-market bonuses,” one of our sources at Schulte Roth told us. “It really shows character to take extra care of the first years (rising second years) who worked super hard through a difficult transition,” said another.

Congratulations on your bonuses, SRZ associates!

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# How To Say Goodbye To Your Biglaw Salary
## How much money would you be willing to give up to have some work-life balance?

Now is not a terrible time to think about leaving Biglaw. Legal technology is allowing corporate legal departments and small to midsize firms to take on more work, and there are new products that are making it easier to become a solo lawyer (more on that soon). Legal technology is growing and more lawyers will be able to find jobs with these companies (if you want to know more about legal tech openings, you should check out [Evolve Law’s new job board](http://evolvelawnow.com/jobs/)). More lawyers are realizing that they, too, can start their own companies: Jake Heller, founder of [Casetext](http://casetext.com), was an associate at Ropes & Gray, and Noah Waisberg, founder of [Kira Systems](https://kirasystems.com/), worked at Weil. One of my favorite bloggers, [Will Ha](http://www.williamha.com/economics-of-software-development-v-the-practice-of-law-a-rough-look/), is leading the charge on why lawyers should [quit law and code](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/should-you-leave-law-and-learn-to-code-a-conversation-with-lawyer-turned-programmer-will-ha/).

But for many lawyers, the biggest obstacle to leaving — and it’s very real — is saying goodbye to their Biglaw salary. For some lawyers, law school debt makes this nearly impossible. Full transparency: had my parents not set aside money for my law school tuition, I would never have been able to leave Biglaw to start [ReplyAll](http://www.replyall.me). For lawyers like me, leaving behind a Biglaw salary is a question of comfort, not an inability to pay back your debts. If you are one of those lawyers, I want to tell you how I made the decision to leave.

It’s all about the mindset.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
You might not love the work you do as a lawyer, but imagine for a moment that you were fully able to control your hours. You could come and go as you please and have complete control of how much work you did and when you did it. This would allow you to hit the gym whenever you want, get as much sleep as you need, take vacations at your discretion, and see your family more regularly.

How much would you pay for that flexibility?

When I was a junior associate, I realized that I would pay back $100K of my salary to have the ability to control my own hours, and I would still make that deal again today. Every time I go to my kids’ soccer games, I realize that I’m paying money to attend, and I am 100 percent cool with that arrangement. As soon as I had the ability to pay myself a salary that was at least $60K, it was entirely worth it for me to start my own company. To be clear, I work more hours now than I ever did at my law firm. I work every single night, weekend, and vacation (and I am entirely grateful to Schulte Roth & Zabel for teaching me that work ethic). But, for me, both the flexibility and the ability to control my hours was something I valued more than $100K — and something I simply could not have at SRZ. That’s not their fault, it’s just how it is.

Now, is this the most novel advice? No. But you would be shocked how many people I speak to who cannot frame their decision in these terms. So, whether you’re looking for independence, better work-life balance, more interesting legal work, or an opportunity to be part of a growing startup, try to attach an actual monetary value to your decision.

Last week, [we released our Outside Counsel rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel/?rf=1#top-tier-firms). They are a broad overview of the 50 firms in-house counsel trust the most when they need outside help.

That’s a great list if your company is generally facing “bet the company” litigation. But most of the time, you’re not. Most of the time, you need your outside counsel to have a deep understanding of your industry so they can advise you on the best course of legal action. The firm that’s going to be best for a bank isn’t necessarily the firm that’s going to know all there is to know about the energy market.

Today, we want to look at the firms that were rated highest by in-house counsel based on the industries they work in. We’ve put together a few top 10 lists, across six different industries: Consumer Products, Energy, Media/Entertainment, Life Sciences/Health Care, Finance, and Tech.

Let’s drill down on the “Finance” category because… well, I like money. Here are the top 10 Biglaw firms based on in-house lawyers who work in finance:

Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft
Cahill Gordon & Reindell
Cleary Gottlieb
Clifford Chance
Cravath Swaine & Moore
Davis Polk & Wardwell
Debevoise & Plimpton
Kirkland & Ellis
Sullivan & Cromwell
Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz

Usual suspects all, though I am sure that we can all think of some firms that talk a big game but did not make this list according to in-house attorneys.

But if we look at the “Energy” industry, you’ll note an entirely different group of firms rises to the top:

# The Top Biglaw Firms In California (2023)
## We wish they all could be California firms....

California has a certain kind of easy-going vibe that’ll make you appreciate that business casual lifestyle. Depending on where your office is located, you may even be able to see the beach from your window. In fact, we wouldn’t be surprised if your firm handed out flip-flops emblazoned with their logo (we see you, Quinn Emanuel). Whether you’re into tech, litigation, or representing celebrities, there really is something for everyone. California really is top notch — but which firms are considered the best in the Golden State?

Thanks to Vault’s recently released [regional rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/vaults-top-law-firms-by-practice-area-and-region-2023/), we now know which Biglaw firms are dominating the legal scene in California.

# Mega Firm Announces Bonus Delays Amid COVID-19 Uncertainty
## Even giant firms are worried about cash flow.

The COVID-19 economic upheaval is coming for us all. Even the legal profession, which many perceive as staid and somewhat insulated from market fluctuations, has seen [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [furloughs, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/)and [associate salary cuts ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-100-firm-turns-to-furloughs-and-salary-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/)aplenty. As the days of social distancing and quarantine start adding up, even the very top of the Biglaw heap has implemented austerity measures, with Am Law 50 firms [Bryan Cave](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-50-bclp-salary-cuts/) and [Orrick ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/orrick-rolls-out-salary-cuts-paired-with-make-whole-cash-rewards/)announcing pay cuts.

Now we’ve learned that the mega firm of Dentons has some cost-cutting moves on the horizon. Tipsters at the firm report that 2019 bonuses, which were due to be paid in full this month, will be delayed in part. The firm is paying 50 percent of attorneys’  2019 bonuses on schedule and delaying the second half until the second half of 2020. A more specific timeframe than that is unknown.

When reached for comment, a Dentons spokesperson had this to say:

Like many firms, we confirm that Dentons US is undertaking proactive steps to ensure the continued financial security of the Firm and our people. If there are early lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the wisdom of prudent and resilient preparation is certainly one of them.  As part of that effort, we have adjusted the timing of bonus payments for our lawyers.  We remain focused on our people, clients, strategy and strength of the future.

Hopefully this move will prevent even more severe cuts, like layoffs.

Bill Voge via Latham & Watkins website

There aren’t a lot of details here yet, but what we know right now is that Latham & Watkins chair [Bill Voge](https://www.lw.com/people/william-voge) abruptly resigned this afternoon “following an admission that he had engaged in communications of a sexual nature with a person not connected to the firm.”

Law360 [cites from Voge’s statement](https://www.law360.com/articles/1024233):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“It is with great sorrow that I step down as Chair and Managing Partner of Latham & Watkins. I made a personal mistake for which I bear considerable fault and humiliation,” Voge said in a written statement. “I deeply regret my lapse of judgment and I am sorry for the distress and embarrassment I have caused my family, friends, and colleagues. My conduct falls well below the personal and professional standards I have tried to uphold throughout my entire career. My disappointment in myself is all the more acute because this lapse does not represent who I am and what I believe, and because I have let down our firm and its people, all of whom I so deeply cherish and respect.”

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Announces Associate Raises And Bonuses
## Another firm shows they have what it takes (money) to keep up with the top of the industry.

News of associate raises is circulating through Biglaw at quite the rapid clip.

Willkie Farr & Gallagher clocks in at #31 on the AmLaw 100 with 1,380,000,000 in gross revenue. So it’s pretty clear they can run with the big dogs when it comes to associate compensation. And they haven’t let their associates sweat it out, only a few short days after [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/cravath-announces-raises-comes-over-the-top-of-milbank-scale-for-some-associates/) established the new salary grid (taking over from [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/milbank-raises-associate-salaries-and-announces-year-end-bonuses/) who got the ball rolling earlier this month), Willkie is also raising associate salaries.

The new compensation and bonus grid at the firm is as follows:

Year-End Bonus	Salary as of January 1, 2024
Class of 2023	$15,000 (prorated)	$225,000
Class of 2022	$20,000	$235,000
Class of 2021	$30,000	$260,000
Class of 2020	$57,500	$310,000
Class of 2019	$75,000	$365,000
Class of 2018	$90,000	$390,000
Class of 2017	$105,000	$420,000
Class of 2016	$115,000	$435,000
The full memo is available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/willkie-compensation-23/2/).

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

It would have been a painful merger. There is so much overlap between the two firms’ practice areas.

— a former Squire Patton Boggs partner commenting on some [preliminary trans-Atlantic tie-up talks](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/03/18/addleshaws-and-u-s-firm-held-merger-talks-last-year-396-13154/) between the U.S.-based firm and the U.K.’S Addleshaw Goddard. These merger talks reportedly started, and ended, in late 2018. Addleshaws had previously discussed a combination with Hunton & Williams before things fell flat in 2017.

# How To Succeed: Moving Work Onto Your Desk
## Senior people universally prefer that you accept work, rather than decline work. Do yourself a favor.

“Okay,” says the junior person.  “That sounds good.  Why don’t you write up whatever you have in mind?”

Huh?

I understand that you prefer not to work.  You prefer to put work on the other guy’s desk.

But, if you want to succeed, then always — always — take work away from the other person, and put it on your own desk.

The responsible junior person says:  “Okay.  That sounds good.  Let me take a stab at writing that up, and I’ll let you review my draft.”

See the difference?

The first response declines effort; the second accepts effort.  The junior person who undertakes effort is the junior person that the senior person prefers to work with.

It’s the same with a draft.

You could decline effort:  “There’s a technical problem with the draft.  There are three possible ways to deal with it.  It strikes me that . . . . Why don’t you decide how to solve this and put a proposed solution in the next draft?”

Or you could accept effort:  “There’s a technical problem with the draft.  There are three possible ways to deal with it.  I’ve proposed below language that adopts each of the three alternatives.  Please let me know which alternative you prefer, and I’ll insert that in the next draft.”

See the difference?

The first tells the senior person to do work.  The second identifies the problem and offers ways to solve it.  Who do you think the senior person prefers to work with?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s the same with every email that you send.

You could decline effort:  “That leaves us with a very difficult problem.  Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.”

Or you could accept effort:  “That leaves us with a very difficult problem  My proposed solution is [whatever].  I’ve drafted language that adopts that solution below.  But please let me know if you prefer some other solution, or if I should draft this differently.”

See the difference?

Move the ball forward; don’t roll it onto the senior person’s desk.  The senior person will notice.  Invariably.

I know you prefer to decline effort rather than to accept it.  Work is not always fun.  And sometimes it’s hard.

But it’s hard to succeed professionally, rather than to fail.

Senior people universally prefer that you accept work, rather than decline work and inflict it back on the senior person.

I’m just sayin’.

# Law Professors Say White '50s Culture Is Superior, Other Racist Stuff
## Professors think things were better when women and minorities just acted more like white guys.

A picture of John Wayne lords over a recent op-ed by Professor [Amy Wax](https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/awax/) of [Penn Law](https://www.law.upenn.edu) and Professor [Larry Alexander](https://www.sandiego.edu/law/faculty/profiles/bio.php?ID=681) of [USD Law](http://www.sandiego.edu/law/) titled “[Paying the price for breakdown of the country’s bourgeois culture](http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/paying-the-price-for-breakdown-of-the-countrys-bourgeois-culture-20170809.html).” In a nutshell, the professors argue that if everyone went to school, got married to their biological opposite number, and stayed married for the kids, everything would be fine in this country.

John Wayne was a twice-divorced college dropout.

This actually tells you everything you need to know about the laughable swill these two dropped on an unsuspecting public this week. This dynamic duo of dumb spend the op-ed concocting a theory as terrifying as it is bereft of factual support when they posit that all of America’s woes really do stem from failing to live up to the ideals of an era when (white) men were men and everyone else kept their goddamned mouths shut. Make America Great Again indeed.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Of course, the original op-ed doesn’t phrase it that way. Instead, Wax and Alexander draw up a thinly veiled avatar for white male supremacy that they call “bourgeois culture.” Don’t worry… they can’t keep up the veil for long:

That culture laid out the script we all were supposed to follow: Get married before you have children and strive to stay married for their sake. Get the education you need for gainful employment, work hard, and avoid idleness. Go the extra mile for your employer or client. Be a patriot, ready to serve the country. Be neighborly, civic-minded, and charitable. Avoid coarse language in public. Be respectful of authority. Eschew substance abuse and crime.

The 1950s are a curious star in the conservative intellectual constellation. The “culture” that Wax and Alexander exalt held just as much sway in the 1930s when Americans couldn’t put bread on their tables. Yet it’s the 1950s — in the aftermath of the economic devastation of every other economy on the planet, and with a non-conservative government committed to high taxes and public works projects — that gets singled out as proof that this dominant paradigm provides the guaranteed blueprint for permanent success.

Some might say there’s nothing racist or sexist about saying people should be neighborly, which is true. But don’t waste effort auditioning to be an apologist for this screed. [Professor Wax has a follow-up](http://www.thedp.com/article/2017/08/amy-wax-penn-law-cultural-values) in The Daily Pennsylvanian in case her thrust wasn’t clear:

“I don’t shrink from the word, ‘superior,'” she said, adding, “Everyone wants to come to the countries that exemplify” these values. “Everyone wants to go to countries ruled by white Europeans.”

That’s the thing right there. One could say, “everyone wants to go to liberal democracies” or “everyone wants to go to strong economies.” In fact, “everyone wants to go to relatively moderate climates” may be as true as any of these other statements. Even if, in some polemicist’s hands, these can be racially coded language, they’re at least arguably fair claims. Wax, on the other hand, wants you to know her heart’s in it for the white superiority and, you know, we thank her for her honesty.

By the way, if you were gambling on when the “unauthorized whitewashing of MLK” would happen, it’s paragraph 7:

This era saw the beginnings of an identity politics that inverted the color-blind aspirations of civil rights leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. into an obsession with race, ethnicity, gender, and now sexual preference.

“I think that we’ve got to see that a riot is the language of the unheard,” is not one of those Dr. King quotes Wax or Alexander want anyone to remember.

This whole op-ed is atrocious. Here’s just the opening paragraph annotated.

“Too few Americans are qualified for the jobs available.” That’s why we’re approaching full employment I suppose. Certainly H1-B visas exist, but to suggest that a software engineer at Google is representative of the jobs available in America is laughable. “Male working-age labor-force participation is at Depression-era lows.” Actually, [labor force participation is up since the 1950s](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate). I’m thinking that’s why the “male” is thrown in there. Maybe women have driven some men from the labor force, which is a bad thing because… making babies or some such. “Opioid abuse is widespread.” It’s a real problem, but maybe it’s [all those heroin knockoffs being prescribed](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/americas-addiction-to-opioids-heroin-prescription-drug-abuse) and not whether or not Johnny’s mom stayed at home. “Homicidal violence plagues inner cities.” [Homicide rates are at historic lows](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/05/17/rick_nevin_murder_statistics_safest_year_ever.html). “Almost half of all children are born out of wedlock, and even more raised are by single mothers.” It’s a stretch to say 40 percent is “almost half,” but whatever. “Many college students lack basic skills, and high school students rank below those from two dozen other countries.” Fund public schools? Oh wait, no, ban gay marriage! That makes more sense.

Then they go off on “rap culture” and anti-assimilation “Hispanic immigrants,” just in case you didn’t realize they’ve never interacted with a person of color ever, but they have no problems pontificating about them.

Surely the battle lines are already being drawn between the forces who will call upon the law schools to fire these professors and the right-wing backlash furthering the wildly exaggerated “campus war on free speech” narrative. Neither Wax nor Alexander should be fired for holding unpopular opinions. They should be fired for being bad scholars.

An op-ed isn’t an academic journal, of course, but belching out so many lies and half-truths while draped in the imprimatur of the credibility that the law school’s name brings is an institutional embarrassment. It undermines that credibility with students and peers. Op-eds for local newspapers may not be held to the strict standards of a scholarly journal, but that doesn’t absolve professors of the need to conduct themselves as scholars for the good of the institution that employs them. Frankly, doing right by your employer is probably a good “bourgeois value” when you think about it.

But, hey, if either of these professors get unceremoniously dumped, they won’t have to remain unemployed for long. There are a lot of open federal appellate seats, and if we’ve learned anything from Judge John Bush landing on the Sixth Circuit after blogging it up about Birtherism, belching out a string of lies and half-truths on the internet is a positive career move.

# Mixed Bag Of Special Bonus News At This Biglaw Firm
## But there is a bright side to look on!

Biglaw bonus season is in full swing! The industry doesn’t usually have bonus announcements in the spring, but once Willkie announced special bonuses and Davis Polk’s scale came over the top, well, a full-on bonus war began. And we have yet another major law firm handing out spring bonuses.

Cadwalader has announced its participation in the spring special bonus frenzy. But when you dig into the details, well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag.

First, the good news: the firm is paying market rate for special bonuses, which, they’ve clarified, are in additional to normal year-end bonuses. Plus the firm dragged their feet in announcing the last round of special bonuses in 2020, so in the words of one tipster, “after waiting for months to hear about a covid bonus in 2020 and then not getting a full market match, I am just happy CWT matched at all!”

But there is bad news too. The payment dates for the special bonus are July of 2021 and February of 2022. This is the first firm to push special payment dates into next year — an ignominious distinction, to be sure. Plus they have the highest stated hours requirement thus far — 2000 hours, annualized — to be eligible for the bonus payments. But on the up side, associates who don’t hit the hours threshold for the July payment, but do by year end, will receive the full payment in February.

In any event, here is the firm’s bonus scale:

I just think it’s a well-kept secret that people are discovering, that it’s a great place to live and work. I’m very curious, [with] the economy shifting a little bit nationally, if that will impact the huge rush to open offices in Salt Lake. And I think that well could.

— [Steve Young](https://www.hollandhart.com/spyoung), leader of Holland & Hart’s tax practice, commenting in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/08/25/where-is-big-law-still-looking-to-grow/), on Biglaw firms’ urge to open new offices in markets where they’d like to grow. While many firms are intent upon opening offices in Miami, Florida, Young noted that population and economic growth in the Mountain West region has been “explosive,” and that it would be a good place for firms to to open their doors.

Are you interested in making a lateral move to a firm in Texas? If you answered “yes,” then we have some good news for you. Lateral Link’s Placement Bonus is BACK!  Here’s how it works: If a Lateral Link recruiter presents you to a Texas firm before Labor Day of 2019 and we ultimately place you from that introduction, Lateral Link will pay you $10,000 just for working with us!

Why Move to Texas?

Texas continues to remain a TOP destination with its low cost of living and competitive salaries compared to other major markets.  Over the last five years, more than 40 Am Law 200 firms have opened offices in Dallas, Austin, and Houston. Some of the newest firms to the Texas market include Womble Bond Dickinson, White & Case, Kirkland & Ellis, and Shearman & Sterling.

Texas has four major, bustling, and diverse big city centers and is home to many Am Law 100 firms and high-end boutiques.  The market is continuously evolving and thriving as a “place to be.” For the first time since 2016, Dallas has more growth in the associate market with 122 hires compared to 88 associate hires in Houston.

Dallas and Houston, similar to the associate movement, are showing major upward trends in the partner hiring market as well.

Which Firms Are Making Moves in Texas?

Reed Smith wins the award for the most growth in Dallas this year, with the opening of its new office. Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani LLP and Winstead have also had significant hires in Dallas. In Houston, White & Case and Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP are leading the charts with the most hiring in 2019.

What Are the Best Practice Areas in Texas?

The practice areas with the most hiring in early 2019 include Corporate and Finance, Litigation, IP, and Real Estate.  Some of the highest Vault- and Am Law-ranked corporate practice groups reside in Texas.  In particular, Kirkland, Sidley, and Latham lead the way on headline Corporate and Private Equity transactions on an international scale.  This year to date, Corporate and Finance had 72 new attorney hires in Texas.  Within these practice areas, Corporate hiring has been primarily concentrated in M&A and, especially, in the Private Equity space.  With regards to finance practice groups, debt-finance including syndicated and leveraged lending was the busiest finance hiring area.

Litigation has remained steady since 2018.  With approximately 85 associate hires thus far, there has been about the same amount of litigation associates hired in the first half of 2019 compared to the same time last year.

IP has started to ramp back up with hiring gains in 2019.  Year to date, there has been 20 new Associate hires compared to only 10 in 2018.  Texas hosts many of the top IP teams at both large Am Law-ranked and IP specialty firms. The IP teams in Texas handle sophisticated IP Litigation and Patent Prosecution matters for an array of top companies.  Technology and IP transactions associates have also been in high demand in Texas.

Real Estate practice continues its upward trend in Dallas.  These associates handle a wide variety of sophisticated Commercial Real Estate transactions including purchases, sales, leasing, development, management, and ventures. Since January 2019, major Am Law firms in Texas have hired over 20 Real Estate associates.

In summary, the Texas legal market is flourishing, with available positions for associates of all practices and seniority levels.  Law firms are very open and HAPPY to relocate worthy candidates.

# Biglaw's Role In Bringing Down Larry Nassar
## The firm behind the litigation that got the ball rolling.

Amazing that this all started with a motion to unseal records in a South Georgia state court, and ultimately led to literally hundreds of young women finding the courage to come forward and make their stories public. I almost never get to see the tangible results of what I do like this.

— [S. Derek Bauer](https://www.bakerlaw.com/SDerekBauer), partner at BakerHostetler and one of the lawyers hired by the Indianapolis Star to litigate an open records request against USA Gymnastics,[ describing](https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2018/01/24/scrutiny-of-usa-gymnastics-doctor-started-with-open-records-fight-in-georgia/) how that records request began the process of exposing the history of abuse by former Olympic doctor Larry Nassar. While BakerHostetler was engaged in litigation over USA Gymnastics’s records, the Star began publishing stories about the legal battle. Those stories encouraged women to reach out to the Star to tell their stories of the abuse suffered at Nassar’s hands. When those stories were published it led to the onslaught of victims coming forward, all of which culminated in [Nassar’s 175-year sentence](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/in-an-utterly-unsurprising-move-judge-throws-the-book-at-larry-nassar/).

Mayer Brown is helping [a bunch of landlords challenge New York’s rent control laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/nyregion/ny-rent-regulation-lawsuit.html), which is already an act of cartoonish super-villainy, but they’ve decided to solidify their mustache-twirling by bolstering their filing by pointing out that rent control goes against the very bedrock value of this nation — specifically, that black people are 3/5ths of a human being.

The new rent stabilization and control laws in New York add a bit more heft to a system that’s been in place since just after World War I. If the courts respected precedent as much as Susan Collins pretends they do, this wouldn’t be much of a case. But a group of landlords have decided to take the occasion of tighter regulation to argue that the whole legal regime should be junked as an unconstitutional taking of property.

Mayer Brown is representing the landlords and in a massive, 386-paragraph complaint that would make John Galt blush, leveling all sorts of libertarian nonsense about the tyrannical government stepping on the poor, downtrodden Manhattan landlords. There are definitely abuses of the system — tenants who have no business enjoying the fruits of a system designed to help the poor and elderly amount to infamous anecdotes. But we don’t make sweeping policies based on a handful of anecdotes for a reason and even if there’s a better way to implement it (bring me your “give tenants vouchers” claptrap and I’ll at least listen), the policy has mostly been a success for almost a century.

But then Mayer Brown decided to throw this into its already bloated, self-indulgent pleading:

This protection of property rights is deeply rooted in American history and traditions, and is a fundamental right on which America was founded. See, e.g., Federalist No. 10, at 78 (Madison) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (describing protection of property rights, especially in land, as “the first object of government”); Federalist No. 54, supra, at 339 (Madison) (government is “instituted no less for protection of the property than of the persons of individuals”).

Oh, it sure was a foundational right! That’s why Federalist No. 54 was written — to explain to worried anti-federalists that the Constitution was a fair compromise because it appropriately recognized slaves as less than human. Just take a gander at some of the paragraph that immediately precedes Mayer Brown’s quote:

Let the case of the slaves be considered, as it is in truth, a peculiar one. Let the compromising expedient of the Constitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as inhabitants, but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the slave as divested of two fifths of the man.

Now, there are some who might say that of all the flowery but ultimately empty platitudes to property rights that it amounts to a spectacular research fail to include a damning tribute to America’s slaving past in a filing. On the other hand, for a lawsuit based upon kicking, by and large, poor and minority tenants out of their homes — and to do so in many cases so the landlord can gut the building and gentrify the neighborhood, pushing working people further and further from their jobs and historic communities — perhaps this was the most unintentionally appropriate citation of all.

After all, what better summary of this case could there be than to say that government should serve the interests of higher profits for mostly white, wealthy landholders at the expense of their sub-human minority tenants?

# Federal Judge Tells Holland & Knight To STFU
## Sit down. Shut up. Think about what you did.

Sometimes a lawyer needs to take advantage of every opening to successfully argue their case. Sometimes a lawyer needs to avoid antagonizing the judge before they get stomped on.

This is an example of the latter.

Last week, [Judge Paul Engelmayer](http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/judge/Engelmayer) of the Southern District of New York heard argument on a motion to disqualify Holland & Knight in a dispute between its client, First NBC Bank, and a company called Murex. Judge Engelmayer informed Holland & Knight at that time that he was inclined to find that Holland & Knight represented Murex immediately prior to filing this suit. But rather than issue an order, he asked the firm and its client to reflect on the issue and then write a letter informing the court of their final determination, but admonished them that “by extending this courtesy, it was not inviting additional substantive briefing on issues related to disqualification.” Emphasis, as they say, in original.

Judge Engelmayer was looking for a letter saying, “don’t bother sorting through everything to write an order, we’re withdrawing” or “you know what, we stand by our argument despite your stated preliminary inclination and ask that you rule.”

Instead, Holland & Knight rehashed why they don’t see a problem here.

Judge Engelmayer was not pleased.

The Court is constrained to express its dismay at this tactic. HK has abused the Court’s courtesy.

Dad’s not angry, he’s just disappointed.

But you know that just means he’s really, really angry.

While the Court will not strike HK’s submission, as a remedy, the Court will permit Murex to file a supplemental brief in response and in further support of its motion for disqualification. Such a brief is due March 2, 2017. The Court does not impose any page or substantive limit on Murex’s response.

Do you know how pissed off a judge has to be to say, “please give me more briefing and don’t worry about page limits”? That’s “someone shot John Wick’s dog” angry.

And then…

For avoidance of doubt, the Court will not invite or permit a reply by HK or First NBC to Murex’s forthcoming submission.

Sit down. Shut up. Think about what you did.

So, if you’re a Biglaw heavy with absolutely no Murex conflicts, this might be a good time to just remind First NBC Bank that you exist.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to Major Lindsey & Africa’s Lateral Partner Satisfaction Survey, what percentage of Black partners who made a lateral move say they left their previous law firm because of disparate treatment due to race?

Hint: This was a bigger reason Black partners left their firm than lack of leadership opportunities, the firm’s financial health, or unhappiness over the firm’s culture.

# Skadden Announces New Salary Scale, Accelerated Promotion Schedule
## One of the biggest names in the business will be paying even bigger bucks to its associates.

Thanks to [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) and [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/), compensation increases at large law firms have started to pick up speed in the race to match the next normal in this white-hot lateral market. We knew it was only a matter of time before one of the biggest names in Biglaw would take the plunge, and the time has now come.

Skadden, the No. 5 firm in the country, announced last night that it would be raising associate salaries to match the Davis Polk scale. After taking in $2,662,890,000 gross revenue in 2020, it would’ve been pure Skaddenfreude for the firm NOT to have increased salaries. This is what the new salary scale looks like:

- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013+: $365,000

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After noting the salary bumps, the firm also reminded associates about their incoming [special bonus payments](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/skadden-spring-bonuses/), the first of which will hit bank accounts at the end of the month. Associates at the firm will be rolling in cash in just a few weeks.

The firm isn’t just bringing good news to associates in the form of higher pay checks. Skadden is also reducing the length of time it takes to be promoted to counsel, from 7.5 years out of law school to 6.5 years. “We are implementing these changes to underscore our appreciation for your tremendous efforts and as part of our ongoing commitment to your career development and advancement,” the memo states. That’s one way to convince associates to stick around.

Will promotion acceleration moves like this start trending among other Biglaw firms as a way to retain associate talent? Recall that Cahill recently announced a surprise second round of [partnership elevations](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cahill-partners/) just last week.

Congratulations to everyone at Skadden!

# Biglaw Firm Hit With Cybersecurity Incident Earlier This Month
## The firm says no client data was breached.

A new [report](https://biglawbusiness.com/foley-lardner-hit-with-cybersecurity-incident/) by Bloomberg Law reveals that the Biglaw firm of Foley & Lardner was hit by a cybersecurity incident earlier this month. Though a spokesperson for the firm declined to specify the nature of the security event, they did note that client data was not breached during the incident.

“Like many other organizations in this increasingly digital world, earlier this month we incurred a cyber event that caused a disruption to our IT systems,” Jill Schachner Chanen, external communications manager at Foley & Lardner, told Bloomberg Law Oct. 26 in an email.

“We have security safeguards in place designed to protect our systems and data and have confirmed no unauthorized access to client data,” she said.

Biglaw firms are charged with maintaining their clients’ data in the strictest of confidence, so it’s no surprise that Chanen’s statement focused on that aspect of the breach. She also noted that keeping confidential data safe from cuber threats will “continue to be our highest priority.”

From this initial information, it seems Foley & Lardner faired much better than other Biglaw firms when it comes to cybersecurity. Last year mega firm DLA Piper [found themselves “paralyzed”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/global-biglaw-firm-paralyzed-by-new-ransomware-attack/) by a ransomware attack, and law firms continue to be [vulnerable to other cyber threats — a fact even 15-year olds know.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/15-year-old-hacker-shows-everyone-at-tech-show-that-theyre-completely-screwed-when-it-comes-to-security/)

# Why Princeton Law School Is In The Top 20

Too bad Princeton doesn’t have a law school.

Princeton, of course, does not have a law school.

But if you included Princeton Law School on a survey, [Princeton would be one of the 20 most prestigious law schools in the country](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/19/nyregion/judge-not-law-schools-demand-of-a-magazine-that-ranks-them.html).

Reputation is an odd thing.

First, it gives off an aura.  Princeton’s a good university.  Therefore, its law school is good.  Even though it doesn’t exist.

Bigg & Mediocre has a great corporate department.  Therefore, its litigators are great. 

Or, conversely, Bigg & Mediocre’s corporate lawyers couldn’t help you acquire a dog catcher.  Therefore, its litigators suck.

(By some similar property of equality, [John Jarndyce](https://www.shmoop.com/bleak-house/mr-john-jarndyce.html) at Bigg & Mediocre disappointed me on a litigation matter.  Therefore, we should never use Bigg & Mediocre for any litigation matter in the future.

Think having one bad partner doesn’t hurt?  Think again.  It won’t hurt your reputation — next year, Bigg & Mediocre will be ranked precisely as it was this year — but it’ll cost you business.)

Second, reputation is terribly sticky.  Once you’re known to be good, you’re considered to be good for a long, long time. 

Look at the rankings of the best — well, anything — in the country.  Once you’re in the top 15 colleges, or law schools, or law firms, or cities for people to visit, or anything, it’s awfully hard to lose that reputation.  

As a law firm, you could hire a half dozen classes of incompetent associates before your reputation started to decline in the surveys.  The firm that had 50 great partners in the mid-1980s is likely perceived to be great today, even though the original gang has long since moved on or retired.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Once you’re known to be good, it takes a long time to lose that mystique.

(I suppose I’m talking about the ordinary course of business here.  If your firm goes bankrupt, or collapses, or is indicted, its reputation may change overnight.  But losing your reputation by evolution is a far different thing; it takes decades.)

Third, in niche areas, reputation is unfairly affected by size.

Size doesn’t affect the reputations of law schools.  Top colleges or graduate schools are basically known to the world (or at least to the universe of people likely to be asked in surveys), so size doesn’t matter too much.  Everyone’s heard of Yale, so Yale’s law school will receive a high ranking, even though the class size is small.

But that’s not true of law firms.   A local firm — Small & Great — will be known only to the relatively few people who have retained it.  When some outfit conducts a national or international survey, Small & Great won’t score very high.  It’s a great law firm, but few people have personal experience with it, and few know enough about the firm to name it in response to questions.

On the other hand, Bigg & Mediocre does just fine on the international surveys.  The firm may not be very good, but everyone’s heard of it, so everyone mentions the name.

Should you make a decision — where to go to school; where to work — based on reputation? 

Maybe.

Graduates of Princeton Law School will do just fine in the workforce.  It really doesn’t matter if they got a very good education.  (That’s actually a pretty serious criticism of legal education.  You probably get essentially the same education at many schools.  It doesn’t matter if the person lecturing to you (or questioning you Socratically) is renowned for having written many brilliant law review articles; the law review articles don’t necessarily reflect the quality of the teaching.  And, ultimately, what you learn in law school has little to do with what you’ll do as a practicing lawyer.)

But how about picking a place to work?  If you’re planning to leave your job after two years, go to a place with a great reputation.  It’s easier to jump from prestigious perches.  But if you’re concerned about becoming an outstanding lawyer, you might think twice about taking a job at Bigg & Mediocre, despite its fine reputation.

# 2 Things You Should Never Say To A Partner
## Partners aren't crazy, but these phrases are sure to raise their blood pressure.

What should you never say to a partner?

“I know it was due today.  I don’t have it for you.”

If you say that it will be ready by today, then it should be ready today.  (Yesterday would be alright, too.  It’s “next week, maybe” that I’m talking about here.)  “Today” means “today at 9 a.m.,” not “today at 11:59 p.m.,” when you’re heading out the door.  “Today at 11:59 p.m.” means that you’ve delivering something “tomorrow.”  It’s the partner’s perspective that counts, not yours.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
When you say you’ll have it today, why should you deliver it today?

First, it’s responsible.  You said it would be done.  It should be done.

Second, your responsibility is part of your stock in trade.  If you promised it today and didn’t deliver, then I’m going to work with a different associate next time.  That’s not personal; I’m just hedging against irresponsible people ruining my life.  But it means there are now fewer partners seeking out your help, so there’s a smaller internal market for your work.  Eventually, the loss of partners seeking your help will add up.

Third, it could be quite important that I receive the thing today.  We might be sending it to a client tomorrow and delivering it to court on the next day.  If we’re cutting things close, we’ll pay a price for your irresponsibility.

Fourth, what should you have said?  “I know it’s due in three days.  I won’t be able to get it to you.”  I won’t be delighted to hear that, but at least I can recover from your negligence.  If you give me three days’ notice that you can’t do it, then I can find another associate to pinch-hit for you.  Or I can do it myself.  But if you tell me that it isn’t ready on the day that it’s due, we’re toast.

Finally, don’t complain about my setting artificial deadlines.  “He said he wanted it on Tuesday, but I know for a fact that he doesn’t need it until Thursday.  Damn partners are always setting artificial deadlines.”

No, no, no.

I told you the deadline was Tuesday because the last time I asked an associate to deliver something on Tuesday, the associate waited until Tuesday to tell me that he’d dropped the ball.  That was irresponsible, and it ruined my life.  I’m not making that mistake again.  I’m now telling you to deliver stuff on Tuesday that isn’t needed until Thursday to hedge against incompetence.  I know that’s not fair, but you’re paying the price for incompetent associates past.

What else shouldn’t you say to a partner?

“Here’s a draft.  I haven’t yet had time to read all the cases, but I wanted you to see where I was going.”

Keep it.

Give it to me when it’s ready for prime time.

If you haven’t yet read all the cases, then you don’t yet know what the answer is.  Why should I waste my time reading something that doesn’t draw the right conclusion?

The truth is, you don’t want me to read your early draft.  Your early draft is predictably bad.  Suppose I look at your draft.  I see that it’s terrible.  Who do I want to work with next time?  You, the producer of terrible work, or [Jarndyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce), whose work product is flawless?

Yeah, yeah:  You told me it was only a draft.  But so did Jarndyce.  Jarndyce may have been lying — maybe he had fired off every last brain cell to write the thing, proofread it to a fare-thee-well, and had a legal assistant cite-check it — but I don’t know that.  I know only that you produce crappy work, and Jarndyce produces good work.  Next time, when I have a choice between you and Jarndyce, I’m picking Jarndyce.  That’s not good for you.

Be smart.

Partners aren’t crazy. 

(Okay, okay:  Some partners are crazy, but I’m giving my hypothetical partner the benefit of the doubt.)

Partners are hedging against past catastrophes repeating themselves.  Partners are searching for great associates to work with.

View things from the partner’s perspective, and put yourself on the right side of the line.

Don’t speak forbidden words to partners.

# Am Law 100 Firm Dials Back Its COVID-19 Salary Cuts
## Will your law firm be restoring salaries soon? It seems to be about that time.

It’s summertime, but the livin’ hasn’t been easy for the legal profession thanks to the coronavirus crisis. While some law firms have been left struggling, others seem to have developed antibodies to the virus that’s swept the nation and disrupted profits. We now have news of another law firm that’s decided to partially roll back its COVID-19 salary cuts, something that’s now become a major trend.

Back in April, Fox Rothschild announced that [salaries would be slashed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-goes-with-good-news-bad-news-approach-to-covid-19-austerity-measures/) across the board, from partners to staff members. Specifically, a tiered salary reduction of between 10 percent and 15 percent for all attorneys and staff making more than $100,000 would take effect in May, while partners would reduce their monthly draws between 10 percent and 20 percent. At the same time, the firm announced that no layoffs would take place (but we have a feeling that the [“productivity and performance-related dismissals”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/reports-of-associate-stealth-layoffs-at-am-law-100-firm/) that occurred were likely stealth layoffs).

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Four months have passed, and employees at the firm are finally getting some good news when it comes to their paychecks.

In an announcement made earlier this week, firmwide managing partner Mark Morris said that on September 1, half of the cuts made to partners’ monthly draws would restored and half of the reductions to attorney and staff salaries would be also be restored (i.e., next month, partner draws will be cut by 5 to 10 percent and attorney and staff salaries will be cut by 5 and 7.5 percent).

“While we will monitor and evaluate the situation to ensure continued financial flexibility in the months ahead, we are encouraged that in only four months, we are able to reverse course on some of these measures,” [Morris] said. “Our goal remains to be in the best position to serve our clients and provide the support they need to navigate these uncertain and challenging times.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# The Worst Behaved Biglaw Partners: The Final Two

This is your last chance to vote in the Biglaw Lawyers Behaving Badly Bracket. Here is the final matchup:



Well, well, well. The little 4 seed that could. Jeffrey Wertkin, the former Akin Gump partner who was [arrested earlier this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/akin-gump-lawyer-arrested-trying-to-sell-the-details-of-a-whistleblower-complaint/), has made it to the finals of our March Madness Bracket that seeks to determine who, in the history of Above the Law, is the worst-behaved Biglaw attorney. Wertkin’s sin? Well, he stands accused of trying to sell a whistleblower complaint — one he had access to from his time working at the DOJ, before he moved to Akin — for a grand total of $310,000. When arrested, he allegedly told the arresting officer, “My life is over.” And here’s the AtL pièce de résistance: he attempted to make the deal for the complaint using a pseudonym and wearing a wig.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Also in the finals is Edward De Sear. [He’s serving time](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/it-gets-worse-ex-biglaw-partner-who-possessed-kiddie-porn-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-trafficking/) — 17.5 years — for child pornography and sex trafficking. And not that I am trying to pull a Comey and tilt the vote here, but, come on, this guy is definitely the worst, hence all that jail time. There are real victims to De Sear’s crimes and, despite the light-hearted nature of the competition, that shouldn’t be overlooked.

But your vote is your own, and you’re free to vote for the funny story of the Biglaw partner who (allegedly) shot himself in the foot and whose only victim seems to be his own career. Or you could vote for the real downer of a story because the crimes involved are just beyond the pale, and nothing else comes close.

Voting is open until Monday at 5:00 p.m. EST.

Who is the worst behaved Biglaw lawyer of them all?

- # 1 Seed Edward De Sear (81%, 572 Votes)
- # 4 Seed Jeffrey Wertkin (19%, 132 Votes)
Total Voters: 704

# Why Quiet Quitting Is Simply A Signal That Workplace Burnout Is Real

If you’ve ever felt as though you’re on autopilot just struggling to get to Friday or agree there’s more to life than clocking in those billable hours on the weekends to impress the managing partner, you might empathize with the [viral TikTok trend](https://www.tiktok.com/@zaidleppelin/video/7124414185282391342?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7124414185282391342) about quiet quitting.

Yet, quiet quitting isn’t about wanting to work at a below-average pace just to collect a paycheck. It’s a bigger dilemma faced by professionals across all career levels and industries, even in the legal profession. It’s when you become mentally checked out from work because you yearn for that work-life balance. But, for many lawyers in law firms, the rat race of the billable hour often precludes that hard stop from the workday.

Over the past two-plus years, there’s been a surge of lawyers in Biglaw making an [exodus from brand-name firms in lieu of career happiness](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/the-office-exodus-why-lawyers-are-trading-higher-salaries-to-work-from-home/) — ceasing those 80- to 100-hour work weeks, giving up the weekend facetime office visits, and attempting to find balance within their personal lives. Are they part of the quiet quitting culture? No, quiet quitting has simply become a coping mechanism, not a true reflection of a person’s ambition or aptitude. It’s about intentionally choosing to reduce tension, anxiety, and depression.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Every week, my LinkedIn and email inbox are filled with a range of messages — younger lawyers seeking ideas on how to transition out of law, midlevel and senior lawyers asking if it’s too late to make a change in their career, and executive-level lawyers wanting a major shift in their final years of practice before they seek a paid board seat. The common theme: [workplace burnout](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/its-mental-health-awareness-month-but-is-the-legal-profession-truly-aware/) and a desire to create more balance (i.e., find that career happiness).

COVID-19 has changed us. It’s caused us to re-evaluate our lives and re-evaluate our work. Boundaries became fuzzy and unclear as workdays blended into worknights while many professionals juggled parenting with full-time careers. The Great Resignation prompted a change for lawyers (and other professionals) who felt trapped by the money or the prestige of working for a big firm or brand company.

I’ve lost track of the number of senior executive leaders and lawyers who have contacted me in the past two years to overhaul their resume and LinkedIn profile because of the reasons mentioned above.

In fact, I worked more in 2020 and 2021 than I ever did previously to help clients make sweeping career changes. Guess what happened? I reached my own burnout. I had raging fatigue.

So, I took action and [set firm boundaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/why-i-am-setting-intentions-instead-of-resolutions-in-the-new-year/) for my own sanity. That meant turning off my computer on the weekends (and not responding to any emails until Monday morning), initiating hard stops in my workday so I could mentally decompress, attending doctor’s appointments (instead of postponing them) to prioritize my health, ceasing to eat lunch at my desk just to send those extra emails, and creating more gaps in my calendar to spread out work rather than overextend myself.

However, all those actions stemmed from prior conditioning as a lawyer for 12 years — sleeping with my BlackBerry next to me in 2010 when I worked for a partner who bragged about her all-nighters and expected you to do the same, the associate who reported to the partner as to whose car was parked in the garage at 7:30 p.m., and the partner who expected you to work through lunch because he did as well. It’s hard to unlearn that behavior.

The result of my actions: I continued to perform at a high level for my clients but reduced my own tension and anxiety about obsessively overachieving.

Whether you’re mentally checked out from work, tired of chasing the “hustle” mentality, or seeking a transition into a new role that personally fulfills you, quiet quitting is merely a term that means refocusing your energy on what’s important to you — and yes, maybe that’s trading a higher salary or brand recognition for personal and professional fulfillment. Or maybe, quiet quitting is a wake-up call for law firms and Corporate America to understand that [overworked](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/how-to-set-better-and-healthier-boundaries-in-your-career/) doesn’t equate to true success in the workplace.

# The Biglaw Firms Joining The Antiracism Alliance
## Over 125 firms have joined the antiracism effort. Is yours on the list?

Imagine leveraging all the power and might of Biglaw, and law firms in general, in order to fight racism, Well, imagine no more, Over 125 firms (so far!) have signed onto the Law Firm Antiracism Alliance (LFAA) and it includes some of the biggest and most prestigious firms in the country. According to the [LFAA charter](http://www.skadden.com/-/media/files/about/law_firm_antiracism_alliance.pdf), the purpose of the group is to “leverage the resources of the private bar to amplify the voices of communities and individuals oppressed by racism, to better use the law as a vehicle for change that benefits communities of color and to promote racial equity in the law and in government institutions.”

As[ reported by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/06/24/over-125-firms-have-joined-the-law-firm-antiracism-alliance/), Kimberly Jones Merchant and the Racial Justice Institute and Racial Justice Network at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law is a partner of the LFAA, and she said the increased resources for their work will be able to make a real difference:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
She said that while efforts to facilitate change on a systemic level have received temporary support in the past, the disproportionately dire effects of COVID-19 on Blacks as well as the murder of George Floyd galvanized efforts in a way that had not been present previously.

“APBCO [The Association of Pro Bono Counsel] and other organizations like the EJI [Equal Justice Initiative] bring advocates to the table,” Jones Merchant said. “But they have constrained resources and can’t operate at the ‘high’ levels. Now we have those resources behind us.”

The LFAA plans on holding two summits this year, and Jones Merchant anticipates a steep learning curve, what with so many well-meaning allies having to unlearn a lot about privilege and race:

“We are going to have some bumps in the road,” Jones Merchant said. “It is an experiment, and both sides are going to have to make adjustments. We are going to learn from each other. Pro bono counsel will have to learn a lot about systemic racism.”

Still it is a great step forward, and it’s exciting to imagine what such a talent group of lawyers can accomplish when racism is the target of their efforts.

# Powerful Discussions Of Race And Gender In Law Firms
## How to have meaningful conversations in the workplace about issues of diversity, race, gender, and inclusivity.

It was an experience, [Gillian Power](https://www.lathropgpm.com/gillian-power) said, that taught her that one can simultaneously be at the most vulnerable point in one’s life and also the most empowered.

After struggling privately for decades with her assigned gender, Power, chief information officer at the law firm [Lathrop GPM](https://www.lathropgpm.com/) in Kansas City, finally came out to herself and her family as transgender, and then made the difficult decision to also come out to her colleagues. It took her nine months to compose the letter she planned to send them, and when she finally worked up the courage to take it to work, she stashed it in a desk drawer.

But eventually she did send it — first to her supervisor and then to firm leadership, all of whom pledged to support her however they could, and then to the rest of the firm’s employees, who within an hour flooded her inbox with more than 100 messages of support.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For [Kim Barrett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mskimbarrett/), legal professional and paralegal administrator at [Latham & Watkins](https://www.lw.com/) in Los Angeles, her story of vulnerability and empowerment was much different. Born to a white mother and a black father, her Caucasian appearance caused many of her colleagues to conclude she was white. But when, in one of her early jobs as a paralegal in a corporate legal department, she brought her family to a company outing, the change among some coworkers was palpable.

It crystallized for her one day afterwards when she asked a lawyer if the company would be open on Martin Luther King Day. “I don’t know how you people celebrate,” he replied, “but the company is open.”

“It took everything I had not to lash out at him,” Barrett recalled. “But I needed the job.”

Barrett went on to chart a successful career, eventually earning master’s degrees in both paralegal studies and business administration while working full time and raising a family. Having worked at multiple firms and corporations over the years since that incident, she never again experienced racism, at least not overtly.

But if she had the confidence she has now when that incident occurred so early in her career, she would have responded different and confronted the lawyer. And she hopes that others who witness such conduct would say something too.

Talking About Race And Gender

Power and Barrett shared their stories as speakers on a July 22 panel, “Talking Successfully About Race, Politics & Gender at Work,” presented by [i.WILL](https://www.i-will.net/) — Inspiring Women Igniting Leadership and Learning — and its founder [Andrea Markstrom](https://www.taftlaw.com/people/andrea-markstrom), CIO at [Taft](https://www.taftlaw.com/) in Minneapolis, and moderated by [Anna McGrane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-mcgrane-aa864886/), cofounder and COO of [PacerPro](https://www.pacerpro.com/).

The focus of the program was on exploring how to have meaningful conversations in the workplace about issues of diversity, race, gender, and inclusivity.

For Power, her experience of those issues comes not only as someone who grew up struggling with her assigned gender, but also as someone who grew up as a privileged white male in Apartheid-era South Africa.

So much of what she sees happening now in the United States around race mirrors the awakening that happened to many white people in South Africa when she was younger, where, she says, many white people had been completely shielded from the horrors of the Apartheid system.

That sense of while male privilege also accrued to her fear and confusion about her gender identity. “I was afforded many opportunities while presenting as a male person and realized how much privilege accrues to that.”

Power eventually moved to London, where in 2001 she obtained her first law firm job at Dentons providing technical support. In 2003, after meeting her eventual wife while on a business trip to the United States, she moved to this country and in 2008 joined Lathrop.

But even after coming out to her wife in 2013, she remained “petrified” of coming out to her coworkers. There was no precedent for her to follow, she said, as no one on the administrative side of a major law firm had openly transitioned before. And she was inhibited both by a sense of shame and by the fear of possibly losing her job and her professional relationships.

“Despite that, I was propelled forward,” she said. “The need to express who you are is one of the strongest forces within us — we can’t hold it back.”

When she did finally come out, the outpouring of support from her colleagues was overwhelming. And it provided lessons that informed not just her situation, but those of so many right now.

The conversations that we are now having in this country and globally are about vulnerability, Power said, about people saying, “I am suffering.” If we engage in those conversations with strength, with dignity, and with resoluteness, that is what produces change, “because it changes the heart of people.”

For leaders at law firms and other organizations, the lesson is to recognize that we have all these different viewpoints and to be able to find “the golden mean” or the path through these views.

“The role of leadership is to be able to do that — to have the centeredness and the awareness to hold and value all those perspectives,” Power said.

‘A Lot Of People Are Not OK’

Barrett is a former Marine who worked her way up through the ranks at Latham after earning an associate’s degree in paralegal studies in 1997 and landing a job there as a part-time night receptionist. From there, she moved into a secretarial role and then became an entry-level paralegal.

While raising two children and working full time, she earned a bachelor’s degree in justice studies and then two master’s degrees, in paralegal studies and business administration. In 2017, the firm promoted her into her current role, where she oversees everyone at the firm who falls under a broad umbrella of legal paraprofessionals.

As a woman of mixed race, she has always strived for diversity among her professional teams to include an array of different perspectives.

She is also aware that the events of the past few months, especially since the “infuriating and heartbreaking” murder of George Floyd, have brought to life for some what has been known for years to those in communities of color.

“Others who are not of color were able to go about in their own bubble because it didn’t affect them personally,” she said. “But now it does.”

She is also a mother who worries about her own two sons. “People of color have experienced unfair treatment by the criminal justice system since forever. This is not a new phenomenon.”

These events outside the workplace affect people in ways that they carry into the workplace, Barrett believes. “A lot of people are not OK mentally and emotionally because of things going on outside the office,” she said.

Her firm has responded by trying to give employees a safe space to share their stories and feelings, as well as to share if they have experienced racism of any kind at work. The firm scheduled an online open forum that so many people signed up for that a second one was required.

The firm has also created a Black Lives Matter group and has other programs to ensure that black culture is celebrated within the firm.

As for how to have conversations with employees around these issues, Barrett said, “You need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.”

She cited the book [Crucial Conversations](https://amzn.to/3f04MYY), which she said has been useful in teaching her critical skills. When emotions are high, it is hard to hear each other, she said, and this book gives guidance on how to talk to each other and to communicate with honesty.

No One Said This Would Be Easy

Near the end of the program, moderator McGrane asked Barrett about that incident early in her career when the lawyer revealed his blatant racism. Had there been another person the room, what would Barrett have wanted that person to do?

“Call it out,” Barrett replied. “We have to call them out. That can be uncomfortable and scary — and it needs to be done.”

As for Power, her experiences have shown her that “every human being inherently wants to express themselves in a dignified manner, to express who they are.” The role of managers and leaders, she believes, is to figure out how they can remove obstacles to that expression.

“That’s not easy in business,” Power said. “No one said this would be easy. But the investment results are so rich.”

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Law firms are on pretty solid ground when they say they don’t want to support terrorism or work with people that support it.

Most major law firms are large and complex entities. And it is hard to please everyone all the time. But the choice some firms make is to manage to the interests of the attorneys and clients that are most important to them and that they can least afford to lose. Inaction may seem like the path of least resistance, but when it comes to issues like terrorism, it could be a missed opportunity for firms not to let those constituents know where they stand.

— Kent Zimmermann, law firm strategic adviser at Zeughauser Group, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/18/after-davis-polk-rescinds-offers-pressure-grows-on-firms-to-act-despite-grey-areas-in-controversy/) on whether the legal community should expect more firms to revoke offers in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack by Hamas in Israel. Zimmermann said that in this case, where acts of terrorism are concerned, firms will support the interests of their attorneys and clients. At this time, Winston & Strawn and Davis Polk & Wardwell have [rescinded job offers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/nyu-student-bar-president-israel-palestine/) for students who made [controversial statements related to Israel](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/davis-polk-rescinds-offers-to-t14-law-school-students-for-their-controversial-statements-on-israel/) following the Hamas attack.

# Biglaw Firm Rolls Back Salary Cuts Earlier Than Anticipated

More and more Biglaw firms are finding their footing after the upheaval caused by COVID-19. And that means the salary cuts that swept the industry in the spring are being reversed this autumn.

[In April, Duane Morris surprised associates with a round of COVID-19 austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-cuts-associate-salaries-and-expects-reduced-pay-to-last-through-the-end-of-the-year/?rf=1) that included salary cuts (the firm’s previous rhetoric about solid financial performance led some to believe Duane Morris would survive the pandemic unscathed). The firm, which made $510,341,000 in gross revenue last year making it 74th on the Am Law 100 list, cut associate and special counsel salaries by 15 percent effective May 1, and expected the cuts to last until the end of the year. But the firm has surprised associates yet again, this time with some good news.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Effective September 1, the firm rolled back the salary cuts — a full four months earlier than originally anticipated. In the firm’s announcement, [available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/duane-morris-rollbacks/2/), firm chair [Matthew Taylor](https://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/matthewataylor.html) noted they were “grateful” for all the hard work employees were putting in that allowed the early rollbacks. Taylor also said the firm is hopeful for a “Phase 2” of rollbacks that would see attorneys receive make-whole payments.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Biglaw Associates Are NOT Happy With This 4-Day Office Mandate

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

There is a very strong, negative reaction to four days a week. Two days a week is probably the magic number, if associates had the power to determine it – but they don’t right now.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh?byconsultantorauthor=kate-reder-sheikh), a partner in the associate practice group of legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/column-does-requiring-4-days-office-make-these-firms-trendsetters-or-outliers-2023-07-21/) on the associate response to the [four-day return to the office](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/hybrid-work-policies/) being mandated by a handful of some of the most elite Biglaw firms in the country. Luckily, as keenly [noted by Jenna Greene](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/column-does-requiring-4-days-office-make-these-firms-trendsetters-or-outliers-2023-07-21/), firms aren’t falling in line to follow the leader just yet as they would on other perks.

# Take The Money Where It Comes...
## Be honest about where and how revenue is actually coming into the firm -- and invest the appropriate level of time and energy to grow that revenue.

Lawyers can be an interesting bunch, especially when it comes to money issues. On the one hand, our profession is among the most open when it comes to compensation issues, whether in the form of Biglaw associate salaries or firms touting their profits per partner. On the other hand, lawyers can be very coy when it comes to revealing the true financial health of their firms, driven by the widespread fear that any sign of weakness will lead to dire consequences in the form of clients choosing to bring their business to busier — and hence, presumably better — outfits. It is unsurprising, therefore, that money issues can be complicated when it comes to law firms.

What this dynamic engenders as well is a willingness amongst many lawyers to ignore or delegate any financial analysis to others — in the name of focusing on the client service they provide. In my own career, I have seen colleagues up for partner who steadfastly refused to look at their own financial performance, perhaps in the hopes that if they ignored it, there would less of an emphasis on their numbers in the partnership evaluation. Similarly, I have been at many a partner lunch where the presentation of financial numbers was met with disinterest by a measurable cohort of the attendees. While the willingness of sophisticated lawyers to analyze the health of their livelihoods may be surprising, there is a strong undercurrent in our profession that focusing on the “numbers” can be an ignoble pursuit, best left to accounting types.

While a rank-and-file Biglaw partner could conceivably espouse such an attitude, law firm owners and Biglaw management do not have that luxury. Accordingly, this time of year often includes some level of analyzing last year’s financial performance, on both a firm and individual lawyer level. While most of the analysis focuses on the top-line performance — with questions asked about whether the firm’s revenue grew, or whether an individual partner’s originations were up to par — there is one area of analysis that is perhaps worthy of more attention. Especially for smaller firms, whose revenues may result from a mixture of fee arrangements, from the billable hour to contingency matters.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In short, firms (and individual lawyers, for that matter) could often benefit from careful consideration of what contributions the different types of fee arrangements they enter into made to last year’s bottom line. Moreover, the analysis should also take into consideration whether that distribution has changed over time, and whether one type of fee arrangement has been making an outsized contribution to financial performance. Once performed, the analysis can often lead to eye-opening conclusions. Firms that think they rely of contingency matters to boost revenue may notice that they are actually generating a lot of billable or flat-fee work. And firms composed of lawyers who fancy themselves as billable-hour mavens may realize that it actually the contingency work that is paying their bills. In fact, both lawyers and firms can make bad decisions based on their perception of whether certain revenue is better than other revenue — simply because that type of revenue fits better with their perception of themselves as lawyers or firms.

In contrast, smart firms take into account where and how the money is actually coming in — and adjust their businesses accordingly. Favorable examples in other industries abound. For example, I recently read about how the [Ringer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://awfulannouncing.com/ringer/the-ringer-podcast-ad-sales-outside-investment.html%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1549942623893000&sa=D&ust=1549942623907000&usg=AFQjCNHBxE9P4is0QgvUKCcyGOjy_ITdYA)’s podcast network has been driving revenue for the company. Considering the Ringer’s roots as a quality-driven source of written and video content, it is a bit unusual that it is podcasts generating the money needed to operate the website. But that is where the favorable revenue stream is, and in response the Ringer has wisely doubled down on its podcast network, increasing the number and breadth of its podcast offerings to maximize its revenue generation. Sure, the Ringer hopes that all of its efforts will be profitable, including its website offerings. But it has also realized there is no need for stubbornness, and because podcasts are profitable then that is where attention will be given and investments made. At least until other elements of the business are just as profitable.

Ultimately, the Ringer’s experience should resonate with law firms. Sometimes we imagine that we make money offering a certain type of service. Or model ourselves on other lawyers and firms that have demonstrated an ability to generate money a certain way. We may even come to think that there is a “better” way to generate revenue. But that can be counterproductive and lead to missed opportunities. Better to be honest about where and how the revenue is actually coming into the firm — and investing the appropriate level of time and energy to grow that revenue accordingly. Once the main source of revenue is given the attention it needs, then the focus can shift to building out the revenue stream the firm’s owners think is ideal. We all have an idea of the best way for us to make money. Until those ideas become reality, however, lawyers must remember to take the money where it comes.

# Lawyers Should Sometimes Speak Less During Oral Arguments
## By speaking less, lawyers may be less of a target for questions, and might look stronger than their adversaries who are unable to adequately answer hostile or challenging questions posed by a court.

I once had a professor in law school who told everyone in my class that in order to be a good advocate, lawyers need to speak as much as possible at oral arguments. According to this professor, those who speak more during oral arguments are able to control the pace of the proceedings and make the most points that can be considered by the court. Nevertheless, in numerous situations it pays to actually speak less during oral arguments, and lawyers should sometimes exercise restraint and refrain from speaking too much.

Perhaps the most important situation when lawyers should speak less during oral arguments is if it is clear that the judge is siding with the attorney’s client. Sometimes, judges come out swinging at the party against whom the judge intends to rule after oral argument. In such instances, judges may ask critical questions and make arguments in favor for why the other attorney should lose in a matter. Of course, if a judge asks a prevailing party a question in such instances, that lawyer should speak up, but in all other situations, the lawyer should just let the court do its work.

One time, earlier in my career, an attorney asked for a temporary restraining order against my client in a real estate matter. It is very hard for parties to obtain this type of relief since temporary restraining orders are usually granted on an expedited basis without the court hearing much evidence. Accordingly, the party asking for a temporary restraining order usually needs to satisfy a high burden in order to obtain the requested relief.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
At oral arguments to decide the temporary restraining order, the judge came out swinging against my adversary who represented the party seeking a temporary restraining order. The judge made my arguments for me and asked extremely incisive questions to my adversary. I said almost nothing at the oral arguments since I thought that adding analysis to the mix could only hurt my client if the judge was already clearly in my client’s favor. In the end, the judge ruled in favor of my client, and my client was impressed with the outcome I had helped obtain even though I only said a few words during oral arguments.

Another time lawyers should say as little as possible is if they have strong papers to support the arguments made on a matter. Lawyers have different competencies, and some are better writers than others. In addition, sometimes lawyers have exceptional papers on a subject, either because they have experience drafting the type of papers involved in a matter or if lawyers invested time and resources in drafting exceptional papers.

In such instances, it sometimes pays for lawyers to rest on the arguments presented in the papers. This is especially prudent if it appears as if there is a “hot bench” and the court has carefully reviewed the materials submitted in a case. Of course, lawyers should still answer all of the questions asked by the court during oral arguments, and this can help clarify issues. However, referring to papers is sometimes better than relying on oral arguments, and often, judges will appreciate advocates who save time by not repeating points that have already been conveyed in the papers.

Depending on the oral argument style of a judge, it may be even more important to speak as little as possible during oral arguments. Some judges are passive during oral arguments and interrupt parties very little while they present their points. However, some judges are very active during oral arguments and ask questions of the advocates related to the papers or the facts involved in a dispute.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
More often than not, judges ask questions of parties who speak more during oral arguments. This is because the points made during oral argument are on the minds of judges, and judges may want to inquire about those points. Some judges are hostile when asking questions and like to pick arguments apart with their questions. When lawyers face such judges, it usually pays to be asked as few questions as possible, since lawyers can trip up when they are asked difficult questions. In addition, the stress of being asked a challenging or hostile question can knock a lawyer off his or her feet and make it difficult to present good points at oral arguments. If a lawyer has a bad demeanor at oral argument because of the stress of questions, this can impact a judge’s decision-making. By speaking less, lawyers may be less of a target for questions, and might look stronger than their adversaries who are unable to adequately answer hostile or challenging questions posed by a court.

Lawyers love to talk, and some attorneys may think that speaking more during oral arguments means that a client’s arguments will get the best consideration by a court. Nevertheless, there are numerous situations when it makes sense for lawyers to speak less during oral arguments.

# Top 25 Biglaw Firm Will Dump Tons Of Bonus Cash On Associates Who Bill Their Butts Off

Some elite Biglaw firms are known for offering market-beating bonuses for their high billers. Year after year, they prove that they’re willing to pay for the most committed legal talent by adding tens of thousands of dollars to their regular year-end bonus payouts.

One of those firms is Quinn Emanuel.

The litigation powerhouse — which came in 25th place in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, with $1.25 billion in revenue in 2019 — just announced its 2020 year-end bonus matrix, and there are some hefty rewards in store for those who truly dedicated their lives to the firm.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Associates who billed between 2100 and 2399 hours will receive a bonus equal to the market rate [introduced by Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) and later [adopted by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/). Big billers start raking in more cash at 2400 hours. Depending on class year, those who billed 2400 hours or more will receive up to $20,000 more than market, while those who billed 2700 hours or more will receive up to $35,000 more than market.

Check out the Quinn Emanuel matrix below:



This year, QE is offering partial bonuses to those who had hours between 2000-2099, and as usual, the firm is rounding associates up to market bonuses if they just missed the 2100 cutoff. As noted in the matrix, the firm is also offering associates the Davis Polk-inspired special bonuses that have become a 2020 market standard.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There’s just one catch, and it’s a matter of who will receive those special bonuses.

“This year many of you will also receive a special bonus,” the firm’s memo reads. (The memo is available on the next page.) Many? Why not all? And if that does mean all, why use such equivocal language that seems to add another layer of eligibility? A source from the firm has the same quibble about the firm’s phrasing:

They’ve really introduced an unnecessary ambiguity regarding the special bonuses–not befitting of a firm that makes this much money and depends so much on lateral recruits. “This year many of you will also receive an additional bonus”. That’s not a commitment of any sort.

Quinn Emanuel will be paying its bonuses sometime this week, so we suppose we’ll soon find out who exactly received special bonuses at the firm.

(Flip to the next page to see the full Quinn Emanuel bonus memo.)

# Top Law Schools Change The Dates Of Their Virtual Interview Programs
## Yale and Stanford are moving their virtual interview programs to June -- and other law schools may be forced to do the same.

Two top law schools are changing the dates of their virtual recruiting programs to make students’ lives a bit less hectic — and make the hiring process a little easier (for their students, at least).

As first reported by [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2024/02/08/yale-and-stanford-law-schools-move-virtual-interviews-to-june/), both Yale and Stanford will be moving their virtual interview programs to June, ahead of their formal on-campus interviews. Not only will this help lighten their students’ loads, but it will increase the likelihood of their students finding employment. It seems that because recruiting is starting earlier and earlier, the administrations at Yale and Stanford were wary that spots may not be available come late July and early August. From Law.com:

The school is moving OCI up instead of “releasing our students into the market early through open direct applications or a pre-season initiative,” which can help coordinate applications and screening interviews in a streamlined and efficient process and can minimize the disruption to summer programs, according to SLS’s announcement.

“We strongly believe that moving OCI earlier will be less onerous on our students than a recruiting process that includes both OCI and direct applications and stretches from June through the end of August,” according to SLS’s announcement. “We think it is important that our students be able to focus on finals and we’d like to minimize as much as possible the impact of the 2L job search on their 1L summer job, which for most of them, is their first legal experience.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Kelly Voight, Yale’s assistant dean for the Career Development Office, said that the school had “resisted” making this move to June for as long as they could, but “reluctantly” made the change this year in order to “maximize students’ access to opportunities and allow for informed decision-making.” The elite school may shift its interview programming in the future depending on law firms’ hiring practices.

While this plan may work out smashingly for Yale and Stanford students — who, let’s face it, were going to get jobs anyway — we’ve got to wonder how students at other top law schools will be impacted. Will formalizing these virtual interviews turn into a law school arms race for jobs at top law firms? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see… and wait for the potential madness to begin.

In light of this news, will other top law schools follow in the footsteps of Yale and Stanford? If you have any details, please feel free to let us know.

# What Happens When Biglaw Gets ‘Political’?

Today, with the increased likelihood of political blowback and client retaliation, there is the chance that your partners will be disturbed by the representation. [W]e may be headed in that direction [of firms having to choose sides.] It is as divided and politically charged as it has ever been.

— [Nick Gravante](https://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/nicholas-gravante), co-chair of global litigation at Cadwalader, in comments given to [Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/07/law-firms-are-getting-pushed-into-red-or-blue-corners/) on the sometimes highly controversial nature of representing clients in today’s overly politicized world. A “wrong” move could potentially affect the firm’s place in the market, including but not limited to retention of clients and talent.

# Biglaw's Push For The Equal Rights Amendment

The battle for the Equal Rights Amendment — a constitutional amendment to guarantee equal treatment based on sex — has been going on for over 100 years. Now that 38 states have ratified the amendment, the ERA is closer than ever, but it’s far from a given. There’s a whole lotta legal wrangling that has to happen first.

I chatted with [Linda Coberly](https://www.winston.com/en/who-we-are/professionals/coberly-linda-t.html), Chicago Office Managing Partner for Winston & Strawn as well as the Chair of the ERA Coalition’s Legal Task Force, about the ongoing fight for the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment. She talks about the recently filed amicus brief in support of the adoption of the ERA, the history of the amendment, why it’s taken so long, how Winston & Strawn got involved in the effort, and about the importance of Biglaw pro bono efforts.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

Last night, the New York Times published a report featuring the stories of two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, who claimed that they’d been [sexually assaulted by Donald Trump](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html). These allegations come a week after the second presidential debate, where Trump told the nation that he’d never actually kissed or groped women without their permission, despite the fact that he’d bragged about doing so during a [2005 conversation recorded on a hot microphone](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html) that was recently made public.

Prior to publication, Megan Twohey of the New York Times called Trump for comment:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In a phone interview on Tuesday night, a highly agitated Mr. Trump denied every one of the women’s claims.

“None of this ever took place,” said Mr. Trump, who began shouting at the Times reporter who was questioning him. He said that The Times was making up the allegations to hurt him and that he would sue the news organization if it reported them.

“You are a disgusting human being,” he told the reporter as she questioned him about the women’s claims.

Asked whether he had ever done any of the kissing or groping that he had described on the recording, Mr. Trump was once again insistent: “I don’t do it. I don’t do it. It was locker room talk.”

On Wednesday afternoon, both Twohey and Dean Baquet, executive editor of the Times, received legal letters from Trump’s attorney, [Marc E. Kasowitz](http://www.kasowitz.com/marc-e-kasowitz/), name partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman, threatening to sue the publication if it did not retract the “libelous” article about Leeds and Crooks. (Last week, Kasowitz threatened to sue the Times for [publication of three pages from Trump’s 1995 tax returns](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/donald-trump-chooses-biglaw-firm-to-fight-new-york-times-over-publication-of-tax-documents/).)

Here’s an excerpt from Kasowitz’s letter (the full letter is available on the next page):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/12/media/new-york-times-donald-trump-lawsuit-threat/index.html), a high-ranking source within the Trump campaign said that a lawsuit was being drafted against the Times, and that “NYT editors, reporters, politically motivated accusers better lawyer up.” Lawyer up they shall, but is it wise for Trump to sue over these allegations? Numerous voices across several media outlets disagree.

Dylan Byers and Brian Stelter of [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/12/media/new-york-times-donald-trump-lawsuit-threat/index.html) note that Trump would have the burden of proving falsity and actual malice, and that the Times would be able to pursue discovery. In an interview with the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/13/donald-trump-is-threatening-to-sue-the-new-york-times-that-might-be-a-bad-idea/), Professor [John L. Diamond](http://www.uchastings.edu/faculty/diamond/index.php) of UC Hastings Law said it would be “very appropriate and relevant for the reporters to question Trump on the truth of the allegation under oath, and a court would likely order depositions. There is no Fifth Amendment protection for civil cases.” If Trump denies the allegations under oath, and they were later proven to be true, he could face perjury charges.

Even if Trump could show that the claims of Leeds and Crooks were untrue, that alone would not be enough to win a libel case against the times. The “actual malice” standard established by the U.S. Supreme Court means Trump would further have to demonstrate “that the defendants knew the report was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth,” Diamond said.”Given the malice requirement, the case would be easily dismissible, based on the fact of a credible interview,” he added.

The Times could “easily” win dismissal of the suit, but would they want to? Professor Diamond hinted that the newspaper may “defer the motion” in order to get Trump to testify under oath. It seems that if Trump decides to pursue a suit over these allegations, he may be opening up a bottomless can of legal worms for himself.

Maybe this is why the Republican presidential candidate wants to [“open up our libel laws”](http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/donald-trump-libel-laws-219866) if he wins the election in November — so he can “sue [publications] and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they’re totally protected.”

# The Corrosive Effects Of Ignoring Diversity

In this episode of The Jabot, I speak with Peter Lynch, partner at Cozen O’Connor, on why he went to law school and how he chose his practice area. Peter discusses why he values D&I programs at business and bar association levels. He shares why he founded DisabilityRightsNow along with the organization’s objectives. The legal profession has fallen behind in the hiring of people with disabilities. Thus, Peter poses some solutions that the legal industry may implement to correct this historical error.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

One by one, Biglaw firms will inevitably match the new salary scale as the quest to retain and attract talent continues in the hottest lateral market the legal profession has seen in years.

The latest firm to offer increased associate compensation on the [Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) is a very special one indeed. It’s none other than the firm that got the [most recent cycle of special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) off and running: Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Here’s what pay will look like at the firm, as of July 1:

- 2020/2021: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013+: $365,000

Note here that Willkie is flipping the switch for its youngest associates by offering a $205,000 salary for the Class of 2021, where as all over firms — including Davis Polk — are offering $202,500. It’s just a bit more, but it can make all the difference in a market where firms are eager to match the highest of salaries for all.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# More Associate Cuts Ahead Thanks To Biglaw's Negative Financial Outlook
## You can expect more aggressive performance reviews from here on out.

Firms are reluctant to shed recently recruited lawyers, but reliance on natural attrition and repurposing associates has not provided satisfactory results; thus, we’ve begun to hear of more demanding performance reviews to manage utilization.

Capacity utilization remains firms’ biggest challenge near-term, [but] formal layoffs do not yet appear to be a pervasive consideration.

— An excerpt from the [Wells Fargo Legal Specialty Group’s nine-month survey report](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/15/more-cuts-higher-billing-rates-could-be-on-the-horizon-for-big-law/), where it’s noted that stealth layoffs are likely to continue due to multiple financial indicators heading south through the third quarter, like net income (down 7.3%); profits per equity partner (down 8.5%); demand (down ~1%); and productivity (down 5.3%). Owen Burman, senior consultant for the legal specialty group, noted that the average number of lawyer billable hours had dropped to 1,592 on an annualized basis (compared to 1,611 at this year’s six-month mark, and ~1,636 before the pandemic in 2018 and 2019). “Those are just not satisfactory levels of performance, so that’s why we’re starting to see this talk about more aggressive performance reviews,” he told the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/15/more-cuts-higher-billing-rates-could-be-on-the-horizon-for-big-law/).

# Jones Day Will Probably Take Don McGahn Back, But They Shouldn’t

Don McGahn (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

UPDATE 8/29/18: President Trump has made it official. [Don McGahn is leaving after the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-white-house-counsel-donald-mcgahn-will-leave-his-job-in-the-fall/2018/08/29/f56828be-ab98-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html?utm_term=.23cfc5b632ad&wpisrc=nl_most&wpmm=1).

The headline news from this weekend is that White House Counsel, Don McGahn, has cooperated extensively with the Mueller investigation. For a man who demands loyalty, Donald Trump seems to inspire about as much loyalty in his henchmen as Skeletor did.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Given Donald Trump’s instincts to, you know, obstruct justice, letting the man often ordered to obstruct justice on Trump’s behalf free rein to talk to the special counsel was probably a tactical error by Trump’s legal team.

The report in the New York Times indicates that McGahn was concerned he would be set up to take the fall for Trump’s obstruction. McGahn should be worried about that. He might only be a hatchet man, but hatchet men also face punishment when the wheel comes back around.

As Cristian Farias pointed out in New York Magazine earlier this year, Don McGahn is already well on his way to being known as [the worst White House counsel of all time.](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/how-don-mcgahn-has-become-the-worst-white-house-counsel-ever.html) He has been unable or unwilling to impose even basic legal standards on this White House. He does what other men would refuse and entertains what better men would decry.

But the fact that he is cooperating so extensively with Mueller indicates that McGahn is, in fact, a rat: not necessarily in the “betrayal” sense, but in the “I ain’t going down with this sinking ass ship” sense. The Times report shows that McGahn intends to survive the Trump administration. He has sacrificed his reputation in service of Trump, but he doesn’t appear to be willing to hand over his bar license.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Any long game McGahn might be playing will eventually lead him back from whence he came, back to Jones Day. We had reports earlier this year that McGahn was trying to figure out when he could get back to his old job at the firm. Some sources said he’d be out by this summer. With that deadline passed, others speculate that he’ll hang on to the midterms and then quit.

My operating assumption is always that the Mueller people don’t leak, so any information that gets out is out because Trump or a Trump stooge thinks they benefit from it. Here, it would make sense to me that McGahn himself leaked that he’s been talking, to anger the impulsive president to trigger the firing that lets McGahn go back to Jones Day.

But why would Jones Day want Don McGahn back? What client is going to say, “You’re putting Don McGahn on my case? The disgraced White House counsel who helped the president obstruct justice, ratted him out to save his own skin, and presided over the most corrupt White House in history? SIGN ME UP! I’d be honored to pay his fees.”

I know that Jones Day has made the strategic decision that ingratiating itself to this White House is worth the profile. I know they’re banking on being able to say, “We’ll serve anybody in power, even the Nazis,” and having most lawyers nod and agree that taking on terrible clients is just part of the game. And I know they’re probably right in their assessment. Rich and powerful people are not in the habit of punishing each other for lacking moral and ethical standards.

But does competence mean literally nothing? McGahn isn’t just compromised by his association with a racist fascist crimelord… he’s also shown his ass as a terrible freaking attorney. How does the first travel ban get within 10 feet of his desk without be set aflame? How does Tom Price happen? How does Rob Porter happen? How does the Devin Nunes memo happen? How does Jared and Ivanka happen?

McGahn has been an epic disaster at his job. How does Jones Day just stick his name on a corner office and say “welcome home”? CAN THEY MAKE HIM TAKE THE MPRE AGAIN JUST TO CHECK?

Of course, they’ll have him back. And 10 years from now, McGahn will slurping oysters with some prospective client, talking about how his close personal relation with Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and (probably) Brett Kavanaugh is the kind of insider representation that you can get at Jones Day.

This town needs an enema.

# Biglaw Firm Hosts Therapy Dogs To Provide 'Fun, Memorable' Office Experience
## The office can drain a lawyer. Keep it upbeat.

A couple weeks back, we had a story here at Above the Law [taking a swipe at “puppy yoga”](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/biglaw-mental-health-needs-to-be-about-more-than-just-puppy-yoga/) as a mental health initiative. And while that might not be a replacement for a robust strategy, the crack seemed unnecessarily derisive of the role animals can play in managing stress. Or, perhaps more to the point, the value of working within an office culture that considers stress management a priority. I’m not likely to hang out with a therapy dog because I’m a cat person — they’re mean and project an air of superiority, qualities that appeal to me for some reason — but knowing that a firm offers access to therapy canines for those who would appreciate them sends a signal to everyone in the firm.

We’ve trumpeted Seward & Kissel’s office fun initiatives for a while now. In a world of hybrid work, it’s a challenge to convince the law firm to want to come into the office to take advantage of all the professional benefits that come with face-to-face interaction. Running an [in-office miniature golf tournament](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/seward-kissel-designs-worlds-longest-miniature-golf-hole/) is the sort of thing that communicates the office esprit de corps that translates to voluntary buy-in.

On April 4, 2024, Seward & Kissel hosted four therapy dogs from New York Therapy Animals, Inc. to provide a little stress relief. Specifically, the four dogs and their trainers included: Shaunna and “Ziggy” the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Colleen and “Louie” the Chocolate Lab, Jessica and “Disco” the Mini Poodle, and Nancy and “Melodie” the Toy Poodle.

From Pilot and Above The Law  


Seward partner and culture committee head Steve Nadel replied, “We’ve heard so many stories about colleges bringing in therapy dogs during final exam season, so we thought why can’t we do something like that too. Our culture goal at the firm is to create an environment where people get to experience fun, memorable, rewarding activities in which anyone can participate. Where else but Seward & Kissel do you get to play with four super cute dogs in the middle of the workday?”

The word “memorable” stuck out in this description because it’s a quality that gets overlooked a lot. When I think back to my favorite days in the law firm offices, they involve something really memorable. Whether it’s the time we played off-hours frisbee down an abandoned corridor while waiting for edits or the time the copier caught fire, those are the times that the office felt the most like a community. Even if some lawyers find themselves stuck in a conference room during the event itself, the mood of the whole place remains elevated for hours and it’s infectious.

Firms that understand this will get a lot more buy-in both for office attendance and when it comes time to worry about retention.

# Partners Should Listen To Their Associates More
## The fact that newer lawyers more recently studied for the bar exam, or have different perspectives, could be an asset to a law firm.

From my own experiences practicing law, I have come to understand that attorneys (and probably most other people) hate taking suggestions.  I have seen time and again throughout my career attorneys expressing how they welcome constructive criticism, and then witness negative replies in response to any suggestions.  I guess it is just natural that people like to think that they know what’s best, and hate to hear an opinion that counters their viewpoint.

At many of the firms at which I worked, [partners were usually unwilling to hear suggestions from their associates](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/).  I can understand why senior attorneys would not care about what junior lawyers think about a given matter.  Indeed, more senior attorneys typically know more about the practice of law, and the strategies that can be implemented to help a client.  However, as the old adage goes, two (or more) heads are better than one, and many partners would be better off listening to their associates more often when it comes to strategizing about legal matters.

I remember one time, when I was working at a Biglaw firm, the boss wanted us to file a completely new legal action to resolve an issue involving a pending matter.  Even though I had not been practicing law for too long, I could tell that this was a very bad move.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
No one on my team seemed to realize that our plan was doomed to fail, and everyone had a serious case of “go fever” when it came to this strategy.  I tried talking to a junior partner about all of the downsides of our plan, but he just dismissed me and seemed peeved that I would even question our strategy.  In any case, the plan blew up in our faces, and had the partners listened to me, we could have avoided a lot of heartache.

Sometimes it also pays for partners to listen to associates because junior attorneys more recently took the bar exam [and attended law school](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/law-school-tips/).  Remembering additional black letter law can sometimes be extremely important when making arguments and deciding on strategies.

Several years ago, I was assigned to a case involving an individual who was the victim of an intentional tort.  I was tasked by my boss with drafting and filing an answer in the case.  However, when I read the complaint, I realized that the case had been filed several months after the statute of limitations for the cause of action had expired!

My boss did not remember what the statue of limitations was for intentional torts, since you’d be surprised how few cases in the real world involve battery, assault, and the like.  However, since I had taken the New York bar exam a few years prior (back when the New York bar exam tested New York law!), I was familiar with the relevant statute of limitation.  We ended up getting the case dismissed, and sometimes it pays for partners to listen to associates, since junior attorneys are more familiar with certain legal standards.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Of course, more seasoned lawyers also have a wealth of knowledge based on their additional experience practicing law.  The first time I ever heard about spoliation, law of the case, and a number of other topics is from veteran lawyers who were familiar with common litigation strategies.  However, it is also important to recognize that novice attorneys, by virtue of the fact that they more recently took the bar exam and attended law school, might also have certain strengths as well.

It is worth pointing out that the insights newer lawyers have about practicing law extends farther than better understanding certain legal concepts.  Newer lawyers are far more likely to have worked at a number of different firms early in their careers.  Even though many attorneys used to stay at one firm for decades, numerous novice attorneys now move from firm to firm in search of better opportunities at the beginning of their careers.

Since novice lawyers are sometimes more likely to have experiences at different shops, they often have important insight about firm management.  For instance, some firms at which I worked had state-of-the-firm meetings, and one had a partner-associate committee that was a great way for associates and partners to talk about issues that arose at the firm.  I told partners at other firms about these aspects about some of the firms at which I worked, and some of my other bosses adopted certain practices that I mentioned.  These suggestions seemed to help my later firms, and I was happy that I discussed my experiences at other firms with later bosses.

All told, many partners might think that the fact that some novice associates are new to the legal profession is a liability rather than an asset. However, the fact that newer lawyers more recently studied for the bar exam, or have different perspectives, could be an asset to a law firm.  As a result, partners should listen to their associates more in order to best serve their clients and improve their firms.

# Skadden Declares Juneteenth A Firmwide Holiday
## Biglaw is getting on board with Juneteenth as a holiday. Which firms are recognizing this important day?

Well, this is simultaneously unexpected and great. Fresh off an early [statement](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/biglaw-george-floyd/6/) on the murder of George Floyd, Skadden Arps — one of the most prestigious law firms in the country — has made another move in the battle for social justice.

Today, the firm’s managing partner, [Eric Friedman](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/f/friedman-eric-j), sent an all-employee email announcing that Juneteenth will be observed as a firm holiday.

Skadden is pleased to announce that next Friday (June 19) we will observe Juneteenth as a Firm holiday.  Juneteenth is a national day of celebration memorializing the end of slavery in the United States.  It was in 1865, on June 19th, that enslaved black people in Texas learned that the Civil War had ended and that they were free, more than two years after the effective date of the Emancipation Proclamation.

We hope this day will provide an opportunity for us to pause from our daily routines to reflect on issues around racism and its impact on our country.

In the grand scheme of fighting systemic racism in this country, is this a relatively minor step? Yes. Is it an awesome thing? Also, yes.

Celebrating Juneteenth is a good thing. Too many kids grow up never even learning about the holiday. The fictional character of Dre Johnson on Black-ish even said the country [acknowledging the day almost feels like “an apology.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy0ikqpoYNU) I wouldn’t go quite that far (seems like there’s a lot more work to do to atone for slavery), but it does serve as an important reminder that our country is built on a legacy of slavery — and that legacy is part of the daily lives of black people in America.

Listen, Biglaw is noted for being a cutthroat place where the bottom line is *the* most important thing. Taking a step back from legal work to commemorate the day and encouraging all employees to reflect on the legacy of slavery sends a important signal from the top of the firm that this is an important issue. Yes, [other firms have tried to celebrate Juneteenth in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-tries-to-do-juneteenth-and-its-a-little-on-the-nose/), but to Above the Law’s knowledge, this is the first time a major Biglaw firm has declared the day a holiday.

# Name Partner Bolts From Struggling Biglaw Firm

How long can the firm ignore all the bad news?

Oof. The hits just keep on coming for the Biglaw firm of LeClairRyan. On Wednesday, we reported that the firm had [issued WARN Act notices](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-this-biglaw-firm/) to staff providing them with the federally mandated 60 calendar-day notification of mass layoffs. Of course, that wasn’t the only thing going wrong at the firm.

For over a year now the firm has seen a flood of partners and senior attorneys exit. Almost 10 percent of LeClair’s headcount departed in 2018, and the [trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-loses-over-a-dozen-partners-as-more-firms-spread-to-boston/) has [continued](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/biglaw-firm-that-just-lost-over-a-dozen-partner-loses-even-more/) in [2019](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/the-partner-departures-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-really-piling-up/). Indeed, just [earlier this week](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-this-biglaw-firm/) a 15-attorney group from LeClairRyan — the aviation group led by Mark Dombroff — departed.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Now we’ve learned yet another piece of bad news for LeClairRyan. Founding partner Gary LeClair is[ leaving the firm](https://richmondbizsense.com/2019/07/26/gary-leclair-jumping-ship-williams-mullen/) and taking two other partners with him. LeClair, Andrew White and David Lay will be heading to Williams Mullin as of August 5th. Though LeClair stepped down from the management of the firm in 2015 to focus on his practice, the exit of the guy whose name is on the door has to sting though the firm has yet to issue any statement on this departure.

However, as [reported by](https://richmondbizsense.com/2019/07/25/leclairryan-ceo-no-comment-firms-future/) Richmond Biz Sense, yesterday CEO Erik Gustafson commented on the swirling rumors of the firm’s imminent demise and whether there’s been a partner vote on shutting down operations:

“Our partners have not agreed to do anything,” he said, referring to the fact that the firm’s shareholding partners ultimately would have to vote on what direction to take. “Right now it’s business as usual.”

….

“We’re looking at all options that we think are appropriate,” he said, declining to answer whether those include winding down the firm, combining with another firm in some capacity, or to fall into some form of bankruptcy.

Asked whether the firm’s future is in doubt, Gustafson declined to comment.

The firm has already lost more than half of its attorney headcount from the high of about 380 three years ago. And as for partners, they’re below 40 at the moment with the 100+ shareholders that have already left taking their books of business with them.

# Oh, You'd Better Believe George Conway Has Thoughts On All This
## Guilty pleas, immunity deals, and a defiant Attorney General offer America's favorite Tweeting lawyer a lot to talk about.

The Twitter profile of one of the most interesting lawyer accounts going.

Kellyanne Conway spent last night on CNN exasperating Chris Cuomo as she gleefully dissembled about the legal anvils dropping all over the White House. Kellyanne’s husband, Wachtell’s George Conway, has some actual lawyerly analysis of the situation.

Taking to Twitter, Conway launched yet another of his [quietly devastating broadsides](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/george-conway-throws-shade-all-over-kellyannes-puff-piece/) upon the Trump administration that his wife spends her days defending against the indefensible. He is the Eeyore of modern American politics and we have a ringside seat for all of it.

It’s safe to say Conway doesn’t have the same faith in Giuliani and Sekulow that his wife’s boss does.

Conway also shared his thoughts on the mounting online feud between Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the wake of Trump’s unhinged early morning rant against Sessions.

What everyone should want, and the country needs, is a “President” capable of comprehending what it means to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II, § 3. [https://t.co/V80OUR6Z7O](https://t.co/V80OUR6Z7O)

# Some Law Firms Try To 'Eliminate Stigma' From Attorneys Struggling With Mental-Health Issues
## When will law firms begin to offer the help their attorneys so desperately need?

Thanks to their incredibly stressful jobs, lawyers are prone to addiction and struggle with mental-health issues like depression, both at higher rates than the general population. According to a recent study, 20.6 percent of lawyers surveyed classified themselves as heavy drinkers, and 28 percent of those surveyed said they experienced symptoms of depression. According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the legal industry has the eleventh highest suicide rate. Despite these facts, lawyers are less likely than others to seek out help because they don’t want to admit they have a problem.

When will law firms begin to offer the help their attorneys so desperately need?

Patrick Krill, who was once a practicing attorney and now consults law firms on addiction counseling, says that the help often comes too late. “Unfortunately, the help really begins to emerge when the performance falls off,” he said in an interview with Sara Randazzo of the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/law-firms-finally-say-its-ok-to-see-a-therapist-1495381847). Some Biglaw firms, though, are starting to come around to the idea that their associates, partners, and staff members may need help, which is a welcome change.

Some U.S. law firms are tackling mental-health issues head-on. They’re offering on-site psychologists, training staff to spot problems and incorporating mental-health support alongside other wellness initiatives.

“We’re trying to eliminate some of the stigma around these issues,” said Tracee Whitley, the U.S. chief of operations at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. The firm has trained 20 U.S. employees to be mental-health first-aid responders, who can spot warning signs of addiction or mental-health concerns and offer assistance.

Some firms, like Hogan & Lovells, for example, have even gone so far as to offer the services of an on-site psychologist to all employees in a few of its offices. Oliver Armas, the managing partner of the firm’s New York office, says the counseling service has been a “rousing success.” The psychologist’s services are part of the New York office’s wellness program, which includes an on-site masseur, gym memberships, and healthy snacks. “The hours are long. We do what we can to soften the blow,” Armas said. Kudos to Hogan & Lovells for its forward-looking initiatives to help its attorneys in need.

Other firms, however, are still hesitant to offer such helpful services for fear of what the competition at other law firms might think:

Leaders at several major firms bristled at the idea of bringing a therapist into the office, saying it isn’t needed, could cause privacy concerns or would send the wrong message.

Joseph Andrew, the global chairman of Dentons, said that while he applauded Hogan Lovells for having an on-site psychologist, the fear of offering such a service is that “our competitors will say we have crazy lawyers.”

To that, we say, so what if competitors think the firm is full of “crazy lawyers”? Statements like this only serve to further stigmatize getting psychological assistance or substance-abuse treatment. Instead, firms ought to welcome the opportunity to intervene and help their “crazy lawyers” before their problems grow even worse. With on-site mental-health services, perhaps Biglaw firms would have fewer “crazy lawyers” and more “stable, well-adjusted lawyers.”

What has your law firm done to assist its attorneys and staff members with their mental-health and self-care? These are important perks that could influence employees’ job decisions.

Remember that you are loved, so please reach out if you need assistance, before it’s too late. Don’t become a statistic — please seek help.

# Debevoise Lets New Associates Get In On The Special Bonus Excitement
## First years are getting paid!

Listen, this year has been weird AF. And I’m sure you’re as tired of reading that sentiment as I am of writing it. But… it’s true! And, COVID has shaded most of the goings-on in Biglaw this year, so it only makes sense to acknowledge that. One bright spot in the year has been the Biglaw COVID appreciation bonuses, which said “thank you” to associates for their hard work during a pandemic in the best way Biglaw know how — with cold, hard cash.

But, particularly for firms that[ doled out these bonuses in the fall](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/), the question remains, what are firms doing for associates that joined the firm after bonus day came and went. There isn’t a consensus out there — hell, some firms haven’t even had anyone from the class of 2020 start yet — but even at firms with new associates, there’s a variety of treatment. Some tipsters report getting blanked out of bonuses entirely, but not every firm is taking such a harsh stance.

At Debevoise & Plimpton (a firm that [announced special bonuses way back in September](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/debevoise-bonuses/)), tipsters report they’re getting special bonuses, commensurate to their class year (which means laterals get counted too) prorated to their start date. Of course, the proration means it won’t be tremendous sums of money, but it’s nice to see those folks accounted for by the firm. It’s been a challenge for everyone, even if they’re relatively new to the firm. Special bonuses for these folks will be paid on December 20th.

# The 10 Worst Law Schools In The Country (2017)
## What depths will these law schools sink to in order to keep their doors open?

The American Bar Association recently released Standard 509 reports from every accredited law school in the country, and there’s much to be learned from the information that can be found within them. Based on the law school enrollment data in these reports, such as incoming students’ LSAT scores and undergraduate GPAs, we can determine which law schools are dabbling in what David Frakt, who serves as chair of the National Advisory Council for Law School Transparency, refers to as “predatory admissions practices.”

Frakt has analyzed the most recent Standard 509 reports available, and he’s come up with a list of what he calls the “bottom 10 least selective law schools in the country.” That’s a mouthful, so we’re going to go ahead and call them the “worst.” Here are the five — or actually six, thanks to a tie — “worst” law schools in the country:

1. Thomas Cooley Western Michigan U – 146/142/139. Cooley has already been found out of compliance with Standard 501 by the ABA. [They recently lost in their efforts to get a restraining order against the ABA to keep this secret from prospective students](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/cooley_law_school_loses_request_for_restraining_order_in_lawsuit_ABA) and did little to improve their chances of having that decision reversed with this year’s embarrassing incoming class, with similar credentials to last year’s (147/141/138).   But the school is still making a fortune with an entering class of 458, third largest in the country (after Georgetown and Harvard). Cooley accepted 85.6% of applicants, far and away the highest acceptance rate in the country.  (Vermont, with 159 entering 1Ls, was second, with a 78.8% acceptance rate.)

2. Texas Southern – 146/143/141. [Already sanctioned by the ABA for standards violations and under remedial measures](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_education_and_admissions_to_the_bar/PublicNoticeAnnouncements/2017_july_texas_southern_301_309_501_remedial_action.authcheckdam.pdf), Texas Southern nevertheless enrolled a large class of 256 students, a significant increase from last year’s 227.  Unfortunately, these students are virtually all at high risk of failure.  The school grew its class by lowering its already dismal admission standards across the board.  Last year they were at 147/145/142.  What are they thinking? The school should be placed on probation.

3. (Tie) Appalachian – 149/143/141 Found out of compliance by the ABA last January and formally notified in May, they hid this fact from prospective students and managed to nearly double their class from 38 to 73 entering students, while very modestly increasing their numbers from 147/143/140. The bottom half of the class are all at extremely high risk of failure.  Their bottom 25% UGPA is an especially woeful 2.51, the lowest of any law school in the country.  Appalachian also boosted enrollment in its upper divisions by taking 16 transfers from Charlotte School of Law, which is not likely to boost their abysmal bar passage rate. Expect Appalachian to be sanctioned.

3. (Tie) Southern – 146/144/141. Number one on my list of schools that deserve to be sanctioned but haven’t yet. Southern has enrolled 200 students, virtually all of whom at are very high or extremely high risk of failure. They increased their class size to 200 from 171, so they could have raised standards, but basically held steady at atrocious. (Last year: 146/143/141) Where are you, ABA?

5. (Tie) Charleston – 148/145/142 Charleston enrolled a large class of 251 students, up from 215, by admitting 71% of applicants.  They could have been more selective and raised their standards considerably.  Last year: 149/145/141. So, for the last three years, at least 75% of Charleston’s class has been made up of high risk students.  The ABA must put a stop to this exploitation.

5.  (Tie)  Thomas Jefferson –  147/144/142.  In January, TJ was found out of compliance by the ABA on Standard 501.   TJ dishonestly kept this secret from its prospective students, enabling the school to grow its enrollment.  But this school is digging itself is an ever deeper hole by admitting a pathetically weak class in a state where students with LSATs below 146 have extremely poor prospects of passing the bar, and everybody below 150 struggles.   Last year TJ had 232 students with a profile of 147/143/141, and the second highest non-transfer attrition rate in the country at 37.2%.  Despite knowing they were facing sanctions due in part to its lax admission policies, TJ chose to increase its class size and essentially maintain its abysmal admissions standards.  The one point increase at the 50th and 25th percentiles was offset by lower UGPAs across the board.  Not surprisingly, TJ was recently [placed on probation by the ABA](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_education_and_admissions_to_the_bar/PublicNoticeAnnouncements/2017_november_%20thomas_jefferson_school_of_law_probation.authcheckdam.pdf).  Expect droves of transfers from TJ this winter and next summer, and continued bar passage woes for the foreseeable future, assuming TJ can stay in business.

You can see the rest of Frakt’s list over at [The Faculty Lounge](http://www.thefacultylounge.org/2017/12/the-2017-bottom-10-law-schools-in-the-country.html).

What is going on at these law schools? What depths will these law schools sink to in order to keep their doors open? How many law students will incur hundreds of thousands of dollars of nondischargeable debt in order to fill these law schools’ coffers? We imagine the ABA will be stepping in soon to deal with these problems.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Work From Home = Dead Law Firm
## Working at home, to your bosses, can make you seem nothing more than a fungible billing unit.

I just read an [article](https://www.law.com/2022/09/28/office-return-mandates-heighten-stand-off-between-law-firms-and-workers-405-110597/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_content=20220929&utm_campaign=morningminute&utm_term=law) saying that a large percentage of young lawyers — 44% — would quit rather than come into the office.

Let me be provocative here and say that a law firm that has too much WFH has a very high likelihood of extinction.

And let me also be provocative and say that a young lawyer who goes too much for the WFH angle has a very high likelihood of career extinction or at least job loss at the next downturn.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Let me explain.

A lawyer I just interviewed told me essentially that there was no reason to go into the office at his firm since no one was there, so if you go in, you are all alone. He works from home, as does almost everyone. It is just no fun, and there is really no law firm at all. Just a bunch of people logging in. That is why he is interviewing with me — because he wants a place to go where he has friends and human interaction.

Building on this, let’s get back to basics. What is a law firm? It is a collection of lawyers who are together because they want to be together. If they stop wanting to be together, then they leave, and the law firm ends. As a partner of mine told me years ago when I was managing partner: “Bruce,” he said, “all of the assets of this company go down the elevator every night. Your job is to make sure they come back in the morning.”

Well, if everyone works from home, it sounds like all the assets aren’t coming back in the morning, are they? They are home — perhaps working hard — but there is no connection to the firm. If they get a better offer, all they have to do is change their email address, and they now work for another law firm.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
At my firm, I am proud to say — and, indeed, the whole point of the firm — is that we are together. We are having fun with each other. We all have friends here. We are a team. We are in the office partly to do work, and partly so we can all add value to each other. Professional value, emotional value, inspirational value, value when we are down to get picked up, value to have the thrill of teaching and being taught, and every other kind of value. Yes, we have bad days of stress, but overall it is fun to be in our office with our friends.

The other law firm I mentioned — which is much bigger than our firm — where that fellow is working, in my view is the walking dead. They may not know it yet but they are.

Turning now to employees — especially younger employees — you went to law school for a reason. To be a lawyer. Being a lawyer admittedly starts out by typing a lot of words on a page. And that you can do from anywhere, but there is a lot more to being a lawyer than that. It is about building relationships with clients and colleagues.

I could go on and on about this, but I guarantee you that you won’t be building that career sitting at home. Instead, at home, to your bosses, you are a fungible billing unit. What a horrible phrase, but that is what you are. You aren’t present in the office and part of the team showing your humanity and building value for yourself and others.

Admittedly, I am overstating things a bit.  There are exceptions, such as working at home temporarily — for personal reasons, such as taking care of a relative. Or for health reasons. Or just because you have to power down now and then.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
A policy allowing people to work from home one — or maybe two — days a week, makes perfect sense and is all to the good. In this vein, WFH can be kind of like a guilty pleasure — like secretly eating ice cream for lunch now and then. But if you go too far, no one will enjoy eating ice cream three meals a day, five days a week.

So here is my message to both employer and employee: If you are the employer — the partners — you need to make sure your office is one that people want to go to.  Or they won’t go in, and as I said, it is game over, sooner or later. It is your critical job just like my partner told me years ago to make the firm a place where people want to be, or sooner or later they won’t be there.

And if you are the employee — the associates — you need to go into the office and make your career happen.

To conclude, some WFH is a great thing to spice things up. But if you go too far toward WFH as a law firm, then the law firm’s days are numbered. And if you go too far toward WFH as an employee, you will likely be the first to be cut from the team when things turn down.

All of this seems obvious to me — but that article I mentioned at the start — made me wonder if others are living in Fantasyland.

# Biglaw Partner's Furious Tirades Go Viral Revealing Family Tragedy

UPDATE: The firm provided an update on its investigation of the incident, which we provide below.

“I ask that you please keep telling my story so that the truth is known far and wide,” wrote Catherine Youssef Kassenoff in her [final Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/catherine.y.kassenoff/posts/pfbid0sUyN9rEjWUHUJuy4du42JBPu2wjzB8uUxyW1Xfhfo5zNSNV2fhZZyJq295TKT2rol). The former EDNY prosecutor and special counsel to the New York governor’s office wrote that she had received a terminal cancer diagnosis and would end her life with the assistance of doctors in Switzerland on May 27. Her post cited the “abuse and terror” of her ex-husband, Greenberg Traurig shareholder Allan Kassenoff, including a folder of documents she wanted readers to pass along.

Since then, clips of Kassenoff’s tirades have erupted on TikTok, with millions of views over the last week. For example, “[The Robbie Harvey](https://www.youtube.com/c/therobbieharvey)” posted this video featuring the tirades.

A firm spokesperson provided Above the Law with this comment:

Allan Kassenoff has been involved in a divorce and custody matter that has been going on for more than 4 years. After lengthy trials and reviewing all the facts, including some videos, none of the 4 judges who presided over the trials or the 2 court-appointed neutral forensic evaluators found him to have committed wrongdoing or abuse as to his children or the contended domestic violence, and instead awarded him sole legal and physical custody of their three children. Nevertheless, the firm will be conducting its own investigation to determine his status with the firm. In the meantime, he is taking a voluntary leave of absence to focus on his family.

There’s no excuse for the behavior captured in these videos. No matter what’s going on in a relationship, the “Biglaw screamer” routine is a toxic environment for children. And insulting and denigrating the other parent in the presence of the kids is heartbreaking to watch. The children’s reactions captured in these clips drive home how damaging it is to witness this sort of rage between caregivers.

That said, it’s critical to remember that these are only a few minutes of the family story, captured by a former prosecutor in the midst of a contentious custody fight. There’s no condoning these specific moments and whatever excuses he can muster that led up to these outbursts doesn’t diminish the impact on the children. But “multiple judges, Child Protective Services and two separate neutral, court-appointed forensic evaluators” also saw these clips as part of inquiries far deeper than a 5-minute TikTok and determined that Allan Kassenoff should have sole custody, noted a letter we received from a tipster that was drafted by Kassenoff’s attorney and distributed to Greenberg Traurig personnel.

The original opinion, issued by Justice Nancy Quinn Koba, stated:

The mother’s manipulative conduct demonstrates a deliberate ‘placement of her self interest above the interests of others.’ The evidence of false allegations of abuse against the father, i.e., the March Zoom Visit, and the purposeful actions to alienate the children from him is ‘so inconsistent with the best interests of the child[ren] that it raises, by itself a strong probability that the offending party is unfit to act as a custodial parent.’ There was no evidence presented that the father manipulated the children into making any false claims against the mother.

Courts can be wrong, of course. And Catherine Youssef Kassenoff’s documents include file folders labeling both the forensic evaluator and the attorney representing the children’s interests as “corrupt.”

But it’s also likely that there was a lot more to these lives than just the clips going viral. Though absolutely everything about this story makes it clear that the children have been exposed to a horrific experience throughout.

UPDATE: Per Greenberg Traurig:

The firm has concluded its review of the situation to determine Allan Kassenoff’s status with the firm. Our primary obligation is to maintain and protect the core values and best interests of our firm, our clients, our lawyers and our professional staff. Allan has been on a short leave of absence and has now resigned from the firm, effective immediately.

The firm is sensitive to the needs of the three children, the primary victims of the situation, and therefore will be creating a dedicated trust fund with an independent trustee for the sole benefit of these children, to be voluntarily funded by the lawyers and staff of our firm. We wish healing and privacy to the children during this very difficult situation.

# A Tribute To A Law Professor And Tax Lawyer

After graduating law school, I decided to pursue an LLM in taxation, partially to defer student loan repayments until after I graduated. I started at Chapman Law School before transferring to Loyola Law School in Los Angeles because the school was closer to my home. It was there I met someone who would have a profound and positive impact on my studies and beyond.

One of the classes I chose was called Tax Aspects of Business Planning. It was taught by Professor [Dean Weiner](https://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2005/11/this_weeks_tax_.html) who before joining academia was a partner at O’Melveny & Myers where he practiced tax law for many years. Every few weeks, a new, complex fact pattern was presented (presumably coming from his work at O’Melveny), and we would submit a detailed tax analysis with a proposed solution. I took a liking to this class because it fit my learning style better. I made it a point to take any future classes with him.

I should note that I had a classmate who was really smart although I didn’t talk to him much outside of class. I later found out that he was [Above The Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/01/featured-survey-results-and-the-winners-are------/) and [Wall Street Journal’s](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-LB-5022) Lawyer of the Year. But I digress.

That September, the ABA Section of Taxation released the problem for their annual [Law Student Tax Challenge](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/taxation/awards/law_student_tax_challenge/) (LSTC). The fact pattern involved a purchase of a private company through a tax-free reorganization structure as well as an executive compensation issue. I decided to enter it and, in light of Weiner’s expertise in business taxation, asked him to be our team’s coach.

In short, we treated the competition as if this was another one of his assignments. I would write a proposed solution, and he would critique it. But we had one major problem which was the executive compensation portion of the problem. First, executive compensation didn’t seem to be Weiner’s forte. Second, the problem involved the newly enacted Section 409A which created very complex tax rules regarding deferred compensation in response to the Enron bankruptcy in 2001. For this portion, I feared that I was pretty much on my own.

Since Weiner was my professor and coach, we got to know each other quite well over the semester. In addition to classes and the competition, we would talk extensively about tax policy, and he would share his war stories about mergers and tax controversies.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
That December, the LSTC’s co-chairs informed us that we were the finalists in the competition. That meant that we would fly out to Miami to participate in the final oral competition at the Section of Taxation’s midyear meeting. Weiner was just as excited as we were, and he took great lengths to help us prepare. He even invited us to his office at O’Melveny where he and others from their tax department provided guidance.

I recall being nervous that day as the judges were well-known tax lawyers and a United States Tax Court Judge. I’m sure my nervousness was shown during the oral competition.

I did not win, although another team from Loyola won first place. But regardless, it was a great experience and I am thankful to the Tax Section for the experience and providing the accommodations. We all went out to dinner afterward where we all had fun and, for a few hours, we talked about anything other than tax.

The next day, all of us went to the airport to go back home. I remember telling Weiner I was considering writing a research paper on the taxation of video game currencies, a topic that drew some debate at the time. But he said he had a headache and planned to take a nap when he got back home. We all had a memorable evening so being a bit under the weather was excusable.

A few days later, the memories were behind us and it was back to business as usual. But in class, I noticed that Weiner’s speech was slower than normal, and he seemed to have trouble remembering things. When I met with him during his office hours to help with a side project he was doing, he seemed absentminded at times. I thought it was simply jet lag that would go away in a few days.

A week later, all of his classes were canceled indefinitely. Obviously, something was seriously wrong.

Soon after, the school told us that Weiner underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor and, as a result, someone else would teach the class for the rest of the semester. Some time later, we got an update saying that he was resting at home. While I was concerned about his condition, I decided it would be best to just send him an email and hope that he would respond when he recovered.

I would not get an update on his condition for a year. In the middle of February 2008, the school sent me an email stating that [Dean Weiner passed away](https://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2008/02/death-of-dean-w.html) on Valentine’s Day.

It’s been 14 years since his passing. For me, he made studying tax law fun, and I believe his influence had an effect on my future performance at school. That research paper I mentioned turned into my honors research paper. It was [published](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1097793) at a top tax law journal and was dedicated to his memory.

I am happy that I was able to provide Prof. Weiner with a moment of pride in the sunset of his life. But at times, I wish he was still around as I am certain that he and I would have stayed in touch. The me in 2007 would have hoped he could connect me with people who could help me find a job after graduation. But today, I would want to reach out to him to get advice on tax issues and law practice. But I know he would ask for my thoughts and critique them just as he did when I was a student.

# Layoffs Come To Top 20 Am Law Firm
## Not even law firms at the top of the heap could avoid making cuts.

The COVID-19 pandemic is still ravaging the country, with cases having surpassed the 4 million mark just earlier this week. Economic uncertainty continues to have an impact on law firms, with salary cuts, furloughs, buyouts, and layoffs still on the table. With the recent news that almost half of the Am Law 100 has [adopted austerity measures in 2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/almost-half-of-am-law-100-firms-adopted-austerity-measures-in-2020/), we can now add yet another law firm to the list — and it’s one of the most prestigious law firms of them all.

According to a well-sourced report from the American Lawyer, layoffs and buyouts abound at Sullivan & Cromwell, a firm that was ranked No. 18 in the most recent Am Law 100, with gross revenue of $1,467,398,000 in 2019. Up to 150 employees at the firm across numerous departments were either laid off or received buyout offers.

The layoffs number up to about 50 staff members over the past three months, said some sources.

The layoffs touched a variety of departments within the firm, including events, marketing and temporary workers, sources said, and laid off staff were offered a severance package of two weeks pay for every year served at the firm.

Apart from the layoffs, many older employees were given the option of an early retirement through what the firm called its voluntary retirement program, said some sources, including one who said the number of employees given that option was around 100. Those eligible needed to be at least 55 years of age, the sources said, and have a tenure at the firm that allowed their age and service time to add up to 70.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
On top of the layoffs and buyouts, the firm recently parted ways with six chief or director-level personnel (although it’s unclear whether their departures were related to the staff layoffs). Those who left the firm include its chiefs or directors of knowledge management, global business development, internal auditing, hospitality services, legal personnel, and global contracts and special projects.

Karen Braun, the firm’s executive director, refused to comment on personnel matters.

Best of luck to all those who are affected by the layoffs at Sullivan & Cromwell.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

My [previous article](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/the-best-of-the-best/) was sobering — with me predicting that somewhere between five to 10 years from now:

- Top lawyers will bill at $5,000 to $10,000 per hour
- Other lawyers will find their billing rates the same as today or even lower
- There will be very few top lawyers and very many other lawyers

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In the article, I defined the top lawyers as the Best Known, and here are my thoughts about how to be the Best Known lawyer for the job:

First — you should read and learn about my concept of the “Power Niche.” I have written on it extensively, through my column on Above the Law and in my book, “If You Want to Get Rich Build a Power Niche” (which I encourage you to read). I can assure you the single best way to become Best Known — and have a super career (one that is fulfilling and economically successful) — is through the Power Niche.

The Power Niche is incredibly easy to do, and anyone — I mean anyone — including those with more of an introverted personality — can do it just fine. Trust me.

Second — build a network. Network effects are astonishing. I mean way beyond astonishing. The theory is that the path to becoming Best Known is an infinite number of imponderable and unpredictable variables that you cannot, well, predict. Faced with randomness, the most logical plan then becomes:

- Take as many shots as possible
- Spend as little time on each shot as possible
How do you build a network? Keep track of everyone you meet in your industry and then interact with that network positively.

Your network outreach should concentrate on the narrow Power Niche you develop and be respectful to the people on that network by ensuring that you always provide valuable and useful information to that network about this Power Niche. Before long, you are the world’s top authority, and your network grows — you are certainly Best Known in your network. Then the game becomes expanding that network and tending it gingerly and respectfully.

By the way, my personal mantra is just four words, “It’s the Network Stupid,” and I remind myself of it every day.

Third — try not to do things that are a waste of time under the marketing rubric. Most of them don’t work. These include:

- Competing on price — which really is the essence of this article
- Publishing deeply researched articles that take a long time to prepare
- Misuse/overuse of social media
- Spamming people
- Throwing big parties
A much better plan is to meet with people in your industry one-on-one, learn what they are trying to accomplish, and see how you can help.

Fourth — take the time you saved from the last paragraph and do what I suggest in the first two paragraphs. This stuff really works.

Fifth — and lastly — if you are at a law firm where you cannot do the foregoing, or you otherwise find your career isn’t moving you to a place where you can become a Best Known lawyer, consider a job change. And — dare I say — when you are interviewing for a new job, consider asking them about the above. You might get some very interesting answers.

Good luck!!!

# Why You Should Build A Relationship With A Recruiter Now
## If in the future you find yourself ready to lateral, you will be well advised to consult a skilled and trustworthy recruiter. Do you know who you’ll call?

So you’re happy at your firm? That’s great! It’s possible you’ll continue to like it so much that you’ll spend your entire career there. But it isn’t likely. Firms change over time and so might your priorities. Maybe personal circumstances will cause you to move to a market where your firm has no presence. Maybe your most valued mentors will retire or switch firms. You never know.

If in the future you find yourself ready to lateral, you will be well advised to consult a skilled and trustworthy recruiter. Do you know who you’ll call? If not, now is the time to start preparing.

Start early

Many lawyers adopt a blanket policy of ignoring all recruiters. I get it. Dealing with recruiter spam is no fun, and it’s tempting to think you can always start replying once you’ve become dissatisfied with your current firm and are ready to leave.

This mindset is understandable, but it’s a mistake. Calling a recruiter when you’re ready to move is definitely better than going it alone. But if you wait until that moment, you’ll find yourself behind the 8 ball. You’ll feel pressure to move ahead quickly and will end up choosing a recruiter without much information. You’ll also be at the mercy of whatever opportunities the market presents at that particular moment. In contrast, if a well-connected recruiter is familiar with your profile ahead of time, she will be actively looking out for the most suitable roles and may be able to create opportunities specifically for you.

A relationship is important

Why does a relationship with a recruiter matter? And what does that even look like?

You probably consider your career to be one of the most important things in your life. Just as you wouldn’t go to a random doctor to address a serious health concern, you shouldn’t assume that all recruiters will be equally effective in helping you shape your career. The best recruiter is one who has listened to you and taken the time to understand your priorities. You want to work with someone who is happy to speak with you even though you aren’t looking to move. That’s a good signal that the recruiter cares about you as an individual and isn’t simply trying to fling plausible candidates at open roles.

You should make it a regular practice to call your recruiter once a quarter. These calls are an opportunity to find out what’s happening in the market and to place your firm in context. Even assuming you determine that your current firm remains the best fit, the conversation will be valuable. And through these regular interactions, you will develop a feel for whether the recruiter is someone you trust. You will have greater confidence in the advice and feedback you receive from a recruiter if you have known that person for years.

Choose one recruiter

You are not under any obligation to work with the first recruiter you come across. By all means, speak to a few and get a sense of who seems most competent and trustworthy. But after you’ve done that initial diligence, it’s in your best interests to choose one to work with exclusively. Working with a single recruiter enables you to maximize trust and rapport.

How should you choose your recruiter? Interpersonal rapport is critical. If you don’t feel a connection, you probably shouldn’t trust that recruiter with your career. Pay close attention to whether the recruiter is truly listening to you and is supportive of your goals. And watch out for red flags. A big one is pushing you to move immediately even if you have already made clear that you’re happy at your current firm. Another is promising to achieve something far out of the ordinary. A skilled recruiter can help you negotiate a better deal, but there are limits. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

A little advance planning will pay real dividends when the time comes to lateral. Don’t wait until you find yourself in a bad situation and are feeling pressure to move reactively. If you decide to switch firms, you’ll want it to be an intentional, considered, career-enhancing move. A strong relationship with a trusted recruiter can make that happen.

# Despite 2023 Setbacks, Law Firm Will Match Pay & Bonus Scale
## Layoffs and deferrals aren't dampening the firm's 2024 outlook.

When Cadwalader incurred [staff and attorney layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/cadwalader-layoffs-2023/) and [deferred its incoming associate class](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/cadwalader-defers-incoming-associates-2024/), you might have expected the firm to be cagey about the prospect of jumping to match the new normal in compensation.

But Cadwalader, 84th on the Am Law 200 with over half a billion in gross revenue last year, is stepping up to the challenge.

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$225K
Class of 2022	$235K
Class of 2021	$260K
Class of 2020	$310K
Class of 2019	$365K
Class of 2018	$390K
Class of 2017	$420K
Class of 2016 & 2015	$435K
While these new salaries will be effective on January 1, they won’t be reflected until the last pay period of February. After the holidays and even Valentine’s Day, but just in time for all their National Frozen Food Day shopping.

On the bonus front, Cadwalader followed suit as well:

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$15K (pro-rated)
Class of 2022	$20K
Class of 2021	$30K
Class of 2020	$57.5K
Class of 2019	$75K
Class of 2018	$90K
Class of 2017	$105K
Class of 2016 & 2015	$115K
The wrinkle here is that associates billing 2200+ are eligible for a 120 percent bonus. The memo does not specify when the bonuses will hit associate accounts, but notes that it will be “no later” than that last pay period in February.

Full memo on the next page.

It was a choice between starting over in the practice of law or trying something different.

In structured finance, transactions always close, so you had to get focused and you had to hustle. Take that and bring it into a sleepy toy business.

— [Jordan M. Schwartz](http://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/jordan-schwartz), partner and senior counsel at Cadwalader, speaking about his [decision to embrace his inner nerd](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/business/dealbook/after-the-crisis-this-wall-street-lawyer-turned-fanboy-toy-maker.html?_r=0) and open [Factory Entertainment](http://www.factoryent.com/), a company that makes mementos and collectibles for fans of science fiction and fantasy movies and television series.

Schwartz says that he’s learned from his toy business that [work-life balance matters](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/business/dealbook/after-the-crisis-this-wall-street-lawyer-turned-fanboy-toy-maker.html?_r=0), and that “[i]t’s not reasonable to expect that same sort of 100 percent commitment day and night that you expect from young lawyers on Wall Street.”

# How Law360 Pulse Is Bringing A Data Focus To Industry Trends

Kerry Benn is excited about how data can help attorneys make strategic decisions about their practice.

As the Director of Series, Surveys & Data at [the legal news website Law360](https://bit.ly/3Bqbza0), Kerry oversees the new [Law360 Pulse Insights](https://bit.ly/3gKC4yY) team, which uses data and analytics to reveal trends in the legal industry. 

Whether they’re surveying 2,500 attorneys about returning to the office or hearing from over 1,200 potential summer associates, Kerry’s team uses real-world data to provide lawyers with actionable insights. 

This trove of information calls for outstanding graphics, and Law360 Pulse is rising to the occasion, developing interactive tools for fascinating issues like partner compensation.

With so much happening at Law360 Pulse, Kerry sat down with Above the Law to discuss her team’s biggest projects, the trends they’re discovering in the legal world, and how Law360 is a hotbed for Jeopardy contestants.

This interview was conducted at the end of May and has been edited for clarity and length.

ATL: What types of new content does Law360 Pulse offer?

We’ve been envisioning Law360 Pulse as a complement to Law360, offering a deep dive into the business of law. It provides news and intelligence that lawyers can act on as part of their business and practice.

I run our Law360 Pulse Insights team, which uses data and analytics in our reporting, allowing us to provide in-depth reports about the business of law and the legal industry.

ATL: Tell us about some of the fun projects that you’re working on for Pulse Insights.

We’re actually just about to release our summer associates survey. We really wanted to get a sense from prospective summer associates of their concerns and what firms were at the top of their list. We ended up surveying more than 1,200 law school students.

The firm most people cited as their top choice was Latham & Watkins. Number two was Kirkland & Ellis and Skadden came in at number three. The firms that made the best impression on the students put a lot of effort into their associate programs.

ATL: It’s clearly a unique time to be surveying summer associates — this is a very different summer coming out of the pandemic. Was there any data to suggest that priorities had shifted for summer associates, in terms of what made a law firm great versus working somewhere else?

I don’t think we dug into that angle of it, but we definitely did see people saying that COVID had some effects.

For example, 53% of respondents cited that they were nervous they wouldn’t have an ability to connect with colleagues or receive sufficient mentoring, just because everyone will be remote.

ATL: You’re also looking at how attorneys are feeling about coming back to the office. I know that there was a new survey with over 2,500 attorneys that was completed in conjunction with the legal recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa (MLA). Tell us about that study.

We asked 2,500 attorneys about how they felt about returning to the office, and people were spread about it, as you would expect. We definitely found that there was a generational difference.

People who identified as part of the baby boom generation were much more likely to want to return to the office full-time than their millennial counterparts. And nearly half of attorneys at every level said their preference would be to go back to the office a few days a week.

Additionally, 27% of partners said they would come back every day, but only about seven percent of associates were interested in coming back every day. So, it was definitely a big split along generational or age lines.

ATL: We understand that, in addition to these surveys and projects, there’s some significant work going on around data visualization. Tell us a little more about what attorneys are looking for when it comes to taking in all this data.

We’re really trying to beef up our visualizations and make them interactive. We did a great visualization with one of our earlier surveys this year about partner compensation, where you could select from a bunch of different menus.

So, you could say, ‘Okay, I’m a woman in my thirties and I work for a firm that’s in the top 200. How much do my peers report that they make as their salary? Does my compensation match that?’

We’ve also found attorneys are really looking for any kind of data that can help them make decisions about their business. So, things like hot practice areas, cold practice areas. Diversity and inclusion data is also a big one.

ATL: I’m really excited to see some of those new charts and some of the new interactive data visualizations. Are those currently available? 

You can check out some of them on [Law360.com/pulse/insights](https://bit.ly/3gKC4yY). We also put together white paper reports for each of the projects we do, and those are available there, as well. 

ATL: It’s so exciting to see all this innovation happening at Law360 — what else is coming down the pike?

We’re actually going to circle back with summer associates later this year and see how those programs went. And you can look for reports throughout the summer on our lawyer satisfaction survey, which looks at how satisfied folks are with their jobs.

We’re also doing a pro bono survey that’s looking at firms’ pro bono efforts. And we’ll be publishing enhanced versions of our usual Glass Ceiling and Diversity Snapshot reports.

We’ve been doing both of those for nearly a decade at this point — tracking data on diversity, attrition, hiring of women, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ folks.

ATL: Is there a way for me to get this in my inbox every day?

We have dedicated newsletters that are delivered to your inbox daily. They’re actually an afternoon newsletter, which is fun. Law360 Pulse has four teams with distinct coverage areas, including our Modern Lawyer section, our Courts section, and a bunch of different state sites, as well. So, folks can sign up for all those newsletters or choose the ones they want.

ATL: So many reasons to check out Law360 and the new Pulse site. Before I let you go, though, tell us about why Law360 might be a magnet for Jeopardy contestants — and you had some success on the show as well, from what I understand.

Yes, that’s right. I am a Jeopardy champion, which I’m extremely proud to be able to say. I competed on two games back in May 2017. Law360, for whatever reason, is just a haven for Jeopardy contestants. We have several others in our newsroom, including one guy who was a Teen Tournament champion back in the nineties and also competed on Battle of the Decade. So, we have a really fun time. 

ATL: Where can our audience go to learn more about Law360 Pulse?

You can go to [Law360.com/pulse](https://bit.ly/3gKC4yY), where you can explore the different sections of coverage and the deep dives into the business of law. On the top of the page, there’s a button for Insights, which you can click for my team’s data project work. Hopefully, people will enjoy reading it as much as we love putting it together.

# Cravath Special Bonuses Have Finally Arrived!
## Good news! Cravath has now spoken on 2021 special bonuses.

It’s been a week since [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) blew [Willkie Farr’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) special bonus scale out of the water, and all the while, we’ve been wondering when Cravath — the perennial bonus leader — would step in to offer a tip of its hat to the credence of these bonuses. That time is finally here.

Cravath hath spoken, and the word is good, and the bonuses are BIG.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Unlike in the fall, when Cravath waited until [year-end bonus time](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/) to match the Davis Polk special bonus scale, the firm is doing it right now, along with the rest of Biglaw firms that have already done so. Here’s the bonus scale Cravath is offering, payable on April 30 and September 30:



As noted in the firm’s memo, there are no billable hours attached to these special bonuses, and “virtually all [Cravath] associates will receive the full bonuses.” That’s fantastic news. Even more fantastic is that the firm says it expects regular year-end bonuses will be “no less than” its regular year-end bonus levels — and that means associates can expect to receive up to $100,000, depending on class year.

Did Cravath raise the market here? No, of course not. But what it did do was let all other Biglaw firms know that it’s time to pay up. We expect to receive a flood of bonus memos from other Biglaw firms now that Cravath has entered the ring.

# Pepper Hamilton And Troutman Sanders Planning To Merge
## Two firms look to create another 1,000+ attorney firm.

Two Biglaw firms are engaged in advanced merger talks with an eye toward creating a new 1,000-attorney firm with over $800M in revenue. Philadelphia-based Pepper Hamilton and Atlanta-headquartered Troutman Sanders confirmed the negotiations are underway in statements sent around this afternoon.

The merger would combine Am Law 68th-ranked Troutman with Am Law 105-ranked Pepper Hamilton. The firms boast a combined 26 offices, some of which will have to be merged — both firms have outposts in New York, D.C., and Orange County — but all in all, the firms are mostly not stepping on each other’s turf.

The move gives Pepper access to the Chicago market and Troutman access to Boston and Philadelphia. Combined, the firms will have a robust California presence with attorneys in Orange County, L.A., San Diego, San Francisco, and Silicon Valley.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The major sticking point in a lot of mergers — synchronizing business expectations — doesn’t seem to be an issue with the firms. Troutman has an RPL of $809K, while Pepper says its RPL is $789K, making for a relatively small gap. When it comes to PPP, Troutman is just barely in the million-dollar club but Pepper is sitting at $830K. That’s a tougher chasm to cross, but given the geographies involved, it may not be as big a deal as it seems.

There’s still a long way to go before this is all wrapped up. [Pepper was trying to tie up with Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/merger-talks-end-for-reed-smith/) and that fell through, so nothing should be taken for granted. But a public announcement is a huge step in the process.

Anjie Vichayanonda, Founder of Leg Up Legal

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with Anjie Vichayanonda, Founder of [Leg Up Legal](https://www.leguplegal.com/), whose mission is to disrupt and revitalize the legal industry pipeline by providing meaningful mentorship to everyone.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
During her years of [practicing law](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2020/06/former-haynes-and-boone-lawyer-creates-tinder-app-for-law-students-sorta/), she learned how important it is to have good mentorship and sponsorship in your legal career. While she has been fortunate to have some wonderful and amazing mentors throughout her career, she realized that many others have not been so fortunate. So she set out to help prospective and current law students find good mentors and guidance early on before they embark on their career paths so that they develop the skills to get the right start.

As an attorney turned entrepreneur, first-generation Asian-American, intellectual property lawyer, and career coach, Vichayanonda has a trove of career and life experiences she leverages to help others on their legal career trajectories. Her energy and passion are contagious, and she will no doubt mentor countless students and inspire the next generation of attorneys and young professionals.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung: Can you share with us a little bit about your background and career path?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Anjie Vichayanonda: I am a first-generation Asian-American lawyer. My parents are immigrants from Thailand and both engineers. I didn’t know any lawyers personally when I decided to go to law school, so I tried to seek out advice from lawyers about what law school I should go to, what type of law I should practice, and what actual steps I needed to take to become a lawyer.

I cold-called over 50 lawyers to try to learn about their career paths. I only was able to connect with three lawyers, but luckily, one took me under his wing and became my mentor. He introduced me to dozens of other lawyers, and helped me decide which law school to attend and what type of practice area to focus on.

I graduated from the University of New Hampshire School of Law and practiced trademark and copyright law for five years before launching Leg Up Legal.

RC: What motivated you to start [Leg Up Legal](https://www.leguplegal.com/) and what are you focused on during these crazy times?

AV: My first mentor taught me how to connect with lawyers on a meaningful level and build long-term professional relationships. He taught me how to “walk-the-walk and talk-the-talk” and ask the right questions. I realized how difficult it was for prospective and current law students to build up the courage to speak with lawyers and learn how to follow-up with lawyers to keep their relationships going.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Throughout my career, I mentored other young lawyers and law students to pay forward the kindness that I had received from my mentors. I watched my mentees struggle with many of the same questions and issues that I did. I realized that there still was not a good way for prospective law students to meet lawyers on a large scale or learn how to interact with them. So, I built the Leg Up Legal mentoring platform for prospective law students to connect with lawyers and learn how to build their first professional relationships.

RC: I came across your profile through a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6714667782623105024/) and you seem to be very intentional in how you leverage social media. Any advice for fellow attorneys interested in creating engaging content?

AV: Thank you! Here’s my tips and tools:

- Use a content scheduler. I plan out and schedule my social media for the week on Saturdays. It helps you post consistently and at peak engagement times no matter your availability.
- One of my attorney friends recommended Shield for Google Chrome and I love it. It’s easy to see the performance of all posts at a glance. You can see what type of content performs well so that you can focus on creating that type of content.
- Hashtags on LinkedIn are really underutilized. You can use up to three hashtags in a post. If you’re going to create branded hashtags, you need to tell people how to use it. “Follow the hashtag #________ for tips on …” Putting that call to action in the post makes it way more likely that people will follow it and come to rely on it.
RC: We talked about being first in our families to pursue the law in our initial chat. What surprised you most about your time at law school or working at a law firm?

AV: My goodness, what didn’t surprise me is probably a much shorter list. What surprised me is how little most students understood about what the practice of law really is all about before they decided to pursue law school.

Law school doesn’t give you much time to do career exploration, and you have to start applying for summer internships and jobs a lot sooner than you think so you should really take some time before law school to connect with a lot of legal professionals and get an idea of what practice areas interest you.

You can go through every gateway to becoming a lawyer — taking the LSAT, attending law school itself, and taking the bar exam — and still have no idea what the actual practice of law is like if you don’t seek out opportunities to really talk to lawyers about what they do. You have to drive your own career exploration, and you have to start as early as possible.

RC: Much is written about the lack of diversity at law schools and law firms. What are your thoughts on this issue?

AV: The lack of diversity is a systemic issue that begins long before law school. If you want to meaningfully improve diversity in our profession, it is not enough to start diversity initiatives at the law school level. You need to start at the undergraduate level or even before.

Many law firms and legal employers invest in “pipeline” programs at the law school level, including internship, fellowship, and mentoring programs for diverse students, but these programs only help the lucky few who make it into law school in the first place.

Thousands of worthy diverse candidates get left behind at the gates. If you want to improve diversity in the profession, you have to help diverse prospective law students develop an interest in law, nurture it with mentorship, and give them access to affordable LSAT prep and law school application prep if you want them to even make it into law school.

RC: You have a very impressive bench of Advisors at Leg Up Legal. We actually featured [Caren Lock](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/balancing-the-three-legged-stool-of-success-in-our-legal-careers-2/) on ATL before. How do you choose your advisors and what type of relationship do you have with them?

AV: Caren is wonderful. She has known me the longest, and I met her through my first mentor so she’s seen my career evolve all the way from before law school to now. When I dove into the world of entrepreneurship, I knew right away that I was out of my element.

While being a lawyer and having a past career in marketing helped me in many aspects of building my business, I knew I needed a team of people who were experienced in many other areas to help guide me and Leg Up Legal. I chose my advisors because they all had experiences working with our three distinct types of customers: undergraduate universities, legal employers (and associations), and individual college students.

We have individual and group meetings to exchange ideas. They help me stay grounded, provide feedback and strategy, facilitate introductions, and some even participate as mentors in our mentoring program.

RC: COVID-19 has taught, and continues to teach, our society a bunch of lessons. What have you learned during this pandemic era?

AV: Relationships and human connection are vital during tough times. Now more than ever, we’ve seen students reaching out for guidance and emotional support. Having people to support you makes all the difference when you encounter difficulties and challenges. We started hosting a bunch of free events on Zoom to allow prelaw students, current law students, and lawyers to connect with each other and bond.

You can create real, lasting friendships and meaningful mentoring relationships through virtual mediums. I’ve seen it happen with my own eyes. We hosted a huge two-week virtual legal career boot camp in September for incoming law students, and I watched people have the most frank and emotional conversations during that event. And I’ve seen it happen time and time again in our virtual events and through our virtual mentoring program.

You have to get over the initial mindset that online interactions are just less personal. They don’t have to be. If you don’t believe me, come hang out on one of our events, and you’ll see.

RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

AV: We host a bi-weekly Virtual Happy Hour for ALL prelaw students, current law students, and lawyers to help create new networking opportunities and the registration links for those are included in the Weekly Zoom Meetup emails. We’ve had law students and lawyers from all around the U.S. attend. Register for the bi-weekly [happy hour here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIvfuGqqzIjHtCxGlcOJGzD3iZeid2kRaJ-).

For one-on-one networking and informational interviews, join our LinkedIn group, the [Leg Up Legal Virtual Coffee Club](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13862345). If you join the group, you can set up one-on-one virtual coffee chats with prospective law students, current law students, and attorneys.

# Another Biglaw Firm Matches Market Salaries... Kinda
## Associates don't seem happy.

When a Biglaw firm only announces raises for first-year associates and leaves the rest of the firm on the precarious ground known as “individualized compensation,” everyone but the most naïve gets a little worried. Even if you work hard — and who in Biglaw doesn’t work hard — there’s no guarantee you’ll make the same salary your peers at other firms are taking home.

That concern is underlying the frustration we at Above the Law are hearing from associates at Troutman Sanders. The firm has announced raises for first-year associates — effective September 1 — but the rest of the associates have to settle for individualized comp. Oh, and the mid-year bonuses some firms have been giving out? Yeah, Troutman associates won’t be seeing any of that money. Told you folks there are pissed:

Associates firm wide are thoroughly frustrated there are no bonuses and no clarity on salaries other than starting.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
First-year salaries at the firm will vary depending on location, with New York, Chicago, California, and Washington,[ D.C. coming in at the highest level of $190,000:



And if those individualized compensation meetings don’t go as associates like, well, tipsters there think they’re likely to be receptive to [calls from recruiters](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/if-firms-dont-think-recruiters-will-go-after-them-for-not-raising-salaries-theyre-wrong-this-email-proves-it/):

Revenues are at an all time high yet Troutman still is playing games with associate compensation. NY, CA, DC, Chicago are thoroughly pissed. Many associates have already left the firm for market salaries in those areas. Time to compete Troutman.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hint: During that time frame, U.S. law firms sent at least 1,025 attorneys right to leadership roles in-house. To get the data, Firm Prospects scrapes the internet for publicized hirings and doesn’t include GCs of government agencies, of corporate divisions, or of companies outside the U.S.

# How AI And Machine-Learning Tools Lighten The eDiscovery Load
## eDiscovery is ground zero for the exploding use of AI in law.

At one time or another, most lawyers involved in eDiscovery have felt the unique pressure induced by a slow-moving document review. That pressure to speed a review is one of the reasons that eDiscovery is effectively ground zero for today’s exploding use of AI in law.

Many lawyers’ first encounter with machine-learning technology was through technology-assisted review (TAR) or predictive coding. Those technologies marked the first significant use of AI in any field of law, and that use is expanding.

So How Does TAR Lighten the Load?

Consider this scenario: You’re halfway through a document review and running out of time. Would it help to switch over to TAR?

Answer: Depending on the size of the collection, yes. In fact, because you’ve already coded half the documents, you can use those coding decisions to jumpstart the TAR process.

A law firm recently faced virtually the identical scenario. The firm had to review a relatively small collection of about 40,800 documents in a short time. As it waited for approval from its client to use TAR, the firm dove into the review, knowing time was tight. By the time the client gave the green light to use TAR, the firm had coded 18,200 of the 40,800 documents.

The documents they’d coded provided a ready-made set of seeds to use to train the TAR algorithm. This is possible with a TAR engine that uses continuous active learning, a machine learning protocol that enables it to use any and all previously coded documents as judgmental seeds to start the process.

The coded documents were fed into the system and then, based on that input, the entire population was analyzed and ranked. From that point, the TAR engine started feeding the reviewers batches of 50 documents each. Each batch contained the next-best documents that were most likely to be responsive. In each batch, the tool also included a few “contextually diverse” documents to make sure there are no topics or concepts left unexplored.

As the reviewers completed their batches, the system continuously used their judgments to re-rank the entire population, improving its rankings with each new batch. The review proceeded along this track until the reviewers started seeing batches with few, if any, relevant documents, which told them that few relevant documents remained. Testing showed that the review had achieved high recall, meaning the reviewers had found the vast majority of the relevant documents.

In the end, the law firm had reviewed another 6,800 documents beyond the 18,000 they’d reviewed before starting TAR. That meant there were another 15,800 documents they did not have to review. So, from the time they started using TAR, the process cut out 70% of the work that manual review would have required. The firm calculated that this saved its clients more than $70,000.

This scenario of how TAR works focuses on just one of 20 questions answered in a new book, Ask Catalyst: A User’s Guide to TAR, which is available for free download at [this link](http://bit.ly/2pRXRbv).

# How Quickly We Forget The Rule Of Law
## Maybe principles should be based on universal concepts instead of individualized personal beliefs.

For four years, liberals believed in the rule of law: “Trump can’t do that! It’s illegal!” Or “Trump can’t do that! The Supreme Court rejected that position in the past!” Or: “Trump can’t do that! He’s Trump!”

But now, the tide has (almost) turned. Although Democrats did poorly in many down-ballot races last year, Democrats control the presidency, and all of a sudden the rule of law doesn’t matter so much.

President Joe Biden urged the Centers for Disease Control to extend the eviction moratorium, even though the Supreme Court suggested an extension was probably unconstitutional. Although liberal voices differ on this subject (perhaps depending on whether the liberals are landlords or tenants, but that’s another story), at least one wing of the party screams: “The Constitution be damned! I believe that extending the eviction moratorium is good policy, so Biden should do whatever it takes, including acting unconstitutionally, to enact the policy that I prefer!”

Liberals might be happy with that result today, but I guarantee that liberals will be unhappy when a conservative president someday relies on the same reasoning to adopt a policy with which liberals disagree. There’s no decent response when that later conservative says, “I don’t care what the law is. I’m adopting the policy that I think is right.” Doesn’t that seem just a tad lawless?  Shouldn’t you preserve the argument that folks in power should be obligated to follow the law?

Maybe principles should be based on universal principles instead of individualized personal beliefs.

In 2018, Sen. Dick Durbin — then in a Democratic minority in the Senate — thought the filibuster was an essential part of government. It would be “[the end of the Senate](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/2025984909415963733)” to eliminate the filibuster. Today, with the Democrats in the majority in the Senate, it’s time to eliminate the filibuster. According to today’s Durbin, to leave the filibuster in place is to “[hold the Senate hostage](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/2025984909415963733)” to the whim of the minority.

And what will Durbin believe in 2026? Or 2033?

Who knows? In fact, who cares? The electorate would have forgotten, or Durbin retired, or whatever. The future will take care of itself.

Should we expand the Supreme Court?

Imagine what liberals would have said if conservatives had tried to pull off that stunt in 2019. The cries of outrage would have echoed off the mountaintops, until the next election results came in.

In November 2020, the outrage would have ended, and right-thinking people could only believe that the Supreme Court must be expanded. Expanding the Supreme Court is the easiest way to increase the odds that it will rule in favor of liberals on issues that matter to them.

What happens when conservatives choose to expand the Supreme Court still further the next time conservatives are in power?

We’ll worry about that then, if ever.

I howl at the moon through my little megaphone at Above the Law. (Howling doesn’t accomplish much, but it sure makes me feel better.) Sometimes the moon is to the right, and sometimes the moon is to the left, so I manage to offend all of my readers.

But can’t we, as lawyers, at least agree that the rule of law is a good idea?

As Sir Thomas More said in the 16th century — or, at least, as Richard Bolt had More say in [the 1950s play](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/2025984909415963733):

And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned ’round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man’s laws, not God’s! And if you cut them down, and you’re just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I’d give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety’s sake!

# Making A Move With A Purpose
## What are your motives? Tips to get you hired.

Three to five years into an associate’s legal career is the prime time for associates to consider making lateral moves within the various legal markets. Most firms are looking at candidates at this experience level with very specific credentials and experience to fill precise needs. An amazing thing happens, however, once a candidate submits his or her résumé for the position — even though the firm has been looking long and hard for candidates with such credentials and experience — the firm will often start asking probing questions before scheduling an interview. First and foremost, they will want to know why you are looking to move.

The answer to this question can be complicated as you do not want to criticize your current firm or work experience, lest you make yourself appear to be a less-desirable candidate to the potential new firm. Moreover, as an associate, there are a finite number of moves you can make before you are perceived as a “jumper.” So, before you enter the job market, you need to understand your own motivations and be prepared to answer that pointed question — and your answer is going to be a determining factor in whether you even get an interview.

So what are good reasons to move, both for your career and/or for the purposes of convincing a target firm that they should make you an offer? Here are six, some of which may raise a red flag, however, if not presented smoothly:

1. To make more money.

This one is perhaps the most legitimate reason for switching firms, though, of course, you do not want to mention this is an interview for fear of looking tacky or unsophisticated. If you started your legal career in a lower paying boutique or smaller firm, or at a national firm that is not on the highest compensation scale, it is only natural to seek out higher compensation at some point, especially if you need to pay back loans or have a family to support. That said, moving because of compensation concerns must be handled with finesse and requires strong interview preparation since most firms consider it undignified to lead off with money as a reason why you would move. A better tactic is to let the firm know you think highly of them, their work, and their reputation — how could you not be interested in applying?

2. To get better work.

If you are looking to work on more sophisticated matters, you may need to make a move to a higher ranked firm with a stronger brand name or one that is strong in your practice area. Hiring managers understand when associates make moves for this reason and often respond well to this as a reason for a move — provided you can sell your prior experience as relevant and valuable. Chances are either you like the work itself at the new firm or you want a better platform to eventually land in-house, which is easier from a higher ranked firm or a firm that is known to place associates with their clients.

However, beware of being too forthcoming with your desires to eventually move in-house at the early stages of the interview process. Firms are not worried about what they can do for you initially; they want to know what you can do for them. Once they are convinced you can help them, they are more willing to go into sell mode and explore the possibilities of an eventual in-house move. Remember the new firm is looking to “buy” your work experience, so make sure you point out the good things about your prior experience while telling them you would prefer to get the better work at their firm.

3. To gain more work-life balance.

Today, many firms offer similar compensation packages and similar hours “targets,” but a firm with some semblance of work-life balance is often a differentiator. Some firms have more reasonable expectations of associates, and when they say 1,950 hours, they mean it. Some firms are better than others at allowing telecommuting or offer good parental leave policies regardless of your gender. These are all differentiators that must be carefully navigated when making a move — you want to make sure you do not move from the frying pan to the fire — but they are viable desires and acceptable reasons for switching firms, as long as your expectations are reasonable.

Again, this must be handled with care, as most firms do not want to hire people looking for a “lifestyle” firm even though many people move for this reason alone. Candidates often reference their current firm’s culture as a reason for a move. Firms can often read between the lines with this, but at least you are not telling them, “I want to work less.” Consider meeting with a firm again post-offer to sit down with their associates and ask them what their life at the firm is really like.

4. To set yourself up for partnership.

If you have partnership aspirations, switching firms may be the only way to reach that goal. Some firms place more emphasis on certain core practices, which are most profitable for their firm. So while you may be doing great work at a name brand firm now, if the practice group is small, not held in high regard internally or is not profitable enough, there may not be a business case for a firm to ever elevate you — no matter how good you are. If that is the case, you may need to find a new situation to give yourself a better shot, which a firm who puts more emphasis in your practice area may understand. In this case, it is easy to tell a firm you are being proactive with your career, and your ambitions dictate that their practice and firm may be a better fit for you. This answer is often favorably received.

5. To move to a new geography.

This reason is the easiest to explain. If your firm does not have an office in the city to which you plan to move — or does not have a policy that allows associates to freely move to their other offices — this is a good reason that raises very few, if any, eyebrows from the firm, as long as you can articulate why you wish to move to the new geography. Some cities are more provincial than others, and the firms will want to know what ties you have to the new city, so be prepared to elaborate on those ties and reasons.

6. To escape difficult partners.

While a perfectly viable reason for wanting to move firms, this is another scenario that must be handled with care and finesse, as firms will worry that you cannot handle a little adversity if you are too open about this initially. No matter how good a new firm’s culture may be, every firm has tough partners. This is the practice of law, after all. That being said, you have no reason to spend your career in fear of specific partners, and if you cannot escape them at your current firm or make a situation more tenable, it is a perfectly reasonable strategy to find a new firm with a more affable group in your practice area.

While there are many personal reasons you could have for wanting to switch firms, there are only a few that firms are going to accept and still see you as a strong candidate for joining their team. As soon as you apply to a firm, the firm will begin their due diligence to learn more about you and why you may want to move. Be prepared from the outset of your search with your reasons as to why you want to make this move and why, if any, you have made prior moves. Firms today are going to press for these reasons before deciding to even meet with you, so be prepared and be ready with the right answers. If you can articulate strong and acceptable motives, a firm is more willing to sit down and interview you — and eventually hire you.

# More Biglaw Bonuses With Extra Cash For Big Billers

Another day, another bonus announcement! Yesterday Sheppard Mullin got in on the associate bonus action, revealing market rate bonuses for associates that billed the minimum number of qualified hours. But there’s a catch… and whether associates fall on the plus or minus side of the 2,000 hour mark is whether that is good news or bad news.

Sheppard Mullin’s bonuses come with some pretty strict penalties for associates that fail to meet the 2,000 billable hour threshold. Associates that billed between 1950 and 1999 hours this year will lose out on their full bonuses, taking a hit of between $6,000 and $40,000, depending on seniority. And if you didn’t hit 1950 hours, well, you get left off the bonus chart entirely.

But there is good news if you’re on the high side of billable hours this year — there’s more money coming your way. If associates hit the 2200 mark, they can expect between $1,500 and $10,000 extra, depending on class year. When they hit 2400 hours those amounts double, and, again depending on class year, they’ll bring home an extra $3,000 to $20,000. That’s a nice thank you for what must have been a busy year.
