What better way to end the week than with a big raise? That’s what management at many a firm thought today, because Biglaw is swimming in cold, hard cash.

The latest firm to increase associate salaries is Orrick, which is currently ranked at No. 35 on the Am Law 100, with $1,152,850,000 gross revenue in 2020. The firm is matching the now prevailing Cravath salary scale, which tops out at $415,000 for senior associates.

This is what the new salary scale looks like at Orrick:



This new salary scale is effective as of January 1, 2022, and associates will see the cash in their March 31 paychecks. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Orrick.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

[Morning Docket](https://abovethelaw.com/morning-docket/)
# Morning Docket: 10.19.16
## * The LSAT may be ""destroy[ing] socioeconomic diversity"" in law schools. Will a low score on the Logic Games section of the LSAT keep you from becoming employed as a lawyer? Probably not, but it may keep you from attending a top law school, unless you can afford an expensive LSAT tutor, and many prospective law students are priced out from the get-go. [[The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/10/the-lsat-is-rigged-against-the-poor/504530/)] * Darby Dickerson, dean of Texas Tech Law, is resigning to assume the deanship at John Marshall Law-Chicago, a school whose enrollment has faltered over the past several years. She was asked during a job interview why she would leave a ranked law school for an unranked one, and her response may surprise you. [[Crain's Chicago Business](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20161017/NEWS04/161019841/new-dean-for-downsized-john-marshall-law-school)] * The first oral argument of the new SCOTUS term marked one of the first times that complete gender equality was reached at the high court. Five men -- all justices -- and five women -- three of them justices and two of them representing their clients -- were all present for Bravo-Fernandez, which is a relative rarity. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/for-a-rare-moment-at-the-supreme-court-the-genders-were-on-equal-footing/2016/10/17/6a56acbc-923d-11e6-a6a3-d50061aa9fae_story.html)] * ""I feel that as a result of the experiences I had, I had a lot to offer."" With the assistance of Dewey & LeBoeuf's former GC, Hinshaw & Culbertson is launching a crisis management and consulting practice. The firm is now in competition with businesses like Zeughauser Group, Altman Weil, and Hildebrandt Consulting. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/law-firm-launches-consulting-practice-for-other-law-firms/)] * A class-action suit has been filed over Samsung's recall of its fiery smartphone, alleging breach of warranty, breach of good faith, and common law fraud. You can expect the size of the proposed nationwide class of plaintiffs in this suit (or at least those in California, Pennsylvania, and Nevada) to explode faster than the Galaxy Note 7. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/10/18/samsung-faces-class-action-over-galaxy-note-7-recalls/?ref=/blogs/law)]

[[The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/10/the-lsat-is-rigged-against-the-poor/504530/)]

* Darby Dickerson, dean of Texas Tech Law, is resigning to assume the deanship at John Marshall Law-Chicago, a school whose enrollment has faltered over the past several years. She was asked during a job interview why she would leave a ranked law school for an unranked one, and her response may surprise you.

* The first oral argument of the new SCOTUS term marked one of the first times that complete gender equality was reached at the high court. Five men — all justices — and five women — three of them justices and two of them representing their clients — were all present for Bravo-Fernandez, which is a relative rarity.

* “I feel that as a result of the experiences I had, I had a lot to offer.” With the assistance of Dewey & LeBoeuf’s former GC, Hinshaw & Culbertson is launching a crisis management and consulting practice. The firm is now in competition with businesses like Zeughauser Group, Altman Weil, and Hildebrandt Consulting.

* A class-action suit has been filed over Samsung’s recall of its fiery smartphone, alleging breach of warranty, breach of good faith, and common law fraud. You can expect the size of the proposed nationwide class of plaintiffs in this suit (or at least those in California, Pennsylvania, and Nevada) to explode faster than the Galaxy Note 7.

# Elite West Coast Firm Matches $205K Market Salaries
## Will any other law firms match this one's generosity towards summer associates?

Many associates on the West Coast seem to be waiting for Godot when it comes to their firms announcing the adoption of new $205K market salaries, but other firms have quickly gotten in gear and decided to pay associates what they owe them for their intense dedication.

One of those firms is Munger Tolles & Olson, a preeminent Am Law 200 firm that we’ve likened to the Wachtell of the West for attracting top talent. Today, perhaps in celebration of winning the Affordable Care Act case before the Supreme Court, the firm decided to match the new salary scale. If you’ve somehow forgotten, this is what it looks like at the firm:

- 2021: $202,500
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013+: $365,000

In even brighter news, the firm is making its match for summer associates retroactive to the beginning of the summer. That’s a pretty nice hike.

Congratulations to everyone at Munger Tolles on their raises — especially the law students, who will now be the highest paid of all summer associates on this pay scale. Will any other law firms match Munger Tolles & Olson’s generosity towards summer associates? We certainly hope so!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Munger Tolles & Olson.)

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Some Associates In Some Markets Get Raises At This Biglaw Firm

Biglaw raises are all the rage rn, but that doesn’t mean everyone is feeling the love. Take Dorsey & Whitney. While the firm is giving *some* associates raises, they have not moved up to the Davis Polk scale making its way through the industry.

So what is going on at the firm?

The firm’s managing partner, Bill Stoeri, announced that fourth-year and more senior associates in a limited number of offices (Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and Denver) will be getting raises. Effective July 5th, mid to senior associates can expect between a $10,000 to $15,000 raise ([full memo available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/dorsey-raises/2/)). And it’s true, those offices were not previously on the $190,000 scale, so it’s not like those markets are getting a boost above Dorsey’s New York or Palo Alto offices. But it *does* mean partners at the firm sat down, thought about associate compensation, and decided the only places they were lacking were Minneapolis, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and Denver.

I guess even cracking the Am Law 100 (the firm is ranked 96th this year) doesn’t mean your priorities are the same as other Biglaw firms.

Dorsey associates, we want to hear from you! What do you think about the firm’s salary decision? Will they come back and raise salaries in other markets? Are you pissed the firm isn’t making a bigger salary splash? Text us to sound off: 646-820-8477.

And remember, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Struggling Biglaw Firm At Crossroads. Again.
## Bye-bye transactional work.

Things are changing in a big way over at Irell & Manella. According to an in-depth [report at Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/05/18/irell-manella-is-at-a-crossroads-once-again/) looking at the future of the firm, Irell is pivoting to focus on its intellectual property litigation practice, with most of the rainmaking falling on partner Morgan Chu and eschewing their transactional practice.

It seems the firm’s back was against the proverbial wall. Since 2014, the firm has lost 48 percent of its attorneys, down to just 82 lawyers from 159. That change has coincided with plummeting gross revenue from $247.5 million in 2014 to just $151.6 million last year. So yeah, some sort of change is needed.

“The writing was on the wall,” as one former Irell partner put it, when Jonathan Kagan, a member of Irell’s executive committee and chair of its hiring committee, wrote in an internal memo in early February that the firm would now focus solely on high-end IP and commercial litigation, abandoning most of its transactional practices.

It wasn’t an entirely deliberate pivot, as interviews with former partners, legal consultants and Kagan himself indicate. These sources describe a firm that has been struggling for years to define itself and trying to rebuild after a devastating spinoff that has led some partners to explore potential merger opportunities.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The struggle to define what is next for the firm is real. Kagan notes:

“For years we’ve been trying to evaluate what the options are for us,” he says. “There is a difference between exploring options and making actual decisions.”

He adds, “We’ve been gradually moving in this direction, then people figured out what we were doing.”

This isn’t the first time in fairly recent memory that the firm has had to switch up its strategic vision. In 2015, the firm lost ~1/6th of its attorneys over a two-day period when the litigation boutique of Hueston Hennigan was born.

The spinoff put Irell at a crossroads of sorts, with three paths emerging: It could have grown its transactional and commodity litigation practices, merged with another firm or retrenched. At the time, [former Irell executive committee member David Siegel] hinted to The American Lawyer that there was disagreement among the firm’s partners about the right approach: “Some of us would prefer to focus now on growing but doing it in a careful way,” he said. “Most of us—but not all of us—have that mindset.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Since then, the firm’s strategy toward lateral partners is described by Law.com as “piecemeal” and that’s resulted in a partnership revolving door, with whatever attempts the firm made to build its transactional practice being thwarted. There’s been downward pressure on the firm’s revenue (though their profitability has remained stable at around 65 percent) and so, a change in direction and focus is needed.

Firm leaders remain optimistic about the new and improved focus, particularly in light of COVID-19:

The recent changes may leave the firm in a better position to weather the economic storm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, sources say. As of early May, Irell had avoided cutting pay or staff like many larger, higher-grossing law firms have done. The pandemic has affected some of Irell’s cases—Kagan says one of his trials was postponed—but every attorney at the firm is busy, which might not have been the case had Irell kept its transactional practice, Kagan says.

“In light of the coronavirus and the dislocation of the economy, Irell might have the last laugh on this whole thing,” one former partner says.

Best of luck to the firm as they try to weather the latest changes.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Diversity In The Legal Profession Has Flatlined Since The Great Recession; Who Is To Blame?

“Confused scholars can’t interpret our scrolls / Your sky has holes / We know the young is old / Nastadamus tells us how the story gets told.”
— [Nas](http://genius.com/2446807)

This month, the National Association for Law Placement (NALP) published its [NALP 2016 Report on Diversity](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/2016NALPReportonDiversityinUSLawFirms.pdf), based on data collected for the 2016-2017 NALP Directory of Legal Employers (NDLE), its annual compendium of legal employer profiles. The report revealed that “the overall percentage of women associates has decreased more often than not since 2009, and the percentage of Black/African-American associates has declined every year since 2009, except for the small increase in 2016.”

Many fates and fortunes were devastated during our country’s last recession. As for diversity and inclusion, it turns out that any positive trend for diversity in the legal profession would [continue to be marginal ](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/what-could-disrupt-diversity-in-law-the-economy-stupid/)at best. Whereas the stock market has gone on to recover since the last recession, diversity in the legal profession has basically [flatlined](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/without-significant-changes-diversity-in-the-legal-profession-will-remain-on-life-support/) since that time. Women and Black/African-American associates have actually witnessed a net-decrease in their representation in the legal profession since the Great Recession:

Minority women and Black/African-American men and women continue to be the least well represented in law firms, at every level, and law firms must double down to make more dramatic headway among these groups most of all.

And, while the relatively high levels of diversity among the summer associate classes is always encouraging, the fact that representation falls off so dramatically for associates, and then again for partners, underscores that retention and promotion remain the primary challenges that law firms face with respect to diversity.  — James Leipold, NALP Executive Director

These patterns look even bleaker at the top. Minority women represent 2.76% of partners, while minority men account for 5.29% of partners, according to the [NALP report](https://www.nalp.org/uploads/2016NALPReportonDiversityinUSLawFirms.pdf).

In 2009, Black/African-American lawyers represented 1.71% of law firm partners. Today, Black/African-American lawyers represent 1.81% of partners.

Currently, Asian-Americans and Hispanics make up 3.13% and 2.31% of partners, respectively. Both groups have increased by less than 1% since 2009.

Many of the [solutions and recommendations](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/how-attorneys-and-law-firms-can-raise-the-floor-for-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-2017/) to increase diversity in the workplace are rather simple ideas, but this does this not mean they will be easy to implement.

In their book [The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living](http://amzn.to/2iMueFX) (affiliate link), Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman point out that most of us have to do something several times in order to truly learn it. One of the hallmarks of martial arts, military training, and athletic feats of almost any kind are the hours and hours of monotonous practice required to learn how to escape from a chokehold, execute maneuvers, or shoot the perfect jumper. Simply knowing isn’t enough; it must be absorbed. It must become part of us or we risk losing it the second we experience stress or difficulty, according to Holiday and Hanselman.

If law firms treat diversity and inclusion programs only as one-offs or inconsistent initiatives, without truly ingraining them into their cultures and understanding what actually works, then it is likely the next recession will be [as devastating to diversity as the last recession](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/what-could-disrupt-diversity-in-law-the-economy-stupid/). We cannot afford another seven-year setback.

We have access to and have received the [data in our profession](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/92-of-biglaw-partners-are-white-is-this-problematic/). But as Charles Duhigg highlights in his book [Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business](http://amzn.to/2iMsUTe) (affiliate link), receiving information is not nearly enough. We must engage with the data instead of passively absorbing it. According to Duhigg, engaging with the data makes it “‘disfluent’ — harder to process at first, but stickier once it [is] really understood…. there’s a difference between finding an answer and understanding what it means.” Is the legal profession currently suffering from “information blindness” — the inability to take advantage of data as it becomes more plentiful?

Where the diversity statistics haven’t fallen since 2009, we have witnessed only incremental increases. So who is to blame for the diversity dilemma in the legal profession? The answer is simple: we all are. Law schools, law firms, and lawyers can all do more to [raise the floor](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/how-attorneys-and-law-firms-can-raise-the-floor-for-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-2017/).

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Instead of just hoping matters will improve, while watching diversity continue to wither on the vine, we should engage with the data and understand what this means for our profession. We should no longer just trust that improvement will be made. We should become watchmen and watchwomen for diversity. If not us, who? Failing to verify best practices and procedures led us to the ramifications of the last recession. Hopefully we have learned our lesson.

For, as Benjamin Franklin once said, “without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning.”

# As Law Firms Start Layoffs, Alternative Legal Services Providers Grow Like Gangbusters
## Biglaw firms that haven't entered the ALSP market might want to get a move on.

Most law firms aren’t in the process of laying off associates. But [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/) and [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/) have been upfront about force reductions and other firms seem to be… [less upfront about it](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/when-biglaw-firms-set-90-day-performance-targets-stealth-layoffs-cant-be-far-behind/). While we have no reason to believe the layoff bug will spill over to the rest of the law firm landscape, even limited layoffs cast a pall over the industry.

But while law firms nervously eye the future, Alternative Legal Services Providers are lighting cigars with $100 bills.

The latest iteration of the [Alternative Legal Services Providers 2023 Report](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/alsp-report-2023/) compiled by the Thomson Reuters Institute in partnership with The Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession at Georgetown Law and the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford reveals that ALSPs now make up $20 billion of the legal market. That represents a compounded annual growth rate of 20 percent from 2019-2021.



Of course, this pales in comparison to the $800+ billion total legal market, but it’s all in the growth. Demand for legal services remains stagnant and clients will only countenance fee hikes for so long. ALSPs have a greased runway to start soaking up business.

And while most of that business flows to independent ALSPs and the Big Four always loom in the background, the fastest growing segment of the ALSP world are the “law firm captives,” the internal ALSPs law firms have built to keep business in house.

Law firm captives, while the smallest part of the ALSP market, are also the fastest growing of the groups. Law firms create captives in multiple ways: with a tight integration (often via an acquisition or equity stake) with an independent ALSP; through an incubator or accelerator for technology-enabled service providers; or by starting a new company or line of business within the parent firm. Such entities now account for about $1 billion in revenues, showing 117% growth since our last report and a CAGR of 47%. Since 2015, the captive market has grown by 589%.

Even without keeping the business inside the firm, the report notes substantial increases among both large and midsize law firms citing ALSPs helping them retain clients.

It’s not all good news though. Corporate law departments already using ALSPs are divided on where they plan to go from here with 21 percent planning to increase ALSP spend, while 22 percent are either decreasing spend or are unsure. Still, that’s likely a net increase when all is said and done and the report also notes that law departments that don’t currently use ALSPs have increased interest in doing so.

There’s a lot in this report, but the primary takeaway is that if there were ever a battle between law firms and ALSPs for work, that’s over. The strategic challenge of the next decade is figuring out which industry players — law firms, in-house, accounting firms — best leverage ALSP concepts.

Year in and year out, we watch law firm after law firm pay lip service to their commitment to diversity in the legal profession, with promises to put women attorneys on equal footing with their male counterparts, whether it be through hiring and retaining more women attorneys, promoting more women attorneys to equity partnership ranks, providing more leadership positions to women attorneys, or adopting more family-friendly policies to ensure that women attorneys are able to excel at their jobs while maintaining a stable work/life balance. Despite these continued assurances, and despite the fact that a number of firms have made great efforts to improve women’s stature in the law, there is still much more to be done — and we know which firms are working hard to do it.

Today, Seramount (formerly known as Working Mother Media) released its sixteenth annual list of the Best Law Firms for Women & Diversity. These law firms are considered pioneers in the field when it comes to attracting, retaining, and promoting women lawyers. These law firms not only stand out as being family-friendly workplaces, but they also ensure that women shine in their equity partnership ranks.

Which firms made the cut for this year’s ranking?

To earn themselves a spot on the Best Law Firms list, self-selected applicant firms must complete an extensive application (more than 300 questions long) with topics ranging from attorney representation, schedule flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women and people of color. Questions also included family-friendly benefits, and mentoring and sponsorship participation. Seramount then selected the best firms based on data provided by those firms from the year 2022. “I’m proud to expand our Best Law Firms for Women to include diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts,” said Subha V. Barry, president of Seramount. “From increasing representation of historically excluded talent to expanding upon their family-friendly benefits, our Best Law Firms are putting in the work necessary to build firm cultures where employees can thrive.”

So what do we know about the recognized firms? Forty-two percent of lawyers at these firms are women, 23 percent of lawyers at these firms are women of color, and 41 percent of women lawyers hired at these firms are women of color. Twenty-seven percent of equity partners are women, while the percentage of women promoted to equity partner is 39 percent. The firms average 17 weeks of paid gender-neutral parental leave and 90 percent of the firms subsidize childcare.

For the first time, Seramount has revealed the top five firms. Here they are (in alphabetical order):

- Arnold & Porter
- Littler
- Morrison Foerster
- Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP
- Perkins Coie

# Law Firms Should Consider Hosting Holiday Parties This Year
## Interacting with other lawyers at such industry events is good for networking, business development, and a variety of other purposes.

The annual holiday party is a fixture of many law firms across the United States. Such parties allow associates, partners, and staff to unwind, meet up in a more relaxed environment, and celebrate the holiday season. Very few law firms hosted holiday parties last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but as vaccination rates increase, and more law firms return to the office, many shops should consider hosting holiday parties this year.

Before starting my own practice several years ago, I worked at a handful of big and smaller law firms. Each law firm at which I worked hosted a holiday party. The biggest firm I worked at hosted a huge shindig as a swanky country club, and the smallest firm I worked at hosted a holiday party at a nearby bar. Although some people many not like the social tension that may be present at holiday parties, I always enjoyed going to these events.

Holiday parties are a great way to build rapport among people who work in an office. Individuals may interact with people at the office more than they interact with some members of their family. Yet, people usually only see their coworkers in a professional environment, wearing the same professional clothes, and talking about the same work-related matters. A holiday party is perhaps the one time in a year when individuals who work with each other can interact on a deeper level and forge bonds that can transcend just the coworker connection.

Indeed, the holiday parties I attended were some of the only times I got to see the partners unwind and view them more as colleagues than bosses. In addition, holiday parties were usually the only time I interacted with family members of people with whom I worked, which was always a great experience. Holiday parties were a fixture of all kinds of law firms for as long as I worked in the profession, likely due to all of the benefits these events can have at a firm.

Last year, practically no law firms hosted holiday parties, and this was the right move. During the holiday season, COVID-19 cases were on the rise, and it was one of the bleakest parts of the pandemic. The cold temperatures seemingly drove people indoors which has a negative impact on the amount of people who were impacted by COVID-19. In addition, although the COVID-19 vaccines began getting rolled out during last year’s holiday season, no one outside of a select group of people could obtain the vaccine. Almost all of the holiday events I heard of got cancelled in light of these conditions, and law firms were wise not to schedule holiday parties.

However, we can be cautiously optimistic that conditions this holiday season may permit law firms to hold holiday parties in some form. Vaccination rates are on the rise, and many law firms are requiring that attorneys get vaccinated in order to come to the office. In addition, COVID-19 case counts are going down (although it remains to be seen if this rate will continue into the holiday season). Based on these conditions, many law firms are requiring associates to return to offices, which has started the long path that lawyers and law firms must tread before things return to as close to the prepandemic normal as possible. Hosting holiday parties can be one way that law firms continue their trend of bringing people back together and normalizing operations in light of recent developments in the fight against COVID-19.

Legal organizations should also consider hosting the same holiday parties they once held, albeit perhaps in a modified format. During the holiday season, I loved attending a variety of industry holiday parties so that I could interact with lawyers who worked outside of my office. Without naming names, there was one court reporting service that used to host an epic holiday party, and people used to travel from hundreds of miles away in some situations to attend this annual event. In addition, Above the Law itself used to host one of the best holiday parties around, and it is a shame that this tradition has been interrupted due to COVID-19. Interacting with other lawyers at such industry events is good for networking, business development, and a variety of other purposes, and legal industry organizations should also consider hosting holiday parties this year.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Of course, measures should be taken to protect against COVID-19 at any holiday party. I am not an epidemiologist, but parties should be kept to a limited number of guests, and guest should likely have to prove that they are vaccinated or had a recent COVID-19 test before they attend such an event. At the very least, law firms should start thinking well in advance of the holiday season whether or not they should host holiday parties this year like they did before the COVID-19 pandemic.

# What's It Going To Take To Get This Biglaw Megamerger Across The Finish Line?
## All of the partners need to be on board, and that could be difficult.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

There is typically a lot of wood to chop to get to the finish of a transformative law firm combination. They will need to develop a business case that captures the hearts and minds of the equity partners.

There is also often a multidimensional chess to play because as much as a firm hopes its partners act in their firm’s best interests, unsurprisingly, there are some partners who start to think, ‘If our firm is not going to be the firm it has always been, maybe I should look at this like being a free agent’ and compare the new firm with others on the open market. Some firms have a culture where that happens a lot; others are more committed to the firm’s best interests.

— [Kent Zimmermann](https://www.consultzg.com/people/kent-zimmermann/), a legal industry consultant at the Zeughauser Group who has handled many law firm mergers, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/25/what-next-for-ao-and-shearman-firms-look-to-partnership-vote-first/) on the proposed merger between Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling. Zimmerman went on to note that “[c]omplacency during a combination in one firm can be a deal breaker,” adding that in prior mergers, he’s seen a lot of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” from certain practice areas.

# Am Law 100 Firm Names Younger Partner As Chair Elect To Lead Alongside Non-Lawyer CEO
## The firm's new leader is about 20 years junior to the typical Biglaw chair -- and that's big news.

A slew of Biglaw firms are ushering in new leaders this year, but the latest firm to elect a new chair has done things a bit differently. What could be so unique about this new law firm leader, you may ask?

His age.

Husch Blackwell — a firm that brought in $555,836,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 81 in the most recent Am Law 100 — has named [Joe Glynias](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/joe-glynias) as its chair elect. The St. Louis-based labor and employment lawyer has all the credentials your typical Biglaw leader comes equipped with, but there’s one thing that makes him stand out among his peers.

Glynias, a Husch Blackwell lifer who joined the firm about 21 years ago, is just 46 years old. Compared to other Biglaw chairs and managing partners, that makes him quite young. [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/husch-blackwell-names-glynias-46-firm-chair-bucking-age-trend) has more:

The incoming chair is significantly younger than the average Big Law leader. The average age of top leaders who departed top roles at the largest firms last year and this year was 66, The American Lawyer [reported](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/10/law-firm-leaders-may-be-tiring-of-the-job-but-thats-not-why-theyve-been-leaving/#:~:text=Chelsey%20Fredlund%2FALM-,The%20average%20tenure%20of%20top%20leaders%20departing%20in%202023-24,than%20the%202006-22%20group.) in November.

Glynias plans to maintain his active labor and employment practice after he takes over the firm’s leadership on April 1, alongside [Jamie Lawless](https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/jamie-lawless), who is set to become the firm’s CEO on February 1. Lawless is not a lawyer, and she’ll soon become the only business professional to lead an Am Law 100 firm.

Glynias offered the following in a statement about his upcoming leadership transition at the firm:

“I am extremely excited about Jamie serving as our next Chief Executive and helping her chart our course forward. Our firm defines itself in many uncommon ways, including that a successful law firm does not have to be run by a lawyer—particularly when a non-lawyer business professional of Jamie’s caliber has shown herself to be such an inspiring and competent leader.”

“I believe my role, and that of the Executive Board, is to support her and create an environment where she can best succeed, and I can’t wait to see what we can all do together. Our firm is beyond fortunate to be working from a position of strength and success based on the extraordinary work and dedication shown by Catherine Hanaway during her time as our Chair, for which we are all extremely grateful.”

Congratulations to Joe Glynias on his ascent to leadership at Husch Blackwell, and congratulations to the firm on forging this new pathway to success with Jamie Lawless.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Nashville, in the health care industry world, is pretty much the epicenter of for-profit health care, where investors come to own health care. I don’t really see that changing, in terms of health care being of great interest to investors.

— [John Tishler](https://www.ebglaw.com/people/john-c-tishler/), a partner at Epstein Becker & Green, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/11/major-combinations-in-nashville-and-carolinas-signal-southeasts-emergence-as-merger-hotspot/), on this year’s strong merger activity within the Southeast, and the fact that firms are “hungry for growth” opportunities in Nashville’s specialized (and profitable) health care market. Tishler left health care firm Waller Lansden in November, and that firm recently [announced a merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/top-biglaw-firm-starts-new-year-off-on-right-foot-with-merger-announcement/) with Holland & Knight.

It’s officially time to say hello to A&O Shearman, the newest Biglaw behemoth. After two weeks of voting, Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling jointly announced earlier this morning that their partnerships had officially approved the firms’ proposed merger. Combined, the firm will have nearly 4,000 lawyers with approximately 800 partners, spread across 48 offices. A&O Shearman’s revenue will total roughly $3.5 billion. As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/13/ao-shearman-has-lift-off-partners-give-green-light/), A&O Shearman is now set to become the third-largest law firm in the world.

According to a firm spokesperson, more than 99% of the votes cast at each firm were in favor of the merger. The firms published a [joint press release](https://www.shearman.com/en/news-and-events/news/2023/10/a-and-o-shearman-merger-approved) with comments from their respective leaders:

Wim Dejonghe, Senior Partner at Allen & Overy, said: “This is a historic moment for both firms and our profession. We are delighted that our partners have voted so resoundingly in favor of this merger, which is a transformational step for the legal industry. We have long admired Shearman & Sterling for its outstanding reputation, talent, and client base, and we are confident that together we will create a truly exceptional global firm that will serve our clients’ needs in an increasingly complex and dynamic world.”

Adam Hakki, Senior Partner at Shearman & Sterling, said: “Our partners have recognized and welcomed this unparalleled opportunity to combine our individual market leadership and brands to serve clients as an integrated global law firm, preeminent in all our markets. A&O Shearman will be a firm unlike any other in the world, built to achieve exceptional outcomes for our clients through an intentional focus on quality, excellence, and collaboration. We are creating a new industry leader, with truly global capabilities, and we are excited for what is to come.”

# The New Compensation Scale Is Spreading On The West Coast

Looks like Biglaw firms don’t want to be left in the dust by their peer firms moving to the new [MoneyLaw scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/). West Coast giant [O’Melveny & Myers](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/omelveny-myers/) is getting on board and giving raises to their associates.

The firm has yet to release an official memo or email, instead preferring to leave the information on voicemail — how very ’90s — but we’ve heard from a bevy of tipsters (we <3 you) that the raises are for all U.S. offices, are effective July 1, and fully match the scale set out by Cravath earlier this week.

A tipster does note the compensation grid only goes up to the class of 2008:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
No 2007 pay scale, which is annoying, and a departure from past practice.

UPDATE 7:16pm: We’ve received a little more detail about how those above the class of 2008 will be compensated:

To be fair the firm stated that the higher level counsel (2007 and senior, I think) would be individually determined. At least seems to leave open the possibility of being paid market, but wonder if/when that will be determined for the present year raise.

Still, a welcomed payday for associates. This move really [amps up the pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-firms-miss-the-moneylaw-cut/) on other West Coast firms, which thus far have been slow to act.

# Supreme Court Frontrunner's Former Clerk Takes Devotion To New Heights
## Biglaw associate takes the battle to be the next Supreme Court justice to the pages of Wikipedia.

The relationship between a judge and clerk is often described as a unique one that can inspire devotion and long lasting bonds. A meaningful clerkship relationship can change the course of a young lawyer’s career, opening up opportunities and experiences that would otherwise would be closed. And if “your” judge becomes a Supreme Court justice, an already prestigious resume line takes an even bigger shot in the arm.

So, it’s not surprising that former clerks of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson want her to get the nod to the Court from Joe Biden. She’s reportedly the frontrunner ([and who Above the Law readers believe will get the nomination](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/who-do-you-think-will-replace-stephen-breyer-on-the-supreme-court/)) to be the replacement for Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court — and she’s a former Breyer clerk to boot. But according to a [report from Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/04/former-clerk-rewrites-supreme-court-wikipedia-bios-00005914), one former clerk’s support of Brown Jackson has turned to an active online campaign.

According to Politico’s reporting, Matteo Godi, a former Brown Jackson clerk and current [Paul Weiss associate](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/associates/matteo-godi), under the username “H2rty” has “as a matter of course” edited his former [boss’s Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson) for a number of years. (Godi was identified as H2rty by an anonymous group of former Brown Jackson clerks.) But now that’s she’s on the shortlist of SCOTUS nominees, he’s reportedly taken to not only editing Brown Jackson’s page, but the pages of other contenders to make Brown Jackson seem like a more compelling selection. H2rty’s Wiki edits include Brown Jackson’s (natch) as well as J. Michelle Childs and Leondra Kruger, Wilhelmina Wright, Tiffany Cunningham, Arianna J. Freeman, and Holly Thomas. Which is basically every serious contender for the seat.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Some of the changes to Brown Jackson’s page seem to be aimed at shining her record:

The most recent changes to Jackson’s page appear to be an attempt at swaying left-leaning opinion in her favor. On Jan. 30 and Feb. 1, user H2rty made significant changes to the body of Jackson’s page, cutting a reference to Jackson’s position on an advisory board of “a Baptist school.” Descriptions of two of Jackson’s rulings against the Trump administration, both of which were reversed by the D.C. Circuit, were erased and replaced with a defense: “Ahead of her confirmation hearing, ‘Bloomberg Law’ reported that conservative activists were pointing to certain decisions by Jackson that had been reversed on appeal as a ‘potential blemish on her record,’ in order ‘to tarnish her so she won’t get picked for the Supreme Court.’”

The portion detailing Jackson’s most famous ruling, a decision to require former White House counsel Don McGahn to obey a congressional subpoena, was also tweaked. The New York Times noted Jackson’s “slow pace” helped then-President Donald Trump “run out the clock on the congressional oversight effort” before the 2020 election; Jackson’s updated Wikipedia page seems to shift the blame for the ruling’s timing from Jackson to the D.C. Circuit court.

Which has a decidedly different tenor than the recent edits to other shortlisters’ pages:

Edits to Childs’ and Kruger’s pages by the user took a decidedly different tone, emphasizing characteristics of the potential nominees that call into question their liberal bona-fides. A passage on Childs’ tenure at South Carolina-based law firm Nexsen Pruet notes her “reputation for being an expert in employment and labor law.” User H2rty added that Childs worked on behalf of “employers dealing with allegations of race based and gender based discrimination, employee efforts to unionize, and other alleged civil rights violations.”

Kruger’s page notes she is “sometimes considered one of the swing votes” on the California Supreme Court. H2rty added that she “is seen as a moderate on the seven-member court — moderately liberal on civil cases, more conservative on criminal matters.”

Of course, because it is a wiki, a Wikimedia spokesperson said this about the recent edits, “We do not write, edit, proofread, or determine what content is included on Wikipedia or how that content is maintained.” While Godi has remained silent about the attention his internet hobby has garnered.

# Get Your Vaccine And Get It Now: Biglaw Firms Want To Open Their Offices

Firms are becoming more firm about what they want people to do, particularly requiring vaccinations. There was a period where people were much more comfortable and willing to be flexible, but what I’m seeing at firms, and just generally, is people’s patience is wearing a little thin about this because they don’t want to continue in this way indefinitely.

— Jeffrey Lowe, practice leader of the law firm practice group at Major, Lindsey & Africa, commenting on the firms that have [recently mandated vaccinations for all employees in light of the rise of the Delta variant](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/04/peoples-patience-is-wearing-a-little-thin-whats-spurring-vaccine-mandates-at-some-big-law-firms/). Law firms would like to reopen their offices and don’t want a wrench to be thrown into those plans due to COVID outbreaks. In order to protect their employees and prevent illness, required vaccinations for all is a perfect way to accomplish both goals.

# Is Skadden Arps Handing Out Retention Bonuses To Only *Some* Associates?
## If you can stay at the firm for another year, you could get a bunch of extra money.

We know the Biglaw lateral market is super hot right now. So if associates are unhappy for even the slightest reason, they’re probably looking at other opportunities. And firms *know* that, hence they’re throwing money at associates (in the form of special bonuses and raises). But is that enough to keep valuable associates at the firm?

Well, it looks like Skadden is giving associates even more money to keep them at the firm — but there’s a catch. According to numerous tipsters, associates are getting retention bonuses — on top of all the money previously publicized — but there’s a catch. It only goes to associates in certain, highly sought after practice groups, namely M&A and capital markets in the New York office. According to insiders, the firm is making the payments on the DL so as not to rock the boat with practice groups left out of the largesse. That means there is no memo — bonuses have been communicated individually by phone.

We are hearing reports of *lots* of six-figure bonuses going out to junior (though not first-year) through senior associates, but truly the midlevels appear to be the target of the move. And finally the real kicker: associates have to be employed at the firm as of June 30, 2022 to get the bonus.

Skadden has not responded to inquiries about the bonuses.

So… Skaddenites, we have some questions for you: Are other practice groups getting these retention bonuses? Are first-year associates truly left out in the cold? Are other offices besides New York getting in on the action?

The other query is: how widespread is this in the industry? Can we expect other elite firms to do the same — or are they already doing so?

You know the drill — hit us up! Please don’t hesitate to let us know whatever details you have on retention bonuses. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

# Above The Law’s 2018 Lawyer Of The Year Contest: The Winner!
## With competitors like the special counsel and a sitting Supreme Court justice, you may be surprised by this year's winner.

The competition for 2018 Lawyer of the Year honors was not a close competition, not even one little bit. The top three candidates — Michael Avenatti, Robert Mueller, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — each had votes in the hundreds, but the new titleholder secured almost 300 more votes than the second-place finisher.

Before we announce which one of the three prevailed, let’s review Above the Law’s past Lawyers of the Year:

- 2007: [Loyola 2L](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/01/featured-survey-results-and-the-winners-are------/)

- 2009: [Justice Sonia Sotomayor](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/atls-lawyer-of-the-year-the-winner/)
- 2010: [Law School Transparency’s Kyle McEntee and Patrick Lynch](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/atls-lawyer-of-the-year-2010-the-winner/)
- 2011: [Professor Paul Campos](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/atls-2011-lawyer-of-the-year-the-winner/)
- 2012: [Chief Justice John Roberts](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/01/above-the-laws-2012-lawyer-of-the-year-competition-the-winner/)
- 2013: [Roberta Kaplan](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/above-the-laws-2013-lawyer-of-the-year-competition-the-winner/)
- 2014: [Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/above-the-laws-2014-lawyer-of-the-year-contest-the-winner/)

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
You’ll see they come from basically two camps: “famous famous,” like President Obama and the three Supreme Court justices, and “ATL famous,” like the various critics of the law school industrial complex. Which camp won out this year?


Michael Avenatti (Photo by Jennifer S. Altman/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)

Famous famous — or some would even say infamous. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for former adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who would go on to start a chain of events that would eventually send another lawyer to jail (Michael Cohen, who finished this competition in second-to-last place) and add fuel to the fire in the FBI investigation of a sitting president, stole this competition with 44 percent of the entire vote. Like no other attorney, he was able to dominate the news throughout the course of the year and developed such a fan club that he even thought of (and then thought better of) running for president.

Congratulations to all our Lawyer of the Year finalists, and very special congratulations to our 2018 Lawyer of the Year, Michael Avenatti. Thanks to his incredibly zealous client representation and his habit of inserting himself into every pop culture legal event, America will never be the same. Well done!

# Disclosure Forms Reveal Biglaw Partner's Salary, Despicable Clients
## Another Trump nominee releases financials and we get another look inside the black box of Biglaw compensation.

A new administration is always good for anyone seeking inside intel on the workings of Biglaw’s biggest shops. It’s how we learned that [Christopher Wray made way, way more](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/king-spalding-pays-christopher-wray-9-2-million-a-year/) at King & Spalding than most of his colleagues. Now we’re [learning more](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202793211030/) about the [black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) that is Jones Day with the release of Eric Dreiband’s financial disclosure forms.

For the law nerds out there, the White House’s decision to nominate Dreiband to head the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ is the ultimate “screw you” staffing move of the still young Trump administration. Betsy DeVos may exhibit rank incompetence and “Kushner” will be the word we use for empty nepotism decades after the man’s existence has faded into memory, but it’s Dreiband who really shows what an administration that gives zero f**ks can achieve.

“Oh you have a whole division devoted to protecting civil rights? Let’s put a guy whose claim to fame is pushing the cartoonishly retrograde justifications for discrimination in charge!”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Most of his troubling representations were public knowledge, but for anyone not keeping track, his [disclosure form](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/disclosure-forms-reveal-biglaw-partners-salary-despicable-clients/2/) may refresh your memory. Dreiband’s most recent headline grabber brought him to the defense of North Carolina’s “bathroom bill,” but it’s a disservice to the man’s record to assume that this was the only blemish on his civil rights record. He’s America’s go-to lawyer for entities unwilling to stand up and do the right thing by victims of discrimination. When R.J. Reynolds needed protection against claims they literally [throw away applications from older people](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202791903832), Dreiband is there. When Bloomberg needed help dispelling accusations that it [retaliated against employees who took maternity leave](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202618795005), Dreiband is there.

For the record, Dreiband represented the Trump campaign and it’s not even the most morally suspect entity on this form because he’s represented Abercrombie & Fitch before the Supreme Court. He tried to justify the clothier’s refusal to hire a [Muslim woman for wearing a hijab](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-86_p86b.pdf). Antonin Scalia wrote the opinion shutting that down. Take a moment to consider how reprehensible a discriminatory policy would have to be for Scalia to write that opinion.

Obviously some discrimination claims are false, that’s the nature of the beast, but lawyers own their brand. His is taking on the discrimination cases that require the helping hand of appellate jurists willing to look the other way. That’s why it may be unfair to judge all lawyers by the clients they’ve had, but when their book of business starts to show a trend, it becomes a legitimate consideration.

Vanita Gupta, the last person to hold this particular job, harbors, shall we say, [some concerns](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/29/activists-oppose-trump-civil-rights-pick-240112):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Whoever leads the ‘crown jewel’ of the Justice Department must have deep relationships with stakeholders and marginalized communities, and have a deep, abiding faith in our nation’s civil rights laws,” Gupta said. “They must respect the laws that touch everyone, rights that people have literally died for. They must respect the role of what has been called the conscience of the federal government. In all those regards, Eric Dreiband is woefully unqualified to lead the Civil Rights Division.”

He’s also woefully outgunned compared to Christopher Wray’s earning potential. While Wray was lapping his partners with a whopping $9.2 million a year, Dreiband is pulling down a measly $2.2 million. That’s still double the reported Jones Day PPP of a little over a million, but one might have suspected a bigger gap between Jones Day partners tackling high-stakes matters out of D.C. and, say, someone in Columbus (who is still doing important work… but not making it rain like someone in D.C. might).

In 1934, many questioned the decision to put the consummate Wall Street swindler, Joe Kennedy, in charge of the SEC. He turned it into an aggressive enforcement agency. Perhaps one of America’s most creative attorneys for attacking anti-discrimination laws will become their greatest defender.

Don’t hold your breath.

# Doc Review During Coronavirus: Contract Attorneys Are Suffering In Silence
## This second-class treatment is not appropriate -- especially now.

Thanks to a global pandemic, law firms have made remote work plans for their employees to flatten the curve and stop the rapid spread of COVID-19. Contract attorneys, however, are facing a much different reality in this time of disease.

Above the Law has received many tips from these attorneys, lamenting the sorry state of affairs they’ve been working under in cities across the country. Here are some of their stories.

Despite the ability to securely and efficiently perform document review online, many legal staffing agencies are refusing to allow employees to work remotely. So, the only option we have, if we want to continue earning money, is to go into the review centers.

Unfortunately, most of the review centers are hot beds for the spread of this virus. Most review centers are either open-space work environments that are densely packed with desks and people, or are small rooms densely packed with desks and people. And, by densely packed I mean, attorneys are placed next to one another with less than one foot of space. Both of these types of spaces are a recipe for disaster in this current environment.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I am in NYC and not currently working out of fear of exposure to the Covid19 and management has refused to address worker or potential worker concerns. Companies like [REDACTED] have tightly packed sardine facilities and expect workers to come in with a copy and paste Covid19 email blast which does not address the underlying issues.

As a document review attorney, you have to apply for at least 10 agencies in order to have constant work. But the majority of time you stay home a few days or weeks between projects. During this time, you don’t get paid so you have to apply for unemployment benefits which is not enough to survive.

Most of the time you get paid for your work between $28 and $33 an hour without benefits such as healthcare etc. As an attorney with student loans and a family and mortgage, it is very difficult to survive with this money. Especially when you are the only person earning in the family.

Coronavirus made it even more difficult for us to get on a project now. I have applied for unemployment, but the $370ish a week I get is not sufficient to pay my bills and mortgage.

[REDACTED’s] downtown office has a lot of reviewers. Our client has considered the possibility of remote work but ultimately rejected the option. I am not sure if they rejected that option for their own associates too.

I am young and probably will not be affected, but if I unknowingly carry the virus and infect my much older colleagues, that’s an unconscionable position. And there’s a lot of older attorneys in my project, who are at much greater risk.

I hope you will help us start a public discussion of this second class citizen treatment in the legal field.

People have been campaigning [REDACTED] to offer remote work since they are notorious for having people work in close proximity. Instead of granting that option, they sent out a ridiculous email saying they will determine if social distancing is appropriate, asking people to self-identify their travel status (as if that matters because the damn virus is here in NYC which has the largest number of confirmed cases in the country) and then attempting to downplay the seriousness of this illness (and it is serious and highly infectious) by mentioning how many more people die from the flu.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We are currently still required to report to work despite there being more than 25 people present in very close working conditions. This is work that could be conducted remotely and is being conducted remotely by other document review companies. It is irresponsible and many attorneys present have elderly parents or children at home who have been sent home due to school closings.

I’ve worked as a contract attorney in NYC for some time and there is a growing problem across the country with agencies denying contract attorneys the right to work from home. There are contract attorneys quitting projects because they are expected to work in a shared workspace where everyone is sitting in close proximity, agencies are asking for contract attorneys to provide travel history which is irrelevant since the virus is already here. In many cases they are outright refusing the opportunity to work remotely.

It’s time we stood up for contract attorneys. To be quite frank, it’s unforgivable that people are expected to work in environments where their close contact could mean the possibility of contracting a critical illness. We can’t risk anyone’s health for the sake of litigation. This second-class treatment is not appropriate — especially now.

Please do what you can to help contract attorneys. Call a staffing agency today and let them know they need to do the right thing and offer remote work opportunities.

# 4 Tips For Navigating The COVID-19 Crisis
## Helpful advice for these troubled times from six managing partners.

How are law firms and their leaders navigating the COVID-19 crisis?

Last week, in a [webinar](https://nysba.org/events/managing-partner-conference-series-managing-partner-response-to-covid-19-webinar/) for the New York State Bar Association moderated by my colleague [Craig Brown](https://www.laterallink.com/team/craig-brown/), Managing Principal of Bridgeline Solutions (Lateral Link’s temporary staffing arm), these six managing partners offered excellent insights and advice:

- Adam T. Klein, Esq. – Outten & Golden LLP
- Wayne N. Outten, Esq. – Outten & Golden LLP
- Gregory S. Katz, Esq. – Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP
- Lawrence T. Gresser, Esq. – Cohen & Gresser LLP
- Alan Hoffman, Esq. – Blank Rome LLP
- Dauna Williams, Esq. – The Williams Group
1. Protect your people.

A law firm’s most valuable assets are its people. The panelists repeatedly emphasized how they put the health and well-being of their own lawyers and staff first.

Doing everything possible to make sure employees don’t contract the coronavirus is just the first and most obvious goal. The social isolation created by remote working can give rise to loneliness, depression, and anxiety. The managing partners talked about measures they took to make sure that their lawyers are staff remained healthy in the most holistic sense, including hosting virtual events like town halls and happy hours to promote community and connectedness.

Many lawyers found themselves taking on additional responsibilities during the pandemic, such as child care, elder care, or care for sick family members. Adam Klein said that at Outten & Golden, he and his partners told their associates and staff to put those priorities first.

2. Connect with your clients.

During times of crisis, lawyers need to let their clients know that they’re there for them. The panelists talked about the myriad ways they tried to remain connected to their clients, including email updates, check-in calls from practice group leaders, and even virtual wine tastings.

At Blank Rome, clients signed up for email updates that would inform them about important developments related to the coronavirus crisis, such as changes to government programs. These updates helped clients navigate the tumultuous times while also keeping Blank Rome top of mind, explained Alan Hoffman.

The wine tastings hosted by Cohen & Gresser have been a huge hit with clients, according to Lawrence Gresser. The firm would have wine shipped to clients ahead of time, followed by online tastings led by professional sommeliers — who in normal times would be very difficult to book, but who are more readily accessible during the current crisis.

3. Leverage technology — thoughtfully and carefully.

Law firms moved online so smoothly and successfully thanks to an array of sophisticated systems and advanced technological tools, such as VPN, Citrix, and Zoom. Lawyers learned how to use numerous new technologies, whether they wanted to or not — and this knowledge will stay with them even after the pandemic is over.

The increased use of videoconferencing has been a highlight, as Wayne Outten of Outten & Golden noted. Depositions, hearings, and arbitrations are all being done remotely during the pandemic — and even after the current crisis is over, expect videoconferencing to be used more often than it was pre-COVID-19, now that lawyers (and clients) have seen the money and time that can be saved.

But technology needs to be implemented with thought and care. For example, as Dauna Williams pointed out, you need to make sure that your tools all play well with each other. Certain applications or platforms don’t interact well with one another — and can even compromise each other’s security. Law firms should work with experienced technologists to make sure they avoid such pitfalls.

4. Have a standard reopening procedure.

Moving to remote operations was no small feat for law firms, and reopening offices will also pose a challenge. This is especially true for large law firms with dozens of offices and hundreds, if not thousands, of employees.

The key to successful reopening — according to Gregory Katz of Lewis Brisbois, which has some 3,000 employees working in 52 offices across 22 states — is to have a standard reopening procedure. Each office will reopen at a different pace, reflecting conditions on the ground, but all offices will pass through the same stages of the same process. That process must be carefully designed to consider such factors as who can return and when, where workers can sit in the reopened offices, when visitors can be allowed, and what signage should be erected.

Law firms closed down and moved online with surprising success, and law firms can and will reopen successfully as well. But reopening can’t be taken for granted or handled haphazardly. Instead, firms much approach reopening with all the intelligence, ingenuity, and innovation that they apply to solve the problems of their clients. If lawyers take reopening seriously, they will reap substantial rewards.

# New York's Biglaw Firms Really Flopped Financially Last Year
## Only four firms were in the black. Sheesh!

Back in 2021, New York Biglaw firms had a fantastic financial year that was characterized by money, money, and even more money. The year that followed, 2022, was markedly different. The post-pandemic business boom was over and many firms were left struggling. What did this mean for some of the most prestigious New York Biglaw firms in the business?

According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/30/what-goes-up-must-come-down-ny-firms-come-back-to-earth-after-record-2021/), out of the 19 firms that they classify as New York firms, less than a handful were in the black. Yikes. Here are the details:

[O]nly four [firms] were in the black on revenue: Willkie Farr & Gallagher (13.1%), Schulte Roth & Zabel (8.1%), Proskauer Rose (6.1%) and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson (0.7%).

Skadden, Arps, Meagher, Slate & Flom and Debevoise & Plimpton held their revenue numbers from the previous year. Everyone else got a haircut.

The list gets smaller when looking at revenue per lawyer. Only three firms (Schulte: 8%; Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison: 2.6%; and Proskauer: 2%) had positive gains in RPL last year (while Willkie did grow its revenue by 13.1%, its RPL was down 5.4%).

When looking at profits per equity partner, only one New York firm was up: Prosakuer (6.4%). That’s it.

It… does not get better from there. Twelve of these firms saw double-digit drops in their profits per equity partner, while five saw double-digit declines in their revenue per lawyer. Virtually all New York firms have transactions and capital markets to blame for their financial distress.

“In New York City, firms benefited from the financial markets,” said Alisa Levin, principal at New York-based legal recruiting firm Greene-Levin-Snyder Legal Search Group. “And when the financial markets go in the other direction, they’re going to be hurt.”

Janet Stanton, longtime legal consultant and partner and co-founder of Adam Smith, Esq., had a similar assessment.

“Those firms are dependent on the financial sector,” she said. “We all know that. It’s not like they did anything wrong.”

New York’s Biglaw leaders are “optimistic” about what 2023 looks like, but we’re eager to see how 2022 affected their placement in financial surveys. Stay tuned, because next month we’ll have analysis on the 2023 Am Law 100 ranking.

# Tips For In-House Counsel On 'Learning The Business'
## While learning the business applies even if you are outside counsel, it is especially critical for in-house counsel.

Start taking notes!

“Learn the business.” This is what you will hear time and time again when it comes to providing client services as in-house counsel. While learning the business applies even if you are outside counsel, it is especially critical for in-house counsel. Interestingly, no one seems to talk about the how. Here are some of my tips, in case helpful.

Do The Work

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
There is no substitute for learning the business hands-on, to the extent you can, by doing the work. For example, when I first started at my company, my leader required all the lawyers to work the manufacturing line. (Don’t worry; I received training). And to date, this was the best experience for onboarding that I had. The hands-on experience gave me the context I needed to be able to tailor my legal advice to the practical constraints of the business. It helped me move beyond “you need to do x,” and allowed me to really help my clients by also including “and this is how you can do x.” It also gave me credibility because I was no longer just a “suit” advising from an ivory tower.

For you, this could look like riding with your sales force or answering a customer service call. It might look like working in a retail store or cooking in the kitchen. Of course, this may not work in all instances — but if you can, invest the time. It will pay off.

By the way, if you are outside counsel, it may speak volumes about your commitment to the relationship if you’re willing to do the same without billing it.

See For Yourself

If you can’t try the work, then do your best to observe it at the source. There is just something in seeing it for yourself compared to trying to understand it from someone else’s explanation or experience. This might look like taking a tour of various facilities and walking the floor and observing company processes in action. Or it may look like shadowing various employees in their roles day-to-day in an attempt to understand their perspective.

Listen To Subject Matter Experts

Note that I intentionally use the word “listen” instead of “talk to.” If you are able, schedule meetings with subject matter experts and take the time to learn what they do. Ask them questions, listen closely and take copious notes. Try to understand their why, their goals, their ideas and pain points. This is also helpful for relationship-building.

Follow Industry News And Publications

Learning the business is something that goes beyond simply learning about your organization’s specific business. It also means learning about the industry, the trends, and competitors. I personally find setting various Google alerts can be effective in staying on top of industry-specific news. Also effective is subscribing to specific newsletters or blogs.

# Attorneys Issue Most Obvious Warning For Democracy Ever
## I mean, when someone tells you they're going to be a dictator, that's probably not a good sign.

If you’ve been paying attention for even like a second of the last eight years or so, you’ve probably concluded that Donald Trump poses a massive risk to the rule of law and democracy. Whether it’s the four separate felony cases pending against him, the whole light insurrection thing, or his promise to be a dictator if reelected — but only for a day, and when has an admitted dictator ever lied to the public, amirite?

Now, exactly zero of these concerns have anything to do with the (disastrous) policies and programs — like child separation, politicizing the Department of Justice and the FBI, his terrible judicial nominees, handling of the coronavirus pandemic, eroding of reproductive rights — that he instituted in his first term (never mind what he has in store should he win the 2024 election). So theoretically, they should be divorced from politics — that’s probably not the case, but it *should* be. On Friday, a panel at the American Bar Association’s white collar crime conference issued a reminder of that fact.

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1810419) Law360, moderator Morris “Sandy” Weinberg of Zuckerman Spaeder warned that the country as facing “an existential threat to the criminal justice system and the rule of law.” Which… no shit. But, I suppose it does bear repeating.

“The former president and others have railed for years about the supposed lack of integrity and legitimacy in our criminal justice system,” he said. “These attacks have questioned every part of the criminal justice system,” including law enforcement, agents, prosecutors, juries and even judges, the moderator added.

“You’ve heard that, against him and others, that the judges in most of his cases are biased against him and others,” Weinberg said. “And that the likely juries will be biased because they come from areas that voted against him.”

Biglaw attorney Neil Eggleston of Kirkland noted that Trump’s tearing down of institutions is a calculated move to absolve himself before he’s held accountable:

“What he’s essentially done is tried to break down all the institutions that might hold him accountable,” Eggleston said. “Because then, when he’s held accountable, he can say it was no big deal, it was all political.”

Even former attorney for Rudy Giuliani, Jon Sale of Nelson Mullins, sees the potential for danger ahead:

“Now, there is an existential threat to our democracy,” Sale said. “And I believe as the eternal optimist that it’s the courts that are going to save us. But we all have an obligation to make sure we make that happen.”

Consider the alarm bell good and rung… now we just need to *do* something about it.

[Yesterday](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/is-there-an-end-in-sight-for-the-booming-legal-market/), we wrote about the booming legal market described in the [2022 Report on the State of the Legal Market](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/state-of-the-legal-market-2022/) by Thomson Reuters Institute and the Georgetown University Law Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession. Beyond the return of real growth in demand for legal services and continued profitability, the report featured some unique findings relevant to the frenetic lateral market.

As the earlier story discussed, some firms will eventually hit a wall when it comes to skyrocketing compensation. When that happens, how will they respond to stay competitive in the battle for the finite pool of talent out there?

The State of the Legal Market report pulled back the curtain a bit on the other side of the lateral question: retention.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

All of these efforts are important and necessary, but they are likely not sufficient to bend the curve on the rising turnover rate that law firms are experiencing. Achieving that goal will require firms to reimagine their structures and operations in the post-pandemic world to provide the real “glue” that we know is necessary to bind people to organizations — feelings of value and meaning in their work, feeling appreciated and recognized, having opportunities for growth and personal satisfaction, and believing that they are making a contribution to something larger than themselves.

The best offense may be a good defense when it comes to laterals. The Thomson Reuters Institute promises more on this issue in the coming months, but armed with preliminary data, the current report includes this graphic:



There’s a lot to unpack here, and I’m a little hesitant to draw too many conclusions until the later report provides all the data, but…

These factors should not be taken as a suggestion that lawyers are happy staying at firms that work them harder and pay them less.

And yet, that’s very much what you’re suggesting!

Again, everyone should reserve judgment until the more complete inquiry comes out and we can piece together the nuances driving these figures (I’d particularly be interested in digging beyond using just the mean billables number), but this is a bit of a jolt to the conventional wisdom. Maybe there really is an appetite for firm culture perks beyond straight cash?

I dunno… loans don’t get repaid with weekly wine and cheese parties.

# Federal Judge Didn't Know Handcuffing Crying Children Was Frowned Upon

Judge Roger Benitez of the Southern District of California decided to use his marshal to take a 13-year-old girl out of the audience and [handcuff her in the jury box](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/federal-judge-handcuffs-crying-13-year-old-girl-attending-fathers-hearing/). Apparently, he didn’t realize arbitrary acts of psychological torture upon children were frowned upon in this establishment. Now the Ninth Circuit is [looking into a formal complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/formal-complaint-lodged-against-federal-judge-for-handcuffing-crying-13-year-old-girl/). Also, those Dr. Rick commercials scold people turning into their parents for trying to leave voicemails, but it might be worth checking to see what the voicemail greeting you set 10 years ago says. Because for [one aspiring lawyer it wasn’t great](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/cheeky-voicemail-costs-law-student-biglaw-opportunity/). Finally, the Fifth Circuit’s Judge Ho thinks it’s [wrong to prosecute political rivals on made-up charges](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/when-judge-ho-feels-the-need-to-angrily-call-out-the-fifth-circuits-totalitarianism-you-know-things-are-bad/) and frighteningly he’s in the minority on this question.

# Demystifying Black Box AI: 7 Tips For Lawyers To Promote Explainable AI
## Even the AI experts who create and train AI black box models don’t always fully understand their internal processes and decision-making mechanisms.

I stumbled on a real eye-opener when exploring the generative AI tool, ChatGPT. My query for the “top three greatest artists of all time” returned a list of white European men: Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Vincent van Gogh. 

Ahem! Georgia O’Keeffe would like a word, as would Frida Kahlo, Kara Walker, and many other great international artists of all races and genders.

ChatGPT’s response sheds light on a few biases lurking within AI systems. Preventing biases is a major reason regulators emphasize the need for “explainable” AI.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But how can lawyers describe the inner mysteries of AI models when even technology specialists refer to specific functions as “black box AI”? Below are seven tips to help you navigate black box AI and promote the use of explainable AI for a more inclusive future.

Embrace The Challenge Of Explainable AI

Legal practitioners play a vital role in ensuring AI solutions adhere to the principles of fairness, neutrality, and unbiased decision-making. Regulations like those in the EU AI Act aim to hold AI technologies accountable for their decision-making processes. 

However, even the AI experts who create and train AI black box models don’t always fully understand their internal processes and decision-making mechanisms. Potential biases go unexamined and unchallenged. The lack of accountability often makes using black box AI inappropriate in areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, credit scoring, or hiring processes.

But not all AI systems are impenetrable. Think of the “black box” metaphor as a call to action, not an insurmountable obstacle, as we strive toward enhancing AI’s explainability. In embracing this challenge, you can lead the charge for greater transparency and accountability in AI. 

Learn The Basics Of AI

Learn basic AI concepts like machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. Familiarize yourself with ethical concerns such as data privacy and algorithmic biases. Education demystifies AI, empowering you to better interpret and explain AI to clients, colleagues, regulators, and the public. (Check out these [resources and strategies](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/ongoing-ai-education-strategies-and-resources-for-lawyers/) to learn more about AI now.)

Collaborate With Technology And AI Specialists

Work closely with data scientists, AI developers, and tech experts to learn about the key drivers behind AI decisions. They can help you translate technical jargon into understandable language, which is a considerable benefit when explaining AI to clients and regulators. They can also help you set clear and realistic expectations around transparency, reliability, and fairness.

Prove AI’s Validity And Fairness

Maybe you can’t see or explain how an AI model works, but you can still evaluate its outcomes. Ensure tech specialists perform rigorous testing and validation of AI algorithms to identify and mitigate potential biases. These efforts generate evidence of AI’s fairness and efficacy to present to stakeholders.

Standardize AI reporting

Develop standardized formats for reporting AI outputs and explaining decision-making processes. Standards enhance clarity and facilitate cross-communication between legal professionals, clients, and regulators. Tailor these and other audit reports to emphasize essential information and justifications.

Prioritize Transparent AI Models

As often as possible, opt to use transparent AI models that provide the clearest explanations of their decision-making process. Some applications may require complex AI models, but the number of interpretable and explainable AI techniques is growing. 

Insist On Transparency From Vendors

Question vendors about the mechanics behind their tools. Request explicit details about how systems make decisions and process data. You may need to acquire detailed technical documentation and assurances of compliance with relevant regulations.

Implement Ethically Sound And Interpretable AI Solutions

Striving for interpretability, advocating for regulations that promote transparency, and engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations with data scientists and technologists are all part of the solution. 

Demystifying black box AI helps you ensure accountability, protect against biases, comply with regulations, and advocate for ethical practices in an increasingly AI-driven world. This is one way lawyers can help pave the way to a future where AI operates as a force for good while adhering to the principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability.

# Biglaw Firm Matches First-Year Salaries (In Some Markets), Senior Associates Not So Lucky
## Salary compression hits mid-level and senior associates at the firm.

When Faegre Baker Daniels and Drinker Biddle & Reath merged in 2020 to create the 1000+ attorney Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath, expectations for the new mega firm were high. And though gross revenue was below the predicted $1 billion mark ($937 million for 2020), firm leaders[ projected contentment](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2021/03/02/in-its-first-year-post-merger-faegre-drinker-kept-profits-steady/) over the progress of the new firm. So, with compensation increases sweeping their way through Biglaw, Faegre Drinker got in on the action.

The firm announced the below compensation grid, which still has different scales for different offices. But there is more to note in the scale — even in their major market locations.

Check it:

Hmmm…. First- and second-years are on track to make the same as the prevailing market rate in the major markets. But after that, things get wonky as grid compression sets in. Compared to the DPW scale, 3rd years are down by $5k, 4th by $15k, and by the time you get to 8th years, they are a shocking $50k below market compensation! This is a trick firms have played in the past — with the first-year number matching market rates, they’re hoping that’s the only nugget of intel prospective first-year associates will note and then once they’re ensconced at the firm is when they’ll notice how far behind their peers they are. But we see you.

But I suppose some raises are better than none, and I’m sure associates at the firm will enjoy the extra cash.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises”).

James Fisher and Kevin Broyles

I joined my video interview with the founders of the up-and-coming firm FisherBroyles last week thinking about law, but I ended it thinking about cars. If Cravath and Skadden are expensive high-end classics, like a Bentley or a Maybach, then FisherBroyles is a Tesla — new, exciting, and convinced it’s going to put the old guard out of business. FisherBroyles is challenging, at times risky, and pushing the envelope, and those who know about it are interested to see where it goes.

In FisherBroyles’s eyes, though, they’re selling space shuttles while the rest of the legal industry keeps hocking scooters. The FisherBroyles experiment is still in its early stages of unfolding, but any law firm that isn’t carefully taking notes and willing to make some adjustments may soon find itself staring at its tracks as it drives off into the future.

Stumbling Into a Big Idea

As James Fisher and Kevin Broyles tell it, their firm was born out of the dotcom bust. Both were working at a technology-oriented firm in the early 2000s. “Our plan was to represent technology companies that were high growth, get some stock options by going in house, go general counsel, and cash out as millionaires.” Instead, the bubble popped, and most of their clients ended up out of business.

With time on their hands, Fisher and Broyles decided to launch their own firm that focused on small companies with substantial upside. Because those clients generally don’t have a lot of cash available for attorney’s fees, Fisher and Broyles kept their overhead and rates at a bare minimum while they built up their respective books.

Lots of new law firms launch with that same concept, but as they grow they rent nice office space, raise their rates, and bring in associates to leverage. FisherBroyles didn’t follow that script. Its founders continued to primarily work from home, using cloud-based worksharing tools. They continued to do the work themselves, rather than bringing in new attorneys to pass the work down to. Those early cost-saving measures became the firm’s guiding principles.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“We took away the two most inefficient aspects of the law firm model: the expensive fixed cost real estate, and the $180,000 a year associate being trained on the client’s time. And once you eliminate those two massive aspects of law firm overhead, that leaves a lot of capital revenue to pay your lawyers more.”

Under The Hood

FisherBroyles seems like an attempt to find out how much you can you take away from a law firm and still call it a law firm. Associates are out. There are only partners at FisherBroyles. While some partners work primarily for other partners, any attorney walking in the door has to be experienced and fully capable of handling themselves unsupervised.

Offices and secretaries are also largely out. If a FisherBroyles partner wants a secretary or dedicated office space, they pay 100% of that cost themselves. The firm leaves overhead decisions entirely in the hands of individual attorneys, so that no one pays for something they don’t use.

Discretionary compensation, what Kevin Broyles calls “the annual horror show,” is out in a big way. FisherBroyles’s compensation is 100% objective, based primarily on working attorney fee income, business generation, and file management. By minimizing friction points, Broyles and Fisher see themselves as freeing up their partners to continue working and bringing in business.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So far, the plan is working. The small “virtual” law firm has ballooned in the past couple of years to over 200 attorneys operating in over 20 major metropolitan areas. It stands poised to be the first ever non-traditional law firm to break into the Am Law 200 either later this year or early next. Given that new partners pay their own freight and have to bring in their own work, the cost to expand the firm is functionally nothing. The objective compensation system actually rewards bringing in new partners, sort of like an Amway for the Am Law set.

The Amazon of Law Firms?

I asked in this column last month whether there was a law firm that [wanted to be the Amazon of Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/amazon-etsy-and-biglaw/). I got the answer a lot faster than I expected, as Fisher and Broyles invoked Amazon comparisons several times during our discussion. In their view, they’ve invented a new type of law firm that will “eventually take over the traditional law firm model.” With their early-mover advantage, Fisher and Broyles think they’re “so far ahead of our next largest competitor that it would be virtually impossible for them to catch up.”

I’m not betting against them, at least not yet. Sure, some questions remain. For starters, FisherBroyles depends on traditional firms to train up new associates, who it can then recruit with promises of better work, fewer hours, and more money. If the old model firms went away, FisherBroyles would find itself without a training ground for its future partners. Someone would have to make up that difference.

The firm may also have to confront what happens when its partners become too successful. One of the animating principles of FisherBroyles was creating a firm where set, egalitarian principles control. But is it overly utopian? Finding ways to keep partners happy in a dynamic, competitive lateral recruiting environment without betraying the core mission of the company might be a challenge; though, if overhead is kept low enough, they’re betting there will be enough money to keep everyone happy.

But Fisher and Broyles aren’t the first revolutionaries to get told they couldn’t do it. I compared them to Tesla at the top of this column, which likewise faced a lot of questions in its early years. A lot of people told Elon Musk he’d never get his concept off the ground. Given the Roadster that just got launched into space a few weeks back, I’d say Tesla did alright for itself. And, if FisherBroyles makes the right steps at this early phase, it may follow suit.

Even if FisherBroyles isn’t necessarily what every law firm will look like in 30 years, I fully expect the model to be adopted more heavily. FisherBroyles has been quietly reinventing the fundamental firm model under the radar, and they’re about to start making major waves. Every law firm needs to be looking closely at this model and seeing what can be done to fold those kinds of strengths into its own practices.

Biglaw can’t ignore FisherBroyles forever.  What happens as it starts getting noticed?

It’s going to be a fun ride.

As the OCI merry-go-round continues to spin at law school campuses across the country, it looks like some law firms are getting a little sloppy. Sure, some rejection letters are deserved, but others are being sent to students who never even interviewed with the firm in the first place.

Here’s what our tipster says of the rejection letter that was sent for no reason:

Hunton & Williams: a firm that’s serving up double-whammy rejections.

Menglu Wang

Menglu Wang had a bright career ahead of her. A Harvard Law grad, and former editor of the Harvard International Law Journal, she’d scored the Biglaw dream job, working as a corporate associate at Linklaters. Then her husband, MIT research scientist Fei Yan, was arrested for insider trading.

But wait — it gets worse. The stock in question was of a Linklaters client… and Wang was staffed on the deal. Oh, and according to prosecutors, he read an article titled, “Want to Commit Insider Trading? Here’s How Not To Do It.” As[ reported by](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/02/ex-linklaters-lawyer-tied-to-insider-trading-case-plans-to-restart-legal-career/) Law.com:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
According to the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office, Yan used inside information about Linklaters client Sibanye Gold’s $2.2 billion acquisition of Stillwater Mining in 2016 to buy stock options in Stillwater. His wife had worked on the Sibanye transaction. Yan then off-loaded his stock options on the day the deal was announced, for a profit of more than $100,000.

This week, Yan pleaded guilty to insider trading.

Linklaters suspended Wang after Yan’s July arrest, eventually cutting ties with her. Her lawyer maintains her innocence in the scandal:

“There were a number of innocent bystanders. She is one of them. She is not a target. It’s an unfortunate side effect that she lost her job,” said Wang’s lawyer, Wayne Gosnell of Clayman & Rosenberg in New York. Gosnell declined to comment about the specifics of the case.

# 'If I Wag My Finger About Diversity And Inclusion, My Law Firm Partners Will Give Me A Different Finger'
## Everyone in a law firm must be able to understand and articulate why diversity and inclusion are important.

“Here’s a thought for my revolutionary heart /  Take a deeper look at history, it’s there to pick apart.” — [J. Cole](https://genius.com/J-cole-high-for-hours-lyrics#note-11187492)

Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to review Kathleen B. Nalty’s book, [Going ‘All-In’ on Diversity and Inclusion: The Law Firm Leader’s Playbook](http://kathleennaltyconsulting.com/product/going-all-in-book/).

[  ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Nalty is an award-winning, nationally recognized expert in strategies for creating cultures of inclusion to retain and advance talent. She specializes in helping legal organizations identify systemic issues that cause higher attrition for attorneys in underrepresented groups. She is the founder and president of [Kathleen Nalty Consulting, LLC](http://kathleennaltyconsulting.com/product/going-all-in-book/).

I found the chapter titled “Diversity and Inclusiveness — Everyone’s Responsibility” to be particularly interesting. Near the beginning of this chapter, Nalty states:

It is human nature for partners to gravitate toward attorneys within their affinity group, unconsciously giving them more intangible opportunities and sharing the unwritten rules for success. Unfortunately, this dynamic operates to marginalize underrepresented attorneys who are disproportionately impacted by the hidden barriers.

Even though attorneys in underrepresented groups may be as talented and hardworking as attorneys in the majority or insider group, multiple research studies demonstrate that they are not always given the same access to swimming lessons, life rings, and water rings in the “sink or swim” environment. On the surface, while the resulting performance gap might appear to be due to lack of ability, it is actually often due to lack of opportunity.

Nalty believes that everyone in a law firm must be able to understand and articulate why diversity and inclusion are important before they become engaged advocates, or engage in the “how” they can participate. She believes that leaders in law firms have to first convince partners and others that something is wrong with the status quo or that problems exist in the firm that undermine organizational performance and hurt the bottom line. She writes:

One law firm office head captured the problem graphically by saying, ‘I can’t go back to my firm wagging my finger [about D+I] because my partners will just turn around and give me a different finger.’

Nalty then highlights commonly expressed concerns and provides responses law firm leaders can use to address these points. Below are three such concerns and Nalty’s recommended responses:

We’re a meritocracy here. I’ve pulled myself up by my bootstraps and everyone else should too.

“Research demonstrates that organizations that view themselves as highly meritocratic tend to have members with more bias than organizations that do not. People who believe the firm is meritocratic tend to perceive themselves as unbiased and fair, which causes them to succumb more easily to unconscious biases.”

The D+I costs outweigh their return on investment.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Actually, it costs the firm $ ___,___ every time we lose a good attorney we’d rather keep. Plus, D+I is really about good management skills, so if we start managing all talent better, there shouldn’t be any significant costs.”

I’m not diverse so why do I have to participate?

“Everyone in this organization contributes to the prevailing climate and culture so everyone must be engaged in making our firm more inclusive for everyone, not just a few people. And to the extent you supervise or manage any attorneys in underrepresented groups, you could be part of the problem without even knowing it.”

As you can see, Nalty’s [book](http://kathleennaltyconsulting.com/product/going-all-in-book/) provides unique insights and is a compelling read for anybody championing the diversity and inclusion cause. If you have a few minutes available, be sure to take her consultancy’s [Identifying Hidden Barriers Assessment ](http://kathleennaltyconsulting.com/identifying-hidden-barriers-assessment/)or [Organizational Diversity and Inclusion Assessment](http://kathleennaltyconsulting.com/organizational-diversity-inclusion-assessment/).

And if your firm is implementing any innovative diversity and inclusion initiatives this year, be sure to let us know!

# Biden Wins -- When It Comes To Six-Figure Donations From Biglaw's Leaders
## Which partners helped Biden with huge cash donations?

From doing away with their COVID-19 austerity measures to offering up appreciation bonuses to associates during the pandemic, Biglaw’s leaders have been doing a lot with their wallets lately — and now they’re voting with them, too.

We already knew that some firms [“despise” President Donald Trump](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/turns-out-lawyers-despise-trump-especially-his-own/) — even the one that takes most of his money in legal fees. But now we know that despite his plan to tax their hefty profits, managing partners and chairs from some of Biglaw’s most prestigious firms are showing their six-figure support to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

Which Biglaw leaders have contributed at least $100K to Biden’s campaign?

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2020/11/02/biden-taps-big-law-for-fundraising-haul/) has the details on this extravagant giving during Election 2020:

Paul Weiss chair Brad Karp, Cravath presiding partner Faiza Saeed, DLA co-managing partner Richard Chesley and O’Melveny chair Brad Butwin join a slew of other names from the Am Law 200, the plaintiffs bar and the legal departments of A-list companies in each bundling at least $100,000 for the Democratic nominee.

Other leaders from Big Law include Buckley managing partner Ben Klubes, Wiley Rein managing partner Peter Shields and Cozen O’Connor chairman Steve Cozen.

But that’s not all. Some very prominent partners donated six-figure sums to the former Veep as well, like Sally Yates, the former U.S. deputy attorney general, who’s now a King & Spalding partner (although the firm seems to be working against her when it comes to doing [Trump’s election bidding](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/the-biglaw-firms-doing-trumps-election-bidding/)), and Leo Strine Jr., the former Delaware Supreme Court Chief Justice, who now serves as of counsel at Wachtell.

Some in-house leaders also made the $100K list, with Amazon GC David Zapolsky and Uber CLO Tony West donating top dollars to Biden, too.

# Can Biglaw Associates Be Lured Back To The Office With New Food Options?
## Hungry in your home office? Your Biglaw firm's cafe is calling.

Getting people back into the office is critical. Some believe strongly that food is the driver by which to do that. If you think about what’s going to bring people back, it’s providing experiences that don’t exist at home, whether that’s in technology, in education, mentorship or food service.

— Marty Festenstein, senior managing director at real estate advisory firm Savills, commenting on some of the ways that the leaders of Biglaw firms can [get associates and staff back into the office](https://www.law.com/2022/07/28/the-law-firm-disrupted-if-return-to-office-is-critical-can-food-be-the-driver/). One of those ways, food service, is changing in Biglaw in the pandemic’s wake, with investments in cafe-style spaces Festenstein calls “healthy oriented grab and go’s” that offer things like water, coffee, juices, fresh fruit, salads, and sandwiches. Julian Christe, of Fooda, a company that specializes in ready-to-serve buffet-style options like what Festenstein described, agreed, noting that with Biglaw’s new hybrid work environment, “It’s just not worth it to have a chef sitting there cooking salmon every day where you have a variable population coming into the office.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Chicago-Based Biglaw Giant Gives Raises To All U.S. Associates
## All U.S. offices will be getting a raise!

UPDATE (6/8/16 6:52 p.m.): And not just the U.S. associates. At least the New York-based foreign associates [seem to be getting raises too](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/chicago-based-biglaw-giant-gives-raises-to-all-u-s-associates/2/).

Call them out and they will respond! Just [earlier today](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-bad-news-who-wont-be-matching/), I wondered exactly when Kirkland & Ellis would announce they would match the newly-minted Cravath compensation scale. See there’s been talk, lots of it, that K & E was [going to match](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202759474944?__nored=2), but we just hadn’t seen the memo.

Of course coordinating a pay increase across six U.S. offices must involve a lot of red tape and number crunching, so making an announcement that your firm is matching a little more than two days after the scale was unveiled to the world isn’t bad. They may not have shattered the market, as per [their tradition in the realm of bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-kirkland-ellis-returns-to-shattering-the-bonus-market-ceiling/), but making a quick move to the new market standard shows they are really one of the big dogs. And it should be noted this Chicago-founded Biglaw powerhouse has indeed raised the salary for all associates in their U.S. offices.

You’ll note the Kirkland scale is only set through the class of 2010, while most firms have established raises through the class of 2008 or 2007. This is likely because of Kirkland’s “non-share partners,” a designation they liberally use, bestowing the “partner” title upon lawyers at earlier stages of their careers than at other firms. We, as of yet, have no information about any changes to compensation for K&E’s non-equity partners.

There has been some unease about whether the good fortune for New York associates would also be shared by those in other U.S. offices. Covington & Burling [went out a limb](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/), telling their non-New York associates not to expect a raise, but it looks like the market may be heading another direction. [Winston & Strawn](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/leading-biglaw-firm-raises-salaries-for-all-u-s-associates/), [Weil Gotshal & Manges](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-biglaw-giant-goes-to-180k-for-all-u-s-offices/), [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/), [Irell & Manella](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-west-coast-firm-adopts-the-180k-salary-structure/) and others are all with Kirkland, making it rain outside of the Big Apple.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

[I]f the courts are still closed there’s no real reason for me to create any risk when our people can effectively do their jobs at home. I can have lunch with a plaintiffs lawyer, we can go bowling, get tattoos or get our nails done–but we can’t go to a hearing. As a trial lawyer it’s really frustrating.

— [Scott Masterson](https://lewisbrisbois.com/attorneys/masterson-r.-scott), the managing partner of Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith’s office in Atlanta, Georgia, commenting on the less-than-ideal circumstances surrounding a [possible return to the office](https://www.law.com/2020/05/07/from-masks-to-staggered-staffing-firm-leaders-plan-reopening-but-arent-rushing/) in a state where the governor’s COVID-19 shelter-in-place order was lifted last week, but courts will be closed until June 12.

THE Ohio State University, as they prefer to be called, has commissioned a Biglaw firm to look into its head coach’s handling of domestic abuse allegations against his staff. But what is an internal investigation? What exactly is it going to mean when Mary Jo White gets mentioned on ESPN? Joe and Elie give a quick, high-level rundown on the internal investigation process and Ohio State’s situation. Sorry, I mean “The Ohio State’s situation.”

# Biglaw Associate Billed 277 Hours To Review 20 Documents, Earns 60-Day Suspension To Keep Not Reviewing Documents
## Missing out on a whole 100 documents worth of time!

A [former Dentons associate who billed 277 hours over the course of around three months to review a mere 20 documents](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/biglaw-associate-bills-277-hours-to-review-20-documents-and-im-fascinated-to-know-how-this-happened/) has now received a license suspension. Earlier this week, the [Illinois Supreme Court issued a 60-day suspension](https://www.abajournal.com/files/HallSusp.pdf) (stayed after 30 days, giving way to one year of probation) to attorney David Hall, who admitted to the allegations.

Hall claimed that he intended to eventually perform the work he listed on his timesheets, but never got around to it before the firm realized that he hadn’t opened most of the 425 documents he was tasked with reviewing. He’s since sought treatment for the depression and anxiety that he claims motivated the overbilling, a decision that played a role in the court’s relatively mild penalty and belief that Hall was unlikely to repeat this ethical lapse.

Dentons caught the issue before the client received a bill for non-existent work, though it remains confusing how the firm found itself three months behind on sending out bills. Or how the disconnect between the reported work and the unopened documents took so long to uncover.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It’s not like 425 documents should be taking 277 hours either!

Which is why this story is ultimately less about ethics and more about legal technology. Real-time document review oversight, time tracking, billing software, project management tools… these are all readily available solutions that firms can install that could’ve avoided this flap.

While not every firm has these products — and they should — Dentons almost assuredly does. But software is only as powerful as its adoption. If teams aren’t keeping on top of these tools, then they’re going to be flashing warnings into the ether for months.

# Will Biglaw Firms Get Caught In The Weinstein RICO Lawsuit?
## Which firms could be involved?

As you may have heard, [yesterday a complaint was filed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryanngeorgantopoulos/weinstein-rico-lawsuit) in New York alleging Harvey Weinstein, the Weinstein Co., the company’s board members, Miramax Film Corp., and others violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), acted as the “Weinstein Sexual Enterprise,” and helped “facilitate and conceal” a pattern of sexual assault and harassment. The novel legal theory parallels [another suit filed in California ](https://www.law.com/sites/therecorder/2017/11/15/weinstein-miramax-twc-face-rico-suit-calling-them-the-weinstein-sexual-enterprise/)that similarly alleges the named defendants — which include Bob Weinstein; the Weinstein Company; Miramax TWC board member Tarak Ben Ammar; and former TWC board members Dirk Ziff, Tim Sarnoff, Marc Lasry, Paul Tudor Jones, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg, Jeff Sackman, and James Dolan — and others were part of a criminal conspiracy that allowed the sexual harassment and assault to continue:

Weinstein’s widespread sexual misconduct did not occur without the help of others… Rather, over time, Weinstein enlisted the aid of the Complicit Producers, along with other firms and individuals, to facilitate and conceal his pattern of unwanted sexual conduct.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In addition to Harvey Weinstein’s business partners, the lawsuit also casts aspersions on the law firms — though unnamed — that worked with the “Weinstein Sexual Enterprise”:

“The law firm participants provided cover and shield to the Weinstein participants by contracting with the intelligence participants on behalf of the Weinstein participants and permitting the Weinstein participants to protect evidence of Weinstein’s misconduct under the guise of the attorney-client privilege or the doctrine of attorney work product when that was not the case,” the complaint said. “The law firm participants also approved the intelligence participants’ ‘operational methodologies,’ which were illegal.”

David Boies and his eponymous law firm have already been [dragged through the mud](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-takes-responsibility-for-enabling-harvey-weinstein/) over their involvement with Harvey Weinstein. A [New Yorker article ](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies) named Boies as the person who contracted a private intelligence agency, Black Cube, to dig up personal information about women who may speak out against Weinstein and to squash any news story that may be written about the allegations. Boies Schiller & Flexner has already [lost a client](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/new-york-times-fires-david-boies-over-the-whole-grave-betrayal-thing/) over the [debacle](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/david-boies-loses-more-work-over-weinstein-debacle/), and they now appear to be implicated by this RICO lawsuit. But BSF isn’t the only firm that may be involved in the case; as [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/12/06/rico-class-action-targets-boies-kl-gates-over-weinstein-sexual-enterprise/), there are more firms, though not named in the suit, that may be involved in the alleged scheme:

Although it does not specifically name lawyers or law firms as defendants, Wednesday’s complaint casts the lawyers and law firms surrounding Weinstein—including Boies Schiller, K&L Gates, U.K.-based BCL Burton Copeland, and Israel-based Gross, Kleinhendler, Hodak, Halevy, Greenberg & Co.—as central figures in the alleged scheme to cover up his misconduct. The firms are described as “co-conspirators” along with others that included Weinstein’s business associates and private intelligence firms.

It will be interesting to see if lawyers’ feet are held to the fire for their role in perpetuating the [culture of silence](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/are-lawyers-perpetuating-a-culture-of-silence-surrounding-sexual-assault/) around sexual assault.

UPDATE: A spokesperson for K&L Gates provided the below statement:

We are aware of the lawsuits filed against Harvey Weinstein and others that mention K&L Gates. K&L Gates is not named as a defendant in the lawsuits but the suits attempt to claim that the firm was involved in a scheme to facilitate or cover up Mr. Weinstein’s activities. The claims relating to K&L Gates are false. K&L Gates has never represented Mr. Weinstein or any other person or entity concerning investigations or inquiries relating to Mr. Weinstein.

# More Biglaw And Boutique Firms Add Vaccination Requirements For Employees To Return To Office
## Proof of vaccination will soon be mandated at many firms. Will yours be one of them?

As the Delta variant of COVID-19 continues to rapidly spread among the unvaccinated, hospitals are preparing for another surge in patients and cases. Throughout it all, law firms across the country are reconsidering their reopenings, and more and more are mandating vaccines for employees to return to the office.

Thus far, the firms that have made vaccination a requirement for those returning to the office include [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/top-20-biglaw-firm-wont-make-lawyers-return-to-office-in-2021-but-vaccines-will-be-required/), [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/), [Davis Wright Tremaine](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-announce-a-covid-19-vaccination-plan/), [Lowenstein Sandler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/lowenstein-covid-vaccine/), [Mintz](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/unvaccinated-lawyers-will-not-be-allowed-to-enter-this-biglaw-firm/), [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/paul-weiss-vaccine/), [Sanford Heisler](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/this-firm-will-require-lawyers-staff-to-be-vaccinated-before-returning-to-work-or-else/), and [Weil Gotshal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/weil-reopening/). Now, we can add another three five firms to the list. Fenwick & West, Hanson Bridgett, and Hueston Hennigan all recently added vaccination mandates to their safety protocols.

As reported in [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/07/28/california-firms-reassess-return-to-work-many-with-vaccine-mask-requirements/), Fenwick & West managing partner Rodger Cole noted that his firm has implemented a vaccine mandate as part of its health and safety procedures during its soft opening. “We have already opened our offices in a limited capacity to firm personnel only, and we require all personnel to be vaccinated before coming into our offices,” he said. The firm will “continue to provide wide latitude and flexibility for remote work” through the end of 2021.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Hanson Bridgett introduced its vaccine mandate last week, with managing partner Kristina Lawson explaining in a firmwide memo that the new policy would apply “for anyone working in or visiting any of Hanson Bridgett’s five physical office locations or attending a firm-sponsored event at other locations.” The firm will provide paid time off for employees to get vaccinated. Ninety-three percent of its personnel are already fully vaccinated.

Employees were encouraged to return to Hueston Hennigan on a voluntary basis starting on June 15, with one requirement: vaccination, with proof. The firm had been planning a full return to the office after Labor Day, but the new surge of COVID infections has made management start to rethink things. “With the current variant and guidance on wearing masks, it’s changed the circumstances. We’re paying close attention,” said managing partner Brian Hennigan.

UPDATE: Hogan Lovells and Dickinson Wright have also [recently added vaccine requirements](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/29/more-law-firms-get-aggressive-on-vaccine-mandates-while-re-evaluating-office-returns/) to their reopening plans. Only fully vaccinated employees at Hogan Lovells may return to the office prior to September 13. Thereafter, the firm will assess whether vaccinations will still be required for entry. Dickinson Wright has informed all employees that they must be vaccinated in order to come into any of the firm’s 19 offices, and the policy will also apply to all firm events.

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine.

Have you ever noticed that there are two ways of reading things?

You can really read things.

You’re primarily responsible for having prepared the brief. The opposition brief arrives. You read it.

You really read it.

You take out a knife and fork, and you go through the thing. You think hard about every argument; you consider ways in which the other side has cheated; you plot out what your responsive arguments will be.

You have a visceral reaction to every word that you read: “How could the lying bastards have said that? That completely misrepresents the law; Smith holds exactly the opposite! I’m gonna kill ’em!”

In short, you read the thing as though you care.

And then there’s reading for the purpose of having passed your eyes over something.

A brief is going out the door on something you don’t really care about. You’re not primarily responsible for defending the case. Maybe you’re just obligated to look at the arguments that one of your co-defendants is making, to be generally aware of what’s happening in the case.

You read the brief.

But you don’t really read it.

It’s more like flipping through the pages for no particular reason; you did what was required.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
There’s reading, and then there’s reading. They’re two different things.

Sometimes, you can do the weak kind of reading and be shamed into going back and doing the strong kind: You flip through a brief and are about to type that it’s good to go. And then a smart person, who read aggressively, sends around an email noting two substantive points that the brief should make, and making several worthwhile stylistic improvements, and noting a typo or two along the way.

You’re embarrassed: “If the other guy had real comments, I can’t just say the brief is okay.”

So now you go back and really read the brief. As though it matters. And darned if you don’t find some ways in which the draft can be improved.

I’m not saying that you should read everything as though you really care.

There are some things that you actually don’t care about. And some things that don’t justify the effort. And reading aggressively is pretty hard and tiring; you can’t put that much effort into every document you pick up.

But at least be aware of the difference between passing your eyes over something and really reading the same thing.

And, at least early in your career, read many things aggressively.

If something matters, then act like it does. Step away from your computer. Put away your iPhone. Eliminate distractions. Go to a quiet space and pore over what you’re reading.

Average associates skim through briefs and say they look good.

Exceptional associates read things as though they matter, and send back intelligent comments on what they’ve read.

Partners notice.

# Biglaw Isn't A Cancel Culture, It's A Business That Cares More About Money Than Your Feelings
## If love means never having to say you're sorry, then surely 'cancel culture' means never having to take responsibility.

Yesterday, the Boston Globe published a piece by Above the Law alum David Lat lamenting “cancel culture” and advancing the claim: “[Simply put, Big Law… is currently seized by ideological intolerance and groupthink](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/01/30/opinion/big-laws-cancel-culture/).”

Simply put, it is not.

That said, the piece succeeds — perhaps unintentionally — as an exploration of “cancel culture” as a touchstone of modern American life. As a pithy, alliterative slogan, “cancel culture” always tickles a search engine, but it also offers people a comforting and quotable deflection from the terror of confronting their own accountability. Lost a job, a friend, a family member… it’s not you, it’s them. Them and their pesky “cancel culture.”

And Lat’s article cites some of these maligned and silenced cancel culture victims — who were coincidentally offered space in the Wall Street Journal to publish their stories — to back up his central thesis. Yet, upon further review, the narratives he’s relying on elide critical details, as one might expect from self-serving accounts, undermining the vast left-wing conspiracy out to get these whiny attorneys. The Lat article opens by recounting Paul Clement and Erin Murphy leaving Kirkland & Ellis in the immediate aftermath of winning the Bruen case:

You might have expected the lawyers who won the case, celebrated Supreme Court litigators Paul Clement and Erin Murphy, to receive congratulations within their firm for such a major victory.

Instead, they received walking papers. That afternoon, [Clement and Murphy announced in The Wall Street Journal that they were leaving Kirkland & Ellis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/2nd-amendment-bruen-new-york-gun-case-supreme-court-decision-kirkland-and-ellis-rule-of-law-constitution-11656017031), the nation’s highest-grossing law firm. Why? Because Kirkland presented them with an ultimatum: withdraw from representing clients in Second Amendment cases, including existing clients in ongoing representations, or withdraw from the firm.

This rests on the shaky assumption that a multibillion-dollar business should prefer winning one Supreme Court case to, you know, making multiple billions of dollars.

Clement and Murphy worked hard to secure a very public Supreme Court victory. In the process, Clement and Murphy tied the firm’s name to a deluge of press coverage about the helping hand Kirkland offered to the next spate of school shooters. While this likely didn’t sit well with all of Kirkland’s partners, it also wasn’t going to sit well with Kirkland’s current and future clients. Somehow the role that clients might play in a service industry didn’t make it into this version of the story.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Because there was an ultimatum involved here: risk millions upon millions in future deals or ditch a high (though negative) publicity passion project?

As one might imagine, [Kirkland & Ellis chose the money](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/paul-clement-laments-kirklands-cancel-culture-or-capitalism-as-the-case-may-be/).

Just like [King & Spalding chose the money](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/) when Clement left there in a huff after that firm realized its client base wasn’t psyched to be working with the firm fighting against marriage equality in 21st century.

It’s not just representing unpopular clients; even articulating an unpopular opinion might be a fireable offense today in the world of large law firms (aka “Big Law”). Take support for the [Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf) and sent abortion back to the states. At least two antiabortion women partners allege — one in [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-dissent-allowed-at-hogan-lovells-abortion-dobbs-roe-v-wade-meeting-safe-space-forum-genocide-lawyers-outrage-11669753147?st=ckfh5c4ogxq40z4&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) and one in [Original Jurisdiction](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/biglaws-latest-cancel-culture-controversy), my newsletter about the legal profession — that their support for Dobbs played a major role in their being forced out of their firms.

This glosses over a bit. Hogan Lovells [parted ways with Robin Keller](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/white-partner-at-biglaw-firm-spreads-inappropriate-and-offensive-theories-about-abortion-with-seemingly-no-consequences/) after she started hammering the racist “Black genocide” trope, recasting abortion as the “fault” of Black women. Which is, you know, a bit more of a hostile workplace problem than a “support for Dobbs” problem.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Before closing out, Yale earns an aside:

This fall, Yale Law School, which had [significant problems](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/an-open-letter-to-yale-law-dean-heather) last year relating to [free speech](https://davidlat.substack.com/p/is-free-speech-in-american-law-schools), redesigned its [orientation](https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/message-our-alumni-free-speech-yale-law-school) for new students “to center around discussions of free expression and the importance of respectful engagement.” Perhaps law firms should follow suit.

Except… [it didn’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/yale-law-school-free-speech/). Popular right-wing accounts breathlessly claimed Yale Law students “shouted down” a speaker and bemoaned the death of free speech on campus. Federal judges cynically seized on it to [boost their own sagging profiles](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/james-ho-cancel-cultures-yale-law-fedsoc-because-other-students-are-mean-to-yale-law-fedsoc-students/). Yet, after the first two disruptions — provided for by then-existing rules to avoid silencing the speech rights of dissenters — the event ultimately continued as scheduled.

But back to the law firm world…

As the majority within Big Law, left-leaning lawyers might be perfectly happy to enjoy dominating their workplaces. But they should keep in mind that beyond Big Law, a “majority rules” approach to free speech can lead to terrible outcomes, including bans on everything from teaching critical race theory to the novels of Toni Morrison.

The conservatives behind these bans share the same reasoning as progressives in Big Law: If something offends us, it must be cast out.

How would you like some apples with those oranges? The First Amendment only applies to government and not private interference — which Lat acknowledges elsewhere in the article — but “cancel culture” discourse consistently ignores that this is a feature and not a bug. One the most compelling justifications for protecting speech from government action is that it keeps the state from tilting the scales as democratic societies grapple with ideas. But for this process to work, private actors being able to cast out bad ideas is just as important as keeping the government out of the process. Imposing a moral duty on private actors to passively accept every opinion they encounter collapses this free marketplace of ideas.

So, no, the idea that a company cannot fire someone making racist remarks or else they’re just as bad as the state of Florida going “don’t say gay” does not track.

But this passage is also where all those omissions from the earlier examples add up. What happened to these lawyers is not about a shadowy cabal of leftists “dominating their workplaces,” it’s about making money. Clement and Murphy did not fit into Kirkland’s business strategy. That a former solicitor general opened his own firm rather than find another welcoming Biglaw home is a pretty good indication that no one else wanted to touch his client-repelling advocacy either. Robin Keller didn’t support Dobbs, she made racist remarks that jeopardized the firm’s relationship with its talent and — not for nothing — raised concerns that she might alienate clients with more loose cannon behavior.

Here’s the thing: none of these folks became fire-breathing conservatives overnight. For years, Biglaw firms smiled and nodded as these lawyers went about their business.

Then these folks each got between a firm and its money.

Because the Am Law 100 is seized by groupthink and that groupthink is “we need to keep making enough money to stay in the Am Law 100.”

# 'Small Enough To Jail' Looks At The Only Bank Prosecuted Over The Housing Crisis
## PBS is looking back at one of the most bizarre prosecutions of the past decade.

The very first day I joined the full-time staff at Above the Law, I wrote a story about the Manhattan DA’s [decision to prosecute Abacus](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/02/which-bank-deserves-criminal-prosecution-the-smallest-one-obviously/), a small, family-run bank serving New York’s Chinese immigrant community. We’d hear all about how this tiny bank’s actions were “emblematic” of the fraud that triggered the housing crisis. But while “emblematic” usually means something is a perfect example of broader behavior, we know from experience that prosecutors across the country weren’t willing to take that statement to its logical conclusion. As it turned out, Abacus — the only bank to face criminal charges arising out of the housing crisis — became an emblem of a lack of prosecutorial will.

As it turned out, Abacus was [acquitted on all charges](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-abascus-federal-acquittal-idUSKBN0OK21620150604). As its attorney, Kevin Puvalowski, put it at the time, “right case, wrong bank.” While banks were bundling terrible mortgages together and pawning them off as well-rated gold, Abacus sold mortgages people were still paying off every month. Abacus even boasted one of the lowest default rates in the country.

Tonight, Frontline will air [Abacus: Small Enough To Jail](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/abacus/), an in-depth look at the Abacus prosecution from Hoop Dreams director Steve James. The film airs on PBS at 10 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Pacific and will be [available for livestreaming here](http://to.pbs.org/2vZjfiq). I’ll be live tweeting the film tonight as well (along with others using the hashtag #frontlinePBS) if you want to follow along. I’m @JosephPatrice if you aren’t already following me.

# How Many Hours Do You Bill For Valentine's Day?

Eww… gross.

Don’t act like you can’t answer this question. Lawyers bill themselves down to six minute increments. You all damn straight know how many hours you’ve spent thinking, planning, and doing stuff for Valentine’s Day. If Saint Valentine was in-house counsel for Trojan, you’d be able to write out the invoice without talking to your assistant.

So how many hours did you spend trying to convince another person that you love them? How much time did you spend online at ProFlowers or Build-A-Bear or Victoria’s Secret? Or checking out the hourly rates at the hotel in Midtown that you use?

Here’s another metric: how much time are you going to spend today covering for somebody else who actually has plans this evening? If you let your newlywed colleague skip out to dinner while your lonely ass holds down the fort, that counts too!

Lawyers are not known as a romantic profession, but we know they put in the work. How many hours did you eat in the name of love?

# The Nuclear Age: The Supreme Court May Never Be The Same

The “nuclear” moniker is unfair. It’s more… landscape altering eruption.

Conservatives across the country are overjoyed at the demise of the filibuster, that last refuge of the scoundrel Democrats who tried to block Judge Gorsuch’s triumphant ascent to the Supreme Court. Liberals, meanwhile, are seething at the final act of villainy — literally changing the rules of the game — in a theft that began when Republicans historically refused to perform their constitutional duty and consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland.

Whatever. It’s happened. Frankly, we’ll be lucky if this is the [worst occasion we have to use the word “nuclear”](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/what-would-happen-in-the-minutes-and-hours-after-the-us-attacked-north-korea) before this presidency ends.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Way back in 2013, when liberals were overjoyed at the partial demise of the filibuster and conservatives saw it as villainy (oh, how the times have changed), I warned that Harry Reid’s mealy mouthed half-measure [may not prevent this day](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/11/and-boom-goes-the-nuclear-dynamite-previewing-the-derptastic-sound-bytes-youre-about-to-hear/), but would certainly provide Mitch McConnell all the political cover he could ever need to blow it up forever. Personally, I didn’t think we’d be here today. I thought the Democrats would find a way to “Alito” him — [pass cloture and then vote against confirmation](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/the-only-gorsuch-surprise-is-that-anyone-still-expects-a-surprise/). On the other hand, some thought Democrats had [no choice but to trigger this moment](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/republicans-can-bust-the-gorsuch-filibuster-but-can-they-take-what-happens-next/).

But what happens to the future of the Court now that we’re here? Elie Mystal thinks we’re staring at a Democratic court-packing plan once the shoe’s on the other foot. He’s wrong, of course, because if there’s any political will for court-packing, we’ll see it before 2018. Why wouldn’t the GOP gather those rosebuds while they may? Trump’s poll numbers suggest the waning hours of the present congress may present the GOP’s William Marbury moment.

But assuming such a radical move isn’t in the offing, what else might result from the death of the 60-vote threshold?

Nominees to the Court will become more wildly partisan: It’s hard to say this wasn’t already happening, at least on one side. Haynsworth? Carswell? Bork? Remember that from 1969 on, people like Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas were the relative consensus picks. In retrospect, Samuel Alito’s curious confirmation process, where he received fewer than 60 votes despite surviving cloture, probably marked the last stand for the filibuster. We should have seen that conservatives would continue pushing the envelope and Democrats were growing increasingly uneasy.

Democrats, on the other hand, have generally hewed to nominating moderates — it’s telling that many of the core “liberal” votes on the Court over the past twenty years came from Republicans like Justices Stevens and Souter, with occasional assists from Justices O’Connor and Kennedy — and the gloves may well be off now. Generally speaking, Democrats are better off as the “adults in the room” because it’s hard to sell America on the principle that government is good when you’re rolling in the same mud. But if 51 votes is the new normal, there’s no reason not to introduce more judicial philosophies. Introduce some of that “[viewpoint diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/conservative-profs-want-viewpoint-diversity-which-is-kinda-racist/)” to the Court by nominating a noted critical legal studies or critical race scholar.

Senate campaigns will focus much more on the Supreme Court: Nope. This is just the wishful thinking of a legal nerd. If Hillary Clinton couldn’t win by making her election about the Grim Reaper hovering over Ginsburg, Breyer, and Kennedy in last year’s SCOTUS portrait, then Nevada’s not going to choose a Senator over it. Plus, the Nevada election might feature more substance than “[please don’t say mean things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrX3Ql31URA).” That said, this split-ticket voting might lose its luster for a sliver of well-informed voters as they start to realize that divided government will make the ordeal of Merrick Garland’s nomination a routine occurrence.

Democrats will start getting serious about term limits: With the entry barrier to the Supreme Court at rock bottom, people may get creative about stanching the harm of a potential 32-year-old crazy person reaching the bench. Most people think putting limits on the Supreme Court would require a constitutional amendment, but in [Uncertain Justice](http://amzn.to/2p63cuO) (affiliate link) Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz suggest that imposing 18-year limits would require simple congressional action to satisfy the constitutional stricture of life tenure without demotion. The Tribe and Matz suggestion creates something akin to senior status, whereby only the judges within their 18-year term would sit on the active SCOTUS panel, while older judges would ride circuit and continue to serve on the Court in the event of recusal (which is another advantage… the Supreme Court could have real recusal standards). [Ted Cruz is already on the record for term limits](https://newrepublic.com/article/122225/ted-cruz-right-supreme-court-needs-term-limits), but now that Democrats realize they can no longer depend on their “Blue Wall” to maintain the White House, Cruz might get some bipartisan support.

Whatever happens, the Supreme Court will change. And, to borrow from my colleagues earlier title, it’s not clear anyone is ready for what’s going to happen next.

We had it coming/We had it coming/We only have ourselves to blame/We tried to fix it/Instead we nixed it!/We helped Dewey go down in flames.

— Michael McMahan, an associate at Arent Fox, who wrote the lyrics to “Cooperator Tango,” a parody set to the tune of “Cellblock Tango” from Chicago. The number is part of a [satirical musical performance, for CLE credit](https://bol.bna.com/the-dewey-leboeuf-case-manhattans-latest-musical-satire/), natch, set to take place at the offices of Debovoise & Plimpton this Wednesday. The show tells the fictionalized tale of Dewey Cheatem and Howe LLP and its merger with Beef, Mutton & Suet P.C., to form Dewey Suet.

# Biglaw Firm's Decision To Cover Abortion-Related Travel Expenses Didn't Please All Partners -- But The Firm Never Wavered
## The firm's leader knew he couldn't make everyone happy, but he did what he thought was 'right.'

I had a lot of partners sen[t] me emails that said thank you. I had a lot of partners that sent me emails that said that’s inappropriate.

We did what we thought was right. [The way politics affects operations is] one of the hardest issues that law firm leaders, probably business leaders in general, are facing today.

There are people on both sides of every issue—whether it’s gun control, abortion, Saudi Arabia. You’re never going to be able to please everybody.

— [Michael Heller](https://www.cozen.com/people/bios/heller-michael), executive chairman and chief executive office of Cozen O’Connor, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/culture-wars-catch-big-law-firms-balancing-client-staff-demands), concerning the firm’s decision to pay for abortion-related travel expenses after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Heller said that his firm needs to balance constitutional rights against the need “to look ourselves in the mirror. We err on the side of trying to do what we think is right.” Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/which-biglaw-firms-will-cover-travel-expenses-for-employees-who-can-no-longer-access-abortion-care/) to see which Biglaw firms are reimbursing for abortion-related travel expenses.

# From Biglaw Partner To Big Law Author: An Interview With Ron Liebman
## What advice does he have to offer to both aspiring attorneys and authors?

If you’re looking for something to read that’s not a motion for summary judgment or a trust indenture, allow me to recommend [Big Law](http://amzn.to/2jbsM2p), the latest novel from attorney turned author [Ron Liebman](http://ronliebman.com/). It’s a fun and fast-paced read — I finished it in a day — and it contains insights about the world of large law firms that will make you laugh or cry, depending on your mood and circumstances.

I recently caught up with Ron Liebman to ask about the book, his impressive career in both law and literature, and his advice for aspiring authors and attorneys. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

DL: Although you take [some poetic license](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/standard-of-review-a-notable-new-novel-about-biglaw/?rf=1) here and there, Big Law is in many ways an accurate depiction of life at a large law firm — which makes sense, given your familiarity with this setting. You’ve had a very interesting and wide-ranging career in the law. Can you give us an overview of your experience in the legal profession?

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
RL: After law school I clerked for a federal judge, then spent a year as an associate in a Baltimore law firm, then became an assistant U.S. attorney, where I was on the team that prosecuted Vice President Spiro Agnew and Maryland Governor Marvin Mandel. I then spent a short time in a Washington, D.C. boutique litigation law firm before becoming a partner at Patton Boggs (26 years), then spent eight months at Dewey & LeBoeuf before escaping. Dewey & LeBoeuf imploded four years later.

DL: The firm depicted in your novel, Dunn & Sullivan, is not a particularly fun place to work. But it’s also realistic, in terms of the long hours and internal politics. I suspect some readers will want to know: did you use any particular law firm — perhaps one of your former professional homes — as a model for D&S?

RL: No. Having spent years observing law firms, my own and those that were my co-counsel or opposing counsel, I created D&S from a little bit here, a little bit there. It’s a stew with a dash of fictional salt.

DL: Fair enough. Speaking for myself, I do see echoes of your two former firms in D&S. The financial shenanigans are Dewey-esque, while the idea of a law firm getting dragged into a mass-torts case occurring overseas and possibly tainted by corruption made me think of Patton Boggs and the [Chevron/Ecuador mess](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/an-18-billion-legal-battle-rages-on/). Any comment you can offer on that, and the role it might have played in the demise of Patton Boggs?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
RL: As I said, I used bits and pieces from here and there. I was long gone from Dewey when I — like everyone else — read the allegations about Dewey’s financial “behavior,” and gone from Patton Boggs before the Chevron debacle [hit them](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/05/patton-boggs-raises-the-white-flag-in-the-chevron-battle-agreeing-to-an-eight-figure-settlement/). That horrible mess of a case hurt them badly. I still have great fondness for PB and was saddened to watch as the firm started sinking in a sea of red ink. Luckily for those who didn’t abandon ship, Squire Sanders [threw them a lifeline](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/08/patton-boggs-managing-partner-comes-clean-on-why-merger-was-necessary/).

DL: Some folks who work in Biglaw might find a large law firm to be a surprising setting for a gripping page-turner like your novel. How did you decide to situate your story in a big firm?

RL: First, thank you. I’m glad you enjoyed the book. Biglaw is a world I know, a wonderful world filled with brains, ambition, egos (some Trump-like massive), intrigue, and so on. I thought it was tailor-made for a novel. I was also interested in how during my years in Biglaw, it remained a profession but began adopting behavior patterns more often associated with the business world. As with so much of business, the bottom line took top priority.


Ron Liebman

DL: The world of Biglaw has definitely become more bottom-line oriented. [Partner profits](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) and [associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) are high, but so are billable hours and stress, as Big Law makes clear. If a young law student at a top law school came to you for advice and asked whether she should go to a large law firm after graduation, what would you tell her?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
RL: Great question. Biglaw will provide first-class training, whether you ultimately make partner or not; you will be working on very interesting cases, sometimes with cutting-edge legal issues; you’ll be in the company of some of the finest legal minds; and so on. But the pain — here cue the theme music from The Devil’s Advocate film — the pain is undeniable. There will be considerable stress. Much of your life as an associate won’t be your own because you’ll be at work with heavy doses of midnight oil, lost weekends and holidays. If you feel like you will be selling your soul to you know whom, don’t do it. Otherwise, sign up. It will make you a better lawyer.

DL: So Big Law is by no means your first book. You co-edited the legal treatise [Testimonial Privileges](https://books.google.com/books/about/Testimonial_privileges.html?id=K7JGAQAAIAAJ); wrote three other novels ([Grand Jury](http://amzn.to/2kzBJko), [Death by Rodrigo](http://amzn.to/2jUbmbK), and [Jersey Law](http://amzn.to/2kKjfzD)); and also authored a work of non-fiction, [Shark Tales—True and Amazing Stories from America’s Lawyers](http://amzn.to/2kzlaF9) (affiliate links). What’s the next project on your plate?

RL: I’m considering a sequel to Big Law. Without disclosing the new plot, I’m toying with a David-and-Goliath theme involving some, though not all, of Big Law’s characters.

DL: Your career, both as a lawyer and writer, is enviable. What advice would you give to lawyers who would also like to write creatively?

RL: Go for it, but keep your daytime job.

DL: Wise words. Congratulations again on Big Law, and thanks for taking the time to talk!

“Sorry baby, I work for Cooley”

The hits just keep on coming for those attorneys who still dream of squeezing a personal life into their 2500-hour year. No sooner do we learn that yet another woman has joined the [multimillion-dollar suit against MoFo](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/pregnancy-discrimination-lawsuit-against-mofo-spirals-and-gets-yet-another-plaintiff/) alleging systemic discrimination against young mothers trying to raise a family while lawyering, do we have an unfortunate screencap from the ranks of Biglaw.

The good folks at Cooley LLP are giving their associates a preview of life in Brett Kavanaugh’s America:

Look, content filtering is a clumsy business and no doubt a stupid algorithm buried within the Cooley LLP systems just saw the word “sex” somewhere on the Planned Parenthood website and decided to block it. Why a law firm of purported professionals would be content blocking anything other than security risks is a whole other question, but the point is, it’s unlikely that someone in Cooley management thought it was high time to crack down on pap smears.

UPDATE: A tipster points out that “PlannedParenthood.com” is just a redirect to “PlannedParenthood.org” and that Cooley’s set up may block redirects. That’s certainly a possibility too.

Nonetheless, it’s not the best look for a firm that just revised its bonus policy to throw [another hurdle in the path of new parents](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/cooley-llps-new-bonus-policy-totally-screws-new-parents/), announcing that it would no longer credit maternity leave for the purpose of bonuses — despite simultaneously reporting record profits. And while there will be contrarians suggesting that attorneys need to be handling these matters on their own time, this overlooks the fact that modern Biglaw takes so much time out of their attorneys that basic errands like scheduling doctor’s appointments during reasonable hours require doing some personal tasks while at the office. Cooley has offered a “[snooze or cruise](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/atl-march-madness-which-perk-do-you-want-from-your-firm/)” perk to allow associates to arrive late or leave early, but that’s hardly a replacement for being able to schedule one’s real life during a 10-minute break in the day.

Come on, Cooley, [we thought you were cool](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/03/which-law-firms-are-considered-some-of-the-best-companies-to-work-for/).

Hopefully, Cooley will take this opportunity to do a little editing of their content blocking rules, but to be honest they’ll probably never see this article because if they’ve blocked Planned Parenthood, I can only imagine what klaxons sound if someone tries to read Above the Law.

# Stats Of The Week: NYC Rules Am Law Rankings
## Further evidence that elite Wall Street firms are operating by different economic rules than the rest of the legal industry.

In any other industry, it might be considered bizarre to define “success” on how well management is compensated. Nevertheless, the 2017 [Am Law 100](http://www.americanlawyer.com/home/id=1202784597030/The-2017-Am-Law-100?mcode=1202617075486&curindex=1) came out yesterday. (Earlier, David Lat [spared you the trouble](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/?rf=1) of having to read it yourself.)

One interesting — in a “[View From Ninth Avenue](http://brilliantmaps.com/new-yorkers-world/)” sort of way — detail about the Am Law lists is the placement of New York firms. Of course, Am Law no longer includes an “HQ” column on its chart of firms, bowing to most large firms’ pointed self-definitions as “global” (e.g., try to find the word “Cleveland” [here](http://www.jonesday.com/home.aspx)). But a quick glance at the top of the three signature Am Law lists show a marked geographical pattern and further evidence that elite Wall Street firms are operating by different economic rules than everyone else:

Number of firms founded in NYC in Am Law’s top 10 by [Gross Revenues](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784616627): 1
Number in the Am Law top 10 by [Profits Per Partner](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784617547): 8
Number on Am Law’s “[Super Rich](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784497908)” list: 15 (out of 20)

# Power Niche Marketing: If You Want to Get Rich, Own A Power Niche

My whole column is about [Power Niche Marketing](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/power-niche-marketing/) – but this article is the “big” article – it is about how you can “own” a Power Niche.

By the way, I have written a manuscript on this subject – hopefully for publication later this year. Does anyone know a literary agent for me?  Yes – that is a serious question.

In any case, in my first article of this Power Niche Marketing column, I explained the essence of a Power Niche and the importance of developing one if you want to have a successful career.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As a reminder, for it to be what I call a “Power” Niche, as opposed to just a plain old niche, you have really be top dog in that niche.

In order to truly own a niche, you need several characteristics that are important:

First – the niche should be an area in which you already have some expertise and should be in the industry you are already working. However, I will admit that this isn’t 100% needed, as you can decide to acquire the expertise, and change jobs and even industries, if the job or industry you are in just isn’t that robust. Then you would be starting from scratch, which is very tough and fraught with the risk that you will find out, after investing a lot of time, that you have hit a dead end. Without belaboring this, I suggest we presume that you are picking a niche in the industry in which you are already working and have a least a modicum of expertise.

Second – it needs to be something that no one else already owns. If you think about what this means, it typically means something that no one has thought of yet. As a quick example, if you are selling houses, perhaps you say that you are a real expert in selling houses for people who have a physical or mental handicap, as you have an understanding of the special requirements and needs.

As an aside, it is not 100% necessary that you be the sole player in a Power Niche, as sometimes there could be room for two people in a niche. In that situation, your power would be somewhat diminished, but depending on the niche and the circumstances you might be okay.

Third – it should be something pretty small so that you can become the dominant force within it. But of course it can’t be so small that it is useless.  This is a judgment call, of course.

Fourth – it should be something for which you can hold yourself out as the world’s greatest expert, perhaps by becoming a thought leader, writing (super short) articles, webinars, even mass-mailings and whatever else you can think of.

In the law business, the Power Niche is by far the most powerful technique. Let me give you a perfect example of the power in a Power Niche.

I will talk about my firm’s litigation practice. I have ten litigators, and the practice is led by a really talented superstar lawyer. He hails from one of the most prestigious law firms (Cravath, Swaine & Moore) and one of the most prestigious law schools (Harvard Law School), and he is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York City. This guy is “the real deal” in litigation! And he has nine partners and associates to boot, so we have a ten-lawyer litigation department led by my talented partner.  Pretty good, huh?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Not so fast. There is another law firm that I have a lot of respect for.  It is a global mega law firm with a powerhouse brand. I have a good friend there, and we had lunch last year. He told me they have 750 litigators. Yikes – that is a lot of litigators!

Using my math major, I calculate that we are down 75 to 1. How could I possibly “compete” with this firm in litigation?

To avoid this competition that I don’t really have a hope of winning, I use the power in my Power Niche. As you recall, I have branded my firm as The Pure Play in Real Estate Law, thereby trying to establish ownership of this niche as much as possible. The global firm I mentioned has a real estate practice and a really good one too; however, whether they like it or not, they are known for being one of the top litigation firms in the world. That is what they are and that is their Power Niche. And we are known for being one of the top real estate law practices in the world.  That is what we are.

So, if the litigation at hand is just general litigation, then unless price is a consideration, which it often is whether I like it or not, the client will likely go with the other law firm. But what if it is real estate litigation? Could I maybe say something like the following?

Well Mr. Client, I can’t say we are comparable to [the other firm] in general litigation. They are just much bigger than we are. However, if you are talking about real estate litigation, it is a much different story. We are the largest real estate law practice in New York City – dramatically bigger than [the other firm’s] real estate group. We have a zillion real estate clients – including a Who’s Who of blue chip institutions doing billion dollar deals — and we know everything about the real estate world from all angles of the capital stack. Our vaunted real estate group often works with our litigators, thinking up unusual and creative legal angles and advising on how to obtain advantage. If this were just a general litigation matter, well maybe [the other firm] is a logical choice. But this is real estate litigation, and no one is better than we are here!

So, what do you think? Believable? Maybe yes – maybe no – but it is a lot better than my alternative, which is only to say that “we are smaller and cheaper.”

Sticking with the legal world for a moment, it is interesting if you look at the statistics. If so, you will see that a fair number of the most profitable law firms in the world – especially the ones that rose to prominence in recent years – are largely pure plays.

So if you want to get rich, own a Power Niche!

# A Whole Mess Of Raises Around The Country
## More raises, but some offices received considerably less than others.

In a memo sent this afternoon by Managing Partner [Stephen E. Lewis](http://www.troutmansanders.com/stephen_lewis/), Troutman Sanders put an end to the nervous speculation of its associates by announcing — tentatively — that everyone’s getting some kind of a raise in September.

Apparently, the firm holds an “Associates Retreat” in August, and the firm is holding off on specifics until after that. I guess they don’t want to throw a party with a bunch of unhappy guests? In any event, the firm was willing to announce what the first-years will be getting all over the country and then leave everyone else in the air with the commitment that sometime after the retreat they “will make appropriate adjustments to our existing associates’ compensation.”

Not exactly inspiring, but better than nothing.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Troutman is making 4 tiers of first-year salaries depending on the office. If you’re in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, San Diego, Orange County, Tysons Corner, or Washington D.C., then congratulations! You’ll be on a $180K scale.

Associates in Atlanta, Charlotte, Richmond, and Raleigh, will be joining the $155K Club. Virginia Beach associates move to $135K, and poor old Portland gets $125K.

(Check out the full memo on the next page.)

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Disbarred Attorney Uses Fake ID To Score Better Job Than You
## He's been arrested for the scheme.

Well, not necessarily a *better* job than you, but he pulled down some elite jobs. You have to admire the number of six-figure attorney jobs this guy was able to secure *after* being disbarred. He must be a helluva interview.

Richard Louis Crosby III was [arrested](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdoh/pr/disbarred-attorney-arrested-charges-related-using-false-identity-obtain-jobs-law-firms) on charges of wire fraud, Social Security number fraud, and aggravated identity theft for his bold scheme of trying to work more legal jobs. Crosby resigned his Ohio bar membership in September 2021, after he was indicted for stealing client funds. He pleaded guilty to that charge and was sentenced to probation.

Those facts — as bad as they are for him — didn’t deter Crosby from trying to practice law. Using the name Richard Williams and claiming he was licensed in New York and Washington, D.C., Crosby was “briefly employed” by a Washington D.C. firm in 2021.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But that wasn’t the only time he attempted to work, as [reported by ](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former-lawyer-is-accused-of-using-fake-ids-to-find-well-paid-law-firm-jobs)the ABA Journal:

In October 2022, Crosby was offered a job with starting pay of $185,000 with a $5,000 signing bonus at a Miami law firm. He allegedly used a former romantic partner’s Social Security number, passport number and name for the bank account he listed in the onboarding process. He was fired in April, however, after the law firm received an inquiry from a child support investigator who made the firm aware of his real identity. Crosby earned about $83,000 before his firing, the affidavit said.

Crosby allegedly used the same alias in July for an interview with a law firm in Coral Gables, Florida. During the hiring process, he allegedly sent an email attachment that was supposedly a screenshot of the name Richard Coleman Williams Jr. in the District of Columbia online bar membership directory. There is no one by the name of Richard Coleman Williams in the directory, but there is a Richard Coleman, the affidavit says. Crosby apparently altered the screen shot to add the name “Williams,” according to the affidavit.

Crosby was offered a salary of $195,000 and a $10,000 signing bonus, but the law firm didn’t hire him after determining he was using a fake identity, according to prosecutors.

That’s an awful lot of effort for a scheme that seems certain to come unraveled. Perhaps in the bygone analog days you could pull something like this off for an extended amount of time, but in 2023, it seems destined to fail.

Despite the fact that a pandemic raged throughout 2021, all signs point to it being an excellent year in Biglaw. In fact, the biggest problem for firms seems to be making sure they have enough talent to handle all the work they’re getting. Towards that end, making sure associates are well compensated is a priority for firms. So, yes, associate compensation has been bonkers this year, with raises running through the industry.

The latest firm to announce raises is Foley Hoag, ranked 136th on the Am Law 200, with $232,079,000 in 2020 gross revenue. Like so many other firms, these raises are retroactive to January 1.

The new compensation grid at the firm is as follows:

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Partners Shouldn't Tell Associates Not To Bill Their Time
## Partners need to be less self-interested when they must reduce the amount of time billed to a client.

This column has previously discussed how law firm partners often take a number of steps that serve their own interests over the interests of associates who perform work for them. Indeed, some partners ask associates [to complete their own personal tasks](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/partners-shouldnt-require-associates-to-complete-their-personal-chores/), while other partners even [haze junior attorneys at some firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/hazing-is-prevalent-at-many-law-firms/). However, one of the most unfair practices that partners at certain firms employ against associates is to tell associates to perform work and not to record time that they spent completing a project. Since associates at many firms need to bill a certain number of hours each year, this can negatively impact junior attorneys.

When I recently told people within the legal industry about this common practice, they were stunned and a little confused. Usually, partners tell associates to record all of their time, since associates often do not capture all of the tasks that they complete on a file and partners want to bill the largest amount possible. Associates are often told that partners may reduce an associate’s time at a later point, but since partners need to have an accurate picture of how long it took to complete tasks, associates should record all of their time. In addition, many attorneys work at firms that are very busy, and there is no need at these shops for anyone to keep time off the grid.

Nevertheless, when I worked in Biglaw, partners would routinely tell me to perform work and not record my time. Sometimes, I would be told to record my time to a nonbillable number, and a few times, I was even told to record time to a pro bono matter even though it was clear that we were completing work for paying clients. From what I can gather, other associates at my firm were also told to keep time off the grid, and attorneys at other firms have also conveyed that this is commonplace at their firms.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Partners may feel compelled to tell associates not to record their time for a few reasons. For one, partners are often afraid of billing clients too much for certain matters. Sometimes, clients set budgets or other caps on fees, and partners are under pressure to satisfy clients’ demands. Even well-paying clients who have not protested fees in the past may set a limit on a certain matter, since they do not feel that it is worthy of too much billing. Clients have every right to set such limits, but partners then need to cut costs in order to avoid getting into trouble.

At most firms, partners also need to bill a certain amount of hours themselves, although this amount is usually less than the requirement for associates. Even though the higher billable hour rates for partners may eat into a budget more than an associate’s lower rate, partners may be unwilling to bite the bullet of keeping time off the grid themselves. As a result, some partners force associates to make the sacrifice of not getting credit for completing some tasks.

You might be wondering why partners wouldn’t simply allow associates to bill their time and write off any excessive amount billed by an associate over a fee limit. The fact is that many firms judge partners by the amount of time they write off from bills. If a partner is seen cutting huge amounts of time off of bills, these partners might be perceived as less efficient than partners who are able to send bills to their clients without writing off a large amount of time from their invoices.

In addition, if partners send a bill to a client, and receive payment that is less than the total amount billed because they hit a fee limit, this might affect their realization percentage (the percentage of amounts collected versus sums billed). Many firms use realization percentages as an important metric of partner performance, and some firms also evaluate their clients based on their realization percentages. As a result, partners often have an incentive to lower the risk that these percentages will be affected by including an associate’s time on their bills.

Nevertheless, it is extremely unfair to tell an associate not to bill time. Since most associates need to record a certain amount of billable hours to satisfy job expectations or receive a bonus, not recording time makes it more difficult for associates to succeed at a firm. Of course, some firms treat associates the same if they record time to certain nonbillable numbers as they would if the matter was billable, and if this is the case, associates may not be impacted by a partner’s actions. However, even if a partner allows an associate to bill time to an ordinary nonbillable number, this usually does not have the same benefits to associates as recording time as billable hours.

In addition, associates often have no choice about the types of matters they need to work on, so punishing associates for completing tasks on a specific matter is unfair. Associates are not ordinarily responsible for communicating fee expectations with clients, and they shouldn’t be punished if fees need to be reduced.

All told, partners need to be less self-interested when they must reduce the amount of time billed to a client. Indeed, partners should bite the bullet themselves and leave some of their hours off a bill if needed, especially since their higher hourly rates might cut into budgets more than an associate’s lower rate. Associates often do not have a choice about which matters they are assigned to, so it is unfair to allow associates to not bill their time while partners can fully record their hours. Junior attorneys have enough responsibilities already, and telling associates not to record their time makes it much harder for associates to satisfy expectations at a firm.

# Plaintiffs Throw Shade At Jones Day In Gender Discrimination Lawsuit
## Plaintiffs think Jones Day is changing its tune now that they've been sued.

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

Have you been closely following the gender discrimination case[(s)](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-hit-with-explosive-gender-discrimination-case/) filed against Jones Day? Because [we sure have](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jones-day/), and it’s been a lot of fun so far.

If you’ll recall, [last month, a lawsuit was filed against the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/jones-day-facing-second-class-action-lawsuit-over-fraternity-culture-of-the-firm/) by six former associates, alleging that the firm’s notorious “black box” compensation system is used to pay women less than men at the firm, and further alleges there’s a “fraternity culture” at the firm. Of the six plaintiffs, two were named — Nilab Rahyar Tolton and Andrea Mazingo — while four remained anonymous.

Last week, Jones Day[ filed a motion](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/jones-day-wants-gender-discrimination-plaintiffs-to-reveal-themselves-to-the-public/) to force the Jane Doe plaintiffs to reveal themselves. The firm argued they were unable to “fully evaluat[e]” the claims and credibility of the anonymous plaintiffs… while also taking a crack at the plaintiffs’ PR strategy. Plaintiffs’ attorneys at Sanford Heisler Sharp — who have built a[ veritable cottage industry](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/sanford-heisler-sharp/) suing Biglaw firms for gender discrimination — responded before the long weekend, and they went all “rule”-y on the Biglaw giant.

In their filing, plaintiffs pointed to a local rule requiring a meet and confer to reach an agreement or at least narrow the scope of the issue before filing a non-dispositive motion… which, shocker, Jones Day failed to do:

“Had Jones Day not flouted its threshold obligation to meet and confer with plaintiffs, many if not all of its concerns about plaintiffs’ pseudonymity might have been alleviated. Jones Day’s failure to even acknowledge, let alone fulfill this basic requirement is, by itself, sufficient basis to deny its motion,” they said in a [motion](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6025477-ec6ebdee-d11a-4022-ac2f-85f591dd8c88.html) filed late Thursday night in Washington, D.C., federal court.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/05/24/jones-day-bungled-bid-to-quash-anonymity-gender-bias-plaintiffs-allege-398-35955/) Law.com, Sanford Heisler also provided an affirmative defense of the desire these Jane Doe plaintiffs have to remain anonymous:

The filing also addressed the merits of the four women’s desire to remain anonymous. The attorneys emphasized that their position in the early stages of their legal career raised the stakes over the public disclosure of their identities, and that the alternative of a protective order would not be able to ensure that “relevant but sensitive facts,” such as one of the plaintiff’s miscarriage, would remain under wraps.

Consequently, the women could conceivably be branded with a “scarlet letter” that would result in them being blacklisted from other firms, according to the filing.

The plaintiffs also went for a fair amount of shade in rebutting Jones Day’s contention that “Secrecy Is Prejudicial to Jones Day.” Given how [notoriously closed-lipped](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) the firm is about compensation, pleading for transparency in their filing, well, that seems entirely out of character for the firm:

They quoted the firm’s website: ”[W]hat is sometimes critically referred to by those outside Jones Day as a ‘lack of transparency’ is almost universally viewed inside Jones Day as one of its great strengths.”

“It’s newfound interest in transparency thus smacks of an ulterior motive; how consistently it abides by this battlefield conversion will likely become apparent as this case moves into the discovery phase,” the women said.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss’s position on transparency remains to be seen.

Quinn Emanuel has decided that the #MeToo movement is far from over and the firm is making that new reality a part of their business model. The firm [recently announced](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/news-events/announcement-september-2019-quinn-emanuel-empowers-survivors-with-creation-of-metoo-practice-1/#page=0&byNewsType=) a plaintiff-side practice group representing the victims of sexual harassment and discrimination, led by partners Manisha Sheth and Diane Cafferata.

While [other Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/01/clients-have-no-idea-how-to-deal-with-sexual-harassment-so-gear-up-for-that-work/?rf=1) have defense practices in this area, or have expanded to include investigation and workplace training services, Quinn stands alone in Biglaw with this plaintiff-focused group. And you better believe that’s something founder John Quinn is proud of:

“Quinn Emanuel’s entry into this practice area is a watershed event. We are the only major AmLaw 100 firm that is actively promoting these plaintiff-side representations,” added Quinn Emanuel founder John B. Quinn. “As with our other practice areas, our defense side representations will allow us to anticipate arguments, defenses, and strategies that may be employed by defendants in these types of cases. The firm expects to partner with other firms and pay referral fees as it develops this practice.”

And the firm’s announcement also foreshadowed their handling of shareholder derivative lawsuits on the basis sexual harassment claims:

Litigation of sexual harassment suits is not limited to direct actions brought by victims against perpetrators and their employers. In fact, courts have seen a dramatic upswing in the number of shareholder derivative suits brought against a company’s board of directors based on its failure to act after learning about complaints of sexual harassment made by an employee. Derivative cases can be brought, for example, on the grounds that corporate management committed waste or breached their fiduciary duties by approving settlements with the victims. Shareholders have also brought securities fraud claims against a company based on allegations that the company made material misstatements or omissions regarding sexual harassment that affected its stock price.

Yet, at its core, the group is focused on those who are victimized by abusive misconduct:

“The #MeToo Movement has made it clear that this is a pervasive problem, and it occurs across all industries at all levels of employment,” said Quinn Emanuel partner Manisha M. Sheth, who is co-chair of the new practice group. “For decades, some people in positions of power have been allowed to abuse it in a way that harmed women and other protected groups financially, emotionally, and in the worst cases, physically. We look forward to working with these individuals to seek justice and remedy such misconduct.”

# Mandatory Biglaw Psychological Counseling Seems Like An Occam's Razor Problem
## Isn't there a better way?

A lot of spilled ink is devoted to the pernicious mental health issues plaguing the legal profession. From simple burnout to tragic episodes of substance abuse and even suicide, the industry takes a brutal toll. A pair of former Biglaw partners who’ve taken on second careers as psychologists have a proposal: mandatory (subject to opt-out) counseling at targeted career milestones.

This… seems to be a complex solution to a simpler problem.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As such [Jonathan Moult and Jonathan Coppin] have now joined forces to come up with a service that they believe could make a fundamental difference to the state of lawyers’ mental health. What they are proposing is a series of seven psychotherapy sessions for every lawyer in any given firm at key points in their career.

The first point would be at three to four years’ post-qualified, which is usually when the pair have found anxiety has started to kick in for lawyers; then at 10 years’ qualified when the strain of making or not making partner is taking hold; and then again at 20 years’ qualified where it is common for partners to plateau and feel they have wasted their lives while also dealing with problems in their private lives.

Mental health should be treated more seriously by everyone, not just attorneys, but Moult and Coppin are entirely right about the career turning points where the undue stress upon practitioners can take a turn toward the tragic.

But I just can’t help but think this is another instance of the Biglaw mentality run amok. Confronted with all these negative impacts, Biglaw tries to find the right counseling while the simplest solution would be to address a model that thrives on putting people in a pressure cooker. Pull back on the hours, provide more leave, assign and manage tasks more humanely, ditch the “up or out” model that creates artificial career deadlines… basically address the source of stress rather than try to manage it.

Sorry, that’s just crazy talk. Biglaw isn’t going to change.

# Will They Or Won't They? Rumors Abound About Potential Biglaw Merger

‘Don’t tell anyone, but my firm’s got the urge to merge…’

Sometimes the world of Biglaw can be just like high school, where rumors about who’s dating who seem to be more important than anything else. Today, we indulge those who crave gossip with a bit of chatter about two law firms that may — or may not — be considering a merger.

According to the [New York Law Journal](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202799647753/Andrews-Kurth-Hunton--Williams-Explore-Merger?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=2), sources say that Andrews Kurth Kenyon and Hunton & Williams are exploring a combination. Thus far, no one is quite sure how far the tie-up talks have progressed, and a vote isn’t expected any time soon.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
If you recall, Andrews Kurth rescued Kenyon & Kenyon through absorption just last year, but since that time, the firm has been searching for a merger partner. Could a parade of partners heading for the exits have anything to do with it?

Andrews Kurth has been hit with a series of partner defections this year. Most recently, one of the firm’s key rainmaking partners, David Buck, co-chair of Andrews Kurth’s corporate and securities practice, gave notice that he was leaving to go to Sidley Austin, sources said. …

Several law firms have raided Andrews Kurth this year to expand their own Texas and energy practices. [Greenberg Traurig in Dallas picked up four real estate lawyers ](http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202799112524/Dallas-Real-Estate-Group-Moves-to-Greenberg-Traurig-From-Andrews-Kurth-Kenyon?mcode=1202616608548&curindex=0)in September.[ Jackson Walker took four partners](http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202795132007/Jackson-Walker-Launches-WhiteCollar-Group-With-Andrews-Kurth-Hires) from the firm this summer, while in February,[ King & Spalding took four corporate attorneys.](http://www.texaslawyer.com/id=1202779625521/King-amp-Spalding-Hires-6-Lateral-Partners-in-Houston)

Given that Andrews Kurth and Hunton & Williams have similar financial metrics per the most recent Am Law rankings — AK’s profits per partner are $1.26 million, its revenue per lawyer is $885,000, and its gross revenue is $289 million; H&W’s profits per partner are $1.1 million, its revenue per lawyer is $820,000, and its gross revenue is $541 million — this could very well be a Biglaw match made in heaven.

Will they or won’t they? Neither firm has commented on their reported trip down the aisle, but since we have fairly reliable sources at our disposal, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Andrews%20Kurth/Hunton%20&%20Williams%20Merger) or text us (646-820-8477) with any information you might have. Thanks for your help!

# What Lawyers Can Learn From Preschoolers
## Law firm leaders brace for a fresh round of pandemic-era compensation challenges.

I was scanning the news this week when an article in The Wall Street Journal caught my eye: “[Adults Are Throwing Tantrums — in Restaurants, Planes and at Home. Blame the Pandemic](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-adult-pandemic-tantrum-11631743724).”

The author of the Journal article posits that the pandemic has imposed so much on so many for so long that when an opportunity for an explosion comes along, people increasingly take it. Going nuclear on a waiter, ticket taker, or other person who can’t push back gives people a sense of control, a release of the tension we’ve all been living under for the last year and a half.

Well, if that can happen out in public where outbursts are — or at least were — taboo, imagine what can happen at a law firm, where partners are already notorious for explosive reactions. And then consider that most law firms are heading into compensation review season.

If you’re a law firm leader, and your stomach’s dropping now, you’re not alone. Law firm leaders across the country better figure out a game plan for how to handle this compensation cycle quickly — or run for cover.

To Make A Decision Harder, Just Add Money

Any law firm leader would agree that, even prepandemic, compensation review was the most difficult time of the year. Strong, well-designed compensation plans are key to any firm’s success, and anything that touches on the livelihood of the partnership is going to be a lightning rod. There’s a reason I’ve written about compensation [repeatedly in this space](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/2020-will-be-the-hardest-compensation-year-since-the-great-recession/). I regularly hear stories of lawyers and partners at firms across the country transforming into entirely different people during comp season. It’s the underbelly of our profession. Everyone wants to make more money. At the partner level, that desire for more is rarely about the marginal extra dollars. More often, it’s to be better recognized for the efforts, sacrifices, and successes they’ve brought to the table.

But if lawyers can have outsized reactions in compensation season in the best of times, imagine what could happen when you add in the angst and turmoil associated with a pandemic. Law firms are already struggling to keep the stresses of the pandemic [outside the firms’ doors](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/managing-across-the-delta/). When people’s sense of self-worth is on the line, all that frustration with the world, politics, the pandemic, and a lack of control can come whiplashing back both on firm management or, worse, associates, who may feel they have no choice but to take the abuse.

So it’s with good reason that many law firm leaders I’ve spoken with are anxious about comp season. No one looks forward to being screamed at or insulted. So what can leaders do to keep comp discussions professional?

Going Old School

When faced with a problem, it’s often good to consult people who deal with that sort of problem all the time. I submit there’s a place where leaders deal every day with temper tantrums and unregulated behavior and have developed a robust toolkit for defusing those situations: your local preschool.

Toddlers have tantrums because they “[can’t yet say what they want, feel, or need](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/tantrums.html).” Because they don’t have the tools to change their world or get their needs met, that sense of powerlessness pushes them to go with the only mode of expression they have left: screaming and crying. Law firm partners are obviously not toddlers, and they have the tools at their disposal to express themselves. But the same logic still applies. Few attorneys feel 100% satisfied with pay decisions — in part because it’s not a decision they make. At most firms, there’s a group entrusted to balance factors and make the best decisions it can for the firm. Compensation season is a time when many attorneys feel powerless to effect change on their situation on their own, and that powerlessness can lead to outbursts of uncontrolled emotion.

Class Is In Session

How, then, do firm leadership teams deal with this? We do what preschool teachers have done for years.

First, we need to acknowledge the raw emotions that people are experiencing. We’re cranky and frustrated. People have been working harder than ever under challenging conditions. Let your people know their frustration is felt and heard, but be resolute that compensation is still going to be guided by data and sound principles of fairness. Some will inevitably be disappointed, but by remaining consistent, fair, and transparent, we severely lower the likelihood those disappointments will boil over into rage.

Second, set expectations. Compensation committees should be clear about how they make decisions. Consider holding a meeting with partners so they can ask key questions. Share the data underlying decisions. Whether your firm’s books are open or closed to the partnership, be transparent about the standards and metrics that matter, so they know how to measure themselves and aren’t in for an unpleasant surprise. If data and market information drive your decisions, let partners know that. The sharper you can be on what does and does not drive compensation, the more sense of power you hand back to your attorneys to control their own fate, and the more confidence your teams will have in your decision.

Lastly, set boundaries and stick to them. Leadership must set a tone that yelling, screaming, and abuse of others is entirely unacceptable. Although anyone can have a bad day, there has to be limits. Firms must impose consequences for when partners abuse others, preferably through a system of warnings and progressive discipline. It needs to be clear that verbal abuse will not be tolerated and will lead to lower compensation or expulsion from the firm. Even if it seems absurd to fire a rainmaker because they’re being “meanie heads,” the consequences of allowing abuse under your roof can be far worse. That means having hard conversations and having them early. It’s no fun having to tell someone they’re being miserable and hurting others. But by having those conversations and setting firm limits on behavior, further abuse is prevented.

Some Perspective

To someone outside of the legal world, all of this may be unseemly. Most of the world lives on [about $6 per day](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/17/nearly-half-the-world-lives-on-less-than-550-a-day), yet I’m discussing how to mitigate temper tantrums among people making six or seven figures a year who think they’re not making enough. Everyone in this profession is privileged to be here. We’re all lucky to be part of a system that affords us a life to take care of ourselves, have nice homes, and provide a quality education for our kids.

We should all be happy, yet the brain just doesn’t work that way. Everyone wants to feel valued, treated fairly, and that they have control over their life. Compensation implicates all of those desires and vulnerabilities. By understanding and embracing that, we can keep it as painless as possible. Anything that seeks to measure and reward the value of an abstract trade like ours is never going to be a perfect science. But we can make efforts to be transparent, fair, and ensure communication to partners that we’re doing our best.

Compensation is never going to be easy, but done right, it doesn’t have to be as hard on us.

We’ve seen some screwy compensation regimes over the last month — almost always at the expense of senior lawyers ([older associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-you-are-not-matching-the-market-1st-years-to-180k-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story/) or [counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/whats-up-with-counsel-salaries/)) — but this one really takes the cake. After a few appearances in our “[Angry Associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/angry-associates-ask-wheres-my-money/?rf=1)” round-ups, Venable has finally announced raises and their system surely leaves a lot of irate seniors in its wake.

Reactions like this one:

Venable had its associate firm meeting. Venable was successful in making associates more angry than if it had done nothing — worse than expected.

Let’s hear from another tipster:

Lockstep for the first 3 years:
1Y – $180K
2Y – $190K
3Y – $210K

So far so good… that’s a complete Cravath match.

Now here’s where it gets complicated. Venable has the Reed Smith discretionary pay scale, with a bottom and top range for every year.

This year, all they announced were the changes to the top of the scale for each year, intentionally ignoring the bottom of the scale (despite repeated questions about it).
The only answer they were willing to give is that the bottom scale will also “move,” but not proportionally to the movement to top of the scale.

Now let’s break this down. Charitably, we could say that they came in jazzed about the top of the range movement and simply weren’t prepared to discuss the bottom. But cynically, how do you prepare for a meeting on compensation knowing you pay based on a range without bringing pinpoint accurate answers on a question that’s OBVIOUSLY GOING TO COME UP?

Well, what would be the range assuming no movement from the status quo floors…

4Y – $185K – $230K
5Y – $200K – $250K
6Y – $210K – $270K
7Y – $205K – $285K [Ed. note: We think the floor is supposed to be “$215K”]
8Y – $230K – $300K

And there it is. Fourth- and fifth-years could find themselves making less than the third-years (and depending on that seventh band, a seventh-year could be in a bind too). That’s astounding. I don’t think seniors have felt this kind of frustration with their younglings [since Anakin Skywalker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnwkE4trA48).

Also, bear in mind that Venable’s intent is to pay associates in the middle of these bands so it’s not fair to judge how far off they are based on the top number.

Venable has never been lockstep — and wants to continue evaluating us on “our own merits”. Venable has decided to continue with their pay bands where every year is assigned a pay band range and given the median pay for each band. However, they are only telling us the new high end of each band for now. We do not get to see the low or median until January!!! They admitted when asked that the low end and median pay is not going to go up pro rata. So basically no one knows what the hell is going on…. Only that some super associate has the possibility on their best day of making x dollars in January — which still is not the new market.

So… consulting [my handy chart](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-comprehensive-partners-guide-to-associate-raises/), it looks like Venable should prepare for a lateral market raid in January.

Until then, congratulations to the youngest of associates! Maybe you can spare some change for your mentors.

# Why Leave Biglaw To Form A Boutique?
## Lately, it seems that not a month goes by without partners from a top Biglaw firm leaving to form a new boutique.

If law practice were a normal business, this would make little sense. In theory, larger firms should be more profitable per partner than smaller firms because a large firm can spread its fixed costs of operation over a larger pool of lawyers, lowering per-lawyer cost. The move to form boutiques seems to violate the basic principle of economies of scale.

But law is not a normal business. As we have previously explored, the [legal profession is remarkably fragmented](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/05/law-firm-consolidation-perpetually-out-of-reach/) relative to other professional services fields. It is clear that standard economies of scale logic does not explain law firm industry structure.

We see four central factors driving the boutique boom: founder autonomy to chart strategy, avoidance of client conflicts, the opportunity to limit overhead investment, and freedom from ongoing obligations to retired partners.

Strategic autonomy

Boutique founders value the ability to chart their own strategy and run the show. A rainmaker in a typical Biglaw firm can be expected to have a more influential voice than the average partner, but the fact remains that major decisions require some degree of consensus, and the status quo tends to prevail.

Take alternative fee arrangements, for example. Boutiques generally have embraced flat-fee or other alternative structures much more readily than their Biglaw peers. That shift is a lot easier to execute when a firm is controlled by a small group of partners who work in the same practice area and are operating on a relatively long time horizon.

Boutiques can also more easily limit themselves to competing only for higher-margin work. When you make no pretense of being a full-service firm, and you have no legacy low-margin practices encumbering you, there is little reason to bring on equity partners whose revenue contribution would reduce the average.

Conflict avoidance

In their public statements, boutique founders tend to highlight the appeal of escaping the conflicts entanglements of Biglaw. It sounds more noble than “I’m expecting to make way more money.” But in all seriousness, freedom from conflicts can be important. It is a frustrating experience to be in line to represent a client in a significant matter, only to find out that your firm has a conflict that seems entirely tangential but nevertheless requires you to decline the work.

No bloated overhead

If law firms were managed to maximize profits, overhead considerations would counsel against forming a boutique. All law firms must incur some level of fixed cost in order to operate. Consider IT costs. Properly managed, the amount spent on IT per lawyer should be materially smaller at a 1000-lawyer Biglaw firm than at a 10-lawyer boutique. Similar economies of scale should exist for real estate expenses.

And yet, boutique founders routinely cite reduced overhead as an advantage of the boutique model. This is an indictment of large firms’ spending decisions. Historically, there has been a cultural assumption among the Biglaw elite that fancy offices on the highest floors of the most prestigious towers are a necessary expense, both as a status symbol for clients and as a recruiting tool for attorney talent. Boutiques have illustrated that there is reason to doubt this assumption. Even before the pandemic made every law firm question its real estate needs, boutique founders realized that they could operate successfully with a considerably smaller office footprint.

Here we again see the value of the autonomy discussed above. It is easier for a small group of founding partners to agree to dispense with some of the traditional trappings of Biglaw office space than to drive consensus among a large partnership to make substantial cost cuts.

No retirement payments

The final factor is likely the least intuitive, especially for lawyers who are not yet partners: the burden of payments to a firm’s retired partnership. Biglaw firms vary in the generosity of annuities offered to retirees, but it is common for a retired partner to be paid in perpetuity something like one-third of the partner’s average compensation in the final five years of service.

As life expectancy has increased, these generous payouts have become an ever-growing drag on Biglaw profits. Imagine you are a relatively young and successful partner. You could spend the next two decades dutifully contributing to the pockets of your retired forebears and hoping that you will receive a similar deal in your old age. Or you could leave now, found your own boutique, and keep that portion of your billings for yourself. In a world in which even partners who stay in Biglaw are likely to make multiple lateral moves over the course of their careers, it is increasingly difficult to convince current partners that bearing the costs of retirement payments is a worthy investment.

Conclusion: Biglaw must reform its cost structure

Unless Biglaw firms take seriously the signals that the boutique boom is sending, they can expect escalating losses of their most productive partner talent. There is of course a limit to the reforms that Biglaw firms can undertake: the autonomy and conflicts factors are particularly hard to counter. But on cost control, the ball is in Biglaw’s court. And in the wake of the pandemic, the largest firms have a golden opportunity to reimagine their business models in fundamental ways.

Biglaw firms need to take a hard look at all elements of their cost structure, with real estate and retired partner compensation at the top of the list. To that end, now would be a great time to shift to more professional administration by trained management professionals, rather than untrained lawyers engaging in administration as a part-time, supplemental duty.

Biglaw firms have advantages that boutiques cannot easily match, including strong brands and the ability to cross-sell work among multiple practices. But without significant reform on the cost side, Biglaw will continue to lose ground to boutiques.

We need each other. We are social animals—human beings. To cut ourselves off from the support and the value that comes from different points of view, different ideas, different backgrounds, different cultural frames of reference, simply makes no sense to me—if and only if you want the best outcomes for your enterprise.

# Biglaw Firm Launches Takeover Of Successful Litigation Boutique To Open New Texas Outpost
## 'We are taking the team, lock, stock and barrel,' said Steptoe's chair. Yeehaw!

Everything’s bigger in Texas, including law firm takeovers.

Earlier this week, Washington, D.C.-based Steptoe — a firm that brought in $434,601,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 101 in the most recent Am Law 200 ranking — announced that it would be opening an office in Houston, Texas, thanks to its recent combination with boutique trial firm Smyser Kaplan & Veselka. The firms’ partners voted in November to go forward with the tie-up. Not only has Steptoe acquired the firm’s office lease, but the Biglaw firm has managed to lasso all of SKV’s attorneys as well. The [Texas Lawyer](https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2024/01/16/steptoe-launches-houston-office-with-24-lawyer-trial-team-from-smyser-kaplan-veselka/) has additional details on the deal:

[Steptoe chair Gwen] Renigar said Smyser Kaplan includes lawyers and business service professionals with “the right skills, the right reputation, the right clients, the right people and … the right culture.”

Smyser said his former firm, which was nearing its 30th anniversary, has been approached by many national and international firms over the years, but those firms were largely intending to “cherry-pick” a few lawyers.

However, he said, the lawyers at Smyser Kaplan have from the start been a close-knit group, and to Steptoe’s credit, the firm wanted to interview everyone at his firm.

“We’ve been looking at Texas for some time, mostly because our clients have told us they would like to have a presence in Texas,” Renigar told Am Law. “We are taking the team, lock, stock and barrel.” Craig Smyser, a founding partner of SKV said, “We are now Steptoe’s Houston office.”

Just prior to Smyser Kaplan’s combination with Steptoe, several of its former partners — Land Murphy, Dane Ball, and Michelle Stratton — left to form their own firm, Murphy Ball Stratton LLP. Lee Kaplan, one of SKV’s founding partners, joined the new firm as well. “Given SKV’s transition to Steptoe LLP’s Houston office, it was the right time to launch a boutique that carries forward the best of SKV while also finding fresh ways to provide smart law to clients,” MBS offered in a statement. “We’re rooting for our friends at Steptoe-Houston, and we’re excited about the future at MBS.”

Congratulations to Steptoe and all of its new trial lawyers from Smyser Kaplan & Veselka!

# Morning Docket: 04.22.19
## * Impeachment proceedings are “possibly coming”: It’s got a little less oomph than the Game of Thrones tagline that the president is a fan of commandeering, but House Democrats are working on it in the wake of the Mueller report’s findings. [[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-say-trump-impeachment-proceedings-possibly-coming-after-mueller-report-n996806)] * Per Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, there’s “nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.” And besides which, “Who says it’s even illegal?” But would he have done the same when he was running for president? “I probably wouldn’t. I wasn’t asked.” Good to know. Thanks for clarifying, Mr. Mayor. [[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nothing-wrong-with-campaign-accepting-information-from-russians-giuliani-says/2019/04/21/9ee60266-644a-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html)] * “Why in the world would you want to put your enemy on the payroll?” Donald Trump is so pissed off at “real lawyer” and former White House counsel Don McGahn that Jones Day will be kicked off campaign work that could have been worth millions. [[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/19/trump-campaign-mcgahn-1283545)] * According to the latest data from the American Bar Association, the bar pass rate for first-time exam takers in 2018 was 74.82 percent, down from 77.34 percent in 2017. Hopefully things will get better in 2019. [[ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/bar-pass-rate-for-2016-law-grads-shows-little-movement-which-law-schools-did-best)] * Less is now more when it comes to Supreme Court briefs. Thanks to a new rules change, appellate advocates will only have 13,000 words to work with, down from 15,000.

# A New Way To Rank Biglaw Firms: Employee Vaccination Rates
## How does your firm measure up in the fight against COVID-19?

Ninety percent is a wonderful vaccination rate. I think anywhere north of 75% is positive. Obviously the higher the better.

— [Jonathan Segal](https://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/jonathanasegal.html), an employment partner at Duane Morris who works with clients to create vaccination policies, commenting on the numerous Am Law 200 firms that are now [touting their high COVID-19 vaccination rates](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/12/these-law-firms-boast-near-90-vaccination-rates-many-without-a-mandate/) for attorneys and staff.

Thus far, the Am Law firms claiming to have current employee vaccination rates of 90% or higher for U.S. employees are Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld; Arent Fox; Dickinson Wright; Hanson Bridgett; O’Melveny & Myers; Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati; Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler; and Ropes & Gray. Am Law firms that claim 90% or more of their personnel are currently vaccinated or will be vaccinated by their return-to-office deadline include: Ballard Spahr; Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton; Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr. Smaller and midsize firms claiming to currently have more than 90% of their employees vaccinated are: Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman & Machtinger; Kline & Specter; and Sanford Heisler Sharp.

# Morning Docket: 02.12.18
## * ""The chief justice, in particular, doesn’t like the court to be a disruptive force,"" but that might change this spring as the Supreme Court considers reversing at least three of its longstanding precedents. Trashing precedents could potentially become much easier now that Justice Gorsuch is here. [[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/09/supreme-court-verge-reversing-some-its-old-decisions/319834002/)] * Berwin Leighton Paisner and Bryan Cave partners are voting on their proposed transatlantic merger, and the results are expected by the end of the month. If the tie-up is approved, BCLP -- the combined firm's new name -- will be a billion-dollar firm with 1,500 lawyers and 32 offices in 12 countries. [[Law.com](https://www.law.com/sites/international/2018/02/09/blp-and-bryan-cave-to-decide-on-merger-by-end-of-february-as-voting-process-gets-underway/)] * Charles Harder, the lawyer who brought down Gawker and now represents Donald Trump and members of his family, is experiencing some growing pains at his firm thanks to his presidential representation. Name partner Douglas Mirell just quit because of his ""pledge to protect the First Amendment."" [[The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/sites/therecorder/2018/02/09/go-to-trump-lawyers-law-firm-changes-name-amid-partnership-split/)] * New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has filed a civil rights suit against the Weinstein Company and its founders, alleging that they ""repeatedly and persistently treated female employees less well than male-employees through gender-based hostile workplace harassment, quid pro quo harassment, and discrimination."" [[Variety](http://variety.com/2018/biz/news/weinstein-harvey-company-new-york-lawsuit-1202694787/)] * In an effort to increase diversity, LSAC will be awarding a total of $1.5 million to five law schools so they can hold Prelaw Undergraduate Scholars programs on their campuses. Akron, Alabama, Duke, Houston, and St. John's will each receive these grants to convince college students to enroll. [[Black Enterprise](http://www.blackenterprise.com/council-awards-15-million-increase-law-school-admission-students-of-color/)] * Congratulations to Charleston Law's National Tax Moot Court team, which just clinched its seventh championship title in a row. It's nice to know that students were able to rise above the school's designation as one of the [""least selective law schools in the country""](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/the-10-worst-law-schools-in-the-country-2017/) to create a tax law dynasty.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Final Magic Circle Firm Pulls $100K Out Of Its Hat
## Associates must be enchanted by these huge wads of cash.

First came [Allen & Overy](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-magic-circle-firm-speaks/), followed quickly by [Freshfields](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-international-firm-matches-the-field/) and later [Clifford Chance](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-bonus-watch-no-chance-this-wasnt-going-to-happen/). Now, the final Magic Circle firm with U.S. offices has come to the stage to enchant and mystify its associates by pulling wads of cash out of its top hat.

Last night, in a memorandum emailed from global head of U.S. practice [Scott Bowie](http://www.linklaters.com/AboutUs/OurPeople/Pages/ScottBowie.aspx), Linklaters announced that it would be matching the Cravath bonus scale for all of its U.S. associates, worldwide. Bonus payouts to associates will be made on December 30, 2016. The firm took so “long” to announce its bonuses this week that it didn’t even feel the need to include the relevant scale in its memo. The full memo is available on the next page.

That’s our take on the Linklaters bonuses. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

This week, I had the opportunity to catch up with Littler Mendelson shareholder [Alyesha Asghar Dotson](https://www.littler.com/people/alyesha-dotson) and principal [Corinn Jackson](https://www.littler.com/people/corinn-jackson). We discussed last month’s launch of Littler’s [Inclusion, Equity & Diversity (IE&D) Playbook](https://www.littler.com/innovation/littler-inclusion-equity-and-diversity-playbook): a comprehensive collection of resources designed to help employers navigate the legal and practical considerations associated with IE&D programs.

Corinn Jackson

The Playbook is a free, self-service tool that provides employers with resources — including videos, FAQs, podcasts, and high-level summaries — that help answer fundamental IE&D compliance questions, assess current efforts, uncover gaps and challenges, and identify IE&D programming opportunities.

Time and time again during this pandemic, we have witnessed companies make front page news not for their products or services, but rather for their [cultures](https://digiday.com/media/twitters-company-culture-used-to-have-an-amazing-culture-unsure-of-future/) and how they [treat employees](https://www.teamblind.com/topics/Layoffs). As an advisor to IE&D firms like [Onboard Health](https://www.onboardhealth.co/) and [The Diversity Movement](https://thediversitymovement.com/), I continue to be inspired by organizations that are investing in their workforce and fostering inclusive environments for their employees. But I’ve also been in the room when a companies’ leaders regrettably admitted that they simply did not know where to begin on this enterprise workstream.

This week’s conversation with Dotson and Jackson was uber-helpful in understanding IE&D foundational and organizational frameworks. For organizations taking a 2022 inventory of their human capital and aiming to improve IE&D amongst their workforces in 2023, this may be the Q4 conversation and compendium you’ve been searching for. Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

Renwei Chung: Can you share with us a bit about your backgrounds and what drew you to your current practice of law and inclusion, equity, and diversity (IE&D)?

Alyesha Asghar Dotson: In addition to being an employment attorney who finds this continually evolving area of employment law intellectually fascinating, I am personally invested in the success of IE&D programming as a member of several historically marginalized communities.

But, as corporate America — and, indeed, employers across the world — pushed towards IE&D even before the events of 2020, it became apparent to me that enthusiastic IE&D programming without legal know-how could result in unsuccessful and unsustainable results.

In other words, employers who engaged in IE&D without a thorough understanding of the legal landscape were likely to unintentionally misstep and incur legal liability. The natural result of being burned in that manner would be a chilling effect on IE&D as a whole and the entire movement coming to naught.

As such, I wanted to contribute to channeling employers’ efforts toward legally compliant IE&D efforts with a focus on achieving sustainable and long-term change.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Corinn Jackson: Long before I started professionally using terms like inclusion, equity, and diversity, the principles were important to me just being Black and a woman working my way through life and its institutions. Then as a management-side employment defense attorney for most of my career, I’ve had this really exciting opportunity to help employers navigate a rapidly evolving employment law landscape.

For me, I felt a natural fit between how my background and experiences have shaped me as a person and an employment lawyer, and working with employers to help them understand their workplaces and develop lawful and meaningful IE&D initiatives.

RC: What was the impetus for the [IE&D Playbook](https://www.littler.com/innovation/littler-inclusion-equity-and-diversity-playbook)?

AAD: As I provided advice and counsel to my clients in the IE&D space on the hour and day after day, I realized that I was repeating much of the same 101 level foundational information. I also found that there was no compendium of IE&D information that I could comfortably refer them to that was equal parts heart and head.

While I am, of course, always glad to talk to employers about any aspect of IE&D, I wanted to solve for that impediment and create an easy-to-use and cost-effective — in the case of the IE&D Playbook, “free” — solution for employers to learn more about IE&D basics so that they could optimize their IE&D dollars toward the achievement of their greater IE&D efforts.

RC: The past few years, colloquially being referred to as the “Great Resignation” and “Great Churn,” have left many organizations in quite a bind. What can employers do to combat employee turnover or to better attract and retain talent?

CJ: There is no question that the pandemic and other major events of the past few years, termed “turnover shocks” by organizational psychologists, have fundamentally shifted both how we work and how we view our relationships with our workplaces.

Workers are less likely to stay at companies where they are unhappy, where they do not feel valued, and with organizations whose core values they feel do not align with their own. In this landscape, employers who center principles of IE&D — including developing policies and programming that create a workplace culture grounded in inclusivity and clearly messaging their organizational goals and values — will be better positioned to both attract and retain talent.

RC: It’s been interesting, from the perspective of a startup advisor and angel investor, that so many companies have made the headlines for their culture and treatment of employees (not their product or services) during the COVID-19 pandemic. What do you make of this?

AAD: IE&D is multi-pronged and all-pervasive. It is not siloed in any department within a company. It impacts a company’s external stakeholders through products and services just as much as it touches on the company’s internal stakeholders including employees.

The COVID-19 pandemic was a unique time — to put it mildly — characterized by many shifts in the modern workplace not the least of which was remote work. By making our home our remote workplace, employees across the world made a company’s culture a very personal thing. That, in conjunction with the social justice reawakening of 2020 inspired many employees to ask for more from their employers.

And, in large part, employers answered the call by engaging in IE&D initiatives at an unprecedented rate. However, IE&D is a journey rather than a destination. It is an ever-evolving conversation between employer and employee. Occasionally, there may be a wrong turn, but if the stakeholders continue to learn and grow, the journey continues and that’s a win.

RC: Of the [12 key focus areas](https://www.littler.com/innovation/littler-inclusion-equity-and-diversity-playbook), were there any that particularly came to mind as companies or employees assess their year-in-review and begin planning for 2023?

CJ: Any time employers start or expand their IE&D efforts — and the new year is always a good time for organizational planning — we recommend as a first step assessing where the organization stands.

The Playbook’s “Assess You Progress” card helps companies determine how best to measure progress across the organization. Beyond just looking critically at past IE&D programming and evaluating what has worked and where there may be opportunities to redirect efforts or deploy different strategies, this card also goes deeper into organizational self-assessment tools.

Workforce data analytics can help employers to identify where there may be gaps, prioritize areas for action, and provide an ongoing measurement of progress.

RC: How do you think IE&D is going to fare during the expected economic tumult of 2023?

AAD/CJ: We think IE&D is here to stay regardless of the economic climate, and companies that continue to invest in such programming in the year to come situate themselves to thrive. Indeed, IE&D programming is not a “nice-to-have,” but rather a “must have” for employers competing for investors, clients, and talent in the global marketplace where these stakeholders want to align themselves with organizations that reflect their values.

Thus, employers that built IE&D values into their DNA through the implementation of IE&D policies in their handbooks, legally compliant unconscious bias training, Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) reporting, and other avenues, shine more brightly in such comparisons. Employers that relinquish IE&D when they are faced with the possibility of an economic downturn do themselves a disservice.

Specifically, they fail to account for the competitive value that IE&D brings their organization in facing economic head winds by building customer and employee loyalty and fostering a culture that is recession-proof.

RC: Where do you recommend an employers at the beginning of their IE&D journey begin in the Playbook?

AAD: The best part about IE&D is that it is not a prescription. There is no one-size-fits-all IE&D program or initiative. For this reason, we created a nonlinear app that allows employers to explore any of 12 general conceptual areas within the IE&D space.

Any employer at the beginning of its IE&D journey — whether that be a startup or a mature employer — can choose where they want to implement change within the employment lifecycle.

However, anecdotally, many employers choose one of two routes. Some are more introspective and conduct a self-analysis of their IE&D data — preferably under privilege — to determine where they want to allocate their capital resources. These employers allow the data to dictate the priorities and timeline for the same. To achieve this end, an employer might begin by exploring the “Analyze the Numbers” card within the Playbook. But data analytics can include legal risk and be expensive. Therefore, other employers may seek to achieve IE&D success by building equity in their existing reality by updating policies, procedures, and training. These employers may do well to delve into the “Legal Implications,” “Program Development” and “Retention” cards.

But no matter which avenue an employer chooses, I encourage all employers to review the “Organizational Buy In” card. Whether it is building buy in from the C-suite or from rank-and-file employees, IE&D is a team effort. And it can only find lasting success where employers motivate all aspects of their workforce to pull towards the same end goal.

RC: Peter Drucker famously quipped “culture eats strategy for breakfast.” In other words, a good culture can be a force multiplier for better company performance. How do you feel about this statement?

CJ: While planning and strategy always serve an important purpose, organizational culture is key for promoting employee engagement, increasing resilience and productivity, and strengthening reputation and brand.

For employers, right now can feel like a turbulent time to do business — at the same time they are navigating an unprecedented competition for talent, they are bracing for a predicted economic downturn. But developing a strong culture — which will look different for different organizations but will necessarily include adapting principles of IE&D — can help companies drive business goals, improve talent acquisition, and increase retention.

RC: Thank you so much spending some time with us this week. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

AD:  We invite employers to explore the IE&D Playbook and send us their feedback. Whether you have a question about IE&D, or a suggestion about what you’d like to see in the next avatar of the Playbook, we want to hear from you.

CJ:  We developed this resource to help employers navigate the legal, practical, and business considerations surrounding IE&D. Nothing about this area is static — and as the space continues to evolve, so will the Playbook. We really hope it is a helpful tool for organizations regardless of where they are in their IE&D program development or implementation.

RC: On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Alyesha Asghar Dotson and Corinn Jackson for sharing their stories as well as the IE&D Playbook with our audience. We wish them continued success in their careers.

We have another match of the Milbank associate salary scale, this time from litigation boutique Selendy & Gay.

Here’s the email that went out to all Selendy & Gay personnel this morning:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Selendy & Gay PLLC today announced an increase to base salaries for associates, effective July 2018. This is part of the firm’s commitment to not only give associates substantive work early in their careers, but to compensate them as well or better than the nation’s other leading law firms. Since its launch in February, the firm has grown rapidly while maintaining the culture of inclusion, dedication and service.

“At Selendy & Gay, we are committed to building a tight-knit office culture, focused on critical collaboration, partnership without ego, associate development programs and community growth,” said Founding Partner Jennifer Selendy. “We believe that hiring and retaining supremely talented associates is critical to our success and we are excited to announce this important change in compensation.”

[The scale is a match of Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/).

Selendy & Gay is a new firm, started in part by Faith Gay. If the name Faith Gay rings a bell, that’s because you are a loyal Above the Law reader who remembers John Quinn, of Quinn Emanuel, going absolutely bonkers when Gay (and fellow Quinn alumni Philippe Selendy) left Quinn to start their own firm. You might remember Quinn’s email to the firm after Gay departed via poem:

Faith, I wish I could join in the high minded sentiment you express here. Some day maybe I will be able to. But not yet. At this time I am still perhaps too mindful of other facts.

It’s better if you queue up [“Don’t You Want Me”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPudE8nDog0) in the background while reading it.

Anyway, as of this moment, associates at Selendy & Gay are slated to make more in base salary than associates at Quinn Emanuel. Or Cravath. S&G > S&C.

This will not last, of course. The big boys will either match Milbank (and Selendy) or come over the top and kick off another round of salary wars. But, right now, it’s still funny. Congratulations to Selendy & Gay associates. Quinn associates… email me.

**************

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or email us (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

First there was texting, and then sexting. How about “[jexting](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/09/us/oklahoma-judge-texting-trial-resignation/index.html)” as the latest? Lincoln County District Judge Traci Soderstrom, the Oklahoma judge who presided over a murder trial while busily texting with her bailiff, has resigned. She is a classic example of multitasking gone bad.

While presiding over the trial, the judge engaged in her own color commentary with her bailiff. At least, she had the common sense to resign, common sense that was obviously not on display during the trial. Her resignation comes after the state accused her of inappropriate judicial conduct (gross neglect of duty and gross partiality) and sought her removal. The judge resigned, claiming that she is better suited to be an advocate than an arbiter. (Really?) She has agreed to not seek another judicial position. Yet another example of squandering an opportunity that so many others want.

What’s the moral here? Don’t “jext” and preside at the same time? Don’t trash those who appear in your courtroom? Don’t write stupid emails, texts, or posts on social media, as all of them will sooner or later be out there for the world to see? ([Dominion v. Fox](https://apnews.com/article/tucker-carlson-fox-news-dominion-lawsuit-trump-5d6aed4bc7eb1f7a01702ebea86f37a1) is just one example.)

Have you heard of [Illich’s Law](https://lifehacker.com/work/illichs-law-take-breaks-to-be-more-productive?utm_source=email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=lifehackerdaily&zdee=gAAAAABk5tYE6bcam7JWAgyuK_oh1_gGd1hHEkQ0KbJKGdMffR_oVROi-kgIy7g9V_8hjkh1RxIKW7h0UQWRcoHyURsgwn_4V5q1k2LoHHcA5FQ2hD0iWNs%3D)? Rather than your productivity increasing after hours spent working on something, the opposite is true: your productivity declines after all those hours. Is working all night to write a brief, prep for trial, mediate a case to settle in the wee small hours of the morning a good or a bad thing? Peeps will have differing opinions as to the value of what has been produced, whether the brief is dreck, or whether the settlement will be durable.

Working too long on any one matter is counterproductive. Take breaks. (Try telling that to the senior associate or partner who doesn’t think you have spent enough billable time on the matter.)

In addition to the growing conversations about the ages of the likely presidential candidates, similar conversations are being held about the aging judiciary. What are some of the issues? According to Ryan Black, a political science professor at Michigan State who is working with several others on a book about cognitive aging and the federal courts, “there are measurable consequences for just about every facet of the work done by those judges,” pointing to several recent research papers on the aging judiciary. Examples cited include longer delays in writing opinions and borrowing more heavily from litigants’ briefs. The [Pauline Newman matter](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/newman-sanction-renews-debate-over-aging-judges-lifetime-tenure) is only the most recently publicized example of [when is “old” too old](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/judge-newmans-upheld-suspension-has-some-questioning-ethics-law-1?source=newsletter%20item=body-link&region=text-section) to continue serving as a judge. For that matter, when is “old” too old to practice?

Everyone wants to believe that their lives have meaning and purpose at every age. Relinquishing professional identity is never easy.

Since a lot of conversation these days is about RTO (return to office) and WFH (work from home), and the collision of desires between management and staff, how about a right to disconnect? Australia is introducing [legislation that would allow workers the right to ignore unreasonable calls and messages](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-allow-workers-ignore-after-hours-calls-bosses-2024-02-07/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_campaign=Weekend-Briefing&utm_term=021024&user_email=dbded7fef442dbe06c22381da0f8249c14b9ac2613dae60e14e958198e6f256b) from their bosses and would penalize employers who violate the rule. What would be “unreasonable” in that context?

And in a new report published by [Clio about solo practices](https://www.clio.com/resources/legal-trends/2023-solo-report/read-online/), it concludes that those attorneys have not been able to reap financial benefits of larger firms.

No surprise there, since, by definition, solos spend a lot of time on administrative tasks. Add to that, solos have lower realization rates on their receivables. Plus non-solos consistently bill at higher rates than solos. The report notes that solo rates have not kept up with inflation.

For those either in solo practice now or in the future, take heart, as the report’s findings are not all bad: solos have more positive relationships with clients, more happiness with their professional lives, and more emotional and mental wellness which, in these times, are all benefits not to be sniffed at. Technological changes can also make the life of a solo easier than in the past, so no sniffing at those either. With an emphasis (long overdue) on mental health and wellness in the profession, what matters most to you? There’s no one size fits all, nor should there be.

As Donald Trump prepared to whip his militia of Proud Boys and Q Quacks into a violent and ultimately deadly frenzy, he was chilling out with his cronies in a tent listening to poor Laura Branigan who is unfortunately no longer around to issue [a cease-and-desist letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_who_oppose_Donald_Trump%27s_use_of_their_music) for dragging her art into the administration’s bargain basement fascism pageant. And, because he’s a talentless disappointment thirsty for anyone to fill the daddy-sized hole in his heart, Don Jr. filmed the whole affair.

Thankfully he lets the camera linger on boring scenery without any commentary for minutes at a time. BECAUSE HE’S AN AUTEUR!

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Now, right there before Junior praises Mark Meadows as a “fighter” — words that would take on a more ominous tinge about an hour later — that guy over his shoulder is good old Eric Herschmann, late of Kasowitz Benson and [now a “senior advisor” to Donald Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/04/impeachment-lawyer-white-house-391506). There he is in grainy glory right there:



Continuing Kasowitz’s [neck-deep involvement in the travails of this administration](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/marc-kasowitz-will-you-accept-this-rose/) — a bond that started even before Trump’s election when Kasowitz was [getting Ivanka and Junior out of criminal prosecutions](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/ivanka-and-don-jr-avoided-indictment-the-old-fashioned-way-by-being-rich/) — Herschmann parlayed his Kasowitz role into a full-time gig with the White House “[with a hazy portfolio](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/business/media/hunter-biden-wall-street-journal-trump.html)” as the New York Times puts it. And since the New York Law Journal already wrote that Kasowitz’s involvement was [hurting the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/when-people-start-writing-about-you-destroying-your-firm-things-arent-going-well/), maybe getting out wasn’t the worst move.

But, that hazy portfolio includes at the very least a prominent role in peddling the Hunter Biden nonsense:

The three [Herschmann, Stefan Passantino, and Arthur Schwartz] had pinned their hopes for re-electing the president on a fourth guest, a straight-shooting Wall Street Journal White House reporter named Michael Bender. They delivered the goods to him there: a cache of emails detailing Hunter Biden’s business activities, and, on speaker phone, a former business partner of Hunter Biden’s named Tony Bobulinski. Mr. Bobulinski was willing to go on the record in The Journal with an explosive claim: that Joe Biden, the former vice president, had been aware of, and profited from, his son’s activities. The Trump team left believing that The Journal would blow the thing open and their excitement was conveyed to the president.

That bid… didn’t work. But it may not be the only disinformation campaign that Herschmann’s quarterbacking, with many tying his vague advisor role to overseeing and advising on the various post-election legal challenges that made up the ooey gooey filling of Trump’s insurrection HoHo. His cameo in this video of a rally to spread debunked myths about the election seems to underscore that involvement.

But despite the delusion these people instilled in the rioters, Donald Trump will no longer be president in a few days. And when he exits the White House, what’s going to become of enablers like Herschmann? Are they going to return to the welcoming embrace of major law firms? Are clients going to remember all this?

Probably not. If this country didn’t have the attention span of a goldfish, people like Herschmann wouldn’t be trying to turn dubious Hunter Biden emails into a scandal.

# Jones Day Hires Homeland Security Lawyer... Doesn't Mention Kidnapped Immigrant Children In Press Release
## There's nothing surprising here which is the saddest part.

Chad Mizelle was recently the Acting General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security. But as revolving doors must, he needed to find himself a new place of employment with the Trump administration over and his wife losing her cushy associate salary to become a federal judge [over the objections of the ABA](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/shocking-no-one-aba-thinks-biglaw-associate-not-ready-for-federal-bench/) and anyone who thought federal judgeships should go to people with, you know, experience. One might have thought a highly placed Trump official attached to a department that [managed to lose track of hundreds of immigrant children](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/lawyers-say-they-can-t-find-parents-545-migrant-children-n1244066) after collaborating with the DOJ to kidnap them in the first place would struggle to find private sector employment. Ditto the part where [DHS started disappearing people off the streets of Portland into unmarked vans](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/sorry-to-interrupt-your-friday-but-homeland-security-is-disappearing-american-citizens-off-the-street/).

But that’s only if you don’t know Jones Day.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Entirely unsurprisingly, Mizelle slipped into the firm his wife just vacated [with an of counsel title](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/jones-day-hires-trumps-acting-homeland-security-gc-mizelle) and an opportunity to pretend that every career stain of the last administration never happened. Current Jones Day icon and former White House Counsel Don McGahn said of Mizelle:

“He is a superb lawyer with a proven track record of navigating some of the most complicated legal, policy, national security, and regulatory issues our clients may face. I look forward to his contributions and welcome him to Jones Day.”

Some of the “complicated legal issues” he failed to successfully navigate involved his former bosses Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli, the DHS “officials” that Trump appointed to head the agency despite a clear legal framework that prevented this. Mizelle’s job was to make the case that Trump could staff the agency with anyone he wanted and the GAO kicked the claim to the curb after, you know, researching it. This prompted Mizelle to respond the way any professional attorney would… [by throwing a tantrum and personally insulting the GAO lawyers](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/an-agency-gone-mad-dhs-unleashes-personal-attack-on-gao-employee-who-concluded-cuccinelli-and-wolf-were-illegally-appointed/).

“This staffer appears to have limited experience practicing law- having graduated from law school only three years ago. He also previously worked on a Democratic campaign and the partisan Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee,” Mizelle wrote. “Surely, few things could be more significant than the appointment of the head of a cabinet-level agency. It should have been easy to find a more seasoned attorney (whose past political work would not have created even the appearance of impropriety) among the GAO’s 3,000 employees.”

Funny you should mention experience since your wife got a lifetime appointment after [clerking the year before](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/latest-trump-judicial-nominee-clerked-last-year/). Or, for that matter, maybe Chad and his 2013 J.D. should cool the jets before calling someone inexperienced:

This letter is the epitome of lawyering in the Trump administration: Offer flatly unconvincing legal arguments that might *seem* superficially plausible to (non-expert) Trump supporters, then distract with overblown rhetoric, ad hominem attacks, hyperbole, and partisan innuendo.

— Steve Vladeck (@steve_vladeck) [August 17, 2020](https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck/status/1295472822714871809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Ultimately, actual judges sided with the GAO lawyer. Perhaps that attorney should be getting the of counsel job?

Once again, there are no permanent consequences. Kirkland & Ellis may [draw the line at attempted coups](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/kirkland-ellis-has-no-place-for-lawyers-who-fail-to-overthrow-governments/) but some other firm will bite eventually just to add a former senior government attorney to the books. And, as always, Jones Day is at the forefront of firms ready and willing to take the heel turn and dare clients to have the pang of conscience necessary to cut ties with a firm ready to memory hole every controversy of the last four years.

What a bad look for Jones Day [https://t.co/uywMT4zUQv](https://t.co/uywMT4zUQv)

We think the value proposition that we offer to our associates includes a lot of things you can’t find at the bigger firms. A place where you can grow your practices and become a partner—at larger firms that can be very difficult to achieve sometimes. —[Roman Wuller](https://www.thompsoncoburn.com/people/roman-wuller)

As a small firm, we’ve always had to try hard to catch up to the big boys, and we’ve done our best. I think what resonated with our associates, when we announced no layoffs, no cuts—to the extent there was a downturn in the market, we would all weather that storm together. That garnered a lot of loyalty. —[Mark Indelicato](http://mobile.hahnhessen.com/attorneys/indelicato-mark)

— [Roman Wuller](https://www.thompsoncoburn.com/people/roman-wuller), chair of Thompson Coburn, and [Mark Indelicato](http://mobile.hahnhessen.com/attorneys/indelicato-mark), managing partner of financial boutique Hahn & Hessen, commenting on one of the [reasons they knew a merger between their two firms](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2021/06/23/new-york-firm-and-thompson-coburn-to-merge-eyeing-benefits-of-scale/) would work: because of the values their firms share. The combined firm will have more than 400 lawyers across seven offices, and their combined revenue would have been about $240 million in 2020. Now the Biglaw firm, ranked at No. 149 in the most recent Am Law 100, will have much greater access to the New York market.

# Why 'Humanizing' Technology Will Empower Legal Teams

Successful legal tech selection, implementation, and adoption require legal departments and the organizations in which they sit to prioritize the needs of the people interacting with the technology and the processes it will enable.

One of the desired outcomes of successfully leveraging technology is that people are enabled to work at their optimal level of proficiency and capabilities. We call this “humanizing technology.”

This practice focuses on the user experience and the necessity of making legal tools, processes, and their output accessible.

Following are areas where legal departments should focus their efforts:

Empathy and User-Centered Design

Involve end-users, such as legal professionals and clients, in the selection, design implementation, and testing phases to ensure that the technology meets their needs and is easy to use.

This is where the corporate buzzwords “process optimization” come into play.

Infuse empathy into the design process. Understand the challenges and pain points of stakeholders (legal and business) to design processes and technology solutions that address their needs. Integrate legal technology seamlessly into existing workflows. Avoid disrupting established processes and ensure that the technology enhances efficiency rather than creating additional burdens.

User-centric design requires evaluating and understanding how the active participants in the process interact in the environment and what the company’s culture/industry is. By doing this, organizations ensure the key participants are taken into account in selection and implementation.  

Clear Communication and Storytelling

Clear and transparent communication is important to build team support and executive buy-in.

User-centered design includes communication with individuals impacted by or benefiting from change.

Take this opportunity not only to understand their needs and collect data points but also to tell the story and pressure test the future state vision for how technology will benefit them and ease their points of friction. 

Lawyers are skilled problem solvers. When they are presented with an issue, they interpret law and precedent and come back with legal analysis to provide guidance to their client. 

In the case of technology implementation, this approach leads to failure and frustration. 

Technology design should be a collaborative effort to uncover what will achieve the desired results for the majority of the parties involved. It involved bridging the gap of understanding by being fully transparent, compromising, influencing, and solving together.

Unlike in Field of Dreams, if you build it, he will NOT come. You cannot buy and implement technology, plug it in, and expect everyone to use it.

You must inspire and incentivize people every step of the way to understand the value technology will bring once it is in place. 

Feedback and Continuous Improvement

During the design phase, include a governance model to manage the technology owners and incorporate feedback mechanisms to gather input from users.

Actively seek feedback and use it to make continuous improvements, demonstrating a commitment to user satisfaction. Address easy fixes quickly and be transparent on how issues are being addressed. 

This prevents frustrations from festering and turning into something bigger than the original problem. 

Embrace a culture of continuous improvement that monitors not only the technology but the environment that it supports. Be responsive to changes like shifts in process steps and to those teams engaged in the process.

These all have an impact on the original design of the tool that will need to be adjusted to reflect the new environment.  

By incorporating these strategies, legal technology can become more approachable, user-friendly, and aligned with the human aspects of the legal profession.

Humanizing legal technology enhances its acceptance, adoption, and overall impact on legal professionals and clients.

Earlier this month, Representative Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, filed a new federal piece of legislation that proposes to “improve” the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the 2018 Farm Bill)’s hemp provisions by replacing “unworkable and overly complicated regulations” that have hindered the growth and success of the hemp industry.

Yet, this nine-page bill, the “Hemp Advancement Act of 2022” (the Act), includes some reforms that may not entirely benefit the hemp industry.

The following summary addresses the most significant provisions of the Act and how they would impact hemp stakeholders if enacted.

Adopt A New Definition Of “Hemp”
The Act proposes to amend the 2018 Farm Bill’s definition of “hemp” in four major ways.

1. By increasing the THC limit in “hemp” from 0.3% to 1% on a dry weight basis.

This issue has been at the forefront of the campaign by hemp advocates who condemn the arbitrary nature of the level of allowable THC content in the hemp plant and the unnecessary burden it causes on hemp producers.

This THC threshold dates back to 1976, when Canadian horticulturalists Ernest Small and Arthur Cronquist published an article entitled, “A Practical and Natural Taxonomy for Cannabis,” in which the authors explained:

“It will be noted that we arbitrarily adopt a concentration of 0.3% delta-9 THC (dry-weight basis) in young, vigorous leaves of relatively mature plants as a guide to discriminating two classes of plants.”

In other words, Small and Cronquist never intended for the 0.3% limit to have legal significance. And yet, many governments, including the U.S., have relied and continue to rely on it.

So, all that, to say that this increase in THC levels would be a welcomed change for the hemp industry.

2. By replacing the “delta-9 THC concentration” with “Total THC concentration”

Despite its intent to increase the THC limit found in hemp, the Act also proposes to effectively lower the allowed THC limit by defining hemp and hemp product (note this term is defined separately from “hemp” in the Act) in terms of “total tetrahydrocannabinols concentration.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Simply put, a “total THC concentration” includes more THC compounds than the existing total delta-9 THC concentration.

Practically speaking, this means that a hemp product that contains some trace amount of delta-8 THC (this is inevitable in working with hemp extract) and 0.3% total delta-9 THC would meet the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the 2018 Farm Bill)’s THC limit, and thus, be deemed lawful. However, under the Act, the same product would be unlawful. The mere inclusion of a minuscule, detectable amount of naturally derived delta-8 THC would push the product over the edge of the 0.3% threshold. Therefore, in order to comply with the total THC concentration, the finished product would have to contain a lower delta-9 THC concentration to make room for other detectable THC compounds, which means manufacturers of these products would need to adopt more stringent manufacturing practices.

3. By including the term “hemp extract” in the definition of “hemp”
If enacted in its current form, the Act would treat hemp extract as hemp, provided the extract:

- is not packaged as a finished product and sold to end use consumers but instead is used in the making of a finished product
- has a total tetrahydrocannabinol concentration that exceeds 1% on a dry weight basis” (emphasis added)
- is stored, transported, and processed in accordance with procedures that would be established by the USDA
Of particular interest here is the concentration level that would be allowed in hemp extract: more than 1% on a dry weight basis. This provision likely aims to address the complex issue of in-process hemp extract, which, though not meant to be sold to end-use consumers, is a vital component of all finished hemp-derived products.

In order to convert hemp (dry) into hemp extract (“wet” or liquid), the hemp plant must be processed using a method that inevitably raises the delta-9 THC levels above 0.3%, even if fleetingly. Although the 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp by removing the plants, its derivatives, extracts, and cannabinoids from the definition of “marihuana” under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (the CSA), it does not address the processing of hemp, nor does the USDA’s Final Rule, which solely regulates the cultivation of hemp.

In August 2020, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) took advantage of this regulatory gap and released an Interim Final Rule, which improperly criminalizes in-process hemp extract. This attack on in-process hemp extract is hugely problematic in that this substance, though not intended for sale to end-use consumers, is lawful under the 2018 Farm Bill and, as previously mentioned, is a vital component of all finished hemp-derived products intended for human consumption. In publishing its Interim Final Rule, the DEA has unduly burdened hemp processors with potential threats of enforcement action. Therefore, Pingree’s Act would help bring much-needed peace of mind for these stakeholders.

4. By providing “hemp” cannot be sold to end-use consumers
Under the Act, hemp (including hemp extract) could only be sold to other licensees. Only finished hemp products, which must contain no more than 0.3 percent total THC concentration, could be sold to end-use consumers.

Although the Act seems to propose a solution to the issue of high level of THC found in in-process hemp extract, the proposed bill contains other provisions that may in fact further complicate the legal status of this substance.

The amendments proposed in the Act would:

- remove hemp (including hemp extract) and hemp products from the definition of “marihuana”
- exclude in-process hemp extract and hemp products from the definition of THC, which already excludes hemp (and thus, hemp extract)
While these exclusions seem favorable at a glance, they are problematic for two reasons:

- By only excluding in-process hemp extract from the definition of THC, the Act fails to remove the possibility that in-process hemp extract be treated as “marihuana” (i.e., as a controlled substance).
- The Act fails to appreciate that THC listed as a Schedule I substance under the CSA only includes synthetic THC. For more information on this issue, I strongly recommend reading Shane Pennington’s excellent article published on On Drugs.
Remove DEA Laboratory Registration Under USDA Regulations
The 2018 Farm Bill tasked the USDA with overseeing the production of hemp and with establishing regulations, including criteria by which a lab may be accredited for purposes of testing hemp to ensure compliance with federal law.

Pursuant to the USDA Final Rule, labs testing hemp must be registered with the DEA. The rationale for this rule is that labs could potentially handle hemp that tests above the THC testing limit, which would constitute “marijuana,” a Schedule I drug under the CSA. Because it is unlawful to possess marijuana without a DEA registration, all labs, therefore, must be registered with the DEA in order to conduct hemp THC testing.

Unfortunately, the current DEA rules limit registration to labs located in jurisdictions in which the prescription, distribution, dispensing, research, and handling of marijuana is legal. This, in turn, means that a very limited number of labs are authorized to engage in this industry. This is problematic given the fact that there are currently too few labs compared to the amount of hemp being produced.

So getting rid of this requirement would hugely benefit the hemp industry.

Prohibit Interstate Commerce Of “Synthetic Cannabinoids”

Section 8 of the Act proposes to amend Section 10114(a) of the 2018 Farm Bill to read as follows:

Nothing in this title or an amendment made by this title prohibits the interstate commerce of hemp (as defined in section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (as added by section 10113)) or hemp products, “or permits interstate commerce of products containing cannabinoids that are not naturally occurring in the plant Cannabis sativa L. or that are manufactured by means of chemical synthesis.” (Emphasis added).

While Rep. Pingree explained in a press release that the Act aims to “ensur[e] final hemp products sold to consumers aren’t intoxicating,” which presumably confirms products containing delta-8 THC could not be sold across state lines (Delta-8 THC is an intoxicating cannabinoid produced through a chemical reaction that combines hemp-derived CBD with a solvent, acid, and heat), the bill fails to address the meaning of “manufactured by means of chemical synthesis” as well as that of the term “synthetic cannabinoids,” which is used in the title of Section 8. Therefore, unless Congress defines these terms, we’ll be left with more uncertainty regarding the legality of these “minor cannabinoids.”

Repeal The Exclusion Of Formerly Ineligible Applicants

This bill also proposes to repeal the controversial drug-felon ban that bars most persons with a felony drug-related conviction from obtaining a hemp license. If enacted, the Act would help ensure that communities of color, which have been disproportionately impacted by drug policies, would gain equal access and opportunity to engage in this emerging market.

Despite some of its problematic provisions, the Act is backed by more than a dozen major hemp and cannabis groups, including the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, Americans for Safe Access, and Hemp Industries Association.

Pingree shared in a recent statement that she is hopeful this piece of legislation will enjoy the same level of bipartisan support as the hemp legalization provisions of the 2018 Farm Bill saw and expects her bill will drive conversations and inform policy as federal lawmakers begin drafting the 2023 Farm Bill.

Let’s simply hope that when discussions begin, Congress is made aware of the issues discussed in this piece so it avoids enacting a bill that would further exacerbate the challenging situation in which the hemp industry has found itself for the past three years.

# Reflecting On My First In-Person Deposition Since The Shutdown
## Much is missed by holding depositions through remote means.

As many people within the legal profession understand from first-hand experience, lawyers and courts have been conducting operations remotely since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Judges and court attorneys are usually holding hearings and conferences through Zoom or other similar mediums these days in order to reduce the risk that attorneys and court staff will be exposed to the virus. In addition, many depositions have been held remotely so that parties do not need to be together in one room during the proceedings. However, I recently had my first in-person deposition since the pandemic began, and the experience has shown me that there is much that is lost by holding depositions through remote means.

Rapport Between Attorneys

Of course, the most important part of a deposition is to receive sworn testimony from a witness. However, there are a number of other reasons why in-person depositions can be important to a case. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of in-person depositions is that is gets all of the attorneys connected to a case in one room, which can be helpful in moving a case forward. At an in-person deposition, attorneys can casually talk about discovery disputes, settlement numbers, and numerous other issues while everyone is together for the purpose of taking a deposition. Moreover, attorneys can build rapport with one another at in-person depositions in ways not possible during virtual depositions. For instance, many attorneys eat lunch together during breaks in a deposition, and this can go a long way toward building connections with other attorneys on your case and even in your practice area. I have never heard of attorneys eating their lunches together through Zoom during virtual depositions, and this rapport-building is essentially lost during virtual depositions.

Efficiency

One of the biggest benefits that I missed about in-person depositions is that taking testimony live is far more efficient than using Zoom or other remote means. When parties use Zoom or other applications, there is always the risk that internet disruptions and other technical glitches will make it difficult to take testimony. At virtual depositions, it is also sometimes hard to hear people, and individuals are far more likely to talk over each other, which can be difficult on the deponent, the attorneys, and perhaps more importantly, the court reporter.

Moreover, many of the procedural parts of a deposition are nearly impossible when depositions are conducted through virtual means. For instance, it is much more difficult (or impossible) to show a witness an exhibit during a virtual deposition, have them read from a writing, and ask questions pertaining to documents and other tangible items. Any good deposition taker will tell you that using exhibits is an important part of directing a witness, and this component of depositions is really hard with virtual proceedings. Moreover, using translators is much easier in person than during virtual depositions. Translators can already add to the time and complexity of a deposition, and this is even more of a challenge at virtual depositions. All told, my recent experiences with in-person depositions and virtual proceedings have shown me that in-person questioning can save both time and effort.

Anyone who has participated in a deposition conducted over the phone or even by Zoom (or a similar app) knows that it is hard to discern witness reactions during virtual depositions. Being able to observe the reactions of a witness is extremely important to determining if a witness is telling the truth, is uncomfortable about certain topics, and other insights. The reactions can help inform an attorney’s perspective, and it is extremely difficult to get this understanding from virtual depositions.

In addition, virtual depositions make it much easier for attorneys to coach their client during a deposition. Some jurisdictions restrict the applicability of the attorney-client privilege during depositions because courts understand that it is important for witnesses to provide truthful and unguided testimony during depositions. However, it is much easier for attorneys to talk with clients without other counsel knowing about it when they are in a room together and everyone else is participating in a proceeding remotely. While I do not want to impugn anyone, everyone knows that coaching and other “funny business” often occurs at depositions, and this is much easier during virtual depositions.

Of course, I am not saying that virtual depositions shouldn’t take place during the pandemic, and lawyers — just like everyone else — need to follow the advice of medical professionals. It seems like virtual depositions will be a much bigger part of the legal profession for a long time, since health guidelines require social distancing and depositions usually bring people together. However, my recent experiences with both in-person and virtual depositions have shown me that virtual depositions should not be an ubiquitous and permanent fixture of the legal profession.

# White & Case Delivers For Child Victims As Part Of $600 Million Flint Water Settlement
## Pro bono effort secures services for most vulnerable victims.

There are a lot of reasons for the United States to be ashamed of itself right now, but if the country ever wanted to add a little bit more, it can recall that a global superpower allowed children to drink poisoned water for months and — six years after the fact — hasn’t fully finished fixing it. The crisis in Flint passed from a lot of people’s minds as newer miseries pushed it to the media back burner.

At White & Case, the matter remained front and center. The firm worked pro bono with the legal team representing the children of Flint including the ACLU of Michigan and the Education Law Center and [reached a partial settlement in 2018](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/the-power-of-pro-bono-biglaw-firm-scores-major-victory-for-victims-of-flint-water-crisis/) with the Michigan Department of Education, Genesee Intermediate School District, and Flint Community Schools. That settlement established a screening process to identify children displaying symptoms of lead poisoning and a second prong providing sophisticated psychological testing those children. A significant victory but it wasn’t the end of the fight.

Today, the firm announced that the new $600 million settlement with Michigan, which must still be approved by the court, will include a wide range of services tailored to address the long-term impact of the crisis including special education programs and universal pre-K.

Lindsay Heck, who we talked to back in 2018, offered the following:

“This is a landmark settlement in our special education case,” said Lindsay M. Heck, lead attorney from global law firm White & Case LLP, which worked on the case pro bono. “Lead is a potent neurotoxin that causes irreversible brain damage. There is no medical intervention that can completely counter the effects of lead exposure—education offers the only antidote. This settlement establishes a model to identify children with disabilities, to create structural changes that will ensure that those disabilities are properly addressed, and to prevent school discipline from being used as a substitute for behavioral interventions. It is a model that will not only transform the educational system for Flint children, but that establishes a framework for underfunded school districts in urban communities with deteriorating infrastructures that serve predominantly Black and Brown children. These communities have endured decades of educational disinvestment and environmental racism. We are committed to making sure this settlement turns Flint into a national symbol of resilience and hope.”

There’s still a lot of work to be done developing, implementing, and monitoring the settlement over the coming years, but today is a day for celebration. It’s a massive accomplishment and one that demonstrates the importance of pro bono efforts generally and the value a Biglaw firm can bring to the fight specifically.

(UPDATE: Worth throwing in there that for the overarching settlement Cohen Milstein Sellers & Tolls is interim co-lead class counsel and the whole case saw involvement from firms from Susman Godfrey to Weitz & Luxenberg.)

# Special Bonuses With A Side Of 'Significantly Increasing' Annual Bonus
## That's some exciting news.

It’s not particularly surprising that Winston & Strawn will join the market in offering special bonuses. This one is a JSESDPWM (June-September Equal Split DPW Match). But what is surprising is a line tucked away at the bottom of the memo promising some even more exciting news at year-end.

Winston matches the market rate for annual bonuses every year, but has historically kicked a bit more into the annual bonus pool for high billers. Back in 2019, this [amounted to around $5K for 2200 hours and $7.5K for 2400](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/winston-bonus-2019/). This special bonus memo concludes by announcing, “we are pleased to announce that we are significantly increasing our year-end high hours bonuses.” That’s a tantalizing promise to drop on associates finishing up their first quarter of billing!

But we’ll have to wait to see what Winston’s going to offer next. For now, we’ve got June and September bonuses to think about.
