# Jones Day: Helping Donald Trump To Make America Great Again
## How would you feel about your law firm representing Donald Trump?

The law firm of [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jones-day/) is notoriously tight-lipped. The sigil for House Jones Day might be a pair of pursed lips, over the motto [“Secrecy breeds strength.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/)

There’s a certain irony, then, in this very discreet firm serving as campaign counsel to the most loudmouthed candidate of them all: Donald J. Trump, the billionaire real estate developer turned reality television star turned Republican presidential frontrunner. Although Trump’s in-house lawyer Alan Garten has earned most of the legal limelight so far (thanks to his [great](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/donald-trumps-amazing-cease-desist-letter/?rf=1) and [not-so-great](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/an-awesome-response-to-a-cease-and-desist-letter-from-donald-trumps-lawyer/) cease-and-desist letters), Jones Day is doing the real heavy lifting as Trump’s [principal campaign counsel](http://www.p2016.org/trump/trumporg.html).

This afternoon, as reported by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/03/19/trump-to-huddle-with-top-republicans-ahead-of-aipac-speech/), the D.C. offices of Jones Day will be hosting a summit of sorts between Trump and two-dozen top Republicans. Back in November, Jones Day [successfully defeated](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/24/effort-to-knock-donald-trump-off-n-h-ballot-fails/) an effort to knock Trump off the New Hampshire primary ballot.

Given the many accusations leveled against Trump — that he’s a [racist](http://www.atlredline.com/does-supporting-donald-trump-make-you-a-racist-1746964335), [sexist](http://www.salon.com/2016/03/14/bimbo_dog_fat_pig_women_recite_donald_trumps_sexist_comments_aloud_in_devastating_new_attack_ad/), [xenophobic](http://www.salon.com/2016/02/17/donald_trumps_despicable_race_baiting_why_his_xenophobic_immigration_platform_is_getting_even_worse/) bully, whose campaign rallies sometimes [end in violence](http://www.atlredline.com/i-know-how-donald-trump-will-be-stopped-but-somebody-w-1748174436) — why hasn’t JD’s representation been more controversial? Trump is [causing controversy in law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/law-school-cancels-barristers-ball-because-of-donald-trump/); what explains Biglaw’s big yawn? As one source of ours wondered:

Jones Day is serving as Donald Trump’s official legal counsel. Why hasn’t there been an insurrection among Jones Day clients and associates?

[W]hen Paul Clement defended DOMA, he [ended up leaving King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/04/paul-clement-quits-king-spalding-after-ks-moves-to-drop-doma-defense/) because of the outcry… this is just as bad, but there doesn’t seem to be any reaction. I am astonished.

Also, this is not the same as DOMA even, because Clement could at least say everyone deserves their day in court and lawyers have to assure justice…. Here, Jones Day is supporting Trump’s messaging, ads, rallies, and politicking with legal review!

The Jones Day team representing the Donald is led by another Donald — [Donald F. McGahn](http://www.jonesday.com/dmcgahn/), a leading election lawyer and [controversial](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-fec-chairman-donald-mcgahn-resigns-from-panel/2013/09/17/84ff1a88-1fca-11e3-94a2-6c66b668ea55_story.html) former chairman of the Federal Election Commission (FEC). When Donald Trump delivered his [New Hampshire victory speech](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/watch-trumps-very-wtf-new-hampshire-victory-speech-20160210), a grinning Don McGahn stood right next to Trump, closer to the candidate than Trump’s wife Melania or daughter Ivanka. Here’s a photo from that evening (showing that the two men share the same ruddy hue):


Jones Day’s Don McGahn: the wind beneath Trump’s wings?

One can understand McGahn’s place of honor on the stage. If not for his and Jones Day’s [efforts](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/11/24/effort-to-knock-donald-trump-off-n-h-ballot-fails/), Trump might not have made it onto the ballot.

And one can understand McGahn’s grin: his client is cleaning up in the GOP primary, and his firm is profiting handsomely. In 2015, according to [FEC filings](http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandCmteTransaction.do), the Trump campaign paid Jones Day almost $250,000 in legal fees — and the pace of spending has picked up since then. In January 2016 alone, Trump made two disbursements to Jones Day, totaling another $100,000. By the time the campaign is all over, one could easily imagine Jones Day earning seven figures from this engagement, especially if the messy Republican race spawns more litigation or if Trump ends up in the general election.

As we noted at the outset, a white-shoe law firm known for its discretion and a red-faced billionaire known for having none might be viewed as an odd couple. But if any Biglaw firm were to defend the Donald, one could see it being Jones Day. The firm and its client share some things in common. Like Donald Trump, infamous for Twitter takedowns and debate disses of his detractors, Jones Day can also be a bit [thin-skinned](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/jones-day-does-not-have-a-sense-of-humor/) and [defensive](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/biglaw-firm-throws-even-bigger-hissy-fit/). Like Donald Trump, who plays best among working-class whites hurt by globalization, the Cleveland-founded firm enjoys a dominant market position in the Rust Belt (which might explain why its representation of Trump hasn’t made waves among its lawyers and clients).

We reached out to Jones Day to see if they’d make Don McGahn or any other JD lawyer on the Trump team available for an interview. A firm spokesperson thanked us for our interest but said that its representation of Trump “is not something we can discuss.”

If you’re a Jones Day lawyer or client, what do you think of your law firm’s representation of Donald Trump? Please get in touch with us [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jones%20Day%20and%20Donald%20Trump) or by text message (646-820-8477). If we get enough information or if there are subsequent developments, we might do a follow-up — this story could be YUGE. Thanks.

UPDATE (1:16 p.m.): Here are some thoughts from one Jones Day attorney:

The firm’s (seemingly gleeful) representation of Donald Trump is cringeworthy and embarrassing. Many people in the firm are upset by it and concerned about the negative implications that representing a sexist, racist demagogue could have on our client base. It also sends a negative message to the firm’s female associates when JD takes the (albeit indirect) side of a man actively bullying Megyn Kelly, who worked at this firm for nine years.

And from a former JD lawyer who’s now gone in-house (i.e., a potential client):

I can sum up my opinion of this story briefly: WTF. This is so embarrassing.

UPDATE (4:35 p.m.): Comments from another lawyer still at Jones Day:

If you’re wondering why there hasn’t been more of an associate outcry, it has a lot to do with the fact that most of us are learning this for the first time reading it on your website. This place isn’t exactly a model of transparency.

The representation of Trump is shameful and embarrassing, but it’s not the first time a Biglaw firm has represented a paying client that many find to be morally reprehensible. It’s part of doing our jobs. And just so people know – Trump’s shtick is emphatically not representative of the worldview held by most of the people here. Many attorneys here have done hundreds of hours of pro bono work for the National Immigrant Justice Center, for example.

Fair enough. This information — that Jones Day hasn’t been making much of the Trump representation internally, and that many JD lawyers disagree with his views and do pro bono work on behalf of immigrants — is helpful and worth noting.

UPDATE (5:18 p.m.): From another mortified Jones Day attorney:

I can speak for all of the attorneys in at least one JD office when I say that we did not know about Trump until today, and considering that our business development plan consists largely of outreach to Latin American clients, we are embarrassed and upset for them and for ourselves. Long story short: Trump’s bigotry doesn’t speak for us all, and many (if not the majority) of us are ashamed to have learned this today.

# The Most Offensive Way To Refer To Biglaw Bills
## Overall, this is just a bad look for the firm.

Ah, the billable hour — the measure of a Biglaw attorney’s worth. For lawyers stuck in the firm-sponsored hamster wheel, being able to bill hours to a client is your ticket to respect, bonuses, and circularly enough, more billable hours.

Clients, of course, see them differently. In-house counsel, many of them Biglaw refugees, know the padding inherent in the bills, and their own standing at their employer is often tied to keeping costs down, which frequently means battles over bills.

Take the case of Dechert and their client, Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC). Dechert was hired to conduct an internal investigation over corruption charges in Kazakhstan. $23.5 million later, the investigation had spread to activities in Africa, and litigation over the bill. That fact, alone, might garner a mention, but it isn’t particularly shocking. However, testimony in the case has revealed the way one partner reportedly referred to billing, and, wow, it’s a doozy.

And, yes, it is worse than “[churn that bill, baby!](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/overbilling-gone-wild-paying-the-dla-piper-plus-interesting-lateral-moves-into-and-out-of-dla/?rf=1)”

ENRC general counsel, Beat Ehrenberger, alleges London-based Dechert partner Neil Gerrard referred to billing practices as being, “in rape mode.” As the American Lawyer [reports](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202757857269/With-Internal-Investigations-Firms-Walk-a-Tightrope-):

Challenging the fees in court, general counsel Beat  Ehrensberger testified that “Dechert made decisions regarding the methods and scope of investigation for the principal purpose of expanding the work to generate higher fees.” More colorfully, the GC testified that Dechert’s Neil Gerrard reportedly referred to himself as being “in rape mode.”

Wow, there is so very much to unpack in this statement. First of all, it shows incredible disrespect for your client. Are they really nothing more than conquered land you and your team are pillaging? And what of the ethical implications? When discussing a client, an entity one has a duty towards, you should probably avoid using an euphemism for “taking advantage of.” It just doesn’t play well.

Then, of course, is the way this language makes light of sexual violence. Charging a multinational corporation money for investigating corruption is not at all like sexually violating someone. To equate the two demeans the real pain and anguish rape victims go through. There may be an impulse by some to dismiss the statement as “insensitive” or concerns about it being “politically correct.” However, that underplays the way this rhetoric undermines a real issue. Imagine if you were a rape victim that happened to work for Gerrard and he referred to billing as “in rape mode.” Would you feel comfortable working often long hours with a man who could take up the persona of rapist to demonstrate how good he was at making money?

Overall, this is just a bad look for the firm. Large bills, particularly in internal investigations where firms have an obligation to follow the issues as they are uncovered, are nothing new or memorable. Dechert was investigating potential corruption, but instead of focusing on that serious issue, the issue for the firm, at least as ENRC sees it, became how to make more money. The language Gerrard allegedly used tells the real story, and it isn’t a flattering one.

# Cheer Up! AI Can’t Do Everything …Yet.

There’s been a lot of discussion about “soft skills” for lawyers. You can’t test for them on the bar exam. These could be included under the general rubric of competency — those attitudes and attributes that make lawyers good and good lawyers better. These are not skills that you can pick up in a bar review course.

They are skills that take time to develop and mature. Some peeps are fortunate enough to have them since childhood (whether pounded into them by parents or not), some others have to learn them, matriculating through the “school of hard knocks,” and some peeps never learn them, which contribute to complaints against lawyers.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
What are some of the “soft skills” essential to good lawyering? Last summer, ATL listed [eight essential soft skills](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/8-essential-soft-skills-for-legal-professionals-in-2023-a-comprehensive-guide/). Time for a refresher.

The first on that list is “effective communication.” Active listening (e.g., no multitasking while listening to a client, devoting complete attention, steady eye contact, and no interruptions). There’s nothing worse than being interrupted while a client is trying to explain a situation and then reverting to “now, where were we?” Insulting and disrespectful.

Another part of “effective communication” is the lawyer explaining clearly what’s going on, what may or may not happen in the future (there are no litigation crystal balls), and the expectations for both lawyer and client. This is where many attorney-client relationships break down. Example: the attorney asks the client to complete some forms so that the case can be filed, the client procrastinates, taking months to complete the forms, and then when client finally returns them, he wants the attorney to drop everything and file his case forthwith. Has this ever happened to you? (Eyes rolling back in heads.)

Another soft skill in the ATL list: “communication and teamwork.” Egos can and often do intrude into law practice, but if the goal is the best possible result, then a clash of egos may not necessarily be the worst thing. Too often we work in silos, rather than collaboratively, so we don’t know when or if we are working at cross-purposes. I always hated “attorney shopping,” that if one attorney didn’t give the answer the client wanted to hear, the client would stroll down the hall and ask a second attorney, without telling that attorney how the first attorney had given a different  opinion. That’s why collaboration is so important. We can and do have differences of opinion based upon our knowledge, but our answers to clients should hopefully be consistent. If not, differences in legal opinions should be duked out within the confines of the legal department.

How about a sense of humor? Others may not prize it, but without a sense of humor about yourself, others, and situations, life can be harder than it already is. Some lawyers think that  it’s of limited or no utility in the profession and even undignified. I disagree that it further tarnishes whatever positive reputation we have (not much, IMHO). The inability to laugh at oneself, at the ridiculousness of certain statutes, of the silliness of certain procedural mandates, of the pomposity of certain colleagues — especially opposing counsel, of examples of judicial robe-itis, would make practice that much tougher than it already is, and it isn’t exactly a bed of roses these days.

The work we do is serious, and the potential consequences even more so, but the ability to separate work from life is critical. We are trained to catastrophize, trained to think of the worst possible outcomes, trained to figure out how to avoid that catastrophe, which is why a sense of humor is so important, to divert us from our worst fears, and that, aside from blowing a statute of limitations (our worst nightmare?), there is usually a fix for everything else.

Also on the ATL list are emotional intelligence, empathy, and understanding. Sometimes, a lawyer needs to just “show up” for the client, not in any physical sense necessarily, but to be there as counselor, as advisor, as someone who shows kindness and compassion when it is needed most. Although we do need detachment so that our client’s problems do not become ours, there’s a difference between detachment and connecting on a human level. Being human is what we all do best.

With all the kerfuffle about AI swirling around, its ability [to pass a bar exam](https://law.stanford.edu/2023/04/19/gpt-4-passes-the-bar-exam-what-that-means-for-artificial-intelligence-tools-in-the-legal-industry/), to do “legal research” and other tasks that used to be within the purview of mere mortals, there is at least one thing that AI cannot do: forge that human connection between attorney and client. [Minouche Shafik](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/14/opinion/ai-economy-jobs-colleges.html?campaign_id=39&emc=edit_ty_20240214&instance_id=115140&nl=opinion-today&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=158162&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c), the president of Columbia University, said it best: “In the past, jobs were about muscles. Now they’re about brains, but in the future, they’ll be about the heart.”

And yes, contrary to popular opinion, lawyers still have hearts, even if sometimes they are hard to find.

# Do You Ever Admit That You Should Have Lost?
## Should someone feel guilty about having won when you should have lost? Why?

An interested reader poses this question:  Do you ever admit to yourself or a client that you won a case or motion, even though you should have lost?

I’m not quite sure what my reader is asking about:  Should someone feel guilty about having won when you should have lost?  Why?

When we win a case that we should have lost, we celebrate!  We won a case that we should have lost; congratulations!  I’ve never noticed any guilt in the room.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Sometimes, as outside counsel, we advise the client that we’re filing a motion that should probably lose:  “This motion has only a 15 percent chance of winning.  But, if we win the motion, the entire case is over. We think it’s worth filing the motion.  Do you agree?”

That’s a motion that I should lose — or, at least, I should lose 85 percent of the time.  But I file it, and I celebrate if I win.  Does anyone think that’s wrong?

Here’s a tougher case:  The lawsuit was filed in California state court.  The federal MDL proceeding is in New York.  Removing the case is squarely prohibited under Ninth Circuit law.  If you remove the case, you shouldn’t just lose; you should be sanctioned.  But removing the case would plainly be permitted under Second Circuit law.  If the motion to remand your case is decided under Second Circuit law, there’s  no doubt that you should win.

What do you advise the client?  “This case presents a dicey proposition.  We’ll remove into the teeth of unfavorable Ninth Circuit precedent.  If plaintiff’s motion to remand is decided by the California federal court, we’ll surely lose and may be sanctioned.  But we’ll try to ship the federal case off to New York at the same instant that we remove the case.  If we manage to get the case shipped to New York before the motion to remand is decided, then we’ll win.  It’s discretionary with the California court whether to decide the motion to remand before or after the transfer, so we’re running a risk here.  But we think you should be aggressive; we suggest you remove the lawsuit.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
If the California federal court decides the remand motion, you lose.  If the New York court decides the remand motion, you win.  Maybe — maybe —  that’s a motion that you “won” even though you shouldn’t have.  But you sure don’t feel guilty about it.  You were gutsy, and the gamble paid off.

Here’s a case that’s harder still:  You’re hired as appellate counsel in a product liability failure-to-warn case.  The case is defensible; the warning label is not too bad.  But, when you check the trial court record, you find that trial counsel forgot to offer the warning label as an exhibit at trial.  The warning label was on the exhibit list.  The warning label was the subject of discussion with the trial judge before trial.  But trial counsel simply forgot to offer the label into evidence.

Do you rely on the warning label in your appellate brief, thus permitting you to win an appeal that you really should lose?

If you can gin up an argument as to why the warning label is actually in the record, maybe you can rely on the label on appeal:  “I’m not really appealing from the jury verdict after trial.  I’m appealing from some earlier decision of the trial court made on a record that included the warning label.”

Or maybe you figure that opposing counsel could waive the argument that the warning label isn’t properly before the appellate court.  Maybe you can rely on the warning label and hope that opposing counsel doesn’t object (and that the appellate court doesn’t notice).

That strikes me as a much closer case.  Perhaps you should confer with an ethicist before deciding whether you can use the warning label on appeal.

But, as a general principle, here’s the rule:  If you win a case — without committing any legal or ethical impropriety — you celebrate!  If you win a case in which the odds were against you, you celebrate even more!

You never commit ethical or legal impropriety.  Without that impropriety, there’s no reason to be ashamed.

# Where’s The Money?
## Collecting on that judgment after all avenues of appeal have been exhausted is a journey all its own.

One of the most difficult discussions that a lawyer has with her client or with a mediator is to assess the likelihood of judgment collectability. The client wants her pound of flesh, wants to go in to court with guns blazing, wants to spend “whatever it takes” to bring down that rascal defendant, and pound him into a quivering mass of jelly. Not so fast, hold your horses, whatever the phrase might be in the circumstances. Even if the plaintiff scores a desired verdict, it doesn’t necessarily follow that the vanquished defendant will whip out a checkbook and pay that judgment in full along with whatever costs and fees are due the plaintiff. (Don’t we all wish that happened in real life?)

Nope, collecting on that judgment after all avenues of appeal have been exhausted is a journey all its own, and it’s why some lawyers specialize in post-judgment collection. The [unfortunate thing from the plaintiff’s perspective](https://www.legaldive.com/news/litigation-funding-judgment-award-enforcement-recovery-burford-in-house-legal/694252/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202023-09-21%20Legal%20Dive%20%5Bissue:54722%5D&utm_term=Legal%20Dive) is that, often, defendants are judgment proof: they have no assets, at least none that can be found after a diligent search everywhere.

Or, even worse, the defendant agrees to pay some or all of the judgment, usually over time, and then files bankruptcy, discharging that judgment unless it meets one of the exceptions to discharge, further enraging the victorious plaintiff who may have to cough up any preferential payments made. Winning at trial doesn’t translate into a collectible judgment. Far too often, plaintiffs think that it’s a slam dunk after the win; it’s anything but that, and so it’s critical to advise clients that the easier part of the case was winning at trial; the far more difficult part is collecting on that judgment. Not an easy conversation but a necessary one for the perplexed and crestfallen client.

I have deliberately refrained from any Tom Girardi stories recently in deference to my editor, but no more. The hearing before a federal district court judge in Los Angeles into Girardi’s competency to stand trial has concluded, but it’s going to be some months before there’s a decision. The [Illinois criminal trial is on hold](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/girardi-illinois-trial-to-wait-for-california-competency-ruling?source=newsletter&item=document&region=digest%5Cs) until such time as there’s a decision here in California. In case you’ve forgotten, Girardi is facing criminal charges both in Chicago and in SoCal, for allegedly having ripped off clients’ settlement funds to the tune of millions of dollars. So, the district court’s decision will affect proceedings here and there.

But wait! There’s more. The parents of a son who died of cancer and who was represented by Girardi has filed a class-action lawsuit against the State Bar of California, alleging “gross negligence” and “reckless misconduct.” The lawsuit claims, among other things, that the California Bar “failed to do its job” and “actively protected Tom Girardi and [his firm] Girardi & Keese from ethical complaints and discipline for decades.” It also alleges: “Had the state Bar carried out its mission of protecting the public, this complaint, and many others like it, would not be necessary.”

The complaint further alleges that, rather than protecting the public as its first order of business, “state Bar officials were gallivanting around the country in Girardi’s private jet, staying at luxury hotels in Las Vegas, enjoying fine dining at expensive private clubs, attending lavish holiday parties with Hollywood entertainers, or attending concerts and other events, all paid for by Girardi.” As an administrative arm of the judicial branch, do you think the California State Bar should be able to [argue qualified immunity](https://abcnews.go.com/US/parents-defrauded-tom-girardi-after-losing-son-file/story?id=103000849)? The cherry on top of this sorry sundae: [Girardi mouthed an expletive](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-13/tom-girardi-utters-f-you-to-federal-prosecutor-as-judge-weighs-competency-to-stand-trial) at the federal prosecutor at the conclusion of the competency hearing,

Competent or not competent? You decide.

Moving from California to east of the Hudson River, a New York lawyer has pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Not only will he serve some years in the clink, he [also must forfeit $19 million](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/white-collar-and-criminal-law/new-york-lawyer-pleads-guilty-to-ponzi-scheme-money-laundering?source=newsletter&item=document&region=digest) (not a typo) in ill-gotten gains, including more than $6 million due to family members he fleeced. (Family dinners may not be happy occasions.)

[Bravo to Joe Patrice](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/law-schools-chatgpt-freak-out/?utm_campaign=ATL%20Weekly&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=275642319&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_q_Yb_WjU5dBOiyTd1sJEylFDO_6WOFibQq4XT0-jl1yQG4-PlLpNqAj51wMdqVxe7ARG0iB6_soHf1gRLy6sBXXlOPQ&utm_content=275642319&utm_source=hs_email) for making it clear that AI needs to fit within a lawyer’s practice, not the other way around. Chat GPT and other AI mechanisms are handy-dandy helpers in law practice, but they should not be the be-all and end-all. Yes, they can cite-check in less than a heartbeat (hopefully correctly). Lawyers read the cases (also, hopefully) so that they can tell the court whether the case is “on all fours” and, if not, why not. (Rarely is a case precisely on all fours, and it’s the ability to distinguish cited authorities that is a key one between us humans and AI.) I doubt that AI can stand at counsel table and answer the court’s pointed questions.

How many lawyers are letting AI do the heavy lifting and yet billing as if the attorney is doing the work? How to bill for the work AI has done? If AI can deliver decent work product in the blink of an eye, what happens to the billable hour? As Ken Crutchfield says, AI is only a tool and [not a replacement for lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/faster-horses/). At least, not yet.

# Top Biglaw Firm Adopts 'One-Size-Fits-All' Office Policy, Where Partners No Longer Rule The Real Estate Roost
## From partners to associates, everyone is on equal footing when it comes to office size at this firm.

King of the office no more…

In the wake of the pandemic and the rise of the hybrid work week, Biglaw firms are doing more with less when it comes to their real estate footprints — when it comes to office space, that is. Gone are the days of the expansive partner office compared to the humble spaces offered to associates. Firms are leaning in to a more “egalitarian” view when it comes to the offices where their attorneys work, and everyone from partner to associate will get what they get and they (hopefully) don’t get upset.

So, what kind of office space are they getting? At Freshfields, lawyers now find themselves in “one-size-fits-all” offices. We cracked a joke [earlier today](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/03/morning-docket-03-12-24/) that smaller offices for partners “ought to get [them] on board with working from home” but partners at the firm don’t seem to be too miffed about their smaller quarters — at least not publicly.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/03/12/freshfields-goes-to-one-size-attorney-offices-as-ny-space-mixes-egalitarian-and-vibrancy-405-137755/) has the details on the firm’s cozier office quarters:

[J]unior associates up through the most senior partners have solo work spaces that are each roughly 140 square feet, which is also “smaller than they were” at the previous office, at 601 Lexington, firm leaders say.

The verdict? At least two-plus weeks after officially making the move from Midtown Manhattan to the tip of the island, no one seems too upset about it.

[Sarah Solum](https://www.freshfields.us/contacts/find-a-lawyer/s/solum-sarah/), the firm’s U.S. managing partner, had this to say of the new Freshfields office space agenda: “I think the old way of doing things for law firms was to have giant partner offices and smaller associate offices. And that’s kind of a thing of the past.”

[Paul Humphreys](https://www.freshfields.us/contacts/find-a-lawyer/h/humphreys-paul/), New York managing office partner, told Am Law he downsized his office just like every other partner at Freshfields. “I don’t think any partner laments the loss of additional square footage,” he said.

What is your firm doing in terms of office space for attorneys? Do partners still work in sprawling spaces while associates are cloistered away in little nooks, or has your firm adopted an equitable vibe for their office space, where all lawyers use offices of the same size? Please please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) and let us know. Thanks.

In a [recent Above the Law post](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/despite-all-expectations-biglaw-had-a-very-profitable-2020/), Kathryn Rubino points out that, on average, the 100 highest-grossing Biglaw firms (Am Law 100) increased their revenue by 6.6 percent. When we read Ms. Rubino’s post which linked to a Law.com article by Dan Packel (“Against All Odds, The Am Law 100 Were Stunningly Successful in 2020”), three thoughts entered our minds.

First off, we say, “Bravo!” We’re happy to see our industry and many of our friends doing so well (at least in this slice of the legal industry, and we’re rooting for the rest of our industry to succeed, too). If there ever was a year when excellent, cutting-edge legal advice and services were needed and worthy of handsome compensation, it was 2020, a once-in-a-lifetime year with unimaginable challenges.

Our next thought is a shameless, self-laudatory “we told you so” point. Last spring, most media reports were all forecasting doom and gloom for the legal industry, reporting on compensation cuts, layoffs, furloughs and the like. On the other hand, a year ago, nearly to the day, in [this Above the Law post](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/covid-19-could-catalyze-the-legal-industry-renaissance/), we predicted the opposite, saying (among other things):

Until the dust settles, most would agree that the near-term demand for legal services will be only in “essential” areas, such as healthcare, employment, bankruptcy, and criminal law. The dust will eventually settle, though. Then there will be an UNPRECEDENTED level of demand for legal services. Unlike the aftermath of the 2008 Great Recession, where the legal industry was unable to drive any aspects of a recovery, the U.S. legal industry can be a critical force in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Legal industry professionals will pore over mounds of insurance policies, contracts, and other documents to assess the legal rights of the afflicted, to be followed by years of lawsuits. These lawsuits will be complex and multi-jurisdictional (or multi-national) and, quite literally, without precedent. Demand will skyrocket, giving the entire legal industry a serendipitous “do-over” to re-imagine new ways to deliver legal services.

We suggested that law firms think about reallocating their professionals to areas of immediate need (“surge lawyering”), considering tele-lawyering (which, of course, we all have now been doing for a while), and embracing innovation.  Many firms implemented much of what we suggested during 2020, some out of necessity and some out of strategic forethought. The reality is that, in turbulent times, lawyers tend to rise to the occasion, and talented lawyers are in high demand. The profession’s understanding of the dynamic nature of the law is critical to novel challenges, and good lawyers’ problem-solving skills are essential to navigating complex issues. When it comes to COVID-19-centric matters and other matters put on hold during the pandemic, we’re still in the early stages of the legal industry’s Renaissance Period that we had predicted.

Our third thought is: Okay, Biglaw: The pandemic forced your hand and afforded you some cover on making some long overdue (since 2008) “hard” decisions, and you made some of the changes that needed to be made. You’ve gotten the “do-over” that we predicted and made many positive moves.  We noted that, in 2008, the legal industry’s fairly quick economic recovery didn’t force any lasting, needed change but allowed for an industry-wide sense of complacency in which the industry could return to its “old” regressive habits.  The “do-over” has arrived, and it’s time to strategize on continuing the positive momentum to advance our industry during the “Renaissance Period.”

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Every week, we talk with countless legal professionals — in all areas of practice, in all sectors, at all levels — about challenges and opportunities in the legal industry; we consume as much content as we can about the legal industry; and we think constantly about how we, as legal professionals, can take positive, meaningful steps to make the legal profession the best that it can be. In this regard, we have some thoughts and suggestions on how to continue the positive momentum:

- If you want to do a good job for your clients, you need to make sure that you mentor (train) and sponsor (promote) a truly diverse workforce.
Our clients deserve the best advice and best service that we can offer.  This happens when service and advice is provided by a truly diverse workforce. We’ve all been in rooms in which people come to agreement on a plan quickly, and the plan falls apart later or yields suboptimal results. One of the likely causes is that everyone in the room has a mostly overlapping set of experiences (or put otherwise, they lack diversity in the broadest sense). If everyone has the same set of experiences, there’s no one in the room to say, “wait a minute — you haven’t factored in X or Y.” The more diverse your team and your team’s set of experiences is, the broader and deeper will be the strategies, tactics, and options that the team will pursue and implement. (One caveat: everyone on the team needs to feel comfortable with speaking up to discuss ideas. Silenced or unmentored diverse teams don’t help you make better decisions. When diverse legal teams are empowered to share their smart ideas, clients wind up receiving the best advice and service.)

- Solicit more client feedback.
Despite what one sees far too often in the media, clients and their lawyers ARE on the same side. It’s a principal-agent relationship guided by robust conflicts of interest principles to make sure that client interests come first. In other aspects of our lives today, we cannot escape customer feedback surveys, polls, likes, thumbs-up, thumbs-down, smiley faces, and frowns. Feedback loops in the legal industry, however, are rare even though client interests are not secret and clients will share what they value most. . They already share some views in the form of billing guidelines, by signaling what they prefer that their outside firms do (and how it’s done). But if a firm spends time — non-billable time — sitting down with major clients to solicit feedback and ask them what industry changes they foresee, it’s immeasurably easier to be able to partner with them to prepare for those changes. Clients don’t resent paying for a well-spent billable hour when they feel that it meets their standards and provides value. When clients see firms spinning wheels with inefficient workflow, though, that doesn’t lead to feelings of good hours having been billed. Misallocation of professionals (too many or the wrong experience level for particular tasks) won’t lead to good hours. Clients don’t expect firms to operate at a loss, but they expect their counsel to behave as true fiduciaries, with their best interests at heart. With a better feedback loop, you can help them help you.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
- Invest in legal tech that provides a measurable client benefit.
Law firms must invest in legal technology tools that extend beyond their own internal operational needs (Office365, billing & matter management, Zoom, etc..) and drive direct client benefits (e.g., contract automation, document review tools, etc….). There are just some things that computers do better than humans do. We already know this about things like the first cut in document production. Computers don’t get tired or hungry; they don’t get distracted out of boredom; they do things consistently, time and time again. Clients benefit from and encourage tech-enabled document review, which is more cost-effective than human first-cut reviews. As fiduciaries, lawyers are supposed to make decisions in their clients’ best financial interests as well as their best legal interests. Though we espouse this proposition as being in the best interest of clients (and law firms), we are mindful of a “knock-on” effect: it runs the risk of creating a legal “lost generation” of legal professionals. If law schools aren’t giving their students practical training, and if the work of a first- and second-year associate doesn’t include those tasks that trained all of us to know what to look for as we draft, or cull through documents, or take depositions, or negotiate, then those new associates won’t have a good foundation for developing their legal skills. Which leads us to:

- Biglaw (via the ABA) needs to remind law schools to train students to practice law (yes, Yale, we’re even talking about you).
Law schools are great at teaching theory, and great lawyers use theory to develop advances in the law. We applaud theory; however, theory devoid of a practical framework just trains people to be law professors (and there are precious few new law professor jobs out there). Everything that we know about pedagogy says that students learn best when they get to apply what they’re learning in new ways, when they get regular feedback, and when they learn in a variety of modalities. Historically, law schools have done nothing of this nature. During the pandemic, though, law professors have had to develop new ways of communicating material: pre-class videos or narrated PowerPoints; quizzes; small-group exercises, and the like. [As law schools revisit online education with the ABA’s Section on Legal Education](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/standards/), it’s time to develop the “applied theory” side of the equation to train students in a practical manner. If law professors are too far-removed from today’s practice of law, they can partner with adjuncts to provide some real-world lawyering practice. Why not “Contracts lab,” a one-hour course that lets students try their hands at drafting basic agreements? “Professional Responsibility lab” could give students a chance to deconstruct situations to see if any ethics issues arise and then try to resolve the issues. If we don’t want a lost generation of lawyers, then we need to bridge the gap between what law schools are teaching and what lawyers need their new colleagues to know.

- Data can be your friend.
Businesses today use technology and data to measure previously unimaginable things and make lots of money from the related business intelligence that’s been generated. [We’ve written recently about how auto insurers have been using telematic data to “watch” a driver’s driving behavior in real time to generate more accurate auto insurance underwriting metrics and how we could use the same principles in the legal profession.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3760626) Law firms are slowly realizing the enormous value of the raw data in their network, particularly their billing and timekeeping systems. Biglaw firms have billions of lines of data that tell them how long various tasks should take and who should be doing them. Those lines of data are called “time entries.” Data can tell managing partners who’s efficient, who’s not, who’s billing on time, who’s delaying submitting bills, how each partner’s realization rate is faring, and other equally valuable data points. Maybe no one in your firm has time to deconstruct what the data are telling you, but there are companies that can do that (and one of us runs one of those companies). The old way of pricing matters (“what do I feel that I should charge”) is leaving money on the table for law firms or frustrating clients with inaccurate budgets. Why not use the data you have to do a better job of pricing legal services and evaluating the behavior of legal professionals?

- Budgets can be your friend, too.
The old trope that “there’s fast, good, and cheap, but you can have only two of the three” only works for non-fiduciaries. Fiduciaries (that’s us!) have to have “good.” That leaves only “fast” and “cheap” as variables. It’s better to have the discussion with a client about how much a matter is likely to cost (remember, you already have that data in your timesheets) beforehand than to engage in work that a client thinks was well out of whack with what you promised to do. Unlike a few years ago, clients are not wasting time negotiating hourly rates anymore.  Instead, they are asking for budgets and treating the budgets as hard caps on matters both by phase and in the aggregate. Tracking a budget during the work on a matter lets you give your client a heads-up when the variables on which your budget depended have changed. Communication is a fiduciary duty, too, and your budget can help you communicate with your client in real time.

- Speaking of budgets, why don’t you save for a rainy day?
Other businesses use retained earnings to save for a rainy day (or for the next pandemic). You can, too.  Where accounting, tax, or financial issues preclude a law firm from keeping cash in the firm, there’s no question that a smart CFO can figure out how to effectuate the functional equivalent of retained earnings through prepayment of expenses or the like. The firms that did not have the make the “hard” decisions during the pandemic were those that had plenty of cash on hand or access to cash.

- Your most important investment is in your people.
Every time a firm loses someone who has given up on Biglaw, the firm loses the time spent in training that person (and the revenue that walks out the door when the person does). We know that law firms often disproportionately lose their colleagues of color and their female colleagues, which in turn affects a firm’s ability to staff a diverse team. We also know that most people who start at Biglaw don’t stay there forever. If you value your newest colleagues, invest in them. If you value your senior colleagues, invest in them, too, by planning what to do if and when they depart. Great leaders don’t last forever. People die. They retire. They leave for greener pastures. A firm that doesn’t have a solid succession plan, both at the top and at the departmental level, is missing an obvious way to deal with future crises. Moreover, a firm that doesn’t develop both the breadth and depth of their associates’ training (more expertise and more across-the-board skills) is one that won’t be able to pivot during the next crisis. Firms can’t reallocate associates with exceptionally narrow skills. Likewise, sophisticated clients know that when their outside counsel team is made up primarily of senior-level personnel, they will have significant switching and/or training cost when the senior-level personnel depart. Think broadly about what new things your colleagues can do to make your firm crisis-resistant.

If the post-2008 era taught us anything in the legal industry, it showed us the potential danger of complacency. The Renaissance is here, the “do-over” is possible, and the positive 2020 momentum can be continued.  The Am Law 100 has, on average, 6.6% more funds to invest, and there are no obvious immediate scares on the horizon. Let’s use these funds and the relative calm to become stronger.

3. You will be challenged. Working on important and complex cases for underrepresented clients will no doubt be a challenge, pushing you to become a more skilled and nuanced lawyer in the process.

4. You can work on cause-driven cases. Social impact law is not just about working on important cases; it’s also about working on cases about which you are passionate.

5. You may be your own boss. If you become a social impact lawyer, you may be your own boss, whether that means starting your law firm or joining an existing firm that shares your values. This is a great way to learn about the business of law and build your practice.

6. You may make a good living. Despite what you may think, you can actually make a good living as a social impact lawyer. In fact, many social impact lawyers are among the highest-paid lawyers in the country.

7. You can have a fulfilling career. The unique mixture of challenge and reward that accompanies a career as a social impact lawyer can ensure a sense of fulfillment not found in many other roles in the legal profession. It is a role that enables you to support yourself while changing the world for the better.

Are you tired of the drumbeat of depressing news when it comes to diversity in large law firms? You’re not alone.

It’s important, of course, for the legal profession to be aware of the diversity challenges it faces. At the same time, it gets demoralizing to constantly hear about the failures. It would be nice to hear some success stories, right?

Cue the crew from Vault, which just issued their newest (i.e., 2017) rankings of the [best law firms for diversity](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-for-diversity/?sRankID=36):

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Vault.com has released its Law Firm Diversity Rankings for 2017, and Ropes & Gray tops the list once again after ceding the Best Law Firm for Diversity accolade to Carlton Fields last year. Ropes & Gray takes the No. 1 spot in two sub-categories as well, Diversity for LGBT Individuals and for Individuals with Disabilities.

Congrats to Ropes, which has been killing it lately in the Vault surveys. It showed up in the [top 10 summer associate programs](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-summer-associate-programs-both-for-fun-times-and-for-training/) and took the #2 spot in the [quality of life rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-biglaw-quality-of-life-rankings/) (with #1 scores in the subcategories of firm culture and formal associate training).

The Vault rankings are based on associates rating how well their firm creates, maintains, and fosters a diverse workforce, with diversity construed as relating to minorities, women, LGBT individuals, individuals with disabilities, and military veterans. Vault ranks the [top 25 firms for diversity](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-for-diversity/?sRankID=36); here are the top 10 (with last year’s rank indicated parenthetically):

1. Ropes & Gray (3)
2. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe (not ranked)
3. Shook, Hardy & Bacon (7)
4. O’Melveny & Myers (10)
5. Carlton Fields (1)
6. Littler Mendelson (5)
7. Fried Frank (21)
8. Finnegan Henderson (6)
9. Baker Donelson (8)
10. Paul Hastings (2)

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As you can see, eight out of the top ten firms appeared in the top ten last year, and a ninth (Fried Frank) was in the top 25. Congrats to them on their continued commitment to diversity — and congrats to Orrick on rocketing up from being unranked to being #2.

Now let’s turn to a second set of diversity rankings, the American Lawyer’s [Diversity Scorecard](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202758333171/Law-Firms-Make-Slow-Progress-on-Diversity) (previously discussed in our pages by [diversity columnist Renwei Chung](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/corroding-pipelines-prevent-partnership-for-many-minority-lawyers/?rf=1)). The Am Law rankings are based on a firm’s percentage of minority attorneys and minority partners in U.S. offices (with “minority” defined to include Asian-American, African-American, Latino or Hispanic, Native American, and self-described multiracial attorneys).

Here are the top ten firms from Am Law’s 2016 Diversity Scorecard (with 2015 rank indicated parenthetically):

1. White & Case (1)
2. Fragomen (2)
3. Wilson Sonsini (3)
4. Wood Smith (7)
5. Fenwick & West (9)
6. Knobbe Martens (6)
7. Lewis Brisbois (NR)
8. Munger Tolles (5)
9. Cleary Gottlieb (13)
10. Curtis (4)

Finally, have a look at Law360’s [top ten firms for minority attorneys](http://www.law360.com/articles/794901/the-top-100-firms-for-minority-attorneys), which like the Am Law rankings focus on a firm’s minority representation at the partner and nonpartner levels and its total number of minority attorneys (but using a somewhat different universe of firms):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
1. White & Case
2. Berry Appleman
3. Lewis Brisbois (30)
4. Wilson Sonsini (1)
5. Fragomen (2)
6. Sughrue Mion (3)
7. Fenwick & West (7)
8. Ropes & Gray (8)
9. Atkinson Andelson (4)
10. Sterne Kessler (6)

Interesting — the #1 and #2 firms, White & Case and Berry Appleman, did not appear at all on [last year’s list](http://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/657666/the-100-best-law-firms-for-minority-attorneys). Perhaps they didn’t provide the requisite data? And the third-place firm, Lewis Brisbois, somehow rocketed up from #30 to #3. Otherwise, not a lot of movement; the other seven firms all appeared in the top ten last year.

Congratulations to the following firms that appeared on more than one of these top ten lists:

- Ropes & Gray: #1 for Vault, #8 for Law360
- White & Case: #1 for Am Law, #1 for Law360
- Fragomen: #2 for Am Law, #5 for Law360
- Wilson Sonsini: #3 for Am Law, #4 for Law360
- Fenwick & West: #5 for Am Law, #7 for Law360
- Lewis Brisbois: #7 for Am Law, #3 for Law360
And congratulations to all the firms that showed up on any of the three lists. Thanks to firms like you, there’s still hope for diversifying the ranks of Biglaw.

For many lawyers and judges, Caribbean islands are a top vacation destination. But on occasion, these tropical paradises can be marred by crime. In 2012, for example, Justice Stephen Breyer was [robbed at knife point](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/02/breaking-justice-breyer-robbed-at-knife-point/) at his vacation home on Nevis.

Nobody was injured during the Breyer robbery. That was not the case with the crime recently committed against [Mike Jones](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=220&itemID=7897), a D.C.-based litigation partner at Kirkland & Elis, as reported over the weekend by [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-tourist-vacationing-turks-caicos-shot-armed-robbery/story?id=48934634):

An American tourist vacationing with his family in Turks and Caicos had to be medically evacuated to Florida after he was shot during an armed burglary Friday night.

The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force said a 57-year-old U.S. citizen was shot by a masked gunman while in his vacation villa in the Leeward residential area of of Providenciales, an island in the Turks and Caicos archipelago, around 10:12 p.m. local time Friday. The man suffered from a single gunshot wound to his upper body and was immediately transported to a local hospital, where police said he was listed in stable condition.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Whenever a terrible crime like this happens, people stress the need to be careful. What’s especially frightening about this crime is that the Jones family was careful. They took security measures, which the robbers [overcame](http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-tourist-vacationing-turks-caicos-shot-armed-robbery/story?id=48934634) (emphasis added):

Commissioner of the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force, James Smith, told ABC News that investigators believe at least two suspects forcibly entered the private villa intending to rob the property. The villa was secured with an alarm system and a security guard, whom police later found had been “lightly bound” at the scene with his own shoe laces, Smith said.

The suspects fled with a stolen laptop, and they remain at large.

As for Mike Jones, a prominent and successful litigator focused on mass torts and product liability litigation, he is fortunately on the road to recovery. Here’s what K&E told [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/08/01/kirkland-partner-survives-gunshot-wound-during-turks-and-caicos-getaway/?kw=Kirkland%20Partner%20Survives%20Gunshot%20Wound%20During%20Turks%20and%20Caicos%20Getaway&et=editorial&bu=Law.com&cn=20170801&src=EMC-Email&pt=AfternoonUpdate):

Mike Jones, a partner in our Washington, D.C., office, was shot during a burglary while on vacation with his family. Mike was treated successfully and is in stable condition and is expected to fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with Mike and his family, and we look forward to welcoming him back after his recovery.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to Jones and his family as well. Let’s hope he’s back on his feet and back in the courtroom, doing well and [doing good](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-college-segregation-lawsuit-20170108-story.html), very soon.

UPDATE (8/2/2017, 8:47 a.m.): Additional comment from someone who knows Mike Jones: “Great story! That dude is tough as nails. I’m shocked the bullet didn’t bounce off and run away.”

I have two kids, ages 6 years and 18 months. Obviously they are not vaccinated, which is a big concern. My firm will be mandating all employees be vaccinated as a condition of employment (subject to religious and medical accommodations), which significantly decreases my concern.

I have a great deal of frustration towards those who are unvaccinated and therefore perpetuating the pandemic—and all of its effects on me, my family and the rest of my community—due to their selfish choices.

— an unnamed associate at an Am Law 200 firm, commenting on their firm’s vaccination requirement and their [feelings about those who remain unvaccinated](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/06/as-law-firms-return-to-office-anger-over-unvaccinated-colleagues-could-boil-over-405-88887/) during a time when COVID-19 cases continue to rise and vaccination rates continue to fall. Law firm employees may still be working remotely, but the tension between those who are vaccinated and those who are not is thick.

# DLA Piper Announces No Special Bonuses For Hard Working Associates
## Associates are understandably 'livid.'

DLA Piper is a ginormous firm — we’re talking 3rd highest grossing law firm in the world kinda big — and the kind that *usually* fancies themselves as having top of the market compensation. So you can’t really blame associates at the firm for kinda assuming they’d wind up paid the same amount of money as the top of Biglaw. Unfortunately for DLA Piper associates, that is not to be.

This year, associates all across Biglaw are in line for special bonuses in addition to the typical year-end bonuses. These special bonuses became [all the rage among elite Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) starting in the fall, and are an extra special thank you for associates’ hard work during the pandemic. At most of the elite Biglaw firms, the special bonuses range from $7,500 to $40,000, depending on class year, and, again, are on top of the year-end bonus numbers. But it looks like DLA Piper associates are missing out.

Yesterday, management at DLA Piper held an associate town hall meeting, and announced that while they view themselves as a market leader on compensation, associates would not be getting those special bonuses. From an insider at the firm:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Today at the associate town hall, DLA made it expressly clear that no special bonuses would be provided. However, felt it was appropriate to reiterate that they view themselves not only as top end of the market compensation but as compensation leaders. Did not go over well with the associates.

Co-US Managing Partner Rick Chesley says “let me be very very clear, we are not doing a special bonus, a Covid bonus, or any other supplemental bonus.” Devastating!

To be clear, this is the most generous to the firm reaction Above the Law has gotten from tipsters, and it still refers to the firm’s decision as “disappointing”:

DLA Piper held an Associate Town Hall on the evaluation process today. Firm management today confirmed there would be no special/COVID bonuses but haven’t put anything in writing (as far as I know). The main reason cited was fiscal conservatism. Not shocking, but still disappointing given the bonus activity of peer biglaw firms.

Most reactions were downright angry, like this tipster who gloriously refers to the move as “horseshit” and says it’ll hurt the firm’s ability to recruit and retain the top talent:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
We get a market bonus, but no special COVID bonus. Just a lot of words of appreciation for associates – the backbone of the firm. I am pissed. DLA is one of the top grossing firms, and we have repeatedly been told how well the firm has done this year. The firm said they’re a market leader and not a market follower, which is why we’re not getting special bonuses. Absolute horseshit. On top of that, we still have to bill 2,000 hours. DLA is being cheap, and it’ll cost them. I’m already looking to move somewhere I’m more valued.

And there were some… interesting justifications for the decision:

Firm management just had an associate-wide town hall where they broke the news that they are not providing any “special” COVID bonuses. Managing partner justified this by stating “We’re a market leader, not a market follower.”

Ummm. Leaders lead from the FRONT, not trailing up to $40K behind… just saying.

No COVID bonuses on the grounds that it is “not market”. Associates are, understandably, livid.

And there’s definitely a perception of management trying to pull a fast one, with frequent proclamations about the financial health and eliteness of the firm while not ponying up the same cash as associates could be making at other firms:

The whole thing is galling. Do they think we are stupid? Just be honest and say you don’t want to do it. We just had a firm call yesterday with management bragging about how this is the best year ever and we are outperforming all our peers. Then you say only half our “peer group” is giving special bonuses. It’s almost insulting to the intelligence. Just be honest and transparent. Because it is easy to see that all, or almost all, the firms that are our real peers are giving the special bonuses. And on the other hand they always brag about our peers being the likes of Latham. Obviously, they are cherry picking a different peer group when deciding on bonuses. So when they want to brag about how great we are, they select a peer group that is the best of the best. But when it comes to deciding bonuses, they are choosing a peer group that is much less elite in order to be cheap on bonuses. After a tough year, the lack of honesty is quite annoying. Especially when they constantly brag about how great the firm is doing financially (apparently we are up year over year and they say many of our peers are down 10-15%). Maybe if you guys lambaste them for this nonsense they will actually do what they say. If they want to be a “market leader” and pay “market bonuses”, both of which are things they said on the call, then the market is clear, it is the standard Cravath bonus scale plus special bonuses. If you do not pay special bonuses, you are way less than market for senior associates and certainly not a market leader. If you want to talk the talk then walk the walk. But they talk elite and walk below average.

It definitely stinks for those putting in the work of elite Biglaw associates but seeing significantly smaller compensation than their peers at other firms.

When Katharine H. Parker, lately of Proskauer Rose, had to sign off one final time to assume her new position as [a Magistrate Judge in the Southern District of New York](http://www.sdnyblog.com/sdny-welcomes-a-new-magistrate-judge-katharine-parker/), she knew she wasn’t going to go out with the usual wall of canned platitudes. Parker dared to think a little outside the box.

What we got instead was a clever mock order from the new judge to the Proskauer faithful. The best mandate though?

Don’t let me take myself too seriously after I become a judge.

# Law Professor Bashes 'Fragile Children' In Classes Without Cold Calling... Internet Erupts
## How can students learn if they aren't frightened and humiliated all the time?

Every few years, we have to have a robust public debate over cold calling law students. Some professors swear by it, citing… dubious justifications. Other folks revile the practice as an archaic throwback of [little educational benefit](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/06/former-law-prof-says-the-socratic-method-is-a-shty-method-of-teaching/) — indeed, there is [good evidence that it’s detrimental](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/05/socratic-method-linked-to-female-underachievement-in-law-school/) — that law schools continue to employ out of blind devotion to tradition.

This year’s edition of the debate kicked off with this message from Chicago Law’s [Adam Mortara](https://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/mortara), the guy who [spends his free time](https://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/adam-mortara-01chicago-maroon-profile-lead-trial-counsel-students-fair-admissions-lawsuit) unraveling social progress to make university admissions safe for white people again.

So, obviously, he has deep thoughts on how education should work.

“Judges don’t let you put up the red light when you don’t want to answer” because but they also don’t grab lawyers at random and ask them to start arguing a motion. If you’re in front of a judge, you did, in fact, “put on the green light” and prepare for the grilling.

Law students are a high-achieving bunch. They managed to get into that lecture hall based on 20 years of schooling that does NOT treat every class as an exercise in anxiety and ridicule so relying on students volunteering to speak seems to work for them so far.

Here is a hill I will die on: cold calling doesn’t reflect anything about practice. You will NEVER appear in court on behalf of a client without at least some notice that you’re on deck and exactly what case/issue you are responsible for.

Personally, I like the Socratic Method as a format but flatly reject the idea of cold calling. Assign students in advance to be on call for a specified set of materials. It hews much closer to the real world practice of lawyering where you’re going to know you’re going to get called on, drilled down on your cases, and anticipated follow ups. Everyone gets a turn in the classroom spotlight, but everyone has an opportunity to display their best effort.

And this all still assumes law students are all gunning to be litigators, which we know statistically isn’t the case. In my experience, tax lawyers huddle in their offices and churn out brilliance with as little human interaction possible. As far as I can tell, they live in those offices and the firm leaves them a bucket of fish heads outside the door for sustenance. What’s the point of making them perform an impromptu song and dance on larceny?

Bottom line, you aren't ready to practice until you've been on the receiving end of Socratic method from a law professor who hasn't practiced. That is the best way to get you ready for the practice.[#Satire](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Satire?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#lawtwitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/lawtwitter?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

At least Mortara practices. His practice is affirmatively deplorable, but it’s practice. Though many champions of cold calling are career academics repeating the practice either out of tradition or to experience a giddy thrill proving how much smarter they are after decades spent studying these materials than a bunch of 1Ls.

Can we please put an end to dogged adherence to tradition?

Every profession should critically examine its practices every so often. It may be that many of those practices will be retained; but keeping things as they are because “that’s the way we’ve always done it” isn’t exactly inspiring to the next generation of professionals.

Indeed.

Anyway, watching himself get positively lit up on social media, Mortara tried to dig himself out by appealing to the highest authority on law school practice:

# Weil Associates Were Waiting, This Firm Raised Salaries

Tick tock… associates at firms across the country are growing impatient with firms that have yet to announce raises. The wait is over at Weil Gotshal, which let loose its salary news earlier this afternoon, much to associates’ delight. Weil took home $1,657,603,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 17 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, so there was certainly enough wealth to share to make the firm look appealing for laterals in this market.

Here’s what salaries will look like at Weil going forward:

- 2021: $202,500
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000

It’s also worth noting that the firm will be increasing salaries for all of its three-year counsel promoted since 2020 by $25,000. (Three-year counsel are those eligible for partnership within three years; if they don’t make partner within that time frame, they’ll be transitioned out of the firm.) All other counsel adjustments will be made on a case-by-case basis.

Congratulations to everyone at Weil!

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

Which Biglaw attorney penned a recent cease & desist letter on behalf of Hunter Biden demanding Donald Trump stop defaming him?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Hint: The lawyer wrote a letter demanding the former president stop making defamatory remarks about the current president’s son, saying, “I am a little surprised to have to send this because it would seem that Mr. Trump is currently facing enough legal problems that he would not want to create any more liability for saying and doing things that could result in harm and injury, and because it appears you have enough to do in defending your client in various arenas now and to come.”

# Early Biglaw Salary Mover Re-Raises Associate Compensation
## Congrats on your 2nd raise!

Fenwick & West [was super early](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-salary-raises-gain-steam-with-another-big-money-match/) on the associate raise train, matching the [Milbank scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) — then the highest in Biglaw — within a day. But the concern for firms fast on the draw is that the scale will change after you’ve already made your big announcement. And that’s what happened — [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/?rf=1) came over the top with a slightly more generous package. Then Cravath matched that DPW scale and a new market standard was born.

But that wasn’t the final word from Fenwick. The firm announced to associates they’d play the re-raise card — matching the new prevailing compensation grid. The firm (which announces salary by tiers, rather than by class year) will be giving associates an extra $5,000-$10,000, effective July 3rd. It’s a move I’m sure will keep associates happy.

Fenwick’s new, new scale:

# What's The Matter (With Associates)?
## If it doesn’t matter to the powers that be, why should it matter to the junior lawyer?

What does “matter” mean?

How to define the word “matters” or “matter.” There are all sorts of definitions, depending, of course, on context.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As a [noun, it can mean](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/matter#dictionary-entry-1) a subject under consideration, a basis of disagreement, or a particular situation. The word also can be defined in physical and biological terms. As a [verb, it’s defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/signify) as having significance, having meaning.

One of the issues confronting employers, who want their employees to return to work, is the issue of matter. A junior associate, pouring over documents, propounding or responding to discovery, or similar drudge work wonders whether the work she is doing matters. The answer is maybe. It could be busy work for that associate to justify her hire, satisfying the anxious senior associate or junior partner that no stone has been left unturned, or any other reason that someone involved in the matter (noun, not verb) feels must be done. That leads to the ultimate question: does she matter?

As we all know, crap runs downhill, and so that person at the bottom of the hill feels like crap because, often, there’s no appreciation shown for the work done, even if it is busy work in a superior’s eyes. But it is not busy work for that junior puppy who is trying to learn, to fit in, to understand the issues, to understand what is expected, in other words what matters (verb, not noun). And let’s not forget pleasing those above her, those who matter to her career.

If it doesn’t matter to the powers that be, why should it matter to the junior lawyer? That’s one of the reasons why pulling people back into the workplace is like pulling teeth, never a pleasant experience. It’s going back to the days of “command performances,” [in Disney’s case](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2023/01/10/Disney-Covid-Bob-Iger-work-remote/3821673360040/), at least four days a week.

Lots of people, especially younger ones, have fallen in love with remote work, with working from home, and the attendant reduction in costs, especially childcare and, yes, elder care, too. There can be fewer expenses such as commuting costs, weekday lunches, and other things that you shell out for in a work week.

Everyone wants to think that they matter, that they are not just cogs in a wheel, that they are not just hamsters spinning mightily on that treadmill, that what they do matters, and who they are matters. [These are not just platitudes](https://470182.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/470182/ATL_Associate-Perspectives-New-Normal_2022Report.pdf).

There’s a strong correlation between mattering and mental health, and if we have learned anything these past three years, mental health is a huge issue for all of us. Surgeon General of the United States Vivek Murthy has emphasized the importance of mattering at work:

People want to know that they matter to those around them and that their work matters. [Knowing you matter](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/10/20/us-surgeon-general-releases-new-framework-mental-health-well-being-workplace.html) has been shown to lower stress, while feeling like you do not can increase the risk for depression. To better assure a culture of mattering at work, workplaces can (1) provide a living wage, (2) engage workers in workplace decisions, (3) build a culture of gratitude and recognition, and (4) connect individual work with organizational mission.

None of these are hard to do if people are willing to take the time and effort to invest in their employees at all levels. No one is exempt from the various forms of depression, anxiety, and stress that pervade the workplace. A 2020 Cigna survey estimated that loneliness is costing companies more than $154 billion annually in “stress-related absenteeism alone.” How high are your workers’ compensation premiums?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Everyone likes to be involved in decision-making. Everyone likes to understand how the work that they are doing connects to the case at hand. No one likes working in a vacuum. Who knows, some people might well have insights that make the job easier, or spot an issue that no one has thought about, in other words, improving the wheel without reinventing it. No one ever has all the answers, not even you Harvard and Yale grads, and, as you’ll learn, the longer you’ve been out of law school, the less your pedigree means to those you need to help you get the work done. The less it’ll mean to clients. They don’t care where you went to law school. Even if initially impressed, that impression fades fast. Trust and respect matter. Everyone likes to be recognized, to think that they make a difference. Meaning means different things to different people, but everyone strives for it.

It’s not just showing employees that they matter; it’s [also good for the bottom line](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-power-of-mattering-at-work-11669910125). And simple things, such as manners, “please” and “thank you,” can make all the difference; those words are very hard for some to say. It’s valuing contributions made towards the goals, it’s telling people, even if they didn’t get much of a raise or a bonus, that their contributions matter.

[Here’s Exhibit A](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/firm-parts-ways-with-lawyer-who-called-maternity-leave-sitting-on-your-ass/) for how not to behave, how not to show trust and respect toward your colleagues, especially those on protected leave, how not to show that people in the firm matter. Maternity leave is definitely not “sitting on your ass.” Either this lawyer has no kids, or his spouse has total responsibility for newborns. He and his firm have parted ways. His tirade doesn’t matter any longer, and neither does he.

# Former Biglaw Attorney Goes On Anti-Asian Racist Social Media Rant

Christina Ignatius

A former Jones Day An attorney (at least according to her [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinaignatius/)) turned law tutor (whatever that means) finds herself in the middle of a social media sh*tstorm. [Christina Ignatius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinaignatius/) took to Facebook to unleash a racially charged rant — nominally inspired by the hit movie Crazy Rich Asians — to let loose on all manner of offensive stereotypes about Asian people.

UPDATE: A spokesperson for Jones Day reached out to Above the Law about this story. Despite what her LinkedIn profile says, the firm is, justifiably, distancing itself from Ignatius:

Notwithstanding her claim to the contrary, Christina Ignatius is not, and has never been, a Jones Day lawyer.  Over eight years ago, Jones Day hired a third-party vendor to review documents for a few month period, and Ms. Ignatius was on the third party vendor’s team that helped in that review.  That is her only connection to this Firm.

In a Facebook post that was shared on the Chapman Law Alumni group page (it’s since been deleted), Ignatius rails against Asians that “took over Orange County” — propagating the trope of Asians as bad drivers and ridiculing her perception of a generically Asian accent — and calls dealing with Asians “one annoying thing after another.”

It’s jaw-droppingly awful, and you should really read it in full:

And then comes the backlash. Oh, don’t worry — despite using an offensive term like “rice rocket,” using pidgin English to describe what Asians might say, and calling white men who marry Asian women “suckers,” Ignatius doesn’t back down from her statements.

In the first response to the burgeoning controversy, she says she “had no idea that talking about stereotypes would be so provocative.” Well, here she is smashing the stereotype that lawyers are smart. But seriously, let’s be clear here: her original post isn’t some academic discussion of stereotypes — it advances harmful assumptions about what all Asians have, do, say, think, and want. But she ends her post insisting — despite all the evidence to the contrary —  that “I do not hate Asians. I really love them and find differences to be funny and interesting.”

You can read the full non-apology yourself:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And she had another rant on social media (and it’s a long-ass doozy of a post) that is a cavalcade of distracting BS meant to provide some sort of cover for the awful things in her first post. This time, she calls out law schools for touting diversity as a smokescreen to increase enrollment numbers, which, fair enough. Goodness knows that’s a hobby horse this blog has been forwarding for years, but what ON EARTH does that have to do with Ignatius’s original post?

Ignatius also name checks controversial Yale Law School professors Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld, as if their work somehow justifies anything she said. I’m… not going to turn this into a post about Chua and Rubenfeld — they have to defend their controversial opinions all the damn time (something Ignatius has steadfastly avoided) — and they get[ dragged](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/yale-prof-promotes-brett-kavanaughs-extraordinary-ability-to-hire-her-daughter/) plenty here, so let’s just put a pin into that red herring.

Let’s be clear: in the word vomit of a follow-up post, Ignatius makes no apology for her hurtful words — though it does, bizarrely, make clear she never got dumped by an Asian guy… um, okay? And she also hates people she went to law school with (remember the post went viral when it was posted in a law school alumni group). The amount of other people who Ignatius blames for some measure of her present pickle combined with a complete lack of personal accountability for her own post is astounding.

According to a [statement made](https://www.ocregister.com/2018/09/01/irvine-attorney-says-she-is-receiving-threats-over-controversial-asian-post-on-facebook/) to the Orange County Register, Ignatius claims she’s received threats as a result of going viral. But she still refuses to apologize, saying, “I’m kind of a silly girl, who is fun and easygoing… My life is not news.” She also says that because she “loves” Asians and had no hatred when she wrote her post, then her casual racism should be ignored:

“I didn’t have any intent of anger and hatred,” said Christina Ignatius, who claims to be the top law school tutor in the United States. “If you have no malintent, you didn’t do anything wrong.” Earlier this week, Ignatius on Facebook compared Orange County Asians to the cast of the hit movie “Crazy Rich Asians.”

She calls herself [“Tenacious Ignatius” on social media](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinaignatius/) — but it seems like “Racist Ignatius” is far more accurate.

UPDATE: Leah Wilson, Executive Director of the State Bar of California, has made the following statement about Ignatius’s social media blitz:

“Racial bias has no place in the practice of law. By statute and to protect the integrity of the attorney discipline process, whether a complaint has been filed with the State Bar and whether an investigation is in process are confidential. The State Bar thoroughly reviews all complaints of attorney misconduct and must adhere to the current rules governing attorney conduct. We work to ensure that all Californians have access to qualified and ethical attorneys. Additionally, effective November 1, new ethics rules for attorneys will include specific provisions to allow the State Bar to better hold attorneys accountable for discrimination and harassment based on race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other protected categories, in their representation of clients and in law firm operations.”

# Baker McKenzie Partner Out After Bullying Allegations
## Troubling allegations at the Biglaw firm.

No one starts a career in Biglaw thinking it’ll be “easy.” And that’s fair, since it’s generally high-stakes work with pressing deadlines, meaning a ripe environment for stress. But too often the behavior of attorneys — usually partners or senior lawyers — takes a turn for the toxic, creating an abusive environment.

The latest example of this are the allegations [Jamie Hamilton at Roll on Friday dug up](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-former-staff-speak-endemic-bullying-baker-mckenzie-shakes-joburg-office) on Baker McKenzie shareholder, Morne van der Merwe.  The allegations against van der Merwe — the now former managing partner of the firm’s Johannesburg office — have words like “bullied,” “demeaned,” and “degraded” bandied about… which is not a great look.

Hamilton reports:

‘Alice’, a Candidate Attorney (the South African equivalent of a trainee) in Baker McKenzie’s Johannesburg office, said she “suffered emotional abuse, severe bullying from the top employees, and faced sexist comments non stop to the point where I had a breakdown”.

In a complaint she handed to the firm, Alice described how she was dropped from a matter when she was unable to leave hospital where she was receiving an intravenous drip for a health condition. “I was called several times to come back to take notes for a call”, but, “I could not leave with the IV only halfway done. When I got back to the office, I was thrown off the matter”.

Other partners had stories of problematic behavior as well:

‘Tom’ joined Bakers’ Joburg office as a partner from a well-regarded firm. “When I started working with Morne, the initial conflict was around my approach to matters compared to his approach to matters. Suddenly I was being treated very much as an associate”, he said.

Tom claimed he was not allowed to communicate directly with clients, and instead had to place his emails in a senior partner’s drafts folder – “and he would send them out, under his name”, said the lawyer.

“There was a deep unhappiness in the department”, said Tom. “I was coming in at a senior level, and I found that I was constantly having to deal with crying people, people who were upset, people who were shouted at”.

And there are allegations about the firm’s handling of a controversial client and scapegoating a single partner rather than take responsibility for the representation as a firm:

Sonia De Vries joined the Joburg office as a partner in August 2016. She left less than two years later when the press criticised Bakers after it was found to be representing Jonas Makwakwa, an executive accused of being involved in South Africa’s state capture scandal. She claimed at the time that she was being scapegoated for accepting Makwakwe as a client, even though the office had vetted the instruction.

“Suddenly the MP had amnesia, and couldn’t remember authorising it”, said a former colleague. “She was a single mother, two kids, and they threw her under a bus. She went into a panic. They could care less. All she asked was for three months’ notice. They asked her to leave immediately. They had another female partner meet with her on the Saturday, to make her more pliable, and on Monday she was told she was no longer required to come to the office, and her employment was terminated with immediate effect”.

De Vries’s own description of the events is revealing about what life in the Johannesburg office was really like:

De Vries wrote in 2018 to management outside of South Africa about her concerns.

….

She described how she was confronted in a management committee meeting where “I was in effect suspended and instructed to work from home. This was an exceptionally traumatic event, exacerbated by” one individual’s “aggressive behavior directed at me”.

But “the humiliation and embarrassment continued”, said De Vries, who wrote that “I had to ask for permission to attend at the BMSA offices and then could only access a boardroom”.

(Another lawyer recalled undergoing a similar public shaming after they quit, where they were made to wait for hours in a communal area before being allowed into the office: “They wanted to demean you. It was a degrading thing to do. That’s the kind of people they are”, they said.)

Regarding her resignation, De Vries wrote, “Quite simply, I was bullied into it”.

Before De Vries could take further action, she died of an aneurism. A colleague said they believed that, based on discussions with De Vries’s family and children, her death was caused “in no small part by the stress she suffered as a result of her mistreatment by the firm”.

When confronted with the allegations of bullying, Esteban Raventos, an Executive Committee member at Baker McKenzie, said in August, “We are deeply concerned about the workplace and cultural issues in our Johannesburg office and are resolute as a global team to put this right.” It was also reported that van der Merwe quietly stepped down from his management role.

That was then, and now van der Merwe’s out of the firm, from a statement:

“Morne van der Merwe has stepped down as a Principal of Baker McKenzie and, with effect from 01 September 2021, as a director and shareholder of Baker McKenzie Inc in Johannesburg. He will leave the Firm on 14 September 2021″, the firm said in a statement.

While welcome, the move was a long time coming, as a former attorney at the Johannesburg office of Baker McKenzie[ told Roll on Friday:](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/former-south-africa-managing-partner-leaves-baker-mckenzie-amid-bullying-claims)

“I, like many others, left BMSA as a direct result” of “bullying and abuse”, and that while the firm in her opinion “ought to have taken steps” a long time ago, the overhaul “presents an opportunity for the firm to rebuild”.

As for who’s left in charge: Dutch partners Erik Scheer and Mirjam de Blecourt are “supporting” the Johannesburg office as part of a “transitional leadership team.”

# Another Firm Announces It Will Only Be Hiring Cheap And Desperate Associates This Fall
## If you pay below market salaries, you're going to get below market talent.

For about a week now, Greenberg Traurig has been out on an island, standing alone as an allegedly “Biglaw” firm publicly refusing to give its associates a cost-of-living increase.

But Greenberg Traurig’s managing partner [gave an interview resisting raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/greenberg-traurig-explains-why-its-too-cheap-to-raise-associate-salaries/) before Cravath joined the salary wars.

Now, we have somebody coming out after Cravath, and most other Biglaw firms, are getting into the salary wars game. Reed Smith’s global head of personnel, Casey Ryan, [told Am Law this morning](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/06/19/reed-smith-citing-interests-of-clients-wont-increase-associate-salaries/) that the firm has “has no current plans to increase associate starting salaries in any location.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ryan said it was in the best interests of its clients.

Reed Smith knows its internal financials and industry standing better than I do. If the firm is telling us that it’s not good enough to raise fees without its clients looking for better counsel elsewhere, who are we to argue?

Clients are looking for different things, some are looking for the best lawyers they can find, others are looking for the cheapest. Reed Smith has to keep its own counsel about how to position itself in the market.

But it is worth pointing out that raising fees is not required to raise associate salaries. I know this is going to sound crazy, but partners could bank less profit in order to keep their employees on par with market salary. That is also a thing that can be done.

Why would Reed Smith even consider such a move? Well, it’s all about recruiting the next generation of Reed Smith lawyers. On-campus interviewing starts soon. There are now a number of firms that students can go to that pay more money than Reed Smith (or Greenberg Traurig). Sure, if you have crap grades and no options, Reed Smith is still offering you a “Biglaw” salary. But if you have options, why would you still go to Reed Smith?

Even if they eventually raise salaries later, you’ll know they’re doing it reluctantly. You’ll know that they’ll always be laggards in market compensation.

And you know that you’ll be treated shabbily. Reed Smith announced this move to press outlets BEFORE announcing it to associates. The associates we spoke with [found out from Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2018/06/19/reed-smith-opts-against-associate-salary-hikes-holding-rates-steady-in-all-offices/?slreturn=20180519142110).

Most of a law firm’s dirty laundry can be hidden from new talent during the recruiting phase. But money is an objective indication of worth. Reed Smith is airing its drawers on a clothesline for everybody to see, right before recruiting.

But hey, “clients” right? I’m sure clients will enjoy saving the buck, and probably not even notice that Reed Smith is now going to have to recruit from the desperate classes.

# International Biglaw Firm Raises Associate Salaries By 15% Following Record Year
## The race to raise salaries is still going strong.

Bonus season for large law firms is nigh, but that doesn’t mean that 2021’s compensation increases have ended. In fact, it’s not just U.S. firms that have gotten in on the action when it comes to increasing wages for associates. The salary scene across the pond in London is on fire right now, and down under in Australia, three firms have substantially raised base pay this week alone.

[Gadens](https://www.gadens.com/) is the latest Australian firm to increase pay for its associates (and staff members, too). [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/2021/11/08/australian-firm-gives-all-lawyers-15-pay-raise-after-record-revenue-292-100160/) has the details:

In an email to staff, chairman Jeremy Smith and [chief executive officer] Mark Pistilli said the firm wanted to reward the hard work of staff in producing record revenue for the firm.

“We want to recognise your ongoing contribution by an across the board increase in the remuneration of all of our lawyers by 15%, and the rest of our staff by 5%, from 1 January 2022,” the pair wrote in the email, which was obtained by Law.com International.

The firm will still pay its regular fee- and performance-based bonuses next year and will also offer lawyers the opportunity to earn a one-off bonus covering the period from July to December this year.

# Yeehaw! Texas Biglaw Firm Lassos Some New York Bonuses For Associates
## Very exciting news. Congrats!

Associates deep in the heart of Texas are about to saddle on up to some big-time bonuses.

Earlier this afternoon, the members of the executive committee at Vinson & Elkins — which brought in $912,337,000 gross revenue in 2021, placing it at No. 56 in the most recent Am Law 100 — informed associates that the firm would be matching the prevailing market bonus rates, all the way up to the class of 2015 and beyond.

Here’s the bonus scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
As noted in the memo, “consistent with past practice, the Firm expects to pay supplemental bonuses to Associates who had an exceptional year.” Associates can expect to see their bonus bucks on January 31, 2023.

Congratulations on your bonuses, V&E associates!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Vinson & Elkins.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks for your help!

# Winston & Strawn The Next Target Of Blum And His Diversity Haters
## Hoping That Third Time's The Failure.

The members of the Anti-Equity Troupe are back with their spite suits. This time, they have their sights on Winston & Strawn. Perkins Coie and Morrison Foerster modified the wording of their fellowships after Blum + Co. prodded at their programs, but Winston & Strawn may have a little more moxie. From [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/winston-strawn-is-third-firm-hit-with-blum-groups-dei-suit):

Blum’s American Alliance for Equal Rights [alleges](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/AmericanAllianceforEqualRightsvWinstonStrawnLLPDocketNo423cv04113?doc_id=X7V9EURQN89A9ACRGLLD5HO287) Winston & Strawn’s program “discriminates against certain applicants because of their race.”…“It is our hope that Winston & Strawn will be compelled by the courts to follow the law,” Blum said in a statement.

Thankfully, Winston & Strawn’s response has a bit of bite to it:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Your implication that the terms ‘disadvantaged’ and ‘historically underrepresented’ necessarily refer to race is baseless,” Winston partner Cardelle Spangler said. “Winston & Strawn does not make employment decisions on the basis of race or ethnicity.”

Could this be the disparate impact affirmative action lawsuit that we’ve all been waiting for? We all know that Black people are not the only Americans that are poor. But, due to the long running American tradition of screwing over Black pockets with policy choices, many Black families are fighting poverty. Does that necessarily make low income a proxy for Black? No, but groups like [Wisconsin Institute For Law And Liberty used that argument to say that Pell Grant relief was too Black to be constitutional](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/this-is-where-id-have-bidens-debt-relief-if-it-wasnt-for-those-darned-black-people-says-wisconsin-institute-for-law-and-liberty/) and you can best believe that mirroring arguments will be made against programs that take historical underrepresentation into account.

# Landing A Case
## Want that case? You're going to have to work harder than everyone else to get it.

Sometimes, when we’re named in a new lawsuit, we actually have a couple of firms come into our office and make presentations.  We pick the firm that, among other things, is more impressive during the pitch.

But sometimes we just send out copies of the complaint, and we ask a couple of firms for their reactions.

Not surprisingly, the responses to these requests makes a difference.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The routine reaction is descriptive.  It has three sections.  The first section is titled, “The Complaint.”  That section summarizes the complaint.  That’s nice, I suppose, in that it fills space and tells us what the complaint says, if we haven’t read it.  But it’s not landing a case for you.  The kid down the block could summarize the complaint.

The second section is titled, “The Plaintiffs’ Attorneys.”  This section reveals that you did a Google search of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, and you summarize what the plaintiffs’ firm website says about the firm and related publicly available information.  Again, it’s nice.  But we have to beat the plaintiffs, no matter who they are.  We’re more interested in winning than we are in the identity of our opponents.

The third and final section of the routine reaction is titled, “Our Experience.”  This section lays out the many cases that you’ve handled in this area of law.  (Or, in the more brazen type of cheat, the section explains that “our firm” has handled many cases of this type, without specifying whether you personally actually worked on any of those cases.)

That analysis is fine.

You didn’t have to do much work.  You asked an associate to gin up something, and the associate did as instructed.  The analysis didn’t take too long and, since you haven’t yet landed the case, why should you sink any time into it?

Big firm mediocre, to coin a phrase.  (Well, not really “coin” the phrase at this point.  But [repeat it](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/inside-straight-the-literary-genre-of-big-firm-mediocre/), anyway.)

Could you do better?

Of course, but it would take a little intelligence, and time, and effort.

Figure out how you would actually defend the case, and tell us.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

The first section of a good analysis is titled, “Motion To Dismiss.”  It presents three or four arguments on motions to dismiss.  It explains what additional documents might be subject to judicial notice and therefore useful in a motion to dismiss.  It explains the disadvantage of making one particularly aggressive argument, which would be great if you won it but is more likely to lose and thus should be saved for summary judgment.

The second section of the good analysis is titled, “Motion For Summary Judgment.”  This section explains the facts that you’d develop in discovery to win the case at a later stage.

Finally, if you’ve ever tangled with these particular plaintiffs’ lawyers before, or if you have personal experience before this judge, you might include a section that talks about those other considerations.

This analysis is much harder to write.

You have to be smart.

You have to spend a little time on this, even though you haven’t yet landed the case.

And you’d have to work hard to develop ideas.

But if you want to land the case, maybe you should try to distinguish yourself from the pack.

# Biglaw Lawyers Behaving Badly: The Elite 8 (Part 2)

So who is the worst behaved Biglaw attorney of them all? And I’m not talking about just being a jackhole — Biglaw has too many of those — but lawyers who’ve been arrested (and some convicted) for their misdeeds. That’s the question we seek to answer in this year’s March Madness pool — and it provides us with a great excuse to reminisce about some of the craziest stories from the Above the Law archives.

Earlier this week, we revealed half of the Elite Eight ([voting is still open](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/biglaw-lawyers-behaving-badly-the-elite-8-part-1/?rf=1) btw), and now we have the results of the Infamous and Impulse Control regions:

On to the voting!


#1 Seed Edward De Sear v. #2 Seed Evan Greebel

The first matchup features an attorney serving time –17.5 years — for [truly awful crimes](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/it-gets-worse-ex-biglaw-partner-who-possessed-kiddie-porn-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-trafficking/). Edward De Sear pleaded guilty to four counts of distribution of child pornography and to sex trafficking of a child. There isn’t any joke I can make to make the terribleness of those crimes palatable. He’s pitted against pharma douchebag Martin Shkreli’s [former attorney Evan Greebel](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/pharma-karma-martin-shkreli-and-biglaw-partner-arrested/). Greebel is accused of financial crimes that allegedly allowed Shkreli to use his biotech company as his piggybank.

#1 Seed Sarah Buffett v. #3 Seed Ryan Walsh

This is a great matchup because we’ve got two former Biglaw attorneys who just can’t keep their sh!t together. Sarah Buffett had an [epic meltdown](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/former-biglaw-partner-who-got-wasted-on-plane-and-caused-flight-diversion-charged-with-airplane-assault/) on an airplane; in fact, it was so bad the plan had to be diverted. She’s up against Ryan Walsh, who left a [threatening voicemail message](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/im-going-to-kill-you-not-the-best-strategy-for-getting-your-job-back/) (retro!) for a partner after he’d been fired.

We’re seeing more austerity measures brought on by the economic ramifications of the novel coronavirus sweeping the globe in the legal industry. Even Biglaw firms find themselves in need of cost-cutting measures to maintain their cash a-flowin’.

The latest firm that’s doing COVID-19 austerity measures is[ Dinsmore](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=88&name=Dinsmore). The firm had $250,888,000 in 2018 gross revenue making it 124th on the Am Law 200. According to multiple tipsters, the firm has laid off and furloughed attorneys and staff in response to the economic upheaval.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Above the Law reached out to Dinsmore and they provided the following statement, confirming the cuts:

“The firm continues to have a strong pipeline of work. That said, we recognize that the economic impact of COVID-19 is evolving quickly, and in order to anticipate its future impact, we have taken swift and prudent measures. We immediately deferred a portion of partner distributions, made a small number of layoffs and are temporarily furloughing some staff, along with other expense-reduction measures. We believe these measures will help to preserve the firm’s financial position and do whatever is necessary to protect jobs. In the meantime, we remain focused on serving our clients and guiding them through the disruption caused by the pandemic until the situation stabilizes.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

‘Tis the season for compensation news. With $1,061,457,000 in gross revenue last year, Alston & Bird sits at #47 on the Am Law 200 and it’s going to share more of that bounty with associates as it moves to match the prevailing market rate.

As of January 1, associates will see their salaries bumped up.

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$225K
Class of 2022	$235K
Class of 2021	$260K
Class of 2020	$310K
Class of 2019	$365K
Class of 2018	$390K
Class of 2017	$420K
Meanwhile, the firm’s bonuses will be paid to associates meeting the 2000-hour billing threshold, with additional bonuses available for those billing over 2200 hours and on a case-by-case basis to those making extraordinary non-billable contributions to the firm.

Class	Bonus
Class of 2023	$15K (pro-rated)
Class of 2022	$20K
Class of 2021	$30K
Class of 2020	$57.5K
Class of 2019	$75K
Class of 2018	$90K
Class of 2017	$105K
Class of 2016+	$115K
Of note, the bonus scale has an entry for the class of 2016 while the salary scale ends at the seventh years.

Associates seem happy with the news, though less happy about the firm “unofficially and without any explicit policy requiring 5-day a week in-person attendance because Alston is ‘not a hybrid firm.'” Further proof that the war to retain talent is fought on multiple fronts.

Please help us help you when it comes to salary news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Salary) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Salary”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firms Don't Seem To Care About Tom Cotton's Anti-Diversity Legal Threats
## And law firm consultants are having a field day roasting the senator.

Last week, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn affirmative action within higher education, Senator [Tom Cotton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton) (R-AR), a Harvard Law School graduate, [launched an assault](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/tom-cotton-threatens-top-biglaw-firms-over-their-diversity-inclusion-initiatives/) against some of the largest law firms in the country, warning them that their DEI programming — and their advice to clients regarding such programming — may violate federal law. Cotton sent legal threat letters to more than 50 firms, many of them among the Am Law 100’s most elite.

The response from these elite firms has essentially amounted to a shrug.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
None of the firms have issued a public response thus far, but consultants who regularly do business with them are speaking up, and as noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/24/big-law-leaders-arent-losing-sleep-over-sen-tom-cottons-anti-dei-threats/), “no one is losing sleep over Cotton’s letter.”

“This letter is coming from somebody who has a history of writing inflammatory letters that get him publicity,” said Kent Zimmermann, law firm management consultant at Zeughauser Group, citing Cotton’s 2015 letter to the leaders of Iran to undermine a U.S. nuclear deal or a 2011 open letter calling for the imprisonment of two New York Times journalists and an editor. “Did you ever watch ‘Succession’ where the dad said, ‘You are not serious people’? I feel like this is not a serious person.”

Oof. And the hits keep coming…

Ralph Baxter, law firm management consultant and former Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe chairman and CEO, echoed similar sentiments.

“I think Tom Cotton’s letter or message reflects a lack of understanding and an ignorance of what law firms are trying to achieve in their diversity programs,” Baxter said. “So, I don’t think it will have an impact because he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”

Fatality!

Perhaps it would be best for Senator Cotton to beg off from threatening the most successful law firms in the world — even their consultants are mopping the floor with him.

Britney Spears (Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty)

* You want your crazy? She’s got your crazy! Britney Spears — or rather, her father, perhaps better known as the conservator of her estate — has settled a lawsuit over the “darkest days” of her career with her former manager, Sam Lutfi. The settlement is rumored to be in the low six figures. [[Yahoo! Music](https://www.yahoo.com/music/lawsuit-over-britney-spears-darkest-days-settled-172043904.html)]

* Sorry, lawyers, but the J.P. Morgan private banking you’ve been enjoying as a perk of your Biglaw job is about to be taken away from most of you. Soon, you’ll need at least $10 million in investible assets for access to their prestigious banking services, and everyone from associates to partners will receive the financial cold shoulder from the bank. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/09/07/private-banking-perks-in-peril-for-wealthy-lawyers/?ref=/blogs/law)]

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  

* Everyone wants to know whether Hillary Clinton intends to re-nominate Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit to the Supreme Court if she’s elected president, but some have speculated that “[s]he’s trying to avoid the question obviously because she doesn’t want to provide the voters and the public with her position.” [[Bloomberg News](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-09-07/what-clinton-won-t-say-whether-garland-is-her-high-court-pick)]

* “A large number of associates just got raises, we are hoping they will be generous with a portion of those and give back.” The Associates Committee, a group of young lawyers, awarded $200K in grants with the noble goal of improving the justice system. Why not do more than pay down your loans with your new Biglaw bucks? [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/what-if-associates-donated-a-sliver-of-that-big-salary-raise-to-legal-aid/)]

* Now that ITT Tech has closed its doors, you can expect a wave of lawsuits to flood the courts. Thus far, the for-profit school has been accused of WARN Act violations, and next on deck may be an ITT filing against the Dept. of Education after it prohibited the school from enrolling new students using federal loans. [[DealBook / New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/business/dealbook/lawsuits-over-itt-shutdown-are-just-starting.html)]

# Sorry About Those Billable Hours, Millennials...
## Blame the Goldfarb case for all those hours that you now have to bill.

I’ve been using the term “millennials” as has just about everyone else, for that cohort of peeps born between 1980 and 2000. Others have different definitions as to when millennial kicked in, but all are roughly in the same ballpark. In any event, the [oldest millennials turn 38](https://www.theringer.com/pop-culture/2018/6/21/17487974/millennials-meaning-age-young-old) this year, only several years away from protection under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, that is, if you’re looking to switch jobs or are under-employed or unemployed.

At least our judiciary doesn’t face a mandatory retirement age, although some might think that’s a good idea. In Poland, the mandatory retirement age for judges has been [reduced from 70 to 65](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/poland_supreme_court_retirement/).  That’s discomfiting,

Age isn’t just a number any more, a number that you can ignore, because, whether you like it or not (and most do not), middle age doesn’t [creep in on little cat feet](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45032/fog-56d2245d7b36c) like the [Carl Sandburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sandburg) poem (who’s he, you ask?). Middle age smacks you in the face (mid-life crisis time), whether it does so at 40 or 49 and can make you re-evaluate your priorities, both in life and in the law.

I’m not going to talk about re-evaluating life priorities, that’s not my job, but re-evaluating priorities in our professional lives is something worth thinking about. What about the newbies who graduated law school after 2008 who have jobs — and aren’t just doing document review — and who are [struggling to repay those student loans](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials-print/) and still have money left over for such things as housing and food, in addition to paying the overhead on a solo or small firm practice while scrounging for clients in a fiercely competitive world that drives prices down? And if you’re in Biglaw or other firms where billables rule the roost, I don’t need to remind you about billable hour requirements

There are providers that, for a small charge, connect clients with lawyers to ask a question, and for an additional fee, additional questions. It’s the information that isn’t provided, that requires a lawyer to fish for information, that troubles me. How many times can a lawyer answer a question with just a yes or no answer? Aside from “don’t do it, because it’s illegal,” or “the risk is not worth the reward,” answers require context. We all know that one difference in facts can make all the difference in the advice. Every case turns on its facts.

As providers compete to reduce legal fees, I thought about the billable hour and how it came to be. It flourished because the minimum fee schedules that bars had used went away because of a [case that said minimum fee schedules were illegal](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13155838236565589433&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr). It was a little more than 40 years ago, before many of you reading this were on the planet.

In 1975, the United States Supreme Court struck down minimum fee schedules in [Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfarb_v._Virginia_State_Bar).  Until that case, there was a minimum fee schedule (a floor, not a ceiling) that lawyers were to follow (at least in Virginia) or face discipline. Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb couldn’t comparison shop for lawyers because the fees were the same, regardless of whom they researched to represent them in a title search of the property they wanted to buy. That did not make the Goldfarbs happy, so they sued.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Millennials, imagine a world with only landlines, no internet, no Amazon, no smartphones, not even flip phones, and you get the picture. Bleak by today’s standards, but that was what we had and we didn’t know any differently. There was little, if any, comparison shopping.

However, the law is a much more competitive business than when Goldfarb was decided.  Note I use the term “business.” One of the arguments that the defendant Fairfax County Bar Association proffered in defense of minimum fee schedules was that the law was a “learned profession,” and therefore exempt from the purview of antitrust laws (e.g., it was not a “trade or commerce” within Section 1 of the Sherman Act). Chief Justice Burger, writing for the court, swatted that argument down.

The local bar also asserted that “….competition is inconsistent with the practice of a profession because enhancing profit is not the goal of professional activities; the goal is to provide services to the community.” While the bar was able to make that “straight face” argument way back when, no way today could that the same “straight face” argument could be made, given today’s environment. In fact, the Chief Justice noted that imposition of the minimum fee schedule had not been entirely altruistic, so that argument also went down the chute.

In the late 1950s, the ABA had said that lawyers were [poor business people](http://businessoflawblog.com/2015/06/history-origin-billable-hour/) and undervalued their work. Based purely on what I’ve observed over my career, competition has eviscerated both premises. Given the ability to commoditize a lot of routine legal work and the rise of non-legal providers who undercut lawyers’ fees, undervaluing one’s services may be today more a question of ego than reality.

The irony is that had attorneys not adhered to the minimum fee schedule that the Virginia bars and other bars imposed, they could have been disciplined, but the minimum fee was price-fixing and thus a per se antitrust violation. Has the billable hour standard been the right solution? Looking at legal fees, many would say no.

So, the Goldfarbs won and minimum fee schedules evaporated. Do we say “thank you,” or something less printable? Although [this post](https://www.ozy.com/flashback/the-virginia-couple-who-gave-birth-to-the-billable-hour/60997) was written in 2015, it still holds true. As associate salaries climb ever higher, the pressure to bill more billable hours increases. Billable hour rates have skyrocketed over the past few decades, way higher than what anyone probably expected as a logical outcome of Goldfarb. So, blame the Goldfarb case for all those hours that you now have to bill.

Now, has emphasis on the demands of the billable hour and its soul-sucking requirements caused re-evaluation of professional priorities? What do you think?

It’s been 10 years since Above the Law first launched. In those 10 years, the legal profession has changed dramatically, but the group that it’s changed the most dramatically for has been women.

In 2006, it was virtually unheard of for a woman to be recognized as a superior manager and trusted with the responsibility of leading one of the largest law firms in the country, if not the world. In 2016, women run the show at several of the most prestigious Biglaw firms in America, and while remarkably few women have ascended to such roles, it’s still a great improvement over the way things used to be.

In 2006, the legal profession was plagued by sexism and gender bias, and today… it’s still plagued by those problems. In 2016, however, there are far more avenues and opportunities that allow those who have been discriminated against to rectify the wrongs they’ve faced simply by virtue of being women working as lawyers, including, but not limited to, the availability of a [new professional conduct rule](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/abanews/2016%20Annual%20Resolutions/109.pdf) enacted by the American Bar Association to address discrimination and harassment.

Here are some of the biggest changes women in the legal profession have seen since 2006, the year Above the Law first started publishing news about women in the law.

According to data from the [American Bar Association](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/women/reports/CurrentGlanceStatistics2006.authcheckdam.pdf), in 2006, women represented 30.2 percent of the legal profession, with 50.6 percent of them working in private practice. Of those women working in private practice, 44.1 percent of them were associates, while only 17.3 percent of them were partners. Per the National Association of Women Lawyers’s first annual Survey on the Retention and Promotion of Women in Law Firms, a report published in 2006 focusing on women in the largest 200 firms in America, this was the average gender breakdown of attorneys by position across all responding firms:

Now, let’s take a look at where women stand in the legal profession in 2016. According to data from the [American Bar Association](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/marketing/women/current_glance_statistics_may2016.authcheckdam.pdf), women represent 36.0 percent of the legal profession, but the percent of women working in private practice is unknown at this time. Of those women working in private practice, 44.7 percent of them are associates, while 21.5 percent of them are partners and 18 percent of them are equity partners.

The National Association of Women Lawyers’s ninth annual Survey on the Retention and Promotion of Women in Law Firms, a report published in 2015 focusing on women in the largest 200 firms in America, provided a comparison between the average gender breakdown of attorneys by position across all responding firms in 2006 and all responding firms last year (which was by far the lowest response rate in nearly 10 years):


(Graph via the National Association of Women Lawyers)

A decade ago, women represented 16.6 percent of the general counsel ranks of America’s Fortune 500 companies, and 15.7 percent of the general counsel ranks of America’s Fortune 1000 companies. In 2016, women now represent 24 percent of the general counsel ranks of America’s Fortune 500 companies, and 19 percent of the general counsel ranks of America’s Fortune 1000 companies.

Ten years ago, women represented 47.5 percent of total JD enrollment in law schools. At the same time, women represented 20.4 percent of deans at 179 law schools. Women today represent 48.7 percent of total JD enrollment in law schools. At the same time, women now represent 31.1 percent of deans at 183 AALS member law schools.

In the beginning of 2006, there were two female Supreme Court justices, but for the vast majority of the year, there was only one active Supreme Court justice who was a woman. In 2016, there are three female Supreme Court justices.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
In 2006, male lawyers earned $1,891 per week, while female lawyers earned only $1,333 per week, meaning that women in the legal profession earned just 70.5 percent of what male lawyers did in 2006 — a depressing fact. Weekly earnings information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is not yet available for 2016, but in 2015, male lawyers earned $1,914 per week, while female lawyers earned only $1,717 per week, meaning that women in the legal profession earned 89.7 percent of what male lawyers did last year — a 19.2 percent increase since 2006.

As reflected by these statistics, while change seems to have happened in reverse warp speed for women in the legal profession, little by little, piece by piece, and bit by bit, it’s still happening, and that’s what’s important. In a profession where we must celebrate tiny upticks in progress, this is “dramatic” change. In a profession where almost every year, something so demeaning, so disgusting, or so degrading happens to a female attorney that it makes headlines across the legal media and beyond, and in a profession where the gender gap is more perhaps more accurately described as a [“gender gulf,”](http://www.nawl.org/2015nawlsurvey) we are forced to revel in these accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem.

Here are just some of the slights and injustices against women that we’ve covered here at Above the Law in the past 10 years. Some are alleged and some actual, and some are far worse than others, but we should be troubled as a profession about these actions and allegations. It is not our intent to single out any particular individual or institution for blame; instead, we want to review this history to avoid repeating it. Take a look.

# Chadbourne & Parke Is Dead
## The 115-year-old Biglaw firm is no more.

Yes, a 115-year-old Biglaw firm is no more, but this time, it is good(ish) news. Chadbourne & Parke announced this morning that its [anticipated merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/biglaw-merger-means-the-end-of-chadbourne-parke/) with Norton Rose Fulbright is official. The combined firm, which will operate under the Norton Rose Fulbright moniker, has about 1,000 lawyers in the U.S. ,with roughly 300 of them in New York City alone.

There were concerns that client conflicts could delay the firms tying the knot, but with today’s announcement, those concerns are put firmly in the past. And, as the American Lawyer [reports](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202791973009/Chadbourne-Is-No-More-as-Deal-with-Norton-Rose-Fulbright-Goes-Live), the bigger Norton Rose looks forward to a bright future:

“Bringing together Norton Rose Fulbright and Chadbourne will enable Norton Rose Fulbright to provide even greater breadth and depth of services to our clients,” Peter Martyr, Norton Rose Fulbright’s global chief executive, said in a statement. “We now offer enhanced capabilities in New York and Washington, DC, while our global platform expands to Mexico City, São Paulo and Istanbul.”

Andrew Giaccia, the combined firm’s U.S. management committee vice chair and Chabourne’s former leader, said in a statement: “Our lawyers’ shared commitment to client service – along with our strong compatibilities in the areas of energy and infrastructure, banking, corporate and finance, project finance, bankruptcy and restructuring, litigation and regulatory law – makes this a powerful combination.”

Though that future will not include everyone. Since announcing the merger was in the works, the artist formerly known as Chadbourne has seen partners and associates alike [leave the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/biglaw-firm-losing-attorneys-as-it-preps-for-merger/), with the total number of departed attorneys nearing 50.

But on merger day, as a storied firm name fades into history, the focus is on the shiny future.

# Partnerships In Law Firms: The Perfect Storm?
## Five key trends are transforming Biglaw and the entire legal industry.

CKR Law grew rapidly from its founding in 2014, expanding to boast more than [200 lawyers](https://www.ckrlaw.com/our-people.html) across some [50 locations](https://www.ckrlaw.com/locations/). But earlier this week, the news broke that the firm, facing a cash crunch, [is considering terminating partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/global-law-firm-facing-cash-flow-problems-considering-terminating-partners/).

The reason provided by CKR founder Jeffrey Rinde is that those partners have been “substantially underperforming.” The handling of these partner firings might have been more public than usual, but the firing of partners for underperformance comes as no surprise. And in today’s legal market, underperformance often stems from partners failing to develop sufficient new business. (Also, it is no surprise that Lateral Link’s 12-part series on rainmaking, presented by Cordell Parvin, has been receiving heavy traffic. [Here](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) is the first part, free to click and check it out.)

Even before the CKR announcement, the legal sector had been shaken by two developments in the law partner sector. To use the cliché, this has felt to some like “the perfect storm.”

One development has been the [drop in the percentage of partners](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/partner_percentages_continue_to_decline_in_biglaw), from 42.2 percent of total lawyer headcount at large firms in 2013 to 40.8 percent in 2017. Along with that has been the increase in the ratio of non-partners to partners during that same period, from 1.37 to 1.45.

The other development is [the decline in percentage of equity partners](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/percentage-of-equity-partners-continues-to-shrink-while-biglaw-profits-increase), from 78 percent in 2000 to 56 percent in 2018. Meanwhile, those fewer equity partners are enjoying record levels of profits per equity partner. When money is a factor, anticipate a trend to have staying power.

What is obvious is this: The implications for radical change in strategic career planning in the legal sector are massive. At Lateral Link, we have noticed the beginnings of these transitions. Here are five key trends we have identified as gamechangers.

1. Increase in lateral activity. To paraphrase Tolstoy, each law firm needing to “right-size” the number of partners will do that in its own way. Partners and associates who sense they will not be at an advantage in these shuffles tend to seek out lateral positions elsewhere. The challenge for them, as for all job changers, is to figure out how to position and package themselves in their search. They have to do everything right. In many ways, the legal system is a closed community.

2. Surge of interest in in-house positions. As more legal projects get handled in-house, the role of corporate counsel increasingly mirrors that of the lawyer in the outside law firm, and the increasing sophistication of corporate legal work has drawn more talent to the in-house world. Still, life as an in-house lawyer presents challenges. The hours are not always better than Biglaw, and within the company, the in-house legal team generally represents a cost center, not a revenue producer. This can exacerbate the office politics surrounding being corporate counsel and create pressures on in-house lawyers to do more with less – to handle an increasing volume of work with a decreasing amount of resources.

3. Surge in placements in the temporary market. An increasing number of lawyers are working as independent contractors, as the “gig economy” comes to the legal sector. Temporary placements have their downsides, such as less job security and a lack of benefits, but they have their advantages as well. At the top of the list, of course, is the paycheck. But there is also the opportunity to acquire more experience in a field or even new experience in another niche. In addition, the temporary worker can gain insight into alternate ways of getting things done, making them more marketable for permanent positions – if desired. Temporary assignments already have become a career path in themselves.

4. Re-socializing law students and associates about goal setting. In the U.S., there remains an addiction to titles. The title “law partner” is among the most desirable. When it isn’t achieved or when it is taken away, lawyers can plummet into despair. But the good news is that lawyers have many other career options, some of them with similarly enviable titles.

5. Accelerated pace of change if the economy sours. When the next recession arrives, Biglaw could lose some [10,000](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/02/26/the-next-recession-could-cost-10000-lawyers-their-jobs/) jobs, according to industry expert Hugh Simons. What does this mean? Lawyers have to prepare now to simultaneously hold on to their jobs and explore other options. This is no time to become “attached” to any particular job setting or functions.

Back in the 1980s, when international competition and technology began to threaten U.S. business, management consultant [Peter Drucker](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Turbulent-Times-Peter-Drucker/dp/0887306160) identified a new advantage Corporate America had: it could use the turmoil as the platform for innovation, in everything ranging from business models to human-resources policies.

American business had a second coming. And hopefully the legal world will as well.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Would Every Lawyer Who's Paid $130,000 Out Of Their Own Pocket To Silence Their Client's Porn-Star Girlfriend, Please Raise Your Hand?

Michael D. Cohen

The lay media has to take Michael Cohen’s story at face value, I guess. [Cohen tells the New York Times](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/us/politics/stormy-daniels-michael-cohen-trump.html?referer=http://m.facebook.com) that he, personally, paid Trump’s alleged porn side-piece, Stormy Daniels, $130,000 out of his own pocket. It was not a “campaign contribution,” says Cohen.

Why? He won’t say. Did Trump know? Cohen says “No.” Folks: Michael Cohen’s OFFICIAL STORY is that he paid a porn star Trump wasn’t having an affair with $130,000 to “protect his client” even though the client never asked him to do it.

Dear mainstream media: THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED! THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED! MOB LAWYERS DON’T DO THAT! Stop pretending that Michael Cohen’s story has even the slightest veneer of credibility. If Michael Cohen told you the Earth was flat, would you act like it could be true? There is simply NO possible theory of events that would result in a $130,000 payment on behalf of your BILLIONAIRE client that the client doesn’t know about. No lawyer does that. There is ZERO CHANCE that’s how this went down.

Cohen’s “admission” to the New York Times IS designed to protect his client, now. Cohen is protecting Trump from having to answer for the HUSH MONEY PAYMENT HE ALLEGEDLY MADE TO A PORN STAR!

It’s clear that Cohen is willing to sacrifice his reputation and risk disbarment to protect Trump’s reputation, which is funny because Trump is basically defamation-proof at this point. NOTHING you say about Trump could damage his standing any further among those who already hate him. And, evidently, nothing you can say about him will damage his reputation with those who have decided to support him. Cohen is throwing himself on a grenade to protect a guy who is invincible.

Still, we should take the idiot up on his offer. Disbar this man IMMEDIATELY. Cohen’s (not credible in any way) admission would be a clear ethics violation if he did what he said he did (which, again, he didn’t). The American Bar Association’s ethics rules plainly state this in [Rule 1.8 (e)](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_8_current_clients_specific_rules.html), describing the “client-lawyer relationship”:

(e) A lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that:

(1) a lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which may be contingent on the outcome of the matter; and

(2) a lawyer representing an indigent client may pay court costs and expenses of litigation on behalf of the client.

Get Michael Cohen the hell on out of here. Jesus Christ, IT’S CALLED ACCOUNTABILITY!

Cohen either clearly lied OR clearly violated professional ethics. Either way, he should be PUNISHED. NOW. Start the wheels turning on his ass NOW.

And stop repeating his idiot “confession.” Freaking ISIS could “take responsibility” for the Stormy Daniels payment and I’d believe it before this hot mess from Michael Cohen.

# Biglaw Firms Are Doing Their Associates Dirty By Conducting Stealth Layoffs
## A former Biglaw chair shares what the 'polite' thing to do would be when it comes to job cuts.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Big Law was eager to throw bodies at the burgeoning economy not long ago. They were good enough to do the work once upon a time, but when the economy changed, they’re not. There’s the attitude in big firms that we don’t owe them anything; we pay them well. [T]hey’re afraid to say that they’re worried about their falling PPPs, because it might reflect that they’re just greedy and not willing to carry people through a tough period.

— [Steven Harper](https://www.stevenjharper.com/), a former Kirkland & Ellis partner who writes about the legal profession, in comments given to [Vivia Chen of Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/kirkland-ellis-ropes-gray-throw-associates-under-the-bus) concerning the recent spate of stealth layoffs that have been happening across elite Biglaw firms. Several firms, like [Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/stealth-layoffs-strike-once-again-at-worlds-wealthiest-biglaw-firm/) and [Ropes & Gray](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/top-10-biglaw-firm-is-conducting-merits-based-reviews-that-have-resulted-in-job-cuts/), have claimed that their job cuts were performance-based, which Harper says is a “red herring.” [Keith Wetmore](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/keith-wetmore), who once served as chair of Morrison & Foerster and is now a managing director at recruiting firm Major, Lindsey & Africa, advised that when it comes to layoffs, “[t]he polite thing to do is to say that lawyers have been let go, including some very strong performers.”

# The Sexual Harassment Settlement That Could Change An Entire Industry
## Securities litigators take center stage in the #MeToo movement.

You don’t always think of securities litigators taking a key role in the fight against sexual harassment, but in the wake of #MeToo, that’s exactly what’s happened. Shareholder derivative lawsuits have sprung up as a response to revelations of sexual misconduct by executives or prominent employees as a way to try to hold companies accountable.

In this episode of The Jabot, I speak with [Molly J. Bowen](https://www.cohenmilstein.com/professional/molly-j-bowen) and [Julie Goldsmith Reiser](https://www.cohenmilstein.com/professional/julie-g-reiser) of Cohen Milstein about their representation of Alphabet shareholders in a case over the company’s handing of sexual harassment claims that led to a $310 million settlement that’s been hailed as precedent-setting.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

In a world with so many texts and emails, putting the thought onto the written page feels meaningful.

— Mayer Brown chair [Jon Van Gorp](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/people/v/van-gorp-jon-d?tab=overview), explaining to [Jenna Greene of Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/beyond-cold-hard-cash-warm-fuzzies-are-way-lawyers-heart-firm-chair-says-2022-06-08/) why he uses handwritten, mailed letters to praise the people he works with at the firm. Given “how much emotion and passion and a piece of themselves that people put into their work,” Gorp said in his [interview with Greene](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/beyond-cold-hard-cash-warm-fuzzies-are-way-lawyers-heart-firm-chair-says-2022-06-08/), “[w]e’re trying to make the place more personable.” As noted by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/beyond-cold-hard-cash-warm-fuzzies-are-way-lawyers-heart-firm-chair-says-2022-06-08/), Gorp gave a keynote address at Fordham last month where he said he wanted attorneys and staff at the firm to “feel like they’re part of a community of support” and to “feel proud when they mention to their friends ‘I work for this law firm.’”

# Cuomo Wanted Hand-Picked Investigator, Instead He Got The Biglaw Partner Who Sent His Aide To Prison
## Somehow, I can't help but think this is a response to trying to mess with the AG's authority.

The [nursing home data scandal](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/nyu-law-school-ethics-professor-embroiled-in-major-ethics-scandal/) may well still sink the Cuomo administration — though they’re sticking with “the numbers were still being audited” excuse because, hey, it worked for Trump for several years! — but mounting allegations of sexual harassment have understandably taken center stage over the last couple of weeks. After an initial power struggle, Attorney General Tish James has seized control of the investigation and decided to bring in outside counsel to lead the charge, choosing employment lawyer [Anne L. Clark](https://www.vladeck.com/Anne-Clark) of Vladeck, Raskin & Clark, P.C. and [Joon Kim](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/professionals/joon-h-kim) of Cleary Gottlieb.

Since the last time Cuomo had to deal with Kim was when the latter was at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and put Cuomo’s former top aide, [Joe Percoco in prison on corruption charges](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/politics-on-the-hudson/2019/03/15/joseph-percoco-andrew-cuomo-former-right-hand-man-reports-prison/3172921002/), it’s safe to say General James is not messing around. There’s not going to be even a hint that she’s installing someone with any fear of crossing the governor’s office.

That, of course, wasn’t guaranteed. The governor initially sought to quell the uproar by bringing in former federal judge [Barbara Jones](https://bracewell.com/people/barbara-s-jones) of Bracewell. Jones last made big news for [racking up entirely reasonable Biglaw bills](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/yes-this-is-how-much-a-biglaw-partner-working-for-one-week-bills/) in the Michael Cohen case shocking the mainstream press who get breathless over the idea of a $700/hour attorney. Jones would have approached the matter with all due seriousness, but Jones would have worked for Cuomo, not the AG’s office, and as we all learned from the Moreland Commission, whenever Cuomo’s office sets up its own ethics watchdog, it’s likely to [shut down its own ethics watchdog if it gets too close](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/nyregion/governor-andrew-cuomo-and-the-short-life-of-the-moreland-commission.html). James and state legislators balked at that suggestion, prompting Cuomo to suggest a power-sharing agreement between James and long-time Cuomo political ally Chief Judge DiFiore, but James scoffed at the idea that she’d cede her legal authority to create an appearance of impropriety. In the end, the AG won the day.

Anne Clark is a renowned employment discrimination and general employment attorney. A former Skadden Fellow/Staff Attorney with the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund focusing on employment matters, she brings 30 years of employment experience to an investigation into core employee harassment allegations.

Clark’s involvement would be enough to demonstrate that the state would not pull any punches in the investigation. The addition of Cleary’s Joon Kim may prove to be the cost of Cuomo’s aggressive procedural shenanigans.

Would James have necessarily added a former prosecutor best known for putting the man Cuomo considered “[like a brother](https://apnews.com/article/22d1456871ce431c9b5997fe34639684)” in prison if she hadn’t suffered through a news cycle of Cuomo trying to undermine her authority? He basically forced her into not merely pledging a dispassionate, aggressive investigation but having to slam an exclamation point on the back of it in order to signal that his pressure tactics hadn’t compromised the independence of the review.

Given the professionals involved, it won’t impact the substantive course of the investigation, but for a politician who thrives on posturing himself as “in control” of every event — potentially to his detriment in the nursing home matter — this is a symbolic defeat likely to embolden any state legislators still squeamish about the Cuomo mystique.

Let this be a lesson to lawyers everywhere, sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.

# Skadden Announces Layoffs Across U.S. Offices
## The layoffs hit professional staff at the elite firm.

Well, it looks like we can expect the Biglaw trend of layoffs to get worse before it gets better.

The coronavirus has wrought a lot of changes in Biglaw — we’ve seen firms announce their office is[ closing until 2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/am-law-50-firm-extends-mandatory-work-from-home-policy-though-january-2021/), we have [partners and associates are sharing offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-firm-tells-partners-to-share-their-offices-with-associates/), bunches of firms slashed[ salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/), and we’ve even seen [partners forced out of firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/biglaw-partners-are-getting-forced-out-of-their-firms/). But the very, very top of the Biglaw pile remained mostly quiet during this tumultuous time. Now, that’s changed.

Tipsters at the firm reported to Above the Law that none other than Skadden Arps has been cutting back on professional staff, apparently taking the unprecedented upheaval to make some staffing changes. A spokesperson for the firm confirmed the layoffs to Above the Law, “We can confirm that we have laid off just under 4% of professional staff across our U.S. offices.”

Best of luck to those who find themselves out of work.

Now that an ultra prestigious firm has decided layoffs are the way to go (and one that instituted no previous COVID-19 austerity measures to boot), will we see even more firms willing to take a carving knife to their ranks? Only time will tell.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

If you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Layoff Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the layoff alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each layoff, salary cut, or furlough announcement that we publish.

# Top International Firm Conducts Lawyer Layoffs Due To 'Prolonged Downturn'
## The firm is cutting a 'modest' number of lawyers from its team.

Biglaw attorneys and staff who were recently polled on layoffs within the legal profession said they [expected more job cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/biglaw-attorneys-staff-expect-more-layoffs-to-be-announced-before-year-end/) to be announced before year end — and as it turns out, they were correct.

Linklaters — a firm that brought in $2,350,490,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 16 in the most recent Global 200 ranking — is slashing jobs across its three China offices. As noted by the [Global Legal Post](https://www.globallegalpost.com/news/linklaters-to-cut-lawyers-in-china-due-to-prolonged-downturn-1208975264), the firm has 220 attorneys stationed in China, one of the largest legal forces among international firms that have set up shop within the country. In the wake of these layoffs, Linklaters will have closer to 190 attorneys, with ~30 people expected to lose their jobs.

The firm offered the following statement on its recent reductions:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“In response to the prolonged downturn in the China market, we have decided to make a modest reduction to the number of lawyers in our Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong offices. China continues to be an important market for Linklaters. The firm is fully committed to the China market and continues to have the strong capabilities required to service the ongoing needs of our global clients in that market.”

Best of luck to those who have been let go from Linklaters.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through deferrals, open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive.

Need break from the horrible details being revealed from the attempted coup and think Impeachment 2: Electric Boogaloo promises to be more of the same partisanship that characterized the first installment of the franchise? Well, then maybe some good, old fashioned bonus news will provide the perfect distraction.

Morrison & Foerster went ahead and announced their bonuses yesterday. Unsurprisingly, the firm’s year-end bonuses match the prevailing market rate, and are subject to the firm’s usual hours requirement. They’re also handing out special bonuses, which do not come with an hours requirement. These special bonuses are above market — at least for first-year associates (first-years will get bonuses of $10,000 compared with $7,500) — and will match the market for other class years. Here are the bonus scales at the firm:

Year-end bonuses:

# Biglaw Firm Reverses Pay Cut For Associates, Partners Not So Lucky
## It's good news (for associates, at least).

Another Biglaw firm has reversed at least some of their COVID-19 austerity measures. [Back in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-but-hopes-to-avoid-layoffs/), Am Law 100 firm Crowell & Moring announced a series of pay cuts designed to avoid layoffs. And almost everyone at the firm was impacted: equity partners took a 25 percent compensation cut, income partners saw their paycheck cut by 20 percent, associates and counsel got a 15 percent cut, and staff making $100,000+, which the firm estimates is about a third of staff members, took cuts in the range of 5 to 20 percent.

But now the firm is walking back the cuts — at least for associates, counsel, and staff. As [reported by ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/crowell-moring-reverses-pandemic-related-associate-pay-cuts)Bloomberg Law:

“Based upon our performance, which has been better than anticipated, we have decided to resume pre-pandemic compensation levels for our associates, counsel and staff effective September 1,” firm chair Philip Inglima told Bloomberg Law via email.

But yes, the cuts for the partnership — both equity and income partners — are still in effect. As Inglima said, “We will continue to be fiscally conservative in the months ahead to ensure that our firm remains in the strongest position possible.”

Way, way back in January, [Milbank introduced a new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) that served as a catalyst for the mad race to increase associate salaries at Biglaw and boutique firms across the country.

One of the firms that matched Milbank — at first [quietly doing so under cover](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/top-20-biglaw-firm-hasnt-announced-a-match-but-associates-say-theyve-received-milbank-raises-after-reviews/) of its annual review process, before a [formal announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/money-matters-top-20-biglaw-firm-officially-announces-a-milbank-match/) was made — was Cooley. Since then, the firm has been silent through the introduction of two more salary scales, one from [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/) and one from [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/). On Friday, the firm finally addressed salaries once again.

Cooley, of course, is matching the Cravath salary scale, like all other firms that wish to remain elite during this especially hot lateral market. Here’s what compensation now looks like at the firm:



The new salary scale at Cooley goes into effect on April 1. Congratulations!

# Checking In On 'Allen & O'Melvery,' Biglaw's Most Hilarious 'Will They Or Won't They' RomCom
## The Allen & Overy and O'Melveny deal appears star-crossed at the moment, but we've got hope.

When news broke that senior leadership from [Allen & Overy and O’Melveny & Myers were deep in merger discussions](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/allen-overy-and-omelveny-are-considering-merger-please-name-it-allen-omelvery/), the Biglaw landscape let out a collective gasp. The proposed mega-merger would result in a 3,000-attorney firm bringing in roughly $2.8 billion in annual revenue. At first blush, the deal made a lot of sense. A&O wants to bulk up its North American presence, while O’Melveny has been on the prowl for a merger partner for some time now.

We’re all basically the romantic comedy best friends who know these two are perfect for each other, but we’ve got a symbolic 90 minutes of dreck to fill, so of course they’re not going to make this merger easy.

The first wrinkle cropped up within minutes of American Lawyer breaking the merger story, when O’Melveny reached out to [flatly deny](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/omelveny-tells-atl-we-have-no-plans-to-merge-and-never-have/) that they’ve ever planned to merge with anyone. Oh, O’Melveny. You’re only lying to yourself. Get over your stubborn pride and go to her!

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Allen & Overy, meanwhile, confirmed that they were in talks with an unnamed firm but tried to play it cool. But if they succeeded in presenting a stiff upper lip to the public, internally they faced a downright breakdown. As [ALM’s Rose Walker has it](https://www.law.com/2018/04/13/ao-faces-skepticism-over-omelveny-merger-as-doubts-emerge-among-partnership-396-2687/), a number of key partners in A&O’s London’s headquarters are “dead against” merging with O’Melveny, and they’re heading to the press with their concerns:

Although Allen & Overy partners were informed at the start of the year that the firm was talking about a potential U.S. tie-up, no names had been presented to partners before last Friday. News of discussions with O’Melveny surprised many, with one source describing the initial reaction in some quarters as “quite violent.”

One Allen & Overy partner told Legal Week that most of the firm’s London office are “dead against” the proposed merger, while another senior partner who recently left the firm said that “lots of people in London do not want this.”

Why the turmoil? Well, as you’d expect, some think the British girl is just too good for the rough-and-tumble American. O’Melveny’s bad-boy image as a litigation-focused firm just doesn’t fit the mold some people have for Allen & Overy. All that courtroom fighting is no place for a prim-and-proper banking firm. Other sources note that the proposed merger would leave Allen & Overy with more work to do — they’d have a larger American beachhead, but they’d need to expend considerable resources bulking up the O’Melveny transactional side to deliver what they feel their clients need. Just like every one of these movies… she’s going to have to change him before this all works out.

While things look bleak right now for this Biglaw tie-up, we’re still relatively early in the saga and there’s more than enough time to set things right. Just get ready for the second act, where Allen & Overy wildly misinterprets O’Melveny chatting with former prospective [merger partner Willkie Farr & Gallagher](http://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/sites/newyorklawjournal/2017/12/13/amid-law-firm-merger-boom-transformational-talks-on-the-rise/) and O’Melveny has to run to the airport before A&O flies out of O’Melveny’s life forever.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to the Thomson Reuters Institute and the Georgetown University Law Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession’s 2022 Report on the State of the Legal Market, how many billable hours per lawyer per month were recorded in 2021?

Hint: While average billables were up over 2020, they were still down from the 2007 high, before the Great Recession.

# Top Biglaw Firm Gives Out Delayed Special Bonuses
## Associates will have to wait for the big bucks.

Is a spring bonus still special if associates have to wait until the fall to see any money?

That’s the query for associates at Hunton Andrews Kurth who received word that their firm will be matching the market standard for Biglaw special bonuses. It’s certainly good news for those associates, but there’s a catch.

Check out the bonus schedule below:

Hmmm, those payments are a good deal later than at peer firms. As a reminder, most Biglaw firms are doing payments in the spring/summer then the second one in fall/winter. But at Hunton, associates’ first payment more directly lines up with the second payments at most firms. However, they are not the only firm to push the [payments into 2022](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/cwt-special-bonuses/).

A sympathetic tipster noted the firm’s fiscal calendar is to blame for the delay:

Same numbers as everyone else, but paid on a different timeline bc of our April-March fiscal year.

And I’m sure it doesn’t hurt that associates will have to stick at the firm through April of 2022 to get their full payment.

The firm noted that, to be eligible for the bonuses, associates must be in good standing and billing 1900 hours annualized. These will be in addition to any year-end bonuses. You can read the firm’s[ full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/hunton-special-bonuses/2/)

# Who Wins The Jingle War: Cellino Or Barnes?
## Each half of the former firm has a new phone number.

800-888-????

Quick, what was the phone number for Cellino & Barnes? A lot of you probably got that right immediately. But the firm split up a few years ago and the two entities it spawned have dueling jingles now. Which came out on top? Joe and Kathryn also discuss Davis Polk’s extra bonus program and what it means for Biglaw and attorney wellness generally. Also, Texas AG Ken Paxton may want to take a break from social media for a while and attorneys still need to hit mute on Zoom more often.

# Ranking The Wealth Of The Elite: Is Your Biglaw Firm 'Super Rich'? (2024)
## These firms have money, money, and even more money.

Even after the many ups and downs that the legal profession experienced in 2023 — a year where some Biglaw firms [conducted layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/) while others were busy expanding their [nonequity partnership ranks](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/biglaw-firms-planning-to-expand-their-nonequity-partner-ranks-in-a-big-way/) — your Biglaw firm may be doing quite well financially… but is it among the Am Law 100’s Super Rich?

What qualifies a firm to be designated as among the Super Rich? These are the Biglaw firms that have at least $1.1 million in revenue per lawyer (RPL) and $550,000 in profits per lawyer (PPL). These Biglaw firms are rolling around in cash, and they’re not afraid to flaunt it after coming through ahead of peer firms last year. According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/16/super-rich-list-expands-with-familiar-and-new-faces/), in 2023, the Super Rich list was the second-largest of the last decade, increasing by four to reach 38. Here are some additional details on how the Super Rich firms best utilized their resources to stay on top:

RPL and PPL are important metrics because they correspond with law firms’ ability to leverage billable hours and technology to make money while solving clients’ problems, according to Marcie Borgal Shunk, founder and president of the Tilt Institute. …

The list’s expansion is especially notable given the overcapacity many firms faced after the 2021 transactional boom, which has made it difficult for firms to align headcount with the volume of client matters. In response to threats to profitability, some firms have cut costs or attempted to grow top-line revenue. Shunk believes the latter is required for firms that want to grow and stay ahead of competitors, while the former can be hazardous to a firm’s competitive advantage.

“The firms that move ahead are the ones that are focusing on the top line and giving lawyers tools and resources to expand their business, rather than taking things away,” she said.

Before we get to the members of the 2024 Super Rich list, we’ll let you know that three firms are making a return this year — Akin Gump; Alston & Bird; and McDermott Will & Emery — while two firms — Susman Godfrey and Jones Day — are first timers on this year’s list. Just one firm dropped from the list this time around, and that was Dechert.

Without further ado, here are the top 10 firms on the Super Rich list:

- Wachtell
- Susman Godfrey
- Sullivan & Cromwell
- Cravath
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Ropes & Gray
- Paul Weiss
- Skadden
- Davis Polk
- Quinn Emanuel
Click [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2024/04/16/super-rich-list-expands-with-familiar-and-new-faces/) to see the complete list of 38 firms.

Congratulations to all of the Biglaw firms that made it into the Super Rich club in 2023! If your firm performs well enough, 2024 could be your year to shine.

Joe and Kathryn have a lot to break down this week. Amy Coney Barrett’s supporters tried to give her a nickname and managed to make an even bigger mess of it. As she begins her hearings, you’ll not be able to get her new nickname out of your head. Meanwhile, Biglaw firms are split on whether or not to give bonuses to associates right now, but Kathryn explains that it looks better to pay now than to wait. And the online bar exams held last week were riddled with glitches, but examiners are committed to pretending it went off without a hitch.

Big Law Business recently conducted two polls asking for opinions on who the most famous practicing lawyer is. One survey was of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg BNA executives, editors, and reporters, while the other was a poll of Big Law Business readers. Ted Olson, Marty Lipton, Eric Holder, Ted Wells, Paul Clement, Rudy Giuliani, Joe Lieberman, Vernon Jordan, and Kathleen Sullivan all appear on both lists, but not at the Number 1 spots. Which two lawyers are the most famous practicing lawyers according to each of these polls?

Hint: Both of these lawyers began their careers at Cravath Swaine & Moore before starting their own firms.

See the answer on the next page.

# Suspended Biglaw Associate Accused In Molotov Cocktail Attack Pleads Guilty
## And now the federal government is trying to add a terrorism enhancement to the sentence.

When we last checked in on suspended (and formerly furloughed) Pryor Cashman associate Colinford Mattis and housing attorney Urooj Rahman, both charged in May 2020 for their [involvement with a Molotov cocktail attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-new-york-molotov-cocktail-attack/) on a police vehicle in Brooklyn, New York, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, they’d been [released to home confinement](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/suspended-biglaw-associate-accused-in-molotov-cocktail-attack-released-to-home-confinement/) for a second time, after being [sent back to jail](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/suspended-biglaw-associate-accused-in-molotov-cocktail-attack-sent-back-to-jail/). This happened more than a year ago, in July 2020. What have they been up to since then?

Mattis and Rahman were originally indicted on charges of arson and use of explosives, and each pleaded not guilty. Yesterday, as part of a deal, they pleaded guilty to one count of possessing or making a destructive device.

This is where things get complicated, as prosecutors are now seeking to add a terrorism enhancement to their sentences, which would result in a 10-year prison term for both lawyers. Their attorneys are understandably strongly opposed to the enhancement, seeing as neither of their clients has a criminal record. The [New York Law Journal](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2021/10/20/lawyers-charged-in-molotov-cocktail-case-plead-guilty-prepare-to-fight-terrorism-enhancement-at-sentencing/) has additional information:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“This is the real beginning of this case,” [Rahman’s attorney Paul] Shechtman, a partner at Bracewell, said after the hearing. “The task now is to persuade the judge that these two young people shouldn’t be sentenced to prison for conduct that occurred in the heat of the moment on one of the most heated nights in modern American history.”

Mattis and Rahman have hundreds of supporters, one of whom is Rachel Barkow, a professor at NYU Law, who taught Mattis while he was a student there. In a [New York Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-biden-plays-hardball-with-black-lives-matter-20211019-37fgfctxorhzpcvvnpf7wqrmh4-story.html) op-ed published earlier this week, she asserted that the federal prosecutors in this case are “continuing to pursue the Trump-era approach of labeling Black Lives Matter protesters as terrorists.” She continues:

Labeling Mattis and Rahman as terrorists is a tactic that one would expect from the [Trump administration](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barrs-statement-riots-and-domestic-terrorism) as part of its political strategy to diminish the calls for racial justice in the wake of police violence. It is shocking to see prosecutors dedicated to equal treatment under the law seeking that label in this case. …

Breon Peace, President Biden’s recently confirmed pick as United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, should step in and not have prosecutors under his watch seek an enhancement and a sentence that does not apply to the reality of this case. Doing so would send a message that the Biden administration is serious about turning the page on Trump’s politicization of racial justice protesters….

Sentencing for Mattis and Rahman is scheduled to take place on February 8. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York believes the lawyers are “virtually certain” to be disbarred. Pryor Cashman says it is “unable” to weigh in on Mattis’s employment with the firm until after his sentencing.

# Sometimes Inaction Is Better Than Action In Legal Matters

Time’s Up.

One of my favorite podcasts, “Cautionary Tales,” teaches listeners lessons they can learn from historical examples. Recently, the podcast conveyed a few examples of historical figures benefiting from taking no action when faced with problems. There is a natural tendency to do something when faced with problems, but often, action can do more harm than good. Lawyers also might be biased in favor of action over inaction in order to prove to clients that they are working hard and that seeking legal counsel was worth it. However, it is sometimes better to take no action in various legal situations.

Several years ago, I was at a mediation, and after hours of negotiations, it seemed as if the case was headed to a tenuous settlement. At that time, I did not want to say a single additional thing since I did not want to rock the boat and potentially upset the settlement. For some weird reason, another lawyer involved in the mediation just had to get one last comment in before the discussions concluded. Lawyers of course love to speak, and all I could do was roll my eyes as the lawyer began to make his point.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The lawyer made a statement that he thought would advance the position of a client, and (I guess) show the other side that they should accept the settlement given the merits of a particular defense. However, the statement greatly irritated the principals involved at the mediation, and the resolution veered of course. If that lawyer had just decided not to speak, the case likely would have settled, but the case ended up taking many additional months of costly litigation before finally resolving.

At another time in my career, a law firm at which I worked was defending a case that had been inactive for years after the court issued a ruling on a given legal issue. No one was really sure why the plaintiff’s lawyer had not prosecuted the case for years. Our best theories were that the lawyer lost track of his client or perhaps the lawyer just forgot about this case since the attorney likely had hundreds of files. It was also possible that the person responsible for the case at the other law firm left the shop so that notifications about the case were not getting to the right person.

Our position was to let sleeping dogs lie on the matter. From a defensive position, there seemed to be no downside to letting the case sit for a while, and this did not cost anything to the client. Moreover, if the case was pending for a certain time without any activity, possibly the matter would be administratively marked disposed by the court for lack of activity. If we tipped the plaintiff off that the case had no activity for a while, they might resume prosecution of the case and make it unlikely that a court would administratively dispose of the matter.

The client eventually moved a portfolio of work to a new law firm, including the matter that had been inactive for years. My firm was asked to complete a consent to change attorney form so that the new lawyer could be substituted into the case. We cautioned the client that filing this document could alert the other side to the fact that the case had been inactive for years, but the client still wanted to proceed with filing the form. This filing tipped the other side to the fact that this case had been inactive, and they resumed prosecuting. If the matter had been quiet for a little longer, the client possibly would have been better served by an administrative dismissal of the matter.

# Top Biglaw Firm Makes Salary Move As New Market Standard Emerges
## Paul Weiss was quick to match salary increases -- once the dust had settled.

We’ve been[ speculating for a while](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/why-havent-more-biglaw-firms-announced-raises/) about the Biglaw salary logjam. Back in January, Milbank [announced raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), but the matches were not nearly as fast and furious as associates would hope. But then yesterday, Davis Polk, part of the troika of Biglaw salary leaders (along with the aforementioned Milbank and Cravath), made[ its move](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/davis-polk-raise-2022/).

The new Davis Polk scale matches the salary numbers for junior associates, but comes over the top for midlevel and senior associates. With that piece in place, we expect to see many more matches. And only a few hours after Davis Polk’s announcement, the matches began.

Paul Weiss, ranked 20th in the Am Law 100 with $1,543,730,000 in gross revenue in 2020, was one of the firms quick to match this new scale. Yesterday, the firm announced salary increases according to the following grid:



These raises will be retroactive to January 1 — the same [effective date as the Milbank bump](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/). They also noted that the previously announced [discretionary top-off bonuses](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/paul-weiss-special-bonus-discretional/) for attorneys will hit bank accounts in March 15, the same day as the raise amounts. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/paul-weiss-raises-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# The Power Of 'Why'
## Stating what is obvious to yourself but may not be obvious to others can go a long way to building rapport.

While it is unlikely a phenomenon unique to being in-house, I have recently learned the power of using “why” in communication. There are two particular use cases for “why” that I have personally found effective for work.

One — less revolutionary and probably well-known — purpose is asking clients “why” during meetings. It is in an attempt to try to get to the heart of what clients are trying to achieve through their ask, through their project, or through the position that they are trying to take. The intent is that once you know what clients are trying to achieve, the better you are able to get them there. If you’re curious, I have previously written about other [helpful questions](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/helpful-questions-to-ask-of-clients-when-working-in-house/) to ask as in-house counsel.

The other use case for “why” is explaining the reason why you’re communicating what you’re communicating. To some, this effort may even be considered overcommunicating and unnecessary. At the same time, I have found this strategy helpful to prevent miscommunication and to create a safe space for intellectual debate and objective problem-solving.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
For example, if I’m asking some questions about a certain direction proposed, I may preface or interrupt my line of questioning by interjecting that I’m not necessarily disagreeing or “pushing back,” I just want to fully understand the facts or the reasoning. That way, my line of questioning is less likely to be misconstrued as having a contrary opinion when I may not actually have one. It signals to my team that I want to explore solutions — that I am still open and not tethered to an opinion yet. Hopefully, this also encourages the team to stay open-minded too.

If I’m investigating something that has occurred, and my line of questioning may be perceived as accusatory or questioning of someone’s credibility or judgment, I will actually state that it’s not my intent to “Monday-Morning Quarterback” — that I just need to understand what happened so I can best protect the company, and how, at the end of the day, it’s not about blame but process improvement and iterative growth. Hopefully, there’s sufficient trust and a strong enough relationship that my good intention is presumed, but if not, then stating what is obvious to me but may not be obvious to others as to why I’m asking questions in the first place can go a long way to building rapport and that psychological safety I’m seeking.

Last, but certainly not least, I find that starting a conversation with why I’m speaking can help prepare the listener and also lead to better results. For example, I may start a conversation with, “This is just an FYI only.” That way, my team knows that they just need to listen and that no requested action or follow up is required. Likewise, I may start a conversation with, “I’m sharing this because I want to know if you’ve encountered this before,” and my team will be able to listen and cognitively be prepared for a compare/contrast with their earlier experiences. But if I start a conversation with, “I want to bring this issue to your attention to get your thoughts,” then my team knows to listen for the purpose of collaborating on a creative solution.

Although taking the time to communicate the “why” behind your communication can take extra time and intention, I have personally found that it can prevent some frustration from miscommunication and lead to stronger relationships with your team and clients.

Harvard Law professor David Wilkins –the guy who should have been dean of the law school [but isn’t](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/john-manning-named-new-dean-of-harvard-law-school-white-men-rejoice/) — [publish a fascinating study on black Harvard Law Alumni outcomes from 2000-2016](http://clp.law.harvard.edu/assets/HLS-Report-on-the-State-of-Black-Alumni-II-2000-2016-High-Res.pdf). At a top level, add this report to list of things that proves Amy Wax’s and Larry Alexander’s arguments [about the black community are drowning in dumb](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/black-people-do-have-bourgeois-values-thats-why-so-many-white-people-are-still-alive/).

Black Harvard Law graduates are more than a canary in a coal mine for the black legal experience. The only law school that graduates more black lawyers than Harvard is Howard.

And those outcomes are beautiful and terrible, all at the same time. From the [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/black_harvard_law_grads_leave_private_practice_at_higher_rate_study_finds):

Nearly 72 percent of black Harvard law grads start their careers in private practice, mostly at larger law firms, the Careerist reports. Seventy percent of female black Harvard law graduates started at the largest firms, with 251 or more lawyers, compared to 53 percent of male black law graduates.

But the percentage of Harvard law grads in private practice dropped by 63 percent, compared to a 38 percent drop among black lawyers and a 28 percent drop among white lawyers surveyed in a national study, according to the study (PDF) by Harvard law professor David Wilkins.

It’s easy to explain why black people go into Biglaw at higher rates than others. Black people and white people both go into Biglaw because of the money. But for black people, you’re often talking about more money than anybody else in their family. It’s hard to put that in the correct context: I was making more money as a summer associate than my mother and father… and my mom and dad both have college degrees and were working full time. I owed it to them to at least try to enjoy making that much money. They sacrificed so much. OF COURSE I was going to take the Biglaw job.

I needed to try to make Biglaw work. For myself, for my entire family, for all my “peoples” who invested in my opportunity to make all the money I could.

And then, I owed it to my people to throw it all away. It’s easy to explain why black people run screaming from Biglaw at higher rates than others. My educated, activist, black family did not work so hard and sacrifice so much so I could be a soulless drone making the world safe for Big Oil to go rape Nigeria without running afoul of international trade agreements. They didn’t put me in this position so I could spend 10 pro bono hours helping an indigent with his federal appeal, after spending 80 hours making sure BigBox could crush its labor organizers who dared to agitate for a living wage.

I don’t think that black people are more socially conscious than others. I certainly don’t think black Harvard alums are necessarily more “woke” than the general population. But I do think that when you are a black person who is blessed with more opportunities than most people in your community, you are forced to think longer and harder about how you’re using those opportunities. “Am I part of the solution… or am I the other thing? Cause they have a term for me if I’m the other thing.” You have to be able to go home and sit at your Thanksgiving table and feel like you are not a sellout, and that hits minorities a little differently than others.

You’ll note that I can explain the shocking high rates of black turnover in Biglaw without even getting into racism and prejudice at the Biglaw firms that can turn a willing associate into a former colleague. But we know that’s also a factor.

The top line is that black Harvard Law alums go into Biglaw, then leave. But it’s nearly as important to recognize that black Harvard Law graduates probably get more of a “bounce” from their degrees than their white peers. From Vivia Chen on [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202800445396/Black-Harvard-Law-Grads-Are-Doing-Fine-Mostly?LikelyCookieIssue=true):

One takeaway from the report is the impact that going to a highly prestigious law school has on a black lawyer’s career. (The report cites a study that finds that nearly half—47 percent—of all black partners “obtained their law degrees from either Harvard or Yale, with over three quarters having attended one of the country’s 12 most prestigious law schools.”)

In fact, respondents to the survey rated HLS’s prestige factor (the “H-Bomb”) as “extremely important” to their career advancement, outranking all diversity initiatives. “It provides credential and network—and those things are way more important if you’re black,” says Wilkins. “When you say you went to Harvard, it tends to put people at ease.”

Folks… this is as close as you are ever going to come to seeing statistical evidence for the proposition that black people have to work harder than white people to get the same benefit. Jesus, “47 percent—of all black partners ‘obtained their law degrees from either Harvard or Yale'”? “‘Over three quarters went to a T-12 school'”? CAN THEY FREAKING FLY TOO?

I can personally and professionally attest to the utility of the “H-bomb.” People make fun of me sometimes, but there’s a reason why I lead with it. Personally, it really does put white people “at ease.” I can’t explain it. I can’t explain why a white person who went to freaking West Southeastern Central feels more “comfortable” talking to my Harvard ass than she does if she doesn’t know where (or if?) I went to college… BUT SHE IS.

Professionally, Harvard is just one of those things that gets your foot in the door. That’s important for everybody, but black people are more likely to have no other way to get into the room where it happens.

“Matt, thanks for coming in for an interview, man, your uncle and I really had some times when we worked out of the D.C. office… Tracey wow, couldn’t get through the day without your mom, we’re so lucky to have her… Hi, Tyrone is it? You graduated from Harvard, right? Nice to meet you. Okay, let’s begin.”

It helps. Harvard helps a lot.

Again, it’s a [really interesting report](http://clp.law.harvard.edu/assets/HLS-Report-on-the-State-of-Black-Alumni-II-2000-2016-High-Res.pdf): 88 percent of black HLS alums say they would go to law school again, but only 66% would recommend going to law school to a young person. Black women trail black men in career satisfaction. There are just a lot of good nuggets here.

If you absolutely must send your black children to law school, consider Harvard if you haven’t already.

# 5 Things I Miss About Biglaw (Part 2)
## If you don't like being a small-business owner, maybe SmallLaw isn't for you.

When I wrote [Part 1](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/5-things-i-miss-about-biglaw-part-1/) of “5 Things I Miss About Biglaw,” I was a little more than a year-and-a-half into my SmallLaw career, and had one part-time summer associate and two handfuls of clients.

Now, two-and-a-half years later, I have a 50-50 partner, two other partners, three associates, and a couple of duffel bags of clients. The things I appreciate about Biglaw now are different than they were back then. Now I’m much more concerned with maintaining a practice than flying first-class on someone else’s dime.

Here’s the second installment of 5 Things I Miss About Biglaw.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- Administrative Assistant. Often in Biglaw, people would tell me they rarely used their admin, but they were all associates. In however many years it was, I only heard one partner say she didn’t use her admin. As a rule, partners had their admins busy. Associates are of course busy, but they’re busy with billables, which isn’t what admins are for. The typical associate doesn’t have to spend half his or her time coordinating speaking at a bunch of events or getting interviewed or coordinating employee hiring and onboarding or dealing with vendors. It can be paralyzing. I miss having someone to whom I can forward an email from a vendor claiming they haven’t been paid and say “handle this”, and then never again hear a peep about it.
- Marketing department. A lot of time these days is spent putting together proposals and marketing brochures or PDFs. Though as an associate I was only interacting with the Biglaw marketing departments every so often (mainly to have them stick a logo on a PowerPoint or collect a list of emails), now I miss having them. It would be great to tell someone to, for example, put together a pitch like the last one we did for a BVI fund but this one needs to be a master-feeder with a focus on cryptocurrencies, and then be able to bill hours while the person in marketing puts together the pitch materials.
- Everyone under one roof. We have a great tax lawyer. We have a skilled employment attorney. We have a brilliant patent lawyer. But the thing is, none of these people are (officially) a part of our firm. They all have their own firms. So I have to get special permission from the client, who is not always on board with my bringing in an “outside” lawyer. They also might disagree with how much time the lawyer estimates the question will take to answer, and try to negotiate through me, which isn’t a great place to be. This never happened in Biglaw. If we were working on an issue that required an employment compensation specialist, we would just call the person down in Atlanta who specialized in employment comp and ask her the question. Tax lawyers got brought in all the time. It was so much easier and faster.
- Billing Department. Man, oh man. [Clio](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/when-to-outsource/) has helped, but with multiple people billing, getting invoices out is harder than ever. And now that my firm [insists on retainers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/smalllaw-billing-maxims-i-e-get-paid/), the entire billing process has become an enormous timesuck. Also, one thing I’ve found is that when a third party, like an admin, sends an invoice, the client pays it a lot faster than when I’m the one sending it. Maybe it serves to emphasize that the money is going somewhere other than my pocket. Or maybe it’s just that I don’t strike fear into people. (One of my students told me earlier this year that he wasn’t going to be able to turn his paper in on time because he had an event to go to that evening and “I’m more afraid of my wife than you.”) Someone like me needs a billing department handling invoicing and collecting.
- Vacations. I used to scoff at associates who would brag they hadn’t had a vacation in years, claiming they were just so valuable no one let them take a vacation. For the most part that was B.S. Sure, if you took three months off for paternity leave, you probably weren’t making partner. But the entire house of cards wasn’t going to come down if you took a week or two off. In SmallLaw, it’s easy to get yourself into a situation where you don’t see how you can leave the office for many days in a row. (Many days, like five.) There aren’t a lot of people around to cover for you, and a lot of clients don’t want to talk to anyone else anyway. I know for me, it’s gotten to where going to American Bar Association conferences are my only vacations. Sad!
I like getting new clients and doing legal work. I can’t say I really care for anything else. Biglaw, at a certain level and for the most part, lets you do that. I miss that.

# New Names For South Texas 'Houston' College Of Law LEAKED!

After the artist formerly known as South Texas College of Law announced that it would replace its current “Houston College of Law” moniker with [a new brand next week](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/the-battle-over-houston-law-school-may-be-drawing-to-a-close/), Above the Law staff began working with our allies at the Kremlin WikiLeaks to get our hands on the new name before the public announcement.

We’re happy to announce that we’ve uncovered a memo with every proposed name that the law school has under consideration. Its effort to name itself curiously close to the [University of Houston Law Center](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/university-of-houston-law-center-files-lawsuit-against-unranked-law-school/) has fallen flat, but these new options should position the school build on its reputation as a destination law school for the next generation:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As you are all aware, the marketing team was tasked with creating a bold, paradigm-shifting, and non-infringing name for our great law school going forward. After weeks of creative work and focus group testing, we submit for your consideration the following options:

The Houston School of AWESOME — Our understanding of the preliminary injunction is that the similarity to the University of Houston rested on calling ourselves a law school in Houston. This takes that out of the equation and doubles down on our brand as “Awesome.”

University of (South) Texas School of Law — Returning to our old name would be the “safe” option, but even if we return to our roots, we don’t want to look stagnant. This name conveys that we are undeniably a University of Texas. We also think this branding could benefit from a new palette. Burnt orange would really pop with this name.

Southern United Methodist University — There are many denominations of Methodism, and we feel attaching ourselves to the United Methodist Church could reap solid benefits.

Yale

Starbucks Law School — Admissions is a perennial hurdle for any law school, and we think the drive-by traffic of this striking brand could be a real shot in the arm for the school. Especially [around September](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/stop-putting-pumpkin-spice-in-every-damn-thing/). We also feel it adds real heft to establishing the academic bona fides to name the school after a key figure in a landmark work of American fiction. We feel Lt. Starbuck of Battlestar Galactica is the ideal candidate for this purpose.

Antonin G. Scalia School of Law — Why not name the school after the recently passed Supreme Court Justice? Obviously we’d include the jurist’s middle initial to avoid an embarrassing acronym because we’re not f**king stupid.

Apollo 13 Law School — Going to law school could be the most successful failure of your life!

Like a kid on the playground branded with cooties, everyone’s running far, far away from Donald Trump. One of his few remaining attorneys [has abandoned ship today, saying his legal services were used “to perpetrate a crime,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/donald-trumps-attorney-asks-to-withdraw-as-counsel-because-his-client-is-a-criminal/) but that’s not the only legal advice going against Trump.

Vanity Fair [reports](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/01/after-a-day-of-violence-and-25th-amendment-chatter-trumps-allies-jumping-ship) on what was going on in the White House as violent insurrectionists took the Capitol Building  yesterday. They don’t have insight into what the President was doing as his supporters attempted a coup, but they do have the 411 on what White House Counsel Pat Cipollone was up to. Cipollone, formerly of the Biglaw monolith Kirkland & Ellis and a graduate of the elite law school at the University of Chicago, was reportedly worried that Trump may be committing treason and advising staffers and advisors to stay away from the president to reduce their chances of being tried under the Sedition Act:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As the violent mob incited by President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, some West Wing staffers panicked that they were possibly becoming participants in a coup to overthrow the government. “What do I do? Resign?” one nervous White House staffer asked a friend on Wednesday afternoon, shortly after news broke that a woman had been shot and killed inside the Capitol. The West Wing staffer told the friend that White House Counsel Pat Cipollone was urging White House officials not to speak to Trump or enable his coup attempt in any way, so they could reduce the chance they could be prosecuted for treason under the Sedition Act. “They’re being told to stay away from Trump,” the friend said. The White House declined to comment.

With rumors of the invocation of the[ 25th Amendment swirling around,](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/a-quick-and-dirty-guide-to-the-25th-amendment/) looks like Cipollone isn’t too confident everyone will get one of those [pardons Trump’s been handing out](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/former-skadden-associate-taken-down-in-mueller-probe-gets-pardoned-by-trump/) like candy.

# Top Tips For A Successful Video Interview
## Virtual interviews have become the new normal during the pandemic -- and they come with their share of unique issues.

Virtual interviews have become the new normal during the pandemic. They come with their share of unique issues (many of us have dealt with someone stuck on mute, for instance). Fortunately, with the right preparation you can avoid most of those problems.

Our candidates have completed hundreds of virtual interviews over the last nine months, securing offers, and even joining their new employers without in-person meetings. We have learned some valuable lessons from their experiences.

Here are our top tips so that you can make the most out of your virtual interview:

Tech Considerations:

- Use headphones, if possible, preferably with a built-in microphone. Using computer speakers without headphones can cause an echo, which is an awkward and irritating experience for everyone involved.Wired earphones help reduce the risk of audio lag and connectivity problems associated with Bluetooth. We advise against using Apple Airpods and Airpod Pros with Windows computers, as we have had several reports that Airpods can be unreliable within applications like Zoom.
- Familiarize yourself with the video conferencing platform that you will use for your interview. If you’re already familiar with the platform, be sure to open the application ahead of time and check for software updates so you don’t run into any problems the day of the interview.
- While most video conferencing platforms offer mobile apps, we recommend using your laptop/desktop for video interviews if possible. This ensures you have access to all video conferencing features, such as screen sharing, which are sometimes limited in mobile apps.
- Set aside 15 minutes before your scheduled interview time to test your microphone and video. Most video conferencing applications (like Zoom) offer [microphone tests](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362283-Testing-computer-or-device-audio). For video tests, consider using your laptop’s camera application to check the lighting and your appearance before joining the interview call.
- Keep your computer plugged in during the interview to avoid any interruptions if your battery starts running low.
- If you run into audio issues, you can use your phone to call the interviewer and continue the conversation by phone while on camera.  You can also use the chat function to communicate with the interviewer.
- Optional: prepare a back-up plan in case of wifi disruptions. While outages are rare, preparing ahead of time can reduce last-minute scrambling on the off chance that you encounter any issues with home internet connectivity. Consider setting up your phone’s personal hotspot as an alternative in case you lose your regular wifi connection.
Preparing Your Interview Space:

- Choose a quiet, private space with a strong internet signal.
- Remember to lock the door to reduce the risk of interruption by family, roommates, or pets. Consider placing a sign on the door as a reminder for other members of your household.
- Be mindful of the background. Your interview background is an excellent opportunity to communicate who you are. At a minimum, it should appear clean, tidy, and work appropriate. If possible, avoid a view of your kitchen or bedroom, as this can be distracting. Bookshelves, educational degrees, family photos, plants, and natural lighting in your background can all help to convey a positive first impression.
- If you’re interviewing for a position that encourages work from home (“WFH”), consider what your background communicates about your ability to work from home effectively. Be prepared to discuss your WFH setup. Do you have a dedicated work space at home? If not, how have you adapted your space to work from home?
- Virtual backgrounds on Zoom can be fun — and necessary in some cases — but use good judgment in determining whether your choice in background could be distracting for your interviewers. If you decide to use a virtual background, choose a professional image, like bookshelves or a solid color, and consider draping fabric in your background to create a functional green screen.
Making a Strong First Impression:

- Choose an outfit that you feel confident in, and dress exactly how you would during an in-person interview. Wearing a strong professional outfit can help shift your mindset into focus mode, and feeling confident is a critical psychological factor in interview success. Wear a full outfit. Some of our candidates have had to stand up to grab dropped items, and it is easy to imagine a camera accidentally tilting and showing more than the shoulders up.
- Minimize distractions. Turn off notifications on your computer, and place your phone in airplane mode to avoid an email or missed call notification interrupting your train of thought during the interview. Just this week, a candidate lost an opportunity because he was sending emails and texts during the interview, and the firm read that as a lack of serious interest.
- Bring a glass of water into your interview space. If you’re feeling nervous, take a sip of water.
- Raise your camera. Consider using a laptop stand or setting your laptop on top of some empty boxes (or books) to create a more flattering camera angle. Ideally, your body should be positioned in the center of frame, with the top of your head at the top of the frame and the middle of your chest at the bottom.For those who wear makeup, be sure you check your appearance using your laptop camera before the interview, as makeup can appear differently on video than it does in real life.
- If you have time, also consider room lighting. Facing natural light sources is ideal, while sitting with your back towards a window can create a dark silhouette. You can also adjust the brightness of your laptop screen and play around with different combinations of lighting/angles ahead of time to figure out what helps you feel most confident.
- Maintain eye contact, and practice looking into your video camera when you speak. Be mindful of appearing distracted when your gaze shifts outside the interviewer’s frame of view (e.g., writing notes might be mistaken for checking your phone).
Virtual Interview Day Checklist:

- Microphone/audio test completed
- Computer plugged in
- Door locked
- Phone silenced and computer notifications turned off
- Personal appearance and background checked using laptop camera
Whether you are interviewing in person or virtually, preparation is the key to your success. Invest an hour or two following the tips above to make the most of your interview.

# Chicago Legal Market Hiring Trends And Predictions For 2018
## Steady lateral attorney hiring is anticipated to continue in Chicago's core practice areas for the remainder of this year.

Zain Atassi

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) team of expert contributors. [Zain Atassi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zain-atassi-20147026/) is a Managing Director with Lateral Link, where she recruits and places high-level attorneys with leading Am Law firms, high-end boutiques, and Fortune 500 companies throughout the Midwest and nationally. Zain focuses on the individual needs of her clients and candidates, delivering the utmost personalized attention. Before joining Lateral Link, Zain gained significant experience as a legal recruiter with a national legal search firm. Prior to recruiting, she spent six years as a litigation attorney with Chicago-based law firms. Zain holds a J.D. from Washington University School of Law and a B.A. with Honors from Washington University in St. Louis.

Chicago Hiring Trends

Chicago is the nation’s third largest legal economy with a range of top international firms, prominent regional names, IP specialty firms, and mid-size Chicago-based firms supporting a diverse range of industry sectors, including finance, technology, healthcare, consumer products, insurance, and automotive.  With consistent deal-flow and complex litigation matters, the Chicago lateral attorney market remained robust over the past year and into 2018, with key firm and practice area hiring trends.  Whether you are an attorney looking to stay within Chicago or considering relocating to a Chicago firm, we have analyzed and assessed recent lateral attorney hiring data to assist you through the search process.

According to reported data, the top Am Law-ranked, regional, and midsize law firms in Chicago hired 746 lateral attorneys between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017 (428 associates, 231 partners, and 87 counsels).  In the first quarter of 2018, 275 lateral attorney moves have been made in Chicago (147 associates, 90 partners, and 38 counsels).  2018 first quarter data indicates that lateral hiring is continuing in an upward trend.  Over the past five years, we have seen a steady increase in year-over-year lateral attorney hiring with the respective annual number of Chicago attorney hires being: 742 lateral attorney hires in 2017, 710 in 2016, 699 in 2015, 665 in 2014, and 575 in 2013.  Of course, hiring can certainly vary from quarter to quarter and we tend to see more lateral moves during certain times of year, with the first and third quarters typically being the busiest.

The practice areas with the most hiring in 2017 were corporate and finance, litigation, IP, and real estate; and the same has held true for 2018 thus far. Some of the very best Vault and Am Law-ranked corporate practice groups reside in Chicago.  In particular, Kirkland, Sidley, Latham, and Skadden lead the way on headline corporate and private equity transactions on an international scale.  In 2017, corporate and finance had 165 new attorney hires in Chicago and 59 new hires in the first quarter of 2018.  Within these practice areas, corporate hiring has been primarily concentrated in M&A and, especially, in the private equity space.  Consistent with the structure of most Chicago finance practice groups, debt-finance including syndicated and leveraged lending was the busiest finance hiring area.  Other exceedingly active corporate practice areas are fund formation and investment management. There are numerous global investment fund practice groups handling formation and fund management for a spectrum of fund offerings centered mainly in private equity funds, including: large and middle-market buyout, growth equity, debt, secondary, venture, technology, and real estate funds. Hedge funds and registered investment company practice groups have also consistently hired attorneys in 2018.  Chicago funds practice groups are very receptive to and regularly hire attorneys from top New-York based Am Law 100 funds and investment management groups.

Litigation also saw a significant demand for lateral hiring in 2017 with 215 attorney hires.  Litigation continues to remain very busy in 2018, with 105 attorneys hires thus far.  Chicago is a nerve center for big-ticket commercial, securities, and white-collar litigation with revered institutions such as Kirkland, Sidley, Jenner & Block, Winston & Strawn, and Mayer Brown.  Notably, this year we saw the opening of powerhouse King & Spalding’s Chicago office with leading attorneys in investigations and related commercial litigation.

IP also showed considerable lateral attorney hiring gains in 2017 with 104 new hires, and 21 new hires in 2018.  Chicago hosts many top IP teams at both large Am Law-ranked general practice firms and IP specialty firms with major presences in the technology, pharmaceutical, and life sciences industry sectors.  Earning the nickname Silicon Prairie, Chicago attorneys have the opportunity to handle cutting-edge IP litigation and patent prosecution matters for an array of top blue-chip and startup technology companies.  We have also seen a consistent demand for technology and IP transactions attorneys with a focus on outsourcing, software development, software, data, trademark, patent and technology licensing, telecommunications, international franchising, commercial agreements, and strategic alliances.

Real estate is another continually prospering Chicago practice area netting 59 lateral attorney hires in 2017 and 18 hires in 2018.  Real estate attorneys in Chicago have the opportunity to work with industry leading partners on sophisticated transactions for a full range of parties, including major REITs, lenders, and private equity investment funds.  The diversity of Chicago real estate practice groups affords attorneys the opportunity to be part of large-scale acquisitions and dispositions, joint ventures, financing, and portfolio-based deals involving all property types, including hotel and resort developments, commercial offices, retail, and national multifamily and mixed-use portfolios.

Other notable staple Chicago practice areas where we saw concerted attorney hiring in 2017 are healthcare, in both the corporate and regulatory space (23 hires), restructuring (17 hires), trusts & estates (31 hires), and tax (21 hires).  We’ve continued to see movement in these practice areas in the first quarter of this year.  Tax in particular has been busy, with 18 hires in 2018 thus far, likely due to the recent changes in tax law.

Predictions for 2018

Given the increased demand for lateral associates and partners in the preceding five years and thus far in 2018, we anticipate continued steady lateral attorney hiring in the aforementioned core practice areas for the remainder of this year.  As you consider lateral opportunities, selecting a recruiter who is knowledgeable and regularly places attorneys in the specific locale is critical to a successful search.  With a recruiter who is a market expert, you will have the advantage of knowing about unposted positions and have a more efficient interview process given their strong firm relationships.  At Lateral Link, our recruiters are dedicated to specific regions and cities with years of experience working with the best firms and practice groups.  We greatly look forward to assisting our attorney candidates in the search process as we continue through 2018.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Biglaw Attorney Reportedly Suspended After Making Racist Remarks And Challenging Associate To Shirtless Brawl
## Probably not the best idea....

For a while now, Biglaw associates and staff have been generally well-behaved here in the US. Long gone are the days of the audacious alcohol-related antics and questionable conduct at some of the largest law firms in the world. For that, it seems we need to take a trip across the pond to London, where an attorney at an elite firm stands accused of some pretty heinous behavior.

A junior lawyer at Simpson Thacher — which ranked as the 19th highest grossing law firm in the world in the most recent Global 200 — reportedly attended a firm social event where he allegedly confronted an associate of Asian descent and referred to him as “General Chan.” As if the casual racism weren’t enough, the junior lawyer then ripped his shirt off and challenged the associate to a fight. [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-simpson-thacher-lawyer-suspended-shirtless-fight-challenge) has additional details in its exclusive report:

The junior lawyer’s peers at the firm “are shocked that [he] took his top off and tried to fight the associate”, said an insider, especially because he appeared to be a “normal, hard working” lawyer, “who was on the cusp of becoming an STB associate”. Drink is understood to have been consumed at the event.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to the report, the lawyer in question has been suspended from his duties while the firm conducts an investigation into the matter. When reached for comment by ROF, a spokesperson for the firm had this to say: “While Simpson Thacher does not comment on the details of personnel matters, the Firm takes any allegations of misconduct seriously.”

Associates: Don’t let this be your headline. Keep up that good behavior so you can avoid committing racist career blunders like this.

# A Biglaw Firm's Success Doesn't Necessarily Negate Layoffs
## This firm did well... but apparently not well enough to avoid cutting jobs.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Trivia Question of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/).

Which Am Law 100 firm grew its revenue, revenue per lawyer, and net income all by about 3% in 2023, yet conducted layoffs in early 2024 nonetheless?

Hint: The firm decimated its attorney and staff headcount in mid-February.

See the answer on the next page.

# Finally, A Firm That's 'Beating' The Cravath Scale!
## We haven't seen very much deviation from the Cravath scale thus far, but that ends right now.

Bonus announcements continue to pour in from Biglaw firms across the country, and most have one thing in common: they’re straight [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/this-firm-wont-give-you-anywhere-near-a-full-bonus-if-you-dont-meet-your-hours-requirements/) matches. We haven’t seen very much deviation from the Cravath scale thus far, but that ends right now.

Last night, associates from Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft received word from [Pat Quinn](http://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/pat-quinn), the firm’s managing partner, that they’d be receiving Cravath-style bonuses. (Recall that about two years ago, the firm [eliminated billable hours requirements](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-no-billable-hours-requirement-still-equals-high-bonuses-at-this-firm/) from its bonus eligibility standards, and then [reinstated them](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/catching-up-with-cadwalader-partner-profits-associate-bonuses-lawyer-departures-and-more/) last year.) In case you’ve forgotten, this is what CSM bonuses look like for the 2017 bonus season:

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
You may be asking yourself, “What’s so special about yet another Cravath match?” This is where the firm threw in a very exciting twist for associates. Things look much different for high billers at Cadwalader. According to the firm’s bonus memo, associates who have billed 2200 or more hours will receive bonuses equal to 120 percent of the Cravath scale. This is what bonuses look like for associates who have made outstanding contributions to Cadwalader in 2017:

Class of 2017 — $18,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $18,000
Class of 2015 — $30,000
Class of 2014 — $60,000
Class of 2013 — $78,000
Class of 2012 — $96,000
Class of 2011 — $108,000
Class of 2010 — $120,000
Class of 2009 and senior — $120,000

That’s awesome! Cadwalader is technically beating the Cravath scale thanks to its rewards for top billers. What’s not as awesome is that Cadwalader’s bonuses will be paid during the last full week of February 2018. This is when the firm traditionally pays its bonuses, but with a tax code that’s still very much in flux, Cadwalader associates could wind up paying more taxes on their bonuses than their Biglaw compatriots — especially the high billers, who will be receiving thousands more than other associates.

Nonetheless, congratulations to everyone at Cadwalader! This is the first firm we know of that’s strayed from the Cravath bonus scale, so it’s time to celebrate.

[The ATL Power 100](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-office-100-law-firm-rankings/) law firm rankings are our attempt to capture the strength and relevance of major law firms in today’s market: Who are the market leaders? Which firms are still making and retaining their partners? Where do you want to work? “Power,” in this market, is about what firms are, not a legacy of past glories.

The Power 100 blends objective data with [subjective feedback](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4GVQte1HK0vOfIN) from over 20,000 law firm associates and partners. The result is a holistic picture of each firm, encompassing employee satisfaction, compensation, reputation, desirability as an employer, and data-driven measures of firm growth. The Power 100 offers a novel perspective on how Biglaw firms stack up against their competitors.

Here are some highlights from last year’s rankings:

Data from the survey helps determine the outcome of the Power 100.

# Repurposing Associates During Downturns
## Associates, if your work has dried up in your day job, don’t sit around.

I keep [reading about the concept that law firms should “repurpose” associates](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/17/repurposing-of-associates-during-a-slowdown-pros-cons-and-unintended-consequences/) during downturns. There are a couple of thoughts there that are worthy of consideration.

On the not-so-good side — it rarely seems to work despite the good intentions.  Consider the drawbacks:

First — at most law firms, the intellectual fearlessness is trained out of associates early in their careers as they are trained to do what they are trained to do very well and to be fearful of new things not in their skill set. This is terrible, and as a plug for our firm, we try really hard to do the opposite; namely, to train associates to have no fear of things they haven’t done before. But that is not true at most firms.

Second — from the point of view of, well, everyone, the associate’s salary is not commensurate with the skill set needed for the work. This means either the associate’s salary needs to drop or the law firm has to write off a lot of time — or the client is taken advantage of with untrained personnel dumping their learning curve on the client.

Third — the partners don’t want to invest time in associates that are only with them for a short time.

Fourth — the associates have the same mindset.  They are just marking time till they can get back to their real jobs.

With these headwinds, it is hard to make it work, unless …

So here is a totally different way to look at things.  Instead of the law firm repurposing the associate, how about if the associate repurposes themselves!

As a quick backstory, about 30 years ago — yes, that long — I could see the writing the wall when I worked at Latham & Watkins. They were going to fire me. I knew it. I was a real estate lawyer, and there was no real estate work to do. None at all!  The writing was on the wall. Who could blame them? I was useless.

So I waited and waited for the axe to fall, right?

Wrong!!!! I decided to make myself into a bankruptcy lawyer. I took out two treatises and read them cover to cover. And spent day and night repurposing myself into a bankruptcy lawyer. It was hard to do as I really knew very little about it. But after a few weeks, I kind of knew the law of the land.

Did it work?

Well, yes and no. Latham & Watkins still fired me. But in my next job at Mayer Brown I was surprisingly useful during the real estate downturn as I had another skill set. And I spent several years while real estate was on pause and was at least in part a bankruptcy lawyer.

Where am I going with this? It is obvious. Instead of the associates sitting there like a fungible billing unit waiting to be retooled, I urge you, associates, if your work has dried up in your day job, don’t sit around. Instead, repurpose yourself.

It isn’t easy, I admit, but it isn’t impossible either. And it is quite doable.

Over my 40 years, I have been a litigator, a deal lawyer, a leasing lawyer, a bankruptcy lawyer, a securitization lawyer, a corporate finance lawyer, an entertainment lawyer, and a bunch more I can hardly remember. All along the way, my core specialty has been real estate, of course, but I have repurposed myself a bunch of times, and the degree to which I can be useful as a real estate lawyer has been enhanced by these actions.

So, don’t wait for your firm to repurpose you if your specialty hits a downturn.  Instead, do as the Romans said long ago: Carpe diem.

This is your career. And you can turn lemons into lemonade every day.

Good luck!

# Awful Advice On How To Show Companies That Your Law Firm Is 'Diverse'
## Pushing all minority associates into the same practice area isn't a good look.

It’s rote work, not bet-the-company litigation. Big companies have a lot of small employment matters, where the plaintiffs are often minority, hourly workers. By using minority lawyers, companies can show the board that they have diverse outside counsel and get credit. It’s a way to throw a bone.

— a former lawyer who’s African-American, in comments given to Vivia Chen of The Careerist on how it’s [easier to promote black labor and employment lawyers to nonequity partner](https://www.law.com/2019/02/08/ok-your-law-firms-diverse-but-in-what-practice-areas/) because it “doesn’t really upset the existing order.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Nationwide Pay Raise Watch: It's Never Too Late
## When it comes to pay raises (and coverage thereof), better late than never.

When it comes to picking a law firm to work for, money isn’t everything (as we’ve [said before](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/)). Here at Above the Law, we cover compensation closely because it’s a transparent and trackable metric — but when choosing an employer, you should view pay as just one of many considerations. Lawyers trade compensation for other values all the time (e.g., when attorneys forsake Biglaw to go in-house, join government, or move to a boutique).

This brings us to [Manatt, Phelps & Phillips](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/manatt-phelps-phillips-llp/). The firm has many things going for it, including its strong position in buzz-generating practice areas like entertainment, advertising, and healthcare law; its track record on [diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-atl-law-firm-gender-diversity-index-2016/); and even its fun [holiday cards](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/atl-holiday-card-contest-the-finalists-7/).

But the firm has historically paid a bit below the Biglaw market, despite flirting with the Vault 100 (some years it’s [in](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/2016-vault-law-firm-rankings-self-perpetuating-prestige/?rf=1), other years it’s [out](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/?rf=1)). And last year, as the [Cravath pay raise](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) spread from firm to firm, we heard from some disgruntled readers at Manatt.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Just spoke with one of the top equity partners… who said that the firm does not expect to raise salaries. There seems to be some tension in the partnership, but overall it is not looking good. Any pressure you can put on them would be appreciated!

From a second source:

Manatt continues to refuse to raise salaries…. despite the party line, hours expectations are not below those of many market paying firms — just comp. Likewise with bonus. We all work just as much as people I know at other firms, at least in L.A. headquarters.

Now we bring you good news about associate compensation at Manatt: the firm has raised salaries, effective January 1, 2017. The details are spelled out in documents we’ve posted in full on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-its-never-too-late/2/).

(The firm actually announced raises in late August of last year and issued an explanatory memo on January 31 of this year, but we received the documents only now, in the wake of our [Wilson Sonsini compensation coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/another-biglaw-firm-raises-billing-requirements-in-the-wake-of-the-pay-raise/). Moral of the story: if you want ATL to cover your comp news, please send us your memos.)

Manatt employs an individualized, merit-based comp model based on “levels,” comparable to the systems used by McDermott Will and WilmerHale (before those firms [moved back](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-firm-announces-new-base-salary-scale/) towards more [lockstep models](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/associate-bonus-watch-very-satisfying-bonuses-plus-a-pay-scale-overhaul/)). Effective January 1, Manatt uses this pay scale:



If the first five amounts for “Top Base Salary” look familiar, it’s because they track the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1) that’s now widely employed throughout Biglaw. (The remaining amounts are a tad below market, but at that point, associates are getting close to partnership consideration.)

And wait, there’s more. In addition to paying its associates additional money to make the raise retroactive to January 1, Manatt paid bonuses that were better than usual:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
[W]hen the firm announced its new base salary compensation structure last year and made it effective January 1, 2017, it said that it would take into account when making bonus determinations the fact that some peer firms implemented their new salary structures in mid-2016. In accordance with that, for this year only, the Firm included in the bonuses an amount related to the ‘market differential’ for those Associates whose qualitative performance and productivity it believes warrant this consideration.

So while it was frustrating for Manatt associates to not get raises at the same time as most of their peers, hopefully those who remained at Manatt through January 31 got compensation that made it worth the wait. (Associates who left the firm before that point, or associates whose “performance and productivity” were deemed inadequate, were out of luck.)

In addition, the firm reduced total billable hours from 2100 to 1950 — compare page 3 of the January 31 memo, posted on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-its-never-too-late/2/), with page 3 of Exhibit 1, the firm’s policy on “Associate Compensation & Advancement.” But one source cautioned us not to read too much into that reduction, noting that the powers that be at Manatt will sometimes strike Investment Hours or Pro Bono Hours that it views as non-qualifying.

This brings us to what sources view as the main downsides of the Manatt compensation system: its complexity and lack of transparency. Some representative reactions:

- “Our system is so complex and so secretive that it is hard to get a straight answer from anyone [about pay issues].”
- “The complex tiered, individualized system makes it hard to know how many will actually be making market.”
There’s certainly some truth to these critiques. It takes 21 pages for Manatt to explain how its complicated compensation system works; many of its peer firms can explain their pay scheme in a page or two (e.g., a table of base salaries and a table of bonuses). And as you can see from those 21 pages of documentation, posted [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-its-never-too-late/2/), the firm reserves a huge amount of discretion unto itself to pay associates less than what they might expect.

Will Manatt at some point move to simplify its system, making it more transparent and less subject to firm discretion? One can certainly hope. As one can see from its reaction to the Biglaw pay raises — a delayed reaction, announced in August and implemented in January, but a reaction nonetheless — the firm does listen and respond to associate concerns.

Are there other announcements that we’ve missed? Please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”).

# First-Years To $180K, Everyone Else Up In The Air
## These raises are awfully vague... and not happening until September.

We have another Am Law 200 firm offering less than a full-throated commitment to raising associate salaries to match the rest of their Biglaw colleagues.

Last night, [Lowenstein Sandler announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/first-years-to-180k-everyone-else-up-in-the-air/2/) that it would jump first-year salaries to $180K in its New York, Palo Alto, and Washington offices. Meanwhile, its New Jersey office — note that Lowenstein is New Jersey’s largest and most profitable law firm — will see a bump to $160K. Note that New Jersey only moved to $150K a few months ago.

But what of the rest of the associates? As one tipster put it, the firm opted for the “Reed Smith Plan.” Just [like Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-you-are-not-matching-the-market-1st-years-to-180k-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story/), Lowenstein is trying to cash in on the $180K headline without following through on the rest of the Cravath scale body. According to tipsters, the firm’s new policy remained vague on older associates but expressed that all associates/counsel across all offices will receive raises on a case-by-case basis.

What’s more, the raises take effect on September 1, as opposed to the July 1 start date most firms are offering.


‘My name is Zweig.’

Whatever that means.

In “[Fear of Flying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_Flying_(The_Simpsons)),” Marge Simpson also felt some stress over being left up in the air (behold that seamless f**king transition!) and expressed immense gratitude to the gift of closure she received from her therapist… who was NOT named Lowenstein as much as Marge kept hoping she was.[1]

# Elite Biglaw Firm Makes Cravath Salary Scale Magically Appear For Associates
## Magic is in the air at this Biglaw firm!

What does it take to be considered an “elite” law firm in America right now? A salary scale that ranges from $215,000 to $415,000 is certainly helpful. We know this is a magic trick that not all firms will be able to pull off, but more and more firms are adopting the Cravath scale each day.

Take, for example, top-rated Magic Circle firm Linklaters. The firm wowed U.S. associates with a [Davis Polk match](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/linklaters-raise-2022/) on February 24, and now, less than two weeks later, U.S. associates at the firm have received a brand new Cravath match.

It’s a magical time to be a lawyer at Linklaters. This is what the Cravath salary scale looks like at the firm:

Class year	Salary
2021	$215,000
2020	$225,000
2019	$250,000
2018	$295,000
2017	$345,000
2016	$370,000
2015	$400,000
2014+	$415,000
These salaries will be paid on March 15th, retroactive to January 1.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Linklaters.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firms Ditching Russian Government Clients Because It's The Right Move
## Sometimes client service involves walking away.

There are a lot of Biglaw firms working for the Russian government and its affiliated questionably private sector entities. Personally, I represented Russian government entities when I worked as an associate at Cleary. When a country does business on the global stage, they’re going to need lawyers and they’re going to hire Biglaw.

But with Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the world is rallying to cut off his access to the services that keep his regime running. And, in no small part, Biglaw firms representing the government, its banks, and its oligarchs perform a huge role in Putin’s continued viability.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

[Sidley Austin and Venable](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/sidley-austin-venable-drop-russian-bank-clients-amid-sanctions) quickly announced that they would drop their Russian bank clients. [Baker McKenzie](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-28/baker-mckenzie-to-cut-ties-with-russia-clients-as-sanctions-bite) is in the process of withdrawing from its relationships right now. Freshfields and White & Case [represent VTB in ongoing litigations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-28/baker-mckenzie-to-cut-ties-with-russia-clients-as-sanctions-bite) complicating their ability to drop the client on a dime. Neither firm provided a comment to Bloomberg Law. [UPDATE: White & Case has [begun the process of extricating itself from the case](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/03/01/white-case-begins-dropping-russian-clients-405-100240/?kw=White%20%26%20Case%20Begins%20Dropping%20Russian%20Clients&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=newsroomupdate&utm_content=20220301&utm_term=tal).]

What about the rest of Biglaw? [At least 19 firms have offices in Russia](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/biglaw-offices-in-russia-and-ukraine-confront-reality-of-wartime-law-practice/), and it’s highly unlikely those firms run on purely non-government work.

Lawyers like to drape themselves in sanctimony and repeat that “everyone deserves a lawyer,” which may be true, but not everyone deserves you to be their lawyer. The lawyer as professional and the lawyer as businessperson are two different entities and the former doesn’t eclipse the latter. Lawyers make decisions all the time about what work they take on.

Law firms are brands. For criminal defense firms, taking on social pariahs is the whole point. Delivering for unpopular clients (whether their unpopularity is fair or not) is critical to the firm’s appeal to future clients. Other firms need to respect that the clients they serve have serious concerns about optics. Disney doesn’t want anyone even casually connecting them to war criminals. Protecting their corporate image is part of client service.

And it doesn’t hurt that the attorneys that firms work so hard to recruit are also interested in knowing if they’re about to don a violent albatross by heading to a specific firm.

So as the days go by, we keep our eyes on these firms and, maybe just as importantly, marquee clients. Because firms that don’t swiftly move to distance themselves from Russian entities are going to start hearing from clients about why.

Walter Chet Little

When Walter “Chet” Little was arrested on charges related to insider trading in August, he pleaded not guilty, but the former Foley & Lardner partner has had a change of heart. As part of a [plea agreement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4196723-Walter-Little-Plea-Agreement.html) with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, Little pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit insider trading, and the government has agreed to move for the dismissal of the other charges against the attorney.

All things considered, the Manhattan U.S. Attorney seems pretty pleased with himself:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“As he admitted in court … Walter Little, while a law firm partner, accessed confidential information about firm clients, and then traded on it,” acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon Kim said in a statement. “He violated the terms of his employment, the canons of his profession and federal securities laws. Now Walter Little awaits sentencing for his crime.”

Little will faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross amount gained when sentenced on February 22, though his attorney will argue there are mitigating factors:

“He did plead guilty to the conspiracy, and we look forward to presenting a sizable amount of mitigation evidence to the court at the time of sentencing,” [Little’s attorney, Todd Foster of the Todd Foster Law Group] said.

Little’s legal troubles began while he was still a partner at Foley & Lardner. In June 2016, the Biglaw firm opened an investigation after learning about his trading activity. Little now admits he accessed and traded on non-public information, though not related to matters he worked directly on. As [reported by](http://www.law.com/sites/americanlawyer/2017/11/13/111317little_plea/) Law.com, the investigation resulted in Little’s ouster from not one, but two firms:

That investigation revealed a violation of firm policies and prompted Foley & Lardner to take action that resulted in Little’s departure from the firm. Foley & Lardner also said it reported its findings to authorities and cooperated with them throughout their investigation.

After Foley & Lardner, Little joined Bradley Arant’s Tampa office in the summer of 2016. In the wake of Little’s arrest less than a year later, that firm quickly dismissed the lawyer. The firm’s board chairman and managing partner Beau Grenier said in a statement in May that Bradley Arant conducted significant due diligence before hiring Little, but the firm was unaware of any investigations into Little until the government had made an arrest and brought charges.

According to court documents, Little’s co-defendant, neighbor and friend Andrew Berke, plans to change his not-guilty plea during a hearing next month. Both men still face a civil suit brought by the SEC.

Growing up, I was raised to believe that I could succeed in any career I set my mind to. Having been raised by a stay-at-home mother, I was never told how I was supposed to balance raising a family while managing a high-powered career, but that didn’t dissuade me from trying. Like many of the “smart” kids of my generation, I was on the pre-med track in college. I wisely ruled out medical school after one too many near-fainting spells while volunteering in a local hospital. With medical school off the table, law seemed like the next most prestigious career, so off to law school I went.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It’s 2005. I’m a 25-year-old newly minted law school grad. I have a plum six-figure job at a prestigious law firm in downtown Manhattan, and I’m on top of the world. I carefully choose my “opening day” outfit: black dress pants, sharply ironed button-down shirt, and classic pumps. Flawless. I walk into my new office at 1 Broadway full of hope and ambition. I feel unstoppable. I smile for my photo ID card. “Click!” goes the camera. Captured — a moment in time.

Fast forward to 2006. I am a second-year associate, and I am pregnant with my first child. I do not reveal my pregnancy until it becomes impossible to hide. The firm is overwhelmingly male, but it is not unfriendly to women. And yet, somehow I intuit that my pregnancy will not be welcome news.

My firstborn, my beautiful son, enters the world in 2007. I am overwhelmed with love and forever changed. I take the fully allotted four-month maternity leave. The Human Resources manager calls me and asks when I will be returning to work. I cringe. It’s too soon. I need more time. But my time is up. Tick-tock.

For the first time in months, I put on my “work uniform” and head out the door in the dark while my son still sleeps. I fight the George Washington Bridge traffic from my town in New Jersey. While I sit unmoving on the West Side Highway, eking my way down to lower Manhattan, I daydream of my son. And I miss him. My heart aches. An hour and a half later I enter the doors of 1 Broadway and swipe my ID card, the shining face on that card no longer seeming like my own. Somehow I survive the day. I drive the long hour-and-a-half commute home. When I arrive home, it is dark and my son sleeps again. I have missed all of his waking hours. My heart breaks.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Continuing to work like I used to would mean I would barely see my son. But this is 2008. Surely the law firm could accommodate a part time or remote work arrangement. Maybe they could — but they won’t. “Sorry, that’s against our policy,” says the HR manager. “You need to come back to work full time or resign.” I give my notice. It’s not a difficult decision.

Part II

It’s 2018. I’m a 38-year-old mother of three. I am living in Boca Raton, Florida, and my youngest child is in kindergarten. I attend her classroom Mother’s Day celebration. She hands me a pink, sparkly card entitled “All About My Mom.” One question reads, “What is your Mommy’s job?” My daughter scribbles in her shaky kindergarten scrawl, “My mommy does errands and goes to the gym.” Mic drop. Wait — what? I have a law degree. I have been an online law professor for the past decade, but suddenly I am itching to get back into practice.

I take — and ace — the Florida Bar Exam the next time it is offered. Despite my gap in practice experience, I manage to land another plum six-figure job at one of the top law firms in the country. I know that this is a second chance that most people don’t get. I intend to make the most of it. I can do this!

But soon, too soon, the cracks start to form in the exterior of my shiny new career. The hour-plus commute, each way. The nannies who quit, one after another. The lack of time, of any free time, for myself. The kids who get sick, who get sad, who still need me so much. I am the default parent, and I have to be. My husband is an Emergency Room physician. He cannot leave the ER to pick up a sick child. He cannot stop CPR to answer a call from a child’s teacher. So it has to be me. As it has always been.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
I look around at the women attorneys at the firm. How are they managing? Some do not have children. Some have grown children. Some have “stay at home” husbands or spouses with flexible jobs. Some have close family nearby who help them pick up the slack. I have none of these. The deck is stacked against me.

My load gets too heavy for me to bear. I try to speak to my supervisors about cutting back hours, about part-time work, about remote work. The partners don’t like it. They want me there every day. Going “part time” would mean loss of benefits, loss of the majority of my salary. Without overtly saying “no,” they have declined my request. So once again, I give my notice.

In my experience, law firms are not set up to accommodate “alternative arrangements.” Maybe firms are more accommodating to those who have achieved seniority before having kids. Maybe these alternate arrangements are offered in theory, but they are disfavored and frowned upon. Even now. Even in some of the country’s “Best Law Firms for Women.” Is this still where we are? Haven’t we come farther than this? Well, no, I guess we haven’t. Not yet. Maybe by the time my daughters are career age, things will be different. Here’s hoping.

# Norton Rose Says 'We Don't Talk About Putin-o, No, No, No!'

Biglaw firms really have two good responses when an international crisis shines a light on how they’ve gotten [hip-deep in Russian government clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/biglaw-firms-ditching-russian-government-clients-because-its-the-right-move/) (or at least involved with clients facing edicts to cut off existing relationships with Russian entities). First, they can announce that they’re dropping these Russian entities immediately in light of the overwhelming international economic crackdown on Vladimir Putin’s regime. Second, they can keep a low profile while trying to find a [graceful exit strategy](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/03/01/white-case-begins-dropping-russian-clients-405-100240/?kw=White%20%26%20Case%20Begins%20Dropping%20Russian%20Clients&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=newsroomupdate&utm_content=20220301&utm_term=tal) if the specific work carries professional obligations that prevent the firm from dropping the client on a dime.

What firms don’t want to do is make it look like they’ve got something to hide by sending a confusing message to their thousands of attorneys about keeping their mouths shut about what’s going on.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Norton Rose woke up and [chose this route](https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/norton-rose-tells-lawyers-no-external-commentary-on-russian-sanctions/5111676.article).

Norton Rose Fulbright has issued an ‘internal notice relating specifically to external commentary on sanctions’, a spokesperson confirmed to the Gazette, adding that the firm has ‘appropriate risk management policies in place across our global business’.

They said: ‘Our sanctions team is advising clients across the world and, given the rapidly evolving situation, it is important that this advice is provided directly, through the appropriate channels. We therefore recently issued an internal notice relating specifically to external commentary on sanctions.

Um… what does that mean? The most generous interpretation is simply that attorneys should decline to offer themselves to the media as experts on the sanctions process while the firm is trying to advise clients directly. Ideally, the firm would clarify that this only relates to sanctions and not the crisis itself.

But without that clarity, the statement certainly seems to suggest “we don’t want to see any NRF employees on social media expressing support for isolating Putin.” As one might imagine, this got people very angry.

And at least one of those people appears to be senior Norton Rose management.

Biglawboiz captured this:



Hopefully, Soliman’s read prevails within Norton Rose.

Because it’s one thing for a sprawling firm to tell lawyers that the right hand shouldn’t offer legal advice to the newspaper while the left hand is trying to sort out a oil and gas forward contract. It’s another to tell the firm to not talk.

# Is It Time To Officially Say Bye-Bye To The Billable Hour Thanks To AI?
## Generative AI may be dipping into your hours....

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

In my mind, it’s not a question of whether generative AI will have an impact on law firm reliance on the billable hour, it’s a question of when and where.

— [Jae Um](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaesunum/), former director of pricing strategy at Baker McKenzie, and founder and executive director at Six Parsecs, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/09/26/is-generative-ai-coming-for-your-billable-hours/) on the role generative artificial intelligence will play on the billable hour within the legal profession. In a recent Legaltech News survey, 45% of respondents said they believed that generative AI would lessen their reliance on the billable hour, while around 15% predicted it wouldn’t, and about 35% didn’t know.

# Higher Pay For Fewer Summer Associates -- But Layoffs May Be Looming
## Don't let those cushy paychecks distract you from the underlying news here...

Biglaw summer associate classes have been shrinking, but at some firms, paychecks have grown larger than ever before. At the nearly 100 firms that participated in this year’s summer associates survey conducted by the American Lawyer, summer hiring decreased by an average of 2.02 percent. On the flip side of the coin, law students who managed to be hired for a summer associateship earned an average salary of $3,285 per week, up 11.36 percent from last year.

As usual, firms located in New York City took the lead in terms of the most summer hires (2,175), followed by Chicago (311), Los Angeles (299), and Boston (222). Which firms had the largest increases and decreases in the sizes of their summer classes? Cadwalader had the largest decrease in summer associates on a percentage basis, with 48.9 percent fewer summers (dropping from 47 hires in 2016 to 24 hires in 2017), while Paul Hastings had the largest absolute decrease in summers (dropping from 132 in 2016 to 84 in 2017). Cadwalader said the decrease in hiring was intentional, to ensure that the firm “keep[s] quality up.” Paul Hastings, on the other hand, said 2016 was an “outlier” year, and that the firm’s summer classes tend to be “a bit smaller.”

Ogletree Deakins and Cleary Gottlieb saw the largest percentage increases in summer hires, with Ogletree hiring 83.3 percent more summers in 2017 than the year prior (though the class size only increased from 12 to 22), while Cleary had the largest increase in absolute summers, with 151 law students joining the firm, compared to the 97 the firm hired last year.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

Now, for the moment you’ve been waiting for, the firms with the highest and lowest pay. McKenna Moore of the Am Law Daily elaborates:

Four firms tied for the highest summer associate pay, $3,750 per week: Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson; Dechert; Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel; and Cooley. Tennessee-based Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz reported the lowest salary in the survey: $1,500 per week.

Don’t let those cushy paychecks distract you from the underlying news here: there are fewer summer associates for a reason.

According to Eric Seeger of Altman Weil, with clients sending less work to outside counsel, there is decreased demand across Biglaw. “In firms where partners are having a hard time keeping themselves busy, they have less work to throw to associates,” he said.

The bad news doesn’t end there. Survey respondents also said they expected to welcome fewer first-year associates to their firms in the fall, with average class sizes dropping from 40.4 to 38.6. Enjoy those paychecks while you can, summers, because 46 percent of Biglaw firms expect to have the same number of associates or fewer over the next five years.

Are layoffs coming to Biglaw in the future? The writing may already be on the wall, and it doesn’t seem to bode well for associates.

# Latest Biglaw Firm To Raise Associate Salaries Proves Compensation Hikes Aren't Just For The Biggest Firms
## Congrats on the raises!

It’s an easy call for the biggest in Biglaw to match the new associate compensation scale started earlier this year by Milbank and Cravath. Almost more interesting than a mega firm easily matching the raises, are the smaller outfits that are still proving they can keep up with the big dogs on salaries

Take for example the single-office firm, Choate Hall. The firm may have only had $311,956,000 in gross revenue last year, putting it in the second hundred of the Am Law ranking, but they have an impressive profits per equity partner number — over $3 million. Turns out that’s enough to get on board with the raises sweeping through Biglaw. In a Friday announcement, the firm told associates they’d all be getting raises in the new year.

The new compensation scale at the firm is as follows:


The full memo is available on the [next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/12/choate-compensation-23/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Biglaw Firm Conducts Layoffs, Citing 'Shifting Market Dynamics'
## Layoffs continue among even the most successful Biglaw firms.

Despite predictions of an onslaught of layoffs within the legal industry, the past few weeks have been relatively quiet on the job loss front. Perhaps it’s been a little too quiet. As it turns out, in the wake of bank failures, law firm leaders are still quite worried about the economy, and layoffs are still lurking among us. In fact, an Am Law firm conducted a round of layoffs quite recently.

Lowenstein Sandler — a firm that pulled in $392,080,000 gross revenue in 2021, landing it in 103rd place on the Am Law 200 — has laid off 16 business professionals across three offices in New York, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C., with most of the layoffs affecting the firm’s business development and staff recruiting personnel.

A spokesperson from the firm offered this statement concerning the layoffs:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“Changing client and attorney support needs, combined with shifting market dynamics, caused us to review our business services group staffing levels across the firm. As a result of this review, we made the difficult decision to separate from 16 of our business services professionals. We are grateful to each of these professionals for the valuable contributions made to the firm during their tenure and we are providing outplacement support and resources as they look for other opportunities.”

According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/16/lowenstein-lays-off-16-business-professionals-in-multiple-offices/), Lowenstein had quite a successful year in 2022, with gross revenue climbing by more than 15%, revenue per lawyer growing by 12.5%, and profits per equity partner increasing by nearly 27%. Following such a strong financial performance, you’d think layoffs would be off the table for a firm that’s likely to break into the Am Law 100 this year.

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Lowenstein Sandler.

# Federal Judge Does Not Take Kindly To Biglaw Firm Calling Him Names
## The judge was not about to let this roll off his back.

Oh this is fantastic. It’s really the best kind of benchslap because you don’t need to know any details about the case to understand the devastating slap this federal judge dropped on the Biglaw firm of Gibson Dunn.

The defendant, One Technologies, is represented by Gibson Dunn, led by partner Brian Robison, and co-counsel, Lynn Pinker Hurst & Schwegmann. In a brief, a reply in support of a motion for reconsideration, defense counsel referred to district court judge [Sam A. Lindsay’s ](http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/judge/district-judge-sam-lindsay)interpretation as “nonsensical,” and well, he does not take kindly to that. He analogizes — with citations — using “nonsensical” to calling him stupid, and that is a pretty glaring no-no in the judge’s book.

Take a look at the full benchslap:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Before the court addresses the parties’ arguments, it addresses the statement of counsel for Defendants that the court’s prior interpretation was “nonsensical,” among other things. Defs.’ Reply 1-2. The court takes no umbrage with an attorney disagreeing with its rulings, as at least one party will usually always be adversely affected by what the court does. Disagreement is not uncommon in a highly competitive legal environment. If an attorney believes that the court has made an incorrect ruling concerning a client, the attorney may take advantage of the appellate process.

Defendants’ attorneys’ tone and use of the word “nonsensical” are “beyond the pale.” The court considers the term “nonsensical” to be synonymous with “stupid” and the functional equivalent of using the term “B.S.” This understanding is supported by Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary. That Defendants’ counsel would display such effrontery to the court is astounding. In any event, if similar conduct recurs, the court will address such conduct with appropriate sanctions, as it will not tolerate such impertinent conduct. The court places the fault squarely at the feet of Defendants’ counsel, as they are responsible for filing documents, as well as the content therein, with the court. The court now addresses the substantive arguments made by the parties.

So everyone with cases in the Northern District of Texas, update your practice manuals and don’t ever, ever call Judge Lindsay, or any of his arguments, nonsensical again.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Davis Polk To The Rescue?
## Is it 2014 all over again?

Alas, no. This is not a replay of 2014, when Davis Polk [beat Simpson Thacher](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/) and set the new bonus market. It’s a repeat of 2015, when DPW [dutifully followed Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-announces/).

And you know what? People are fine with that. As one tipster told us, “Reaction is neither happy nor sad.” Said a second source, “As expected.” As we mentioned in our initial story about the [Cravath bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/), when you combine the summer pay raises with holding the line on bonuses, associates end up doing better this year than last.

Of course, even though these bonuses are nice, hope springs eternal in the debt-saddled law graduate’s breast. Is it possible the bonus scale could go higher? As I wrote [back in 2015](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/where-are-the-biglaw-bonuses-associate-bonus-watch-day-3/):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
There are, at most, five firms with any role to play in setting compensation for the top-shelf, New York-focused, lockstep firms — a compensation scale that then becomes the benchmark for Biglaw around the country. I will call these firms the “Fab Five”: Cravath (the usual first mover), Davis (last year’s scale setter), Simpson (last year’s first mover), Skadden (2008’s first mover), and Sullivan & Cromwell (which hasn’t been a player super-recently, but I’m giving them credit for [making spring bonuses happen](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/associate-bonus-watch-sullivan-cromwell-pays-generous-spring-bonuses/) back in 2011).

At this point, we’ve heard from three of the five: Cravath, Simpson, and Davis. If anyone trumps Cravath, it will be S&C or SASMF. If they both match, then game over.

Do you work at Skadden or Sullivan? When your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Associates At This Am Law 100 Firm Will Be Swimming In Money Thanks To These Raises
## Come take a dip in this pool of money, associates!

Every day since June 10 has been an especially great day to be a Biglaw associate in America. It was on that day that [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) raised salaries, and on June 11, [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) raised the bar even higher. Since then, associates have been waiting to see when their firm would allow them to dive into a gigantic pool of money on the new $205K salary scale.

To that end, Jenner & Block — ranked at No. 88 in the most recent Am Law 100 — had some great news for associates yesterday. The Chicago-based firm brought in $446,295,000 gross revenue in 2020, and now it’s bringing associates some big raises for their hard work during the pandemic. Here’s what the Davis Polk match looks like at Jenner:

- 2021: $202,500
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
