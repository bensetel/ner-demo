When it comes to the tech industry, the 2020s have been a decade of emerging rules.

But will the same hold true as the use of artificial intelligence quickly grows?

Join us and our friends at Ontra for this CLE-eligible webinar on Oct. 11 at 1 p.m. ET, where our expert panel will explore the potential for regulation of AI.

We’ll also look at what regulatory developments could mean in practice, particularly for in-house law departments.

The discussion will include:

>Emerging intellectual property and data security concerns
>Potential effects on legal ethics rules
>Past regulation of emerging technologies
>Practical applications — and how you can avoid pitfalls

Please fill out the form and join the discussion!

# Biglaw Firm Decides To Take A Back Seat To Elite Firms On Compensation
## All the firm needs are warm bodies with a J.D.

Not every Biglaw firm is created the same. At no time is that more apparent then during Biglaw raise season. The summer’s new associate compensation scale, that starts at $190,000 for first-year associates, was ushered in by Milbank, but not every big-time firm can match it.

Wiley Rein called an associate meeting where the managing partner announced that associates will not be getting raises. While there may be some small kindness in letting associates know not to hold their breath waiting for a raise that will never come, it still has to sting to know your firm can’t keep up with the Cravaths. Sources at the firm report that while there was an acknowledgement that this will obviously have an impact on the firm’s ability to recruit talented students out of law school and retain them once they’re at the firm, they’re not worried. As a tipster says:

Firm thinks everything will be fine since there’s plenty of law students out there.

Well, if all you need are warm bodies with a J.D., the firm should have plenty of options. But folks at the firm seemed surprised at the candor of the announcement:

Was surprising that he would speak that way, since he must have known it would leak to Above the Law.

Yeah, that’ll happen. Especially when the lack of raises or bonuses has left the firm with, to quote a tipster, “a lot of angry associates.”

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Gives Associates A Major Halloween Treat In The Form Of Raises
## The raises are retroactive to the beginning of 2021, so this is an especially nice treat.

Happy Halloween, associates! One Biglaw firm just gave its associates the best treat of all: raises. That’s right, it’s the end of October and law firms are still handing out raises. Which firm is the latest to scare up an increase in compensation?

That would be Littler — the world’s largest employment firm — which brought in $613,640,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 69 in the most recent Am Law 100. Yesterday, during a video town hall presentation, the firm announced raises for all U.S. associates, effective immediately and retroactive to January 1, 2021. The raises are based on market and associate level, and will range from $5,000 to $25,000. An insider at the firm says everyone is “really happy,” and particularly happy with the retroactive nature of the raise. In a way, it’s like associates at Littler are getting a little Halloween “bonus.”

Salaries at he firm are highly individualized, and while Littler’s salary bump may not match the Davis Polk money that’s become the prevailing rate in most major markets ($202.5K for the Class of 2021 and $205K for the Class of 2020, to be specific), money is money, so congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# Lawyers From Biglaw Firms Across The World Sign Statement Of Support For Israel After Terror Attacks
## It's time for lawyers to speak up on behalf of their Jewish colleagues.

While many of the world’s largest law firms have issued public or internal statements affirming their support for Israel in the wake of the brutal Hamas attacks on Jewish civilians, many other firms simply have not.

This lack of meaningful action is not sitting well attorneys, and they can be silent no longer.

Leading lawyers from prominent law firms around the world recently published a powerful statement — written by [Alex Kaufman](https://www.paulhastings.com/professionals/alexkaufman) of Paul Hastings — condemning the terrorist attacked in Israel and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense. You can read the statement below.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
We, the undersigned group of attorneys from around the world, publicly condemn and denounce the unspeakable acts of mass terror perpetrated by Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, against civilians in Israel.

We stand for the rule of law. We are shocked and horrified by the ghastly barbarism carried out against innocent civilians. We are angered by the cowardly crimes against humanity committed and the massive scale on which they were perpetrated.

We stand for moral consistency. We are profoundly disturbed by the litany of free people throughout the world who are indifferent, or even hostile, when confronted with Jewish suffering.

We stand against injustice. We therefore affirm that Israel has the undeniable right and obligation to pursue justice against those who harm it and murder its citizens, and to defend itself against further aggression.

We stand for peace. We affirm the right of all people – Jews and non-Jews – to live in peace and security, and we wholeheartedly reject the moral equivalence of bloodthirsty terrorists and Israel’s imperative to defend its population.

Finally, we affirm the promise made by our forebears — that never again will Jews sit by while other Jews are slaughtered en masse.

We call on our colleagues in the legal profession and elsewhere to stand with us and denounce terrorism against Israel and Jews throughout the world.

At the time of publication, more than 1,500 attorneys have signed on to this important statement. To add your name to the list of signatories, please click [here](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/global-lawyers-condemn-terrorism-in-Israel).

Please stand with Israel. Please donate. Please support your Jewish friends and colleagues. Am Yisrael Chai.

# Biglaw Firms Forced To Raise Salaries, Deliver Huge Bonuses Due To Hot Lateral Market
## Firms hope their big compensation packages will be enough to attract top talent.

We’re not seeing firms ask us for one or two associates. Some are coming to us saying we need 10.

The bonuses are more impacting the industry beyond the walls of what it typically has. This has broken that barrier. It has forced the hands of a lot of smaller markets to increase their compensation because in order to compete with talent, they have to compete with the big firms’ compensation because the firms are so much more willing to have people sit in other markets. Firms are being much more willing to pay what they need to pay in order to get really quality associates in the door.

— Summer Eberhard, West Coast-based managing director in the associate practice group at legal recruiter Major Lindsey & Africa, commenting on the [impact that special bonuses have had](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/lawyers-get-164-000-bonuses-to-keep-working-100-hours-a-week) on the associate lateral hiring market. Associates could receive [up to $164,000 in year-end and special bonus money](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) based on class year, on top of their already high salaries.

# Biglaw Recovery
## There can be a period of culture shock that new in-house counsel experience after leaving Biglaw.

Although I have been in-house for almost seven years, I can distinctly remember my “detoxification.” For those of you who are unaware of this phenomenon, allow me to enlighten you.

This is the period where recovering Biglaw lawyers may experience disorientation or dissociation during their transition into in-house life, especially if the cultures of their prior employer and new employer are vastly different. In other words, there can be a period of culture shock that new in-house counsel experience.

Here are a few of my unique experiences from my detoxification.

Losing My Skepticism Of Kindness

I vividly remember my first few weeks in-house and how everyone was so nice. People stopped what they were doing, got up out of their chairs with smiles that reached their eyes, and took the time to talk. They not only introduced themselves, but they also asked questions that they undoubtedly knew would extend the conversation (as if they genuinely wanted to get to know me).

And while we all know to say, “if you need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out,” they actually meant it — and even more astonishing to my jaded self — proactively shared resources about the team, department and company with me — unprompted.

This was not just a handful of nice people. It was everyone. And I didn’t know what to make of it. I kept thinking to myself, “What’s the catch?” “What’s their angle?” “Why is everyone so nice?”

It took me awhile, but now I understand that my current company has an incredible culture — in stark contrast to the more transactional nature of firm life, where every unbillable nicety was something that had to be made up later.

Shedding Toxic Productivity

Speaking of which, I also clearly remember waking up in the middle of the night on one occasion that first week with a panicked thought that I had forgotten to bill. And during the first few weeks, I was anxious because without billing and without any work product like a brief or discovery to show, I wasn’t sure how to “prove” to my new boss that I had indeed been working.

I remember going to my manager and asking if she wanted me to send her a weekly email with what I worked on, because I used to send weekly or every-other-week updates to my former shareholders on the cases that I managed for them. I also asked for more projects. She declined, and reassured me that my plate would get full soon enough as people got to know me.

Something I have been unable to shed — checking my email right when I wake up and right before I go to bed. But I have learned to curb my need to immediately respond to emails — although I may have an occasional involuntary twitch.

Learning To Be Growth-Minded

Last, but certainly not least, part of my detoxification experience included learning to be growth-minded and not being a perfectionist. When you’re in-house and clients need immediacy, you can’t let perfect be the enemy of good enough. Without the blame/throw-someone-under-the-bus culture and CYA culture that can often exist at a law firm, I learned to get comfortable with taking risk and exercising judgment — without all the facts and data. I had to learn to let go of fear of failure and accept uncertainty and that if I made a mistake, we would address, learn and move on.

Tongue-in-cheek[[1]](#f1) aside, it personally took me six months to feel settled — and there were moments in those early six months that I wondered if I made the wrong decision leaving firm life and considered a relapse. But almost seven years later post-recovery, I’m glad I stuck it out through the detoxification period.

[ [1]](#reff1) Please note that this post intentionally uses hyperbole to make a comparison between the stereotype of a toxic Biglaw culture and in-house but I do not intend to make light of addiction or mental health conditions.

With the men’s college basketball tournament approaching, we are inviting our clients and candidates to join Lateral Link’s bracket challenge for a chance to win $5,000. Entry is free, all you have to do is [register](https://app.laterallink.com/register) on Lateral Link, [follow us on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lateral-link), and fill out your [bracket](http://laterallink.mayhem.cbssports.com/e/e53e4a69e7d39c0ddc373d082d0d0eb4bf5dbd0eb3f2487c?ttag=BPM20_cpy_invite_new). Before practicing at Am Law 200 firms, most of our recruiters attended top law schools, and had the chance to witness the trials and tribulations of their school’s team firsthand. Here are their thoughts on their school’s chances in the upcoming tournament. 

[Paul Dorfeld](https://www.laterallink.com/team/paul-dorfeld/) | The Ohio State University

When I came to Ohio State, the basketball program was fresh off NCAA sanctions under the previous head coach. Over the next decade-plus, Thad Matta revitalized the program, leading them to five conference crowns, four conference tournament titles, two final fours, and an NIT title. Current head coach Chris Holtmann has brought the program back the past three seasons and currently has them ranked in the top 20. The boys are poised for a run this March, so the Buckeyes are my sleeper pick!

[Jesse Hyde](https://www.laterallink.com/team/jesse-hyde) | University of Michigan and Loyola University Chicago School of Law

In 2018, my two alma maters squared off in the Final Four. I have enjoyed seeing the recent success of both programs and am particularly excited about Juan Howard being Michigan’s coach. He is an outstanding leader and next year’s recruiting class is stacked. Go Blue!

[Steven Rushing](https://www.laterallink.com/team/steven-rushing/) | Florida

Florida was never a basketball school. At least until winning back-to-back NCAA championships in ’06-’07. Being on campus for that incredible run made winning seem easy and we’re living and breathing off that feeling to this day. With only a championship able to quench that thirst, I’m hoping for a miracle run with our hot and cold team this March Madness.

[Scott Hodes](https://www.laterallink.com/team/scott-hodes) | Florida

I started at the University of Florida right after their Final Four run in 1993. Coach Billy Donovan took over soon thereafter and really put Florida basketball on the map. Since that time, they made history with back-to-back championships with arguably one of the best college basketball teams in recent memory, and Gator fans have grown accustomed to deep tournament runs. Although inconsistent as of late, they are not a team to be taken lightly come every March.

[Ryan Belville](https://www.laterallink.com/team/ryan-belville) | Michigan

Michigan basketball keeps me afloat during the, shall we say, somewhat lean football years as of late. Two final fours and an elite 8 in the last seven years is solid. Let’s see if we can make another deep run this year. 

[David Lat](https://www.laterallink.com/team/david-lat) | Harvard

I am probably the one person in America who does not follow March Madness, so I’m afraid I don’t have much to say about Harvard — and given their history in the tournament, I don’t think there’s much to be said. I’ll just quote the Harvard Lampoon from 2013, when the Crimson did surprisingly well: “America, we are sorry for messing up your brackets and also your financial system and everything else.”

# Top 10 Biglaw Firm Is Conducting 'Merits-Based' Reviews That Have Resulted In Job Cuts
## The line between layoffs and performance-based cuts is growing awfully 'blurry.'

Springtime is upon us, and Biglaw firms seem to be doing their fair share of spring cleaning — i.e., conducting “performance reviews” that result in out-of-work associates. If that sounds like these firms are performing stealth layoffs, you may be right on the money based on past precedent.

One of the latest firms to make cuts is Ropes & Gray, which recently rose two places to No. 10 in the Am Law 100 by bringing in $2.718 billion gross revenue in 2022. (On the other hand, thanks to its successful recruitment strategies, the firm’s lawyer head count increased by 8.7%, which in turn caused its revenue per lawyer to drop by 6.5%.)

According to numerous message boards, Ropes recently made some attempts to slim down its associate ranks. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/13/in-response-to-layoff-chatter-ropes-gray-cites-merits-based-evaluation-process/) has the details:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[T]he firm said on Wednesday that any cuts result from a performance evaluation. The firm’s statement follows a Big Law trend this year of firms quietly making cuts through the review process.

“The quarterly performance management process is a part of the normal course [of] our business operations. We continue to use our same merits-based evaluation process,” the firm said in a statement provided by a spokesperson.

But how can you tell the difference between a stealth layoff and a genuine review-based termination these days? Industry experts say the line has become “increasingly blurry” in recent weeks. “All firms are engaged in a sort of rightsizing,” a consultant familiar with the New York market told Am Law. “Everyone is engaging in some process of looking at head count and so [using] these aggressive reviews.”

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Ropes & Gray.

# Orrick's New Partners: Diverse By Many Metrics

In the Biglaw annual calendar, what does January stand for? Some firms announce bonuses this month. Some lawyers, bonuses from last year in hand, make lateral moves. But perhaps the most notable thing about January is how it is, for most firms at least, the effective date of partnership for new partners.

In our [New Partner Watch](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/new-partner-watch/) feature, we’ve been writing about new partnership classes at selected firms. We tend to write about announcements that are, for one reason or another, interesting. For this current cycle, we’ve been focused on diversity (or the lack thereof) among new Biglaw partners. If you think you have a class that merits scrutiny, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=New%20Partner%20Watch) (subject line: “New Partner Watch”).

Today’s topic: the 18 new partners at [Orrick](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe/), which the firm just announced yesterday. From their [press release](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/orricks-new-partners-diverse-by-many-metrics/2) (posted in full on the next page):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Orrick announced today the admission of 18 lawyers to the firm’s partnership, effective January 1, 2017.

“We are thrilled to welcome these exceptional lawyers to our partnership,” said Orrick Chairman & CEO Mitch Zuklie. “This diverse team demonstrates our continued commitment to the technology, energy & infrastructure, and finance sectors, and to our powerhouse litigation and IP platform.”

Orrick’s 2017 partner class includes six tech-focused corporate partners, one energy & infrastructure partner and six finance partners. It includes five litigation partners, including two IP litigators. The new partners are based in eight U.S. offices, as well as in Paris and Düsseldorf. Eleven have spent their entire law firm careers with Orrick. Ten of the 18 are diverse or women lawyers.

Congratulations to these 18 new partners on grabbing the ultimate Biglaw brass ring, and congratulations to Orrick on the impressive diversity of its class. The new partners are diverse according to many metrics — by practice area, geography, racial or ethnic background, and gender.

There are six partners who are diverse in terms of race/ethnicity: Daniel Kim (Los Angeles), David Lin (San Francisco), Bola Oloko (New York), Cathy Lui (San Francisco), John Palmer (San Francisco), and Michael Yang (Silicon Valley). There are five women partners: Irma Foley (D.C.), Christine Reynolds (Portland), Alyssa Caridis (Los Angeles), Diane Lamarche (Paris), and Cathy Lui (San Francisco).

The wording of the Orrick announcement is worth noting as well. Firm chair Mitch Zuklie praises this “diverse team” of “exceptional lawyers,” and the announcement explicitly notes that 10 out of the 18 new partners are diverse or women lawyers.

This decision arises out of our conclusion that, given current and expected conditions, we cannot provide for a meaningful summer experience that allows our students to perform to their full potential.

— a spokesperson for Pepper Hamilton, commenting on the firm’s recent decision to [cancel its summer associate program](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/pepper-hamilton-troutman-sanders-nix-summer-associate-programs) alongside that of its merger partner, Troutman Sanders. Both firms have extended full-time job offers to the affected law students who would have spent their summers at the firms, [offering “financial assistance” to them](https://www.businessinsider.com/two-big-law-firms-cancel-summer-associate-programs-2020-4) as well. The merger between Pepper Hamilton and Troutman Sanders is being [postponed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-merger-postponed-due-to-unprecedented-coronavirus-challenges/) until July 1, 2020, due to the coronavirus.

# WilmerHale And The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Of Leaking Client Whistleblower Docs To The WSJ

Handing a drink to the SEC. (via Kendall and Kylie/YouTube)

Did you know that Pepsico’s former general counsel Maura Smith initiated an internal investigation into allegations of financial misreporting and that the SEC is looking into her subsequent departure as a possible violation of whistleblower laws? We didn’t either until yesterday, when the Wall Street Journal [told the world about it](https://www.wsj.com/articles/departure-of-pepsico-lawyer-is-focus-of-sec-probe-1506504603?mod=e2tw) after accidentally receiving a privileged memo from WilmerHale.

So if you know a Wilmer attorney, give ’em a hug today.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The memo, discussing a subpoena Smith received, was sent to the Wall Street Journal in an email including a number of other attorneys working on the matter. Given the circumstances, it’s safe to say someone’s inline autocomplete got the better of them. For any attorneys using a mailbox with that feature… maybe turn it off. On the plus side, as an efficiency aid, it saves you a few seconds every day. On the downside, one day it’ll send privileged and potentially career-ending documents to the press. Weigh those out and do whatever you think is best. Don’t worry, you can continue this story after you [go into your mail preferences](http://accc.uic.edu/answer/how-do-i-disable-outlook-auto-complete-and-clear-cache).

Welcome back. Wilmer’s statement, as [reported by Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/09/27/wilmer-inadvertently-leaks-pepsi-client-secrets-to-wall-street-journal/), falls appropriately upon the sword:

We deeply regret that privileged documents were inadvertently emailed to a reporter at The Wall Street Journal. WilmerHale takes full responsibility, and we apologize to our client. We promptly advised The Wall Street Journal of the error and asked the reporter to delete the material. The reporter told us he had deleted the material, but we later learned he had printed and retained hard copies.

We are disappointed that The Journal has decided to publish private information it knew was protected by our client’s legal privilege. We are taking additional measures designed to ensure that emails are not misaddressed to unintended recipients.

Is it just me, or does this measured professionalism come across as hopelessly archaic? Perhaps the real takeaway from all this for Wilmer should be the need for new public relations personnel. It’s 2017! A technological screw-up like this can’t be explained away with words like “inadvertently.” Here’s some free P.R. advice for Wilmer in case this comes up again:

Saw the failing WSJ attacking Pepsico. People won’t fall for your #fakenews. Sad!

Today, Wilmer will begin picking up the pieces and mending fences with their client. No word yet on the professional fate of the lawyer who sent the privileged and embarrassing information to the Wall Street Journal, Thomas Cocacola.

# The U.S. Cities Where Biglaw Associates Are The Most Satisfied (2022)
## How did your firm do in this city-by-city ranking?

‘We love our firm!’

Here at Above the Law, we’ve spent the past week or two discussing what makes Biglaw associates satisfied with their jobs. From their compensation to their firm’s commitment to their career development to their interaction with partners, there’s a whole lot at play when it comes to keeping associates happy and fulfilled professionally. But where in the U.S. are midlevel associates the most satisfied, and which firms are doing the best in each major market? Of course there’s a ranking for that, so let’s dig in.

As part of the American Lawyer’s Midlevel Associates Survey, firms were assessed on several aspects of job satisfaction and graded on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score. For the city-by-city satisfaction ranking, firms were rated by location, listing which associates are most satisfied across a particular city. As noted by Am Law, a change in location could mean a world of difference when it comes to professional happiness.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
[A] lawyer’s experience at a firm can vary wildly depending on the practice they are in, the partner they work for or the office where they practice. A satellite office may offer a different experience than a headquarters, a full-service office may offer a different feel than one that houses only a few practices. …

[A]s the various city rankings will show, firms don’t always do well across all of their locales.

So, where can we find the most satisfied midlevels? It may be time for lawyers to giddyap and head down south, because it looks like they’re the happiest in Dallas, Texas, where the average satisfaction sore for the city was a 4.557. Here are the rest of the cities, in order of overall satisfaction.

- Dallas, TX: 4.557
- Salt Lake City, UT: 4.538
- Philadelphia, PA: 4.467
- Palo Alto, CA: 4.444
- Denver, CO: 4.439
- Houston, TX: 4.433
- San Francisco, CA: 4.405
- Atlanta, GA: 4.389
- Los Angeles, CA: 4.382
- New York, NY: 4.368
- Chicago, IL: 4.356
- Boston, MA: 4.350
- Washington, D.C.: 4.329
- Charlotte, NC: 4.298
- Miami, FL: 4.205
Associates in some of the most major markets of all are the least satisfied, with Miami coming in last place for midlevel satisfaction. And here we thought the city was [becoming “Wall Street south”](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/miami-is-bringing-the-heat-for-biglaw-firms/) (but by the looks of it, associates in “Wall Street north” aren’t that satisfied, either).

The market has been subverted by uber-aggressive U.S. firms, to no-one’s benefit.

— A rather critical response given by a Biglaw partner in the UK when asked about associate salaries in a survey published by [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2022/02/07/almost-all-law-firm-partners-think-their-nqs-earn-too-much/). According to that survey, 95% of respondents believe that salaries for junior lawyers are now too high, and 84% of respondents said they felt negative about the most recent round of raises. Only 5% felt positive about Milbank’s latest round of salary increases.

# A Short Defense Of Jones Day
## Yeah, yeah: Some folks at Jones Day worked for Trump.

I really don’t do this. Really.

I worked at Jones Day for 20 years, 17 as a partner. I was perfectly happy there. In 2009, I was offered an in-house job that I couldn’t resist, and I left the joint on good terms. I don’t think I’ve mentioned Jones Day in writing since, in what is now approaching 700 columns here at Above the Law. But it’s time to break my silence: The [New York Times went overboard](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/7325986265427203525#) with its criticism this week.

Yeah, yeah: Some folks at Jones Day worked for Trump. Yeah, yeah: All right-thinking liberals — and, after January 6, to my eye, all right-thinking individuals — believe that Trump’s a scumbag. I certainly have been doing nothing in this column to curry favor with the possible next Trump administration. Here’s my final “yeah, yeah”: Some of the lawyers who worked in the Trump administration later returned to Jones Day.

I have this to say about all of that: Jones Day has about 2,500 lawyers. How many of those 2,500 worked on Trump stuff? 20? 30? 50? I can’t believe it was more than that; 50 lawyers staffs up an awful lot of big projects.

So what’s the average schlub partner in the Cleveland, or Los Angeles, or London office of Jones Day thinking about while those 50-ish lawyers are off doing their Trump things? “That Trump stuff might be a little offensive to me, but I’ve got other things to worry about — like tending to big corporate litigation or mergers and acquisitions.” The average Joe knows that the firm is playing its silly political games — the folks in D.C. always do — but that Joe is preoccupied with doing the things that busy lawyers do.

Moreover, be honest: Most of you would have an extraordinarily hard time turning down a high-ranking government job, even if the job were offered by an administration of which you were skeptical. (Think of the many arguments with which you disagreed that you’ve advanced in court for your clients.) One Jones Day partner agreed to serve as solicitor general under Trump. Solicitor general is an extraordinarily cool job; it permits you to represent the United States in the most interesting constitutional disputes of our time, assisted by the bevy of former Supreme Court clerks who work as assistants to the SG. Moreover, the job is generally not political — Dean Erwin Griswold worked at Jones Day after serving as the solicitor general in both the Johnson and Nixon administrations, so politics is obviously not dispositive.

I’m sure that a few of you — working at stridently liberal plaintiffs’-side firms and untempted by intellectual intrigue or resume-padding — would turn down the job of SG if offered it by a Republican administration. But I bet that most readers of this column would wrestle briefly with their consciences and then respond to the job offer with a hearty, “Hell, yeah; I accept!”

So, too, for serving as White House counsel. That must be a fascinating job. Most of it would not be political. You’d have hugely talented help — again, the staff is basically former Supreme Court clerks. And you’d be worth a fortune after acting in that capacity. If offered the job early in the Trump administration — before January 6 — how many of you would honestly have turned it down?

My argument is admittedly less convincing for jobs lower down in the governmental hierarchy. The jobs are less interesting as you move down the ladder, and your stomach might turn a bit more at the thought of helping someone with whom you disagree politically. But I bet many readers of this column insist that they’d never take a high-ranking government job, secure in the knowledge that there’s no chance they’d ever be offered one.

Finally, as weird as it sounds, Jones Day as a firm actually leans Democratic. In the 2020 federal elections, 86% of donations from Jones Day lawyers went to Democrats; in 2016, Jones Day lawyers donated $284,675 to Clinton and $7,622 to Trump. That’s no surprise — Jones Day lawyers by definition have post-graduate degrees; they’re not exactly cut from the less-educated mold that constitutes Trump’s base.

Could one be slightly offended by some of the choices that certain Jones Day lawyers made in the past six years? Maybe. But, so far as I know, no one from Jones Day has lost their license or is yet headed to jail on Trump’s behalf.

And the vast majority of the joint are merely lawyers being lawyers, only vaguely conscious of, and completely unaffected by, the political intrigues of the active few in D.C.

Let the nasty emails begin.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Hint: The firm’s equity partnership is 32.3 percent women. Though it should be noted women make up more than half of law school students and have been at over 40 percent for decades, so still there’s plenty of room for improvement.

Robert Mueller

Big news. Yuge. In a letter [obtained by CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/special-counsel-robert-mueller/index.html), the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, has appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to shepherd the investigation into the possible interference by Russia into the 2016 presidential election.

Mueller has a sterling reputation in law enforcement. He led the FBI for 12 years and has previous public service including as United States Attorney for the Northern District of California and acting United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. He’s been appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents for those positions.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Prior to his appointment as special counsel, Mueller was a partner at WilmerHale. He has now resigned from the firm to focus on the investigation. Which, given [the firm’s](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/ivanka-trump-lawyer-jamie-gorelick-clintons-236445) [representation](http://www.businessinsider.com/jared-kushner-role-trump-white-house-2017-1) of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, is probably for the best. [While at the firm](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uxzhLY3awr8J:https://www.wilmerhale.com/robert_mueller/+&cd=18&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) his practice focused on investigations, crisis management, privacy and, perhaps most importantly for this particular assignment, cybersecurity work.

The reality is that no matter what level of success you achieve, whether it’s a partner of a firm, a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, it doesn’t matter. The treatment isn’t fair and equal. It isn’t our reality. When I looked at George Floyd pleading for his life, it carried the baggage I’ve carried with my entire life. It could have been me. It could have been my nephew; it could have been my cousin.

— [Robert Simpson](https://www.carltonfields.com/team/s/robert-r-simpson), a partner at Carlton Fields, reflecting on his thoughts after [watching the video of George Floyd’s death](https://www.law.com/2020/06/03/it-could-have-been-me-black-attorneys-reflect-on-george-floyds-death-and-what-comes-next/) under the knee of a police officer.

Associates, did you click on this hoping for some firm to beat the Cravath bonus scale? Temper your greed — and think about your colleagues on the staff side.

Ever since Biglaw bonus season started, we’ve received a slew of emails from law firm support staff wondering what their fate may be as the Benjamins continue to rain down upon associates. After all, it takes an army for law firms this large to run, and the behind-the-scenes battalions of staff members deserve their due, too.

After an extremely successful year, despite the ongoing pandemic, one of the most prestigious firms in the country came to the conclusion that its worldwide support staff — a class defined as business services and legal services employees who don’t participate in its legal bonus scheme — deserved a little bit more during COVID times, and decided to issue special bonuses to them of $1,500, on top of any year-end bonuses they were already due to receive. (Sources tell us these bonuses can be up to 20 percent of annual salary for the highest performers.)

Congratulations to White & Case for showing their staff members some appreciation during these tough times. “I am immensely proud of the role that each of you have played in contributing to our success, and the way in which we have risen to the challenges presented by the pandemic,” writes White & Case chief operating officer Greg Dolan. Staffers at the firm are quite pleased:

It was a very pleasant surprise! And nice to know that our firm’s support for its business services employees isn’t just lip service.

Add this to the fact that we haven’t faced any layoffs or salary reductions at White & Case this year, it makes it a great place to work for lawyers and non-lawyers alike!

Staff bonuses at White & Case will be paid sometime in December. Congrats to all!

# Should Law Firms Ban Or Embrace Generative AI?
## Eliminating generative AI from your firm’s toolkit increases your firm’s risk of falling behind in efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and innovation.

“We completely outlawed the use of ChatGPT in our firm,” a law firm partner recently told me. 

“How’s that working for you?” I asked. 

“Our lawyers are probably among the most adept generative AI users around,” he shrugged. 

Firms may monitor online traffic and prohibit lawyers from visiting specific domains on office computers. But lawyers can, and will, still experiment with generative AI on their personal devices and at home. 

Some may even use tools like ChatGPT for legal work without telling anyone. They could divulge confidential client information and make important decisions relying solely on AI analysis without you ever knowing.

Its unenforceability alone highlights the short-sightedness of a total ban on generative AI. Instead, law firms can benefit by carefully crafting a use policy to monitor and guide lawyers. Here’s why and how it works.

Bans Overlook The Many Benefits AI Offers

Banning generative AI outright may seem like a straightforward way to prevent the attendant ethical and legal issues. But generative AI can create content, draft and summarize documents, and perform tasks with stunning speed and impressive accuracy. Leveraging generative AI can save lawyers significant time and resources while helping to produce high-quality legal work at lower costs.

Eliminating generative AI from your firm’s toolkit increases your firm’s risk of falling behind in efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and innovation. A ban also ignores the reality that clients increasingly expect lawyers to use technology to better serve their needs. Seven in 10 in-house counsel [recently surveyed](https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/research-and-reports/generative-ai-and-the-legal-profession-report.html) expect their law firms to use cutting-edge technology, including generative AI tools. Waiting too long or failing to do so could harm your firm’s ability to remain relevant. 

Plus, bans drive AI use underground, in the dark, where it can be misused. It’s better to foster a culture that values and promotes the responsible use of AI. A good AI use policy helps lawyers understand how and when to use generative AI to minimize risk and maximize value. 

What makes a good AI use policy?

A comprehensive AI use policy can help provide much-needed guidance to lawyers and staff. It ensures legal professionals deploy and use AI solutions ethically and transparently and fosters an open environment for discussing ethical quandaries, expressing concerns, and reporting difficulties with AI systems. Such a policy may:

- Clearly define the scope of use of generative AI applications in the firm. 
- Establish requirements for data privacy and client confidentiality. 
- Encourage discussions with clients about the use of AI in their cases. 
- Require lawyer and staff training on generative AI best practices and ethical considerations.
As the AI field moves quickly, it makes sense to designate a “policy owner” to keep abreast of technological advancements and regularly update the policy as needed. [Many resources are available](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/ongoing-ai-education-strategies-and-resources-for-lawyers/) to help lawyers and firms understand AI and how to use it ethically and responsibly.

A Well-Crafted AI Policy Is An Empowerment Tool

A well-crafted generative AI use policy ensures your firm’s legal professionals know the ethical guidelines surrounding AI usage, including the potential risks and consequences. Its guidance encourages legal professionals to develop and sharpen their technical skills and readily adapt to change — the type of skills and abilities needed to compete in the future.

Your policy will encourage compliance with legal and ethical requirements and foster a culture of competence and integrity. Trained and knowledgeable AI users are better equipped to make conscientious decisions grounded in innovative thinking. Embrace a policy-driven approach to harness the benefits of generative AI while maintaining the highest level of professionalism and adherence to ethical standards.

# Biglaw Firm Awards Special Bonuses And Expands Bonus Pool For Extra Valuable Associates
## Of course the firm re-upped bonuses when the market moved.

Bonus season is upon us and Biglaw is busy giving out lots of money to the associates who make the firms tick.

As you may recall, Fried Frank was already pretty quick on the bonus draw, announcing year-end bonuses that matched the Cravath scale[ way back on November 24th](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/fried-frank-bonus/). But now that[ Davis Polk has moved the goal posts](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/) via new special bonuses, well another bonus memo is in order for the firm (ranked 60th on the Am Law 100 with $780,300,000 in gross revenue in 2020).

Yesterday, the firm announced special bonuses on that Davis Polk scale:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  


But as an extra kicker, the firm, which previously announced additional bonuses for “extraordinary efforts,” is bumping up the size of that pool, from $2,250 – $30,000 to $3,000 to $34,500.

As you know, the Firm has had a long-standing commitment to rewarding the extraordinary efforts of its attorneys by paying premiums of 15% or 30% above the market bonus amounts for attorneys who meet the criteria specified in our year-end bonus policies. As an update to the Firm’s 2021 Year-End Bonus Policy, the 15% and 30% premiums will be applied to the 2021 bonus scale announced on November 24, so that premium amounts will range from $3,000 to $34,500. For example, an associate in the class of 2014 is eligible to receive a maximum year-end bonus of $149,500, plus special bonuses totaling a maximum of $87,000.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

# Biglaw Associate On Trial For Punching Man After Alleged Homophobic Slur
## He says he acted in self-defense.

Barney Gush, an associate in the Real Estate Disputes practice in the London office of Eversheds Sutherland, is facing charges of inflicting grievous bodily harm after a September 2021 night out. He’s accused of fracturing the jaw of investment banker, Jonathan Luke, but Gush contends he only did so after he was called a homophobic slur at a London bar.

As[ reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/eversheds-sutherland-lawyer-punched-banker-over-alleged-homophobic-slur) RollOnFriday, Luke says he was “reasonably tipsy” at the time of the incident:

“I was with colleagues and having a nice time and I remember feeling this punch at the bottom of my jaw from the right. It felt like a big, sudden impact, a shock,” Luke told the court. “I was not braced for any impact and it was very sore. I felt a bit of a hole in my mouth and it was where the jaw had displaced.”

Luke said he hoped he could sleep it off, but went to A&E in the morning. “I could not swallow and two metal plates were put in to crack the lower jaw back into place,” he said.

Gush, through his attorney, Aisling Byrnes, paints a different picture, saying Luke was “very drunk” and he was “making a little bit of a nuisance” of himself on the dance floor:

Gush claims that the banker shouted the gay slur: “F*** off you little p***,” due to his flamboyant dancing at the bar. Luke denies making the homophobic slur.

Byrnes said that while it is not disputed that Gush hit Luke, the banker had “made physical contact” with Gush while he was dancing. “He and his friend moved away and you backed into him harder than before while he was dancing,” Byrnes put it to Luke.

According to Gush, he asked Luke why he kept bumping into him and told him to leave him alone. But Luke insisted: “I didn’t really bump into anyone.”

Prosecutors have disputed Gush’s story, saying Luke “did not commit any act of violence” and “nothing justified the defendant punching him in the face with such force.” But Gush insists he acted in self-defense, and Luke moved towards him with his arm at “neck and chest height.”

The trial is ongoing.

# For The Love Of All That Is Holy, Stop Blaming ChatGPT For This Bad Brief

“Here’s What Happens When Your Lawyer Uses ChatGPT,” blasted the [New York Times headline](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html) to the delight of tech skeptic lawyers everywhere. A seemingly quite irate Judge Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York issued [a show cause order](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/05/Show-Cause.pdf) directed at the law firm of Levidow, Levidow & Oberman and its attorneys Peter LoDuca and Steven Schwartz asking why he shouldn’t impose sanctions after a number of cases in the firm’s recent filing turned out to be made up — another of [ChatGPT’s well-documented court case hallucinations](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/chatgpt-crowns-clarence-thomas-as-champion-of-gay-rights-in-feedback-loop-of-stupid/).

An airline defendant filed a motion to dismiss a personal injury claim that had wound its way into federal court. The case belonged to Schwartz, but after it was removed to federal court, LoDuca became counsel of record and [filed the response to the motion to dismiss](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/05/GPT-Brief.pdf) under his name. It deals with a lot of thorny issues — competing statutes of limitations, the Bankruptcy Code, international treaties — but the response managed to find on-point citations for every procedural hurdle. Pretty compelling stuff!

The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit specifically addresses the effect of a bankruptcy stay under the Montreal Convention in the case of Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co.. Ltd., 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019), stating “Appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims as untimely. They assert that the limitations period under the Montreal Convention was tolled during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Court proceedings. We agree. The Bankruptcy Code provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as a stay of proceedings against the debtor that were or could have been commenced before the bankruptcy case was filed. 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)….

And the purported quote from the Eleventh Circuit detailing the precise result plaintiff sought under the precise instance of bankruptcy impaired, Montreal Convention statute of limitations goes on with multiple internal citations for another half a page.

Unfortunately, this case doesn’t exist. And some of the internal citations don’t either. Perhaps finding a whole page of directly quotable support for a hyperspecific legal question should’ve tipped someone off?

Schwartz had asked the buzzy AI application to give him a research assist, unaware that those of us covering generative AI have [flagged its propensity to flagrantly make stuff up to please its user](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/the-legal-industry-has-a-long-way-to-go-before-gpt-matches-the-talk/). And it’s very, very confident in its output regardless of its ability to back it up, which is why the epithet “Mansplaining as a Service” rings so true. That’s also why the conversation among the tech savvy has advanced from what generative AI can accomplish to [how do you put ethical and professional guardrails on this thing](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/casetext-cocounsel-ai-tool/)?

But while the media — and the social media zeitgeist — spent the weekend ripping ChatGPT, this isn’t about generative AI. They can chase the clicks with their GPT headlines, but this is a simple lawyering story.

This isn’t any different than turning in a brief with red-flagged cases or just slapping the first 10 results from a database search into the filing and calling it a day. The problem wasn’t the search that ChatGPT produced, it was the lawyer failing to bother to read the full opinions in the cases he chose to cite.

That’s why I’m not really buying the Schwartz defense that he had never really used the app and “therefore was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false.” It doesn’t matter if the results were right or wrong, you still have to read the frickin’ opinions! Back in the day, a Westlaw or Lexis search would rarely turn up the right result on a lawyer’s first stab at it — and you had to check to make sure the opinion really was useful.

Adding generative AI to the mix of research tools doesn’t alter that calculus. It just — when deployed with the right protections — reduces the number of tries an attorney will need to get the right cases. That’s going to make a significant improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of lawyering. But it’s not replacing the attorney.

Don’t blame AI for lawyering fails. Like a lot of things in tech, the source of the error here lies between the keyboard and the chair.

# Am Law 100 Firm Offers ZERO Year-End Bonus 'Without Any Acknowledgement'
## 'A Real Life National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.'

At the end of 2022, Cozen O’Connor left its attorneys fuming when it [issued “special” bonuses far below the market standard](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/cozen-special-bonus-2022/). At the time, we wrote that “at least they’re getting bonuses at all….” That proved darkly prophetic as 2023 came to a close and associates have realized there aren’t going to be bonuses at all.

The AmLaw100 firm Cozen O’Connor gave no year-end bonuses this year. This is shocking given the consistent year-end bonuses, and even special bonuses, over the past few years. There is major dissension among the associates right now. Is the firm in trouble?

The frustration isn’t limited to bonuses, as the perennially below-market firm sent around an email about salaries that left attorneys flat:

After a thorough review and analysis, we are pleased to announce that starting salaries for the 2024 class will be increased by between $10,000 and $15,000. Nothing will change in our compensation process for existing attorneys.

In other words, the firm is making an adjustment to protect its law school recruiting but doing nothing for attorneys already on staff. And, for some unknown reason, sent this to the attorneys who aren’t the class of 2024. Everyone else has to wait to see if they get any adjustment to match their peers at other firms.

We will reflect our new compensation structure in compensation adjustments made during the normal compensation process in Feb/March 2024 (retroactive to January 1, 2014).

Presumably January 1, 2024.

But back to bonuses. Last cycle, the firm explained that, despite a profitable 2022, they had to pinch pennies over fears that 2023 would present economic headwinds. Fast forward, and Cozen leadership has consistently boasted a strong 2023 to its team. Yet not only has there been no talk of making lawyers whole based on last year’s cuts, there aren’t any bonuses this year.

And associates report receiving no warning that they’d be going into the holidays empty-handed.

Cozen O’Connor has lapsed into a real life National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation. Every year, without fail, firm offered a bonus at the end of the year that was not merit based but universally offered. Above the Law covered it last year. Without any acknowledgement, the firm has not given the bonus this year. Attorneys have been left in the dark completely. Many were of course relying on it. This has enraged countless attorneys. 

Reportedly, counsel are also not getting bonuses, but at least they were warned that this was coming.

Law firm “bonuses” aren’t so much “bonuses” as a “variable salary tier.” No one knows at the beginning of the year exactly how much the bonus gods (read: Cravath) will bestow upon the market, but, like Clark Griswold, associates still count on it as part of their salary. To yank it without warning just… well…

Clark: I was expecting a check. Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club. 17 years with the company. I’ve gotten a Christmas bonus every year but this one. You don’t want to give bonuses, fine. But when people count on them as their salary, well what you did just plain…

Rusty Griswold: Sucks.

It was only a matter of time. This was inevitable. Others will follow.

If you could see in to the offices of managing partners and chairs at other firms across the US today, you’d observe a lot of eye-rolling and head shaking about this announcement.

It advances an arms race that most firms don’t want to advance. But it was inevitable given a perfect storm of low expenses and very high performance by many firms for several years in a row leading a large group to be flush with cash to invest in talent in a tight talent market.

# How Did Reproductive Rights Group Get Mixed Up With Attorneys Making Anti-Abortion Donations?
## A lesson in how legal needs to be considered part of a unified entity.

Clients and lawyers don’t necessarily have to see eye-to-eye on everything. But when you’re a political think tank raising money from donors to advance a cause, maybe funneling those donations to a law firm with a PAC funding the other side is… ill-advised.

That’s what appears to be happening at the Guttmacher Institute, a high-profile reproductive rights think tank, that’s presently signing checks to Jackson Lewis. Unfortunately, [Jackson Lewis passes some of that money along to anti-abortion candidates](https://jezebel.com/leading-abortion-research-group-employs-law-firm-that-g-1849518992) through its affiliated PAC. Guttmacher Employees United, the group’s unionized employees, have called on their bosses to sever its ties with the firm.

Cynics will point out that dropping Jackson Lewis would inure to the benefit of the union, since the pro-employer firm represents Guttmacher Institute in contract negotiations. But this is a red herring. Guttmacher could easily replace Jackson Lewis with any number of the talented anti-union law firms out there. That’s not a knock on Jackson Lewis, whose credentials in this area are well known, but they aren’t the only anti-union firm in the sea. This is less about an imagined tactical advantage and all about calling out an advocacy group for putting its money where its mouth isn’t.

And, of course, Jackson Lewis isn’t only giving to anti-abortion politicians. Like a lot of firms with lobbying arms, it’s playing the field to stay in the good graces of a lot of politicians. Though that’s probably a reason why a reproductive rights group should steer clear of lobbying firms.

A statement reveals that the organization is either terminally stupid or assumes you are:

Guttmacher Institute said the organization’s progressive mission is not swayed by lawyers. “Lawyers do not determine our values and positions on any issues, including unionization. Our CEO has always been very clear that Guttmacher leadership supports our staff’s desire to organize and that our management looks forward to working with the union, and this position has guided the relationship with Jackson Lewis,” a spokesperson for Guttmacher told Jezebel by email. One Friday, the union [announced a public petition](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/dfd8ec8cb8554c0a13bc152c3111cae43f0a44f5) against Jackson Lewis.

No one is saying the lawyers have determined Guttmacher’s values, they’re saying Guttmacher’s values took a back seat to securing counsel.

Again, from a legal perspective, a client can hire whoever it wants to represent it. But when entities hire attorneys who clash with the group’s mission, that’s a business problem. The bottom line is this group hired a law firm that they either knew or should have known uses firm proceeds to fund politicians seeking abortion bans. That’s just bad executive decision-making.

Because legal work is not a pocket dimension cabined off from the rest of a client’s identity. Outside counsel becomes an extension of the business and management has to consider who it chooses as its avatar. If the client has a brand identity to maintain, it’s incumbent upon leadership to make sure it’s not undermining itself.

# Biglaw Partner Dishes On the Pandemic's Impact On the Cannabis Industry, Diversity and Fulfilling Your Family's Legacy
## Choosing a practice area matters -- a lot.

In this episode, I speak with Meghana Shah, partner at Eversheds Sutherland, about why her practice area was appealing and what an average day looks like for her. We discuss how the pandemic impacted Meghana’s practice and what she thinks is on the horizon for the cannabis industry. Meghana shares her tips for others hoping to become a Biglaw partner and some of the highs and lows of her career. We also chat about why diversity has been such a challenge for the legal industry, and what Meghana thinks can be done to improve D&I efforts.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

# Former Partner Sentenced To 5 Years In Prison For Scheme To Defraud Biglaw Firms
## Her future includes a minimum-security federal prison in West Virginia.

The long, sordid legal drama of former Biglaw partner Keila Ravelo has finally entered the sentencing phase. Ravelo, formerly a partner at both Hunton & Williams and Willkie Farr & Gallagher, [pleaded guilty last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/former-willkie-partner-pleads-guilty-to-role-in-fraud-scheme/) to tax evasion and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with a $7.8 million litigation vendor scheme to defraud her former firms. Yesterday, Judge Kevin McNulty of the District of New Jersey sentenced Ravelo to five years in prison with three years of supervised release.

For those who don’t remember the details of [Ravelo’s misdeeds](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/who-is-the-worst-behaved-former-biglaw-attorney/), let’s give y’all a brief primer. Ravelo, along with her now-estranged husband, Melvin Feliz, were arrested back in 2014 and indicted on charges of wire fraud and embezzlement for allegedly creating dummy corporations to funnel “legal consulting fees” — for work that was never actually done — from both of her former firms. The indictment was amended to include charges of tax evasion and using fake billings to funnel the $7.8 million they obtained in litigation support fees back to themselves for personal use, which included financing a “lifestyle of the rich and famous” — at least that’s how prosecutors describe it. The couple bought multiple properties, expensive artwork, jewelry, and private jet rides.

Feliz pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme in August 2015, and was sentenced to four years in prison. Ravelo’s sentence added an extra year on, as Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/10/10/ex-big-law-partner-ravelo-sentenced-to-5-years-for-vendor-fraud-scheme/), because Judge McNulty seemed to be compelled by the prosecution’s argument that Ravelo’s breach of trust of her former firms warranted additional jail time:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It was Ravelo, not Feliz, who was a partner at Hunton and then Willkie and who had built relationships with the firms and the client, prosecutors said, and it was Ravelo who manipulated the payment mechanisms to keep the conspiracy going.

Prosecutors said Ravelo went to great lengths to keep the conspiracy going. For instance, they said, Ravelo posed as the head of one of the bogus vendors and lied to her law firm and each of her partners in order to cover up and extend the conspiracy. They also said Ravelo used people over whom she had influence to help hide her illegal activity, including at one point causing an associate she led to submit a summary chart detailing alleged vendor work product to Willkie.

The government said in 2012, after Willkie almost detected the activity, she orchestrated the payment of the bills through an accounting firm that would be reimbursed by the law firm.

Ravelo is expected to surrender by January, and was recommended to a women’s minimum-security federal prison in West Virginia.

# Thanks To Omicron Variant, Elite Biglaw Firm Makes Office Work 'Voluntary' For Lawyers Through March 2022
## Things continue to change for the future of law firm office work due to COVID variants.

As we get closer and closer to the new year, more and more Biglaw and boutique firms seem to be getting antsy about the latest coronavirus variant. Omicron is here, and it’s even more transmissible than the delta variant. Magic Circle firms in the UK have already told their personnel to [start working from home](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/uk-magic-circle-firms-bring-back-covid-19-remote-work-requirements-thanks-to-omicron-variant/), and certain firms in the US have already [revised their return-to-office plans](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/litigation-boutique-revises-its-hybrid-return-to-office-plan-due-to-omicron-variant/) for 2022. In fact, the latest one to announce a change of plans due to omicron is one of the top firms in the country.

Goodwin Procter — a firm that brought in $1,486,263,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it at No. 23 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — notified employees that it would be pushing back its official reopening date to March 14, 2022.

Since November, the firm had been encouraging lawyers to work from the office at least two-to-three days each week, with plans for a fuller return in January 2022. According to a memo sent by managing partner Mark Bettencourt, the firm is making a slight change to its plans “[o]ut of an abundance of caution.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As first reported by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/12/14/goodwin-pushes-return-date-to-mid-march-amid-uncertainty-over-omicron-variant/), Bettencourt announced that until mid-March, “working from our U.S. offices will be entirely voluntary for our lawyers and GO! Team members.” Will other firms follow Goodwin’s lead?

What has your firm announced as far as a revised reopening plan is concerned now that the omicron variant has arrived? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a new market standard for a return.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

Irell & Manella is blowing the door off the Biglaw market bonus scale. And all associates are sharing in the firm’s good fortunes!

The firm[ already gave out fall bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/) (ranging between $7,500 and $40,000, depending on class year). But that’s a move [that a lot of other Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) have pulled this year. But in May they also gave out supplemental bonuses, those are part of a new bonus structure that the firm says in based, in part, on profit sharing and were made after the firm’s 2019 financials closed. Now they’ve announced their year end bonuses, and for every class year, they beat the market.

Seriously, year-end market bonuses range from $15,000 to $100,000 depending on class year. At Irell they’re $25,000 to $120,000.

So, um, Cravath who?

The firm’s bonus chart shows the jaw dropping bonuses associates can earn at the firm over the course of the year (you can read t[he full announcement on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/irell-2020-bonuses/2/)):



Earlier this year, Irell [found itself at a sort of crossroads](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/struggling-biglaw-firm-at-crossroads-again/) as the Biglaw firm announced its intention to eschew transactional work. But, if the size of these bonuses are any indication, the concerns about the new direction were overblown. And yes, the firm again intends to disburse supplemental spring bonuses after fiscal year 2020 has closed.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Offers Major Bonuses In Major Market Offices
## Associates seem happy with their bonus haul this year.

With Hannukah nearly midway through and Christmas just around the corner, Biglaw bonus season is still going strong. The largest of law firms continue to announce matches of the prevailing market rates, and this top 50 firm is no different. Bonuses at Perkins Coie are majority lockstep, and for most associates, it seems as if the firm is following where the market leads (depending on office).

The Seattle-based firm brought in $1,155,565,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 42nd place on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. Here’s what the bonus scale looks like at the firm’s major market offices:

- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015: $115,000
- Class of 2014+: $115,000
According to the firm’s internal announcement, some major market offices will have a bonus range for sixth-year associates and beyond, while offices located outside of major markets will have their own bonus schedules.

Congratulations on the extra bonus cash, everyone!

# Marc Kasowitz... Will You Accept This Rose?
## Trump choses Marc Kasowitz to defend him in the ongoing probe.

Yesterday Trump had narrowed down his pick for outside counsel to four. Then he decided to give the rose to… or fire the rest of… or whatever television catchphrase amounts to Kafkaesque presidential leadership these days, anyway he selected Marc Kasowitz to take the blame for upcoming revelations in the Russian collusion investigation represent him.

Meanwhile Guiffra, Olson, and Weingarten must be as relieved as group of Miss USA contestants told they can just go home — run while you can.

Kasowitz is also, of course, Joe Lieberman’s boss, a conflict of interest which would terrify the average observer aware that the firm lacks the size required to keep proper ethical walls around a conflict like this. But alas cooler heads have prevailed with reports that Lieberman will no longer pursue the FBI position, saving Orville Redenbacher from having to conjure up enough popcorn to prepare audiences for the acrobatics some senators would have come up with to justify that. Apparently having NY commercial litigator Kasowitz defend the President in a high stakes D.C. quasi-criminal investigation was more important than installing an unqualified political lackey in the FBI job. Mull on that.

At least KBTF partner David Friedman gets to miss out on the potential ethical firestorm that could result from Trump’s latest move. Because he’s already taken on the job of [ambassador to Israel](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/kasowitz-benson-loses-name-partner-lots-of-money/).

Is it possible that Trump just forgot other firms exist?

Just asking on behalf of Jones Day.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Don’t Waste Your Time Collecting Golden Tickets
## The downside to spending your life chasing credentials.

This is just the beginning, he captioned ironically …

I went to law school because I wanted to have a big impact on the world. For some reason I told myself that could only happen if I had the right credentials. Like working at a prestigious firm and doing a fancy clerkship. That’s why I set my sights on getting admitted to a top 10 school. Which oddly enough, [includes 14 of them](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/is-t14-dead-is-it-t15-t13-was-t14-an-arbitrary-ranking-all-along/).

Something strange happened along the way, though. I found myself trying to get credentials for their own sake. I guess you kind of have to, because everything’s so competitive. It’s like I had to put on these blinders so I could properly focus on collecting as many of these [Golden Tickets](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/golden%20ticket) as I could.

“If I can just focus on this for a little while and beat everyone else,” I told myself, “I’ll be all set.”

My laser-like focus helped me win a few Golden Tickets early on. I got into a good school and ended up with decent grades after 1L year. I also somehow ended up making law review, which was unexpected. I had originally wanted to spend my time doing mock trial, which sounded a lot more fun. But everyone in my class seemed to want to be on law review, so how could I turn that down?

And, I mean, it all worked as planned. My Golden Tickets made me a highly sought-after recruit. Firms fell all over themselves trying to hire me during on-campus interviews.

Honestly, it felt good. Really good.

It came at a price, though. Because when you spend all your time collecting Golden Tickets, you’ll find yourself doing a lot of things that aren’t aligned with your original goals. I knew that for all my “success” I didn’t actually *accomplish* anything. I didn’t help any clients. I didn’t win any cases.

I wasn’t having the impact I had always wanted.

The other thing they never tell you about these Golden Tickets, is that even after you feel like you’ve “made it,” the game doesn’t end. When I started my first week as a summer associate at my fancy Biglaw firm, I realized it was the beginning of yet another competition involving over a hundred other law students, who like me, were all from top schools. We knew this “game” would end with only one or two of us making partner.

I made myself feel better by telling myself that I had earned my place in this exclusive group of well-credentialed lawyers and law students. Wasn’t that an accomplishment in and of itself? I was a child of immigrants who never expected to be a fancy-pants corporate lawyer. This was a win, right?

That’s when I realized that I started to value the game itself. I didn’t want the ambiguity of the real world where I might not be certain about whether I was actually having an impact. My Golden Tickets gave me all the reassurance I needed.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This delusion lasted for a while. Eventually, I came to my senses and realized that this kind of job wasn’t right for me. At the end of the day, competing for all these stupid Golden Tickets was making me unhappy. It wasn’t at all what I wanted out of my career or my life. And it was starting to impact my health and well being.

That’s when I decided to leave. In 2014, I quit Biglaw for good.

A lot has happened since then. I ended up spending a couple years doing a few things that didn’t work out, but they played a role in helping me find my place in the legal technology space. Which is where I ended up having the impact I was looking for.

If I could talk to my 20-year-old self, I’m not sure what I’d say. How would I explain my current job? What would I say that I do? “Look, you’ll end up becoming a rainmaker in the legal industry. But not as a law firm partner. They’ll call you an ‘influencer’ and [you’ll be best known for posting Tik Toks](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2022/05/12/brand-building-101-how-in-house-counsel-can-authentically-be-seen/) and [dumb memes on social media](https://www.legalops.fm/home/the-pulse-alex-su-the-man-behind-the-meme).”

I truly believe I’ve found my place, though. Because even though I’m almost 40 and have an uncertain path ahead of me, I can see the impact I have on a day-to-day basis. Whether it’s [evangelizing technology](https://www.legaldive.com/news/avoiding-the-legal-tech-quagmire/623918/) to legal departments or highlighting all of the hard-working associates and legal professionals out there — I’m doing the kind of meaningful work I had been looking for all along.

So to those of you who are exhausted from running around collecting Golden Tickets that lead nowhere, I say, go ahead and be a little bit reckless. [Go off the beaten path](https://itsofftherecord.substack.com/p/how-to-go-off-the-beaten-path-a-summary). You don’t have to mimic [my unusual career path](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/a-funny-thing-happened-on-my-way-to-a-law-career/), but you should feel empowered to pursue something different. Don’t try to achieve conventional success by collecting all these credentials.

Because what they never tell you — especially in law school — is that “conventional success” is often anything but. They’re just proxies for success.

And they’ll never be a substitute for the real thing.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Ever since Biglaw special bonus season started, we’ve received a slew of emails from law firm support staff wondering what their fate may be as money continues to rain down upon associates. 2020 was an incredibly difficult year for everyone, and while 2021 may be a little easier, we’re still living in unprecedented times. It remains important to remember that Biglaw is not made of attorneys alone. After all, it takes an army for law firms this large to run, and the behind-the-scenes battalions of staff members deserve their due, too. That said, many firms have gone out of their way to show their support staff that they truly matter.

The latest firms to dip into their pockets to say thank you to staff are Sheppard Mullin and Paul Hastings. Exciting news for everyone!

Last week, Sheppard Mullin offered [special bonuses to associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/am-law-100-firm-latest-to-join-bonus-parade/), and earlier this week, staff members were notified that they, too, would be receiving bonuses. Here’s an excerpt from a memo sent by chief operating officer Ted Tinson:

As the Firm has been busy, indeed, you all have been working hard. Whether you are working from home, or are part of the crew that keeps our offices running smoothly, there has been much to do. To recognize the contributions our staff has been making, the Executive Committee has approved a Staff Special Bonus of one week’s salary, payable in June. This bonus will be paid to all salaried staff and paralegals. Recipients must be active and in good standing on June 24th and payday for the bonus will be June 25th.

Thanks for all you do, folks. Stay safe, get yourselves and family members vaccinated when you are able. Step by step, a new workplace experience will come (back) to our life patterns!

Back in March, Paul Hastings offered [special bonuses to associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/paul-hastings-special-bonus-2021/), and just yesterday, staff members found out that they would also be receiving bonuses. Here’s an excerpt from a memo sent by chairman Seth Zachary and managing partners Greg Nitzkowski and Ronan O’Sullivan:

As an expression of our gratitude, we are pleased to announce that a $1,500 (or equivalent in local currency) Appreciation Bonus will be paid later this month to eligible business professionals, including regular full and part-time support staff, paralegals, other timekeepers, London and Hong Kong trainee solicitors and China Advisors. This is in recognition of the work that is being done each and every day to make our Firm great and an acknowledgement of the hard work and dedication that is being asked of team members to build on and strengthen our position in the market. …

We thank you for your commitment to excellence and greatly appreciate your contributions to the success of the Firm.

# Goliath Law Firm Offers Raises To U.S. Associates... But How Much Depends On The Office (DLA Piper)

The world’s [third-largest law firm](https://bol.bna.com/the-worlds-largest-law-firm-will-have-7300-lawyers/) by headcount, DLA Piper, has finally announced raises for its U.S. associates. It’s a nice gesture from a firm that has so much money lying around they [hold their partner meetings on a cruise ship](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/05/law-firm-rents-entire-cruise-liner-for-partner-meeting-while-the-rest-of-you-look-for-work/). Actually, that makes you wonder why it took so long to open the coffers just a sliver.

But the wrinkle is that the firm is sending out memos on an office-by-office basis, so our intel is spotty at the moment. If you are a DLA associate or know any, remind them to send their memos in so we can feature them in this story.

For now, let’s check out the New York office raises:

Pretty standard stuff. Unfortunately, with a firm this size that leaves us a little in the dark about salaries at just a couple of the DLA Piper offices. Like, oh, for example:

Albany, Atlanta, Austin, TWO Baltimore locations, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, two Los Angeles locations, Miami, Minneapolis, New Jersey-South, New Jersey-North, Northern Virginia, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh, Sacramento, two San Diego offices, San Francisco, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Tampa, Washington D.C., and Wilmington.

UPDATE (6/14/16 6:50 p.m.): San Diego reports a full match of the Cravath scale. No memo as of yet.

UPDATE (6/14/16 6:51 p.m.): Silicon Valley reports a full match of the Cravath scale. Reporting the exact same graphic as posted above.

UPDATE (6/14/16 6:56 p.m.): Washington D.C. matches entirely.

UPDATE (6/14/16 7:15 p.m.): Chicago also matches entirely.

UPDATE (6/14/16 8:29 p.m.): Reports coming in that Northern Virginia has matched. Apparently those getting shorted are shy…

UPDATE (6/14/16 9:01 p.m.): San Francisco matches.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
UPDATE (6/15/16 5:01 p.m.): We’ve got our first sense of what’s happening in offices that aren’t on the full Cravath scale. Some offices — unclear which — appear to be offering a match up through Class of ’14. After that the figures are 2013-$200k, 2012-$210k, 2011-$230k; 2007-$285k. Depending on what market you’re in, that’s not a terrible haul.

UPDATE (6/16/16 12:27 p.m.): Apparently I missed an earlier tip that Houston has also matched. Sorry about that.

What will they do in all these offices? We don’t have much to go on, but if I were a betting man, I’d guess we’ll see a lot of these offices move to $180K for first years and then compress the scale for senior associates. Kind of a recruiting bait-and-switch that maintains [salary sanity in non-NY markets](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/no-your-office-doesnt-deserve-the-ny-to-180-raise/).

# In-House Legal Have No More Excuses When It Comes To Connecting With The Right Outside Counsel
## With a new free trial, in-house lawyers should jump on Priori Legal's new Feature Lab.

It used to be so simple for in-house lawyers. If anything came up, just call whichever Biglaw firm spawned your GC boss and no one would ever be mad. Unfortunately, that approach might cost the firm a lot more money than necessary for the task at hand and there was no objective way to know whether the firm could actually do the job right… but it was easy.

Companies no longer enjoy that luxury. The higher-ups keep squeezing the budget and the firms keep raising the rates. But how do in-house lawyers balance finding the right-sized (read: cost) firm for the job without jeopardizing the company’s position? They used to say, “No one gets fired for hiring Cravath.” In 2024, legal departments exist like Schrödinger’s Cat trapped in limbo between being fired for spending too much and fired for spending too little.

It’s Legalweek here in New York, and that means product launches. And one of the first announcements out of the gate seeks to assist in-house counsel navigate these troubled waters.

[Priori Legal](https://www.priorilegal.com/) isn’t new to the space. Priori’s marketplace of outside counsel has helped in-house teams match the right firms with the right work for a while now, having built up a client base including Fortune 50 companies and hosting thousands of outside counsel from firms large and small and across tons of practice areas. But Priori is now offering a, for lack of a better term, “Lite” version to in-house legal teams to get a taste of what they’re missing.

Beginning on February 15, users [can get six months of free access to Priori’s newest features](https://resources.priorilegal.com/early-access-priori-feature-lab). The new “Feature Lab” includes:

The newly launched features will empower legal teams to send requests for proposals (RFPs) to their own trusted law firm networks directly through the Priori platform and leverage structured reviews and scorecards to better track and maintain knowledge about their preferred firms’ performance over time.

Importantly, legal teams will also have the option to receive proposals from Priori’s global legal marketplace of vetted law firms, lawyers, legal operations professionals and ALSPs to compare side-by-side with quotes from their own trusted law firm network, helping them select the right talent and drive cost savings when hiring for new matters.

What this sounds like to me is a clean, streamlined package that should get law departments hooked. For any in-house team still clinging to the old ways and grabbing representation from the same handful of lawyers that have served the company for decades, the Feature Lab lets them use Priori’s tool to hire their old lawyers and, oh by the way, you can benchmark that against what the marketplace offers. There doesn’t seem to be a good argument against taking Priori up on this offer.

# Do Some Lawyers Suffer From Moral Injury?
## Numerous attorneys face representations which do not completely align with well-established moral principles.

One of my favorite podcasts (other than Above the Law’s “Thinking Like A Lawyer,” of course) is “The Daily,” which is a production of the New York Times. Each weekday, “The Daily” covers a story that is relevant to the recent news, and on Sundays, “The Daily” includes an oral reading of an article from the New York Times Magazine. This week’s Sunday episode was about how some healthcare professionals suffer from moral injury, which is a negative feeling associated with working in a system that might not be promoting the morals that people hold dear. The episode mostly discussed how the commercialization of healthcare has forced physicians to forgo human-based decisions in favor of efficiency and making the most money possible. Listening to this episode got me thinking: do many lawyers also experience moral injury throughout the course of our careers, and can this explain the high rate of burnout experienced by many attorneys?

Numerous lawyers are forced to represent interests that might not necessarily sync with their moral background. For instance, criminal defense attorneys often need to represent people who may have committed serious crimes, and our entire system of justice depends upon everyone, including people who might have done heinous acts, receiving the best legal representation. Even though individuals in such positions may recognize that they promote one public good in representing someone who may have committed bad acts, this does not mean that lawyers do not suffer on a deeper level from these types of representations.

Even if lawyers do not practice criminal defense law, numerous other attorneys face representations which do not completely align with well-established moral principles. Numerous lawyers represent large companies, insureds, and other parties in the civil system of justice which are accused of doing bad things. Even though it is important that every party is represented, and the civil system of justice might ultimately lead to wronged people being fairly compensated, representing a client in such situations can inflict some amount of moral injury.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
For instance, numerous times in my career, I have represented clients that were accused of pretty heinous claims, and in all likelihood, had at least some level of culpability in the acts complained of in the litigation. In certain instances, the faults of my clients possibly resulted in deaths or serious injuries to others. Throughout the course of the representations, I would routinely make legal arguments that would try to minimize the amount of exposure my clients had. In some instances, I would get cases dismissed on procedural grounds with the understanding that this would greatly reduce or completely eliminate a recovery for people who have suffered.

At other times in my career, I had very personal exposure to the problems that may have been caused by my clients. At an earlier role in my career, I worked in a given mass torts matter in which I took the depositions of numerous plaintiffs who claimed that my client and others had at least partially caused the illnesses from which the plaintiffs were suffering. Some of these depositions would go on for a long time, and I would really get to know the deponents, and sometimes, their families as well. In some instances, I would even take the depositions in the plaintiffs’ homes, or other times, in hospitals.

I am not going to say that these situations were particularly soul-crushing, and of course, some professionals and other lawyers need to deal with bigger issues throughout their careers. However, I definitely did not go home from work everyday feeling good, and this experience did make me think at times that I was an instrumentality for some bad outcomes like clients not paying restitution to people who were harmed by the client’s bad acts or negligence. This feeling definitely traveled with me throughout my days, since it was difficult to block out the unease I somewhat felt by certain work tasks when I was in my personal life.

Since starting my own practice, I have much more autonomy to choose which types of matters I handle, and I now generally work on matters that do not involve moral injury. However, people should definitely be more cognizant that even though lawyers serve a vital public function in ensuring that individuals and businesses receives representation, this does not mean that lawyers do not feel the impact of taking on certain types of cases. Many lawyers can feel the downsides of moral injury, which might explain some of the burnout that seems to be so ubiquitous in the legal profession.

Welcome Aggretsuko the Red Panda to your life, because the new mascot of the hard-drinking, rage-fueled Biglaw life is brought to you by the most unlikely source imaginable.

So imagine my surprise when I learned that the company introduced [a pitch-perfect junior associate](http://io9.gizmodo.com/sanrio-s-new-character-is-a-cute-red-panda-that-is-secr-1790842431) character, a single twentysomething rife with unending professional sadness, repressed rage, and a pronounced alcohol problem.

# Your Office Sucks And Is Costing You Business
## New survey breaks down what clients want to see in a lawyer's office.

Having only worked at firms, I never had much control over the decorative scheme of the office. And what I did have control over — my personal office — was never seen by the clients that we’d shunt into conference rooms with sweeping views of New York Harbor or the Empire State Building.

That said, firm decor matters. Cahill used to boast [notoriously awful offices](http://www.vault.com/blog/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/the-agony-and-ecstasy-of-the-law-firm-office) until a complete overhaul brought it out of the worst excesses of the 1970s. While I’ve generally worked in attractive offices, in one memorable meeting, a client capped on the conference room table as “IKEA-looking.” I’m pretty sure that table’s been replaced, but it’s moments like those that make you realize how much clients notice — and are ready to judge you by — your surroundings.

But lawyers don’t think about office decor nearly enough. The National Law Review just put up an infographic about how ugly offices are costing lawyers business. It’s interesting data.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


When broken down by gender, everyone agrees that clutter is the worst, but while women think poorly presented staff is the second worst sin, men cite a lack of natural light. So much for the lawyer “man cave.” Meanwhile, broken down by age, the older set thinks poorly presented staff is the second biggest problem while outdated decor is the least important concern. Respondents aged 25-34 had the exact opposite take. I’ve written before about how younger clients not only have fewer fashion hangups, but [actually may prefer a casual atmosphere](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/02/this-partner-wants-you-to-dress-up-so-you-can-be-a-tool-just-like-him/) so this isn’t surprising.

So clean up your office — or at least the area where clients will see you — and then take a long look at who you’re trying to entice. If you’re writing wills for senior citizens, be sure to dress up your staff and don’t worry about the shag carpet. If you’re working for tech entrepreneurs, make sure everyone’s wearing jeans and your office looks like the set of the Enterprise.

Just take the time to care about what image you’re conveying.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

With the merger, they want the brand and the footprint in the US.

— Freddie Lawson, head of partner search at UK recruiter Montresor Legal, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/shearman-keeps-lid-on-us-partner-exits-ahead-of-a-o-merger) on the upcoming [merger between Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/ao-shearman-merger-approved-poised-to-become-third-largest-firm-in-the-world/). While more than 30 partners have left Shearman since the A&O Shearman combination was announced, less than half of those departures occurred in the U.S., where the firm’s line-up remains “largely intact.”

# Associate Bonus Watch: Achin' For More Cash? This Firm Beat Market (For Some)!
## Would an extra performance bonus of up to $25,000 put a little more pep in your step this holiday season?

Winter is coming, but with the way some Biglaw firms have been showering their associates with extra greenery, you could easily mistake this season for spring. Would a performance bonus of up to $25,000 — on top of your regular bonus — put a little more pep in your step this holiday season? Of course it would!

That’s the news that associates at Akin Gump received this weekend from firm hiring partner [David Botter](https://www.akingump.com/en/lawyers-advisors/david-h-botter.html) when they opened their emails. The firm is matching Cravath when it comes to its standard bonus (which associates are generally eligible to receive after billing about 1950 client hours, including pro bono hours), but for “truly outstanding performers … whose performance is deemed extraordinary,” the firm is willing to shell out some extra cash, ranging from $5,000 to $25,000. Those who went the extra mile at Akin Gump in 2016 will receive Cravath-beating bonuses on February 15, 2017 — but they likely won’t find out what their bonus actually is until sometime just before that date, which is a tad annoying for those who intended to do additional financial planning for the year to come prior to 2017’s arrival. Either way, congratulations are in order.

That’s our take on associate bonuses from Akin Gump. If you’re a lawyer at the firm, what do you think? Feel free to let us know how you feel [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Staff%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Cheers to a happy bonus season, everyone!

Usually when I write a thing, I hate when it’s invalidated — I’m sure many a person whose journal note was mooted by a resolved case felt that. But this is a cause for celebration! Allen & Overy just announced that they’ve matched Cravath. Here’s the scale:


Said raise will come with all the fixings — retroactive to Jan 1st and will be reflected in March 31st paychecks. Enjoy!

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s done for morale and to hold onto that talent. If firms give someone an equity interest, I think it’s a sign of the firm’s belief in the partner and probably indicates optimism about their future path at the firm. Particularly in the environment in the last five years of partners moving up and down the Am Law 100, I think firms really need to implement more strategies to hold onto their talent.

There are extraordinary lawyers, your steady-eddy subject matter experts who still have the rates and a book of business—do you pass on that person because they can’t get into the equity partnership? The non-equity tier is a great tool for recruiting. The hybrid version of that offers a little more.

— Avis Caravello, a California-based partner recruiter, in comments given to the[ American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/11/16/firms-offer-income-partners-skin-in-the-game-with-partial-equity-status/) on “hybrid” partnership status that’s becoming more popular among Biglaw firms. “They feel that they have got a seat at the big table, even if it’s a smaller stake,” said Dan Binstock, a partner recruiter with Garrison, of hybrid partnerships.

# Should Incoming First-Year Biglaw Associates Be Deferred?

Yet more decisions between bad and worse are upon us. The class of 2020 is due to start arriving in less than six months. There’s not going to be enough work for them; they should be deferred.

There’s no abnormal reputational risk in announcing deferrals now. It would be well received by current associates who’ll recognize it avoids increasing the competition for what work is available.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It’s tempting for firms to delay announcing decisions about the arrival of the class of 2020 as we await greater clarity. However, we are already past the time in 2009 by which most firms had announced. There’s also an important benefit to incoming associates from moving soon: delay weakens their prospects of securing prestigious paid public interest work and entry into elite LL.M. programs.

— [Hugh A. Simons](https://twitter.com/simonshugh?lang=en), formerly a senior partner and executive committee member at The Boston Consulting Group and chief operating officer and policy committee member at Ropes & Gray, arguing that, given historical perspectives from the Great Recession, the associate class of 2020 [should be deferred](https://www.law.com/2020/04/16/what-to-do-about-the-first-year-class-of-2020/).

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Announces Black-Box Bonuses, And Some Associates Are Pissed
## The lack of transparency here is really angering associates.

As Biglaw bonus season begins to wind down and Milbank salary matches begin to catch on, we’ve got to wonder: Is there anything worse than below-market bonuses? The answer to that question may very well be black-box bonuses. As opposed to offering the traditional, lockstep bonuses that most firms do, some firms shroud their bonuses in secrecy, leaving associates wondering if there’s something else they could have done to earn more money and if their firms have actually met the prevailing market standard.

One of the firms that is reportedly using a black-box bonus system is Holland & Knight, a firm that’s fresh off this past summer’s merger with Thompson & Knight. Now, this is a firm that tends to match the market, but based off some reports that we’ve received from associates, that seems debatable. Specifically, as one associate said of the firm’s 2021 year-end bonuses, “Looks like more black box bullshit from a firm that pretends like it can hang with the rest of the Am Law 50.”

Earlier this week, the firm emailed associates that bonuses based on achieving their 1900 qualifying hours target (with bonuses climbing higher for every 100 hours over the 1900-hour goal) would be forthcoming, with H&K leaders noting that “[t]otal associate bonuses for 2021 are materially more than in prior years due to the hard work of our associates.” As a reminder, here’s what 2021 market bonuses and special bonuses looked like:

Now that associates have seen their bonuses, some of them are quite upset. The firm’s total bonus pool may well be “materially more” than it’s been in years past, but some associates who have reached out to Above the Law are downright mad (while others seem to have received market money). Here are just a few of the comments we’ve received from associates (emphasis added):

“Holland & Knight sent this email on 2/15, which does not outline the bonus set for everyone. Based on what associates have seen in their accounts, most associates who hit the billing requirement have received 50% of market bonus (4th years are seeing $40,000 and 3rd years are seeing $28,700).”

“Many associates are disgruntled, particularly with HK raising their hours requirement to 2,000 hrs for 2022. I hope they are ready for a lot of associates to lateral to other firms.”

“I’m a fourth year and my bonus was about market. I spoke to other associates, and it sounds like they all received their class equivalent (no Davis Polk special bonus). We all billed well over 2,000 hours.”

“No one is particularly happy about the lack of transparency, and I’m actively calling recruiters to get a feel for the market.”

So, if you billed your butt off during the ongoing pandemic and managed to max out your hours, congratulations. It seems like Holland & Knight may have handsomely rewarded those who did. If you came in at or just below the mark, you’re probably pretty upset — and reasonably so.

It felt like a quiet day on the bonus front, but no sooner did we acknowledge this out loud than Sheppard Mullin swooped in to keep the bonus news flowing.

The Am Law 54 and Global Law 66 firm informed associates this morning — it’s just now morning on the West Coast, of course — that the firm would be matching the Davis Polk special bonus scale with backloaded bonuses paid in June and November. Payments will be made based on meeting six-month billing requirements, though associates can catch up in November if they’re behind for the first payout.

# Biglaw Midlevel Associates Are Satisfied With Their Pay, But Money Isn't Everything During A Pandemic
## Burnout is real for midlevels and they think management's transparency is lacking.

Making it to midlevel in Biglaw isn’t easy — especially during a pandemic. First you had to break into Biglaw in the first place (which can be quite difficult, especially if you didn’t go to a top law school or earn top grades). Then you had to survive the high stress and long hours. Finally, you needed to have to endured and somehow persevered through these incredibly uncertain times (and we’re sure the special bonuses and pay raises had to have helped a little).

But if you did make it to your firm’s midlevel ranks, it was arguably more difficult than ever thanks to COVID-19. The American Lawyer just released its [midlevel associates survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/23/midlevel-associates-arent-satisfied-with-law-firms-return-to-office-plans/), and respondents are understandably more concerned about management transparency and work-life balance than they were last year. Midlevels may have been happy with how their firms have managed the coronavirus crisis in 2020, but things have taken a turn in 2021. Per Am Law’s Dylan Jackson:

As law firms prepare to bring lawyers back into the office in the coming months, many midlevel associates are uneasy about a perceived lack of communication from their firm’s management, especially as it relates to return plans that vary widely in terms of both in-office requirements and the detail firms have provided.

Associates in their third, fourth and fifth years gave firms lower marks than last year across every metric of The American Lawyer’s [2021 Midlevel Associates Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/23/the-2021-midlevel-associates-survey-the-national-rankings/). More than 3,700 associates from 77 Am Law 200 firms filled out the survey, giving their firms an average score of 4.26 (out of five)—down from the [average score of 4.32](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/24/as-they-navigate-the-pandemic-midlevel-associates-say-law-firm-transparency-is-paramount/) associates gave their firms on 2020′s survey.

Midlevel associates were asked how satisfied they are with their firm on a variety of different questions: compensation and benefits; training and guidance; relations with partners and other associates; interest in and satisfaction level with the work; the firm’s policy on billable hours; and management’s openness about firm strategies and partnership chances. In the face of the returning to the office in our “post-pandemic” world, leadership across Biglaw firms lost major points when it came to their openness and transparency. Scores in this area dropped from 4.3 in 2020 to 4.13 this year — the largest decline among all categories on the survey.

“The firm started out with exceedingly good transparency—providing monthly economic updates, insight into management’s thinking, immediately cutting salaries with the intention of not implementing layoffs (and subsequently restoring salaries and providing backpay),” one New York-based third-year associate at an Am Law 100 firm said in their survey response. “But since late 2020, these steps have evaporated. Monthly economic updates have been abandoned.”

As far as work-life balance is concerned, millennial midlevels have really been feeling the pressure. While they really appreciated the special bonuses that were doled out by their firms, 60% of associates surveyed said they would consider leaving their firm for a better work-life balance. Money isn’t everything, and burnout among attorneys is something that partners need to be worried about. While some were pleased with how their firms were mindful of their mental health, others stressed (quite literally) that “announcing more bonuses isn’t going to help retention as much as committing to emphasizing work/life balance.”

That having been said, let’s get down to the rankings. The full list is available [here](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/23/the-2021-midlevel-associates-survey-the-national-rankings/), but these are the firms that make the top 25 in terms of midlevel satisfaction:

Most folks haven’t heard about their bonuses yet — [which is weird](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-richest-firms-that-still-havent-announced-bonuses/) — but you can come hang out with us and take your mind off it. It’s that time of year again where we look back, take stock of the year in law, and order another round. With that in mind, we’re throwing a holiday party here in New York, and you’re invited!

If you’ve never come to an ATL shindig before, the rules are pretty simple: [sign up here](https://info.breakingmedia.com/holiday-party-2018) and then come on down to [Windfall](http://windfall.apps-1and1.com) on 39th between Fifth and Sixth and celebrate another year of legal news with us.

Everyone’s welcome: Biglaw, small law, law students, staff, judges… just a big legal industry party.

# The Am Law Second Hundred Is Out And Looks Just As Negative As We've Come To Expect
## Not a lot of good news down in the rankings.

This is the Am Law 100 walking away from the second hundred.

Let’s start with the positives. Revenue was generally up and profits per partner enjoyed a modest boost.

The bad news, of course, is that this still resulted in the firms [losing significant ground to the Biglaw elite](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/05/22/the-am-law-second-hundred-are-green-with-envy/):

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Start with jealousy, which may result from the impulse at Second Hundred firms to compare their financial results to their bigger brethren. The Am Law 100 continued to pull away last year. In fact, the nation’s 100 largest firms by revenue grew their lead over the Second Hundred by a wider margin than in all but two years in the past decade.

The Am Law 100 grew revenue by 8 percent last year. Subtracting the Second Hundred’s 3.1 percent growth rate creates a delta of 4.9 percent. Wider gaps existed only from 2016 to 2017 (when the delta was 5.6 percent) and from 2014 to 2015 (5.9 percent).

Kirkland & Ellis added more revenue last year than the whole second hundred combined! As one might suspect in a world where the mid-tier firms are falling farther behind, some have sought salvation in the form of mergers. Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, Andrews Kurth, and Gardere Wynne Sewell all departed the second hundred due to merger. And the quest for growth may be the only way up for second hundred firms:

The 25 largest firms by head count in the Second Hundred grew revenue by 4.5 percent and PEP by 3.5 percent. The next 25 largest saw revenue rise 2.8 percent and PEP jump 6.4 percent. Firms No. 151 to 175 boosted revenue by 3.5 percent and PEP by 3.8 percent. The smallest 25 firms increased revenue by 3.8 percent, while PEP was virtually flat, growing by 0.1 percent.

Still, Nicholas Bruch, director of ALM Intelligence, points out that “43 firms saw revenue shrink or grow slower than inflation (2.4 percent). PEP shrank or grew slower than inflation at 41 firms; 42 firms saw RPL grow slower than inflation.” That’s not a blueprint for success. At least the firms are also lagging behind in controlling costs!

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Firms 76 to 100 saw costs rise 0.6 percent. Firms 101 to 125 saw costs rise 1.5 percent. Costs rose 3.7 percent at firms ranked Nos. 126 to 150, and 3 percent for firms 151 to 175 and 176 to 200.

The hits just keep on coming. And remember, this is the outlook when the economy is good. When the dark days come — and they will — it’s hard to imagine these firms will have much in the tank.

# Which Firms Are Doing Right By Their Staff?
## Biglaw firms don't necessarily offer staff the same benefits as attorneys. Kudos to those that do.

Back in April, we pointed out that a number of Biglaw firms are offering [second-class benefits to staff members](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/biglaw-firms-offer-second-class-benefits-to-staff/), unbeknownst to most lawyers.

While the benefits gap can manifest itself in a number of ways, the disparity that seems to generate the most ire is in family leave. There’s a reason, grounded in scarcity and specialization, to pay attorneys more than the staff. But there’s not much reason why an attorney needs more time to bond with a newborn than someone in human resources would. Perhaps the firm knows that its associates are so socially dysfunctional they need an extra several weeks to seem human? That’s certainly a colorable argument.

Here’s one story that’s representative of a number of tips we’ve gotten:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the NY office of my big law firm, attorneys get 18 weeks paid (with the option to extend to 6 months off with unpaid leave). Staff must first use 2 weeks of accrued PTO, then get 6-8 weeks paid (with the option to extend to 12 weeks with unpaid leave under FLMA). It’s a huge difference. Basically attorneys get 2-3 times as much paid leave and the option to have twice as much total time off if they wish.

While there’s a laudable trend toward [gender-neutrality in family leave policies](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/biglaw-firm-makes-big-waves-with-gender-neutral-parental-leave-policy/), women remain the ones who do most of the work on the whole “giving birth” front, and that’s what makes the gap in this area intriguing. Law firm staff is, generally, more heavily female than the attorney ranks, and yet a benefit traditionally intended for women is routinely tilted in favor of attorneys.

Firms extending leave for attorneys are quick to explain the move in terms of diversity. For example, Orrick [cited the need to increase gender diversity](https://thinkprogress.org/why-this-law-firm-decided-to-offer-the-most-generous-paid-family-leave-benefit-eaba8081952e/) for its generous maternity leave policy:

“At Orrick, one way we’re seeking to attract women, and inspire them to stay and lead, is by expanding our parental leave policy,” he said. He noted that a 2007 report found that the biggest reason women give for leaving the track to a law firm partnership is the conflict between combining the long hours required with caring for children.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The fact that attorneys face challenges that staff members don’t justifies offering different solutions, but does a longer leave period really address the unique challenges attorneys face in taking care of kids? If the grueling work schedule of attorneys — the inability to go home most days at an assigned hour — presents the unique child-rearing challenge, more weeks off after birth doesn’t seem to address that specific problem. If attorneys had more personal time to run errands they miss out on by not generally being off the clock at 5 or 6, that would be a disparity tailored to the challenges of an attorney raising kids. The extended leave period, on the other hand, just seems like a blunt-object solution to the much more nuanced problem of improving diversity.

The same article cited above notes that Orrick actually provides a robust staff leave policy of 14 weeks paid. Even though that’s less than attorneys get, this puts Orrick in the good column in light of several tips we’ve gotten.

Some firms eschew the attorney-staff disparity entirely. Lowenstein Sandler offers a gender-neutral leave policy and [gives it to both attorneys and staff](https://bol.bna.com/law-firm-adopts-gender-neutral-family-leave-policy/). Years ago, we profiled Arnold & Porter adopting a policy that also [bridged the attorney-staff divide](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/01/biglaw-perk-watch-good-news-for-parents-from-davis-polk-and-arnold-porter/). Highlighting these firms is just as important as identifying those that fall short when it comes to taking care of their staff.

Most of Biglaw just wants to be part of the cool crowd. It’s why they fall all over themselves every year to offer the exact same bonuses. If more firms knew that the cool firms were treating their staff members better, maybe they’d all make the jump.

# Today Is The Last Day: Where Is The Money?
## If you aren't going to pay MoneyLaw salaries, maybe you should just admit you're a lifestyle firm.

The clock is ticking. As of tomorrow, the Biglaw compensation bump that has been sweeping the industry will be effective. (Yes, I know, a few firms have annoyingly pushed back the effective date of the raises until January 1, in an effort to get six more months of cheaper labor out of associates. But, the market standard is a July 1 effective date.)

At Above the Law, we have [documented 103 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-salary-increase/) so far that have increased associate salary in some way. That may seem like a lot, but let’s not forget the prestigious Am Law list goes up to 200. So for the rest of the firms out there, what are you waiting for? Associate base compensation hasn’t seen any movement in nine years, and momentum was growing for some kind of shift. If the massive movement of the market — with almost 4 weeks’ notice — isn’t enough to spur action, then what is?

If you aren’t going to pay MoneyLaw salaries, maybe you should just admit you’re a lifestyle firm. Some high-quality lawyers would probably love you for it. But there needs to be a reckoning of who and what your firm really is.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Sure, not every firm that has made a move on compensation issues has received universal praise. In fact, when you leave older, more experienced associates out in the cold to chase the $180,000 dragon you’re likely to get some backlash. But this all comes back to just being honest with yourself, and your employees, about the true nature of your practice.

And if you can’t get it together today, you can always make the raises retroactive.

We are covering this story as market conditions develop, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# Harvard Law School's Dershowitz Moves To Disqualify Boies Schiller In Sex Trafficking Case
## Here's an issue-spotter for you.

Soon after Alan Dershowitz went on TV and “challenge[d]” his accusers to “sue me for defamation,” Boies Schiller promptly [took Dershowitz up on his gracious invitation](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/dershowitz-wanted-a-trial-over-sex-trafficking-accusations-hes-getting-one/). Boies Schiller represents Virginia Guiffre, who alleges that she was directed by Epstein to have sex with Dershowitz while she was an underaged girl in Epstein’s orbit and BSF’s [Sigrid McCawley](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/sigrid-s-mccawley.html) (with the assistance of [Meredith Schultz](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/meredith-l-schultz.html)) filed a lengthy complaint detailing all the shots Dershowitz has taken at their client.

It seems that “television Dershowitz” may want a trial… but “reality Dershowitz” doesn’t seem to want any of the trials he’s being offered. On Friday, Dershowitz — through his attorneys [Aidala, Bertuna and Kamins](https://aidalalaw.com/) — moved [to disqualify BSF from the case](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/harvard-law-schools-dershowitz-moves-to-disqualify-boies-schiller-in-sex-trafficking-case/2/).

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
This isn’t even the first potential trial on these claims that Dershowitz has shut down. He settled his fight with former federal district judge Paul Cassell and Bradley Edwards over related allegations and claims that the settlement exonerated him. Judge Cassell and Edwards have publicly stated that Dershowitz’s claims are “at best misleading” and that it would be “a mistake for anyone to conclude… that the case against him was abandoned due to lack of factual support.” Still, this didn’t deter Dershowitz from including in his latest filing the claim that Cassell and Edwards admitted the allegation was a “mistake.”

The present motion revolves largely around two major plot points in the Dershowitz-Epstein saga. First, a claim that another BSF partner, [Carlos Sires](https://www.bsfllp.com/lawyers/carlos-m-sires.html), offered to represent Dershowitz in January 2015 before learning that the firm was representing Guiffre and terminating any relationship with Dershowitz. However, in the eight days before informing Dershowitz that he couldn’t represent him due to a conflict, Sires received material that Dershowitz claims created an incurable conflict.

Second, that statements made by BSF attorneys, including David Boies, during settlement negotiations that Dershowitz claims makes BSF Advocate-Witnesses. Dershowitz has claimed that Boies is trying to extort him — for some unknown reason — and that therefore Boies and the firm as a whole are fact witnesses. On the one hand, this seems to make sense as BSF’s handling of the prior case is intertwined with the instant defamation matter and the credibility of Guiffre’s BSF attorneys could be important to getting to the truth of the matter. On the other hand, BSF’s credibility is only really implicated because Dershowitz is claiming that the firm is trying to extort him, seemingly by mere virtue of its representation of Guiffre, and that he intends to depose a litany of BSF attorneys if the case goes forward. A party’s chosen defense probably shouldn’t be used as a sword to disqualify the plaintiff’s counsel of choice absent something truly extraordinary.

A lot to chew on here. Looking forward to reading the response to this one.

# Am Law 100 Firm's Furloughs Have Turned Into Layoffs
## Sorry, Biglaw, but the layoffs are coming.

The U.S. government may have claimed victory over the coronavirus, but the public health crisis is far from over. Biglaw firms that announced austerity measures are now rethinking them, and one firm has decide to pull the plug on legal professionals whose careers were on life support.

Two months ago, Katten Muchin — a firm that was recently ranked #63 on the Am Law 100 with a 5.5 percent increase in revenue to $669,709,000 and a 10 percent increase in profits per partner to more than $1.8 million — put all of its [employees’ salaries on the chopping block](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-furloughs-lawyers-and-staff/?rf=1) while furloughing others, including business administration professionals and staff attorneys. According to a Katten spokesperson, some of those furloughs will now become permanent, but none of the layoffs, slated to begin August 1, will affect attorneys at any level across the firm.

Why does the firm see the need for layoffs now? Because of the success of its remote work environment. Here’s a [statement from Katten](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/06/29/katten-makes-some-furloughed-business-administration-employees-permanent-cuts/):

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Given this [the success of remote working on workflow] and the realization that our administrative needs are fully supported through new approaches we’ve taken that better fit the remote work model, we have determined that it is in the best interest of the firm to permanently separate from some of our currently furloughed employees as of the end of July. We deeply appreciate the dedication and contributions of these members of the Katten community. This was not an easy decision, but it was necessary in light of the ongoing crisis and our current and anticipated staffing needs.

The firm will be offering those impacted by the layoffs one week of pay for each year they’ve been at the firm, with a minimum payout of eight weeks, and those payments will be structured to “maximize earning potential” on top of the unemployment insurance they’re already receiving. Those who are about to be laid off will also have health insurance coverage made available to them through the end of the year, at no additional cost. Last, but not least, the firm will offer their soon-to-be-former staff members employment search assistance at no cost.

As for other employees at the firm, there’s no end in sight for the salary cuts that were announced on April 29. If you recall, those cuts were up to 20 percent for both business professionals and attorneys who make over $100,000. Equity partners who suspended their monthly draws in April and May received a payout in June, but at a 25 percent reduction from previous levels.

Will this be the last round of austerity measures we’ll see from Katten? A firm spokesperson said commenting on that would be “premature.”

# Sullivan & Cromwell Beats Cravath (For Certain Classes)
## It's official: SullCrom is beating the market -- for some class years.

UPDATE (8:45 p.m.): Please note the multiple updates below.

Biglaw firms have made this Wednesday a very happy hump day for their associates, announcing matches to the [new Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) left and right. While associates are surely very happy with their new salaries, starting at a whopping $180K, some were holding out hope that at least one law firm would top the market. Some thought that it would be Sullivan & Cromwell that would do it.

As you may recall from [prior years](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-sullivan-cromwell/), S&C doesn’t issue a universal bonus memo listing different class years and their respective bonuses. Following that tradition, S&C hasn’t issued a universal pay raise memo either; instead, the firm has sent each associate an individual memo with a link to an intranet page listing that lawyer’s pay raise. We have heard from S&C associates in a wide range of class years, and so far they all report… a Cravath match. Sorry to disappoint you (though a huge raise is hardly disappointing).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
UPDATE (7:08 p.m.): Due to a clerical error at SullCrom, salary raise memos were initially sent out to attorneys in senior classes with the wrong information. As it turns out, eighth-year associates (i.e., Class of 2008 attorneys) at S&C will see their salaries raised to $325,000 — a full $10,000 more than what’s being offered under the Cravath scale. We’ve also heard that the class of 2009 is receiving a raise to $305K, a full $5K over what Cravath is offering to its associates. Were any other class years affected by this clerical error? We’ll keep you updated.

UPDATE (8:45 p.m.): This might make the news a bit less exciting, but even prior to the pay hike, S&C’s seventh- and eighth-year associates were earning above the [standard Simpson scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/) (also employed by Cravath and other top firms). S&C seventh- and eighth-years were making, respectively, $270K and $290K, compared to the market rates of $265K and $280K for their years.

UPDATE (6/13/2016, 1:45 p.m.): And ninth-year associates (class of 2007) will make $345,000, according to the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202759700996/More-Firms-Jump-on-Cravath-Pay-Scale-as-SC-Beats-Top-End?slreturn=20160513105329).

Associates at S&C seem extremely excited, and the memo that accompanied news of their new salaries, sent by chairman [Joseph C. Shenker](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/JosephC-Shenker), outlined some new firm initiatives, including a special loan refinance program associates can take part in should they choose to do so. Congratulations to all Sullivan & Cromwell associates!

For those who have been keeping track, we’ve heard from almost all of the firms that we’ve referred to as the [“Fab Five”](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/where-are-the-biglaw-bonuses-associate-bonus-watch-day-3/): Cravath, Simpson Thacher, and Sullivan & Cromwell. We’re still waiting to hear from Skadden Arps and Davis Polk. Could one of those two firms top the market? We’ll have to wait and see.

UPDATE (5:40 p.m.): Sources have reported that SullCrom has also extended raises to their summer associates.

(Flip to the next page for the full Sullivan & Cromwell pay raise memo, from chairman [Joseph Shenker](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/JosephC-Shenker).)

# The All-You-Can-Eat Frustration Buffet Special

While I am sure that my editors are relieved that I haven’t written about a certain infamous California lawyer (aka He Who Shall Not Be Named) for a while, I do have to add a P.S. to my column last week about Florida’s governor and his quixotic war against Disney (aka the Mouse House). I just learned — and I’ll stipulate that I am way behind the times on this one — that Ron DeSantis was married at Disney World in 2009. Everyone else knew apparently, but I didn’t. Shame on me. Too bad that the marriage license was issued by the state and not Disney’s special district. I could see Mickey’s gloved hands rubbing in glee.

I plead guilty as I am as cliché driven as anyone else, but is anyone else fed up with our cliché-driven world? Just some examples that trigger my bruxism (Google it). How many times can anyone “unpack” something other than groceries, suitcases full of clothing, briefcases, cartons of books, and so on? I hate that usage. Who started using that verb in that context?

But that’s [not the only one](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/opinion/avoid-cliches.html). To paraphrase comedian [Jimmy Durante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Durante), “we’ve got a million of them.” And so we do. My new favorite one, which is a lethal combination both of flattery and condescension: “That’s a great question.” Really? How patronizing.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We know that February bar results are usually lower than July results. The [California results were disappointing](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/News/News-Releases/state-bar-of-california-releases-results-of-february-2023-bar-exam), although in line with meh results from other states showing a decline. Kim Kardashian might want to rethink her decision [to sit for the February 2025 bar](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/kim-kardashian-bar-exam/), instead of waiting for the July bar that year.

While AI seeks to grasp an ever-strengthening toehold in our profession (think legal research, drafting discovery, writing briefs, and the like), it has not yet cornered the market on jury consultants, but that is only a matter of time. AI can [potentially vet a prospective panel](https://www.infotrack.com/blog/ai-jury-selection/#:~:text=The%20benefits%20of%20artificial%20intelligence,legal%20professionals%20using%20manual%20processes) faster than someone can say “voir dire.”

Will AI replace witnesses? Counsel? [The court](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/will-ai-soon-be-capable-of-arguing-matters-in-court/)? Lawyers are already confronting the [hulking AI behemoth](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/new-lexisnexis-generative-ai-writes-mean-cease-desist-letters-becoming-the-ai-we-never-knew-we-needed/) in different ways.

And how do you bill for AI time? If AI could do in a heartbeat what it takes hours for a mere mortal, this may be one more slow torturous death drip (notice how I didn’t use the cliché ridden “nail in the coffin”) for the billable hour. It may prompt the move from billable hours to task pricing.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One of the issues in the writers’ strike (and for those readers who practice east of the Sierra (singular, not plural, thank you) and west of the Hudson (also singular), the strike is most likely a big yawn until your favorite shows are in endless reruns (dinosaurs, remember those?) or off the air altogether, e.g., late night. Why should we care? One issue in the strike is … wait for it … AI and [how it may well reshape the industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/arts/television/writers-strike-artificial-intelligence.html?campaign_id=57&emc=edit_ne_20230510&instance_id=92251&nl=the-evening&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=132621&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c).

[More layoffs seem to be coming](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/am-law-top-50-firm-begins-reduction-in-force-will-cut-5-of-global-workforce/). How will the presence of AI affect layoffs? What do you think? It looks like the appetite for [Biglaw jobs may be on the decline](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/gen-z-lawyers-could-not-care-less-about-working-in-biglaw/). Work-life balance may not be just a cliché to Gen Z lawyers. Only 23% of Gen Z lawyers aspire to partnership in a law firm.

Just like every other lawyer, I love a good benchslap, as long as it’s not directed at me. Schadenfreude has its place. Shame on these lawyers who didn’t have the decency to grant an extension of time without onerous conditions to a lawyer whose wife unexpectedly went into labor and delivered their child during the pendency of several cases. He had to go to the trouble of filing a motion to ask the court to extend certain deadlines. The three defense lawyers apparently don’t know the first thing about courtesy and civility but do know [how to force opposing counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/federal-judge-disappointed-biglaw-attorneys-cant-display-basic-compassion/) to ask the court to extend the courtesy that counsel would not.

What galls me even more is that two of the three defense counsel are women. When I entered this profession almost 50 years ago (not a typo), I thought that the presence of more women lawyers would make the profession a little more humane, a little more empathetic, but I was wrong. I hate being wrong about something like this.

I don’t care what excuses defense counsel can offer. What is our profession coming to? Yes, women lawyers can be and should be just as tough as the male lawyers, but where’s the humanity? Tough-mindedness does not equate with being a (fill in the blank — several unflattering Yiddish words would fit.) How low have we sunk? I already know the answer.

What one court grants, another denies. The Ohio Supreme Court denied a trial continuance to a pregnant lawyer on bed rest. Of course, the male majority would think that way, but [one justice, a woman, dissented](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/pregnant-dont-plan-on-practicing-before-ohios-supreme-court-any-time-soon/). Where is the humanity? Is this a rhetorical question?

And for those (along with my editors) who think that this column is a “hot mess,” there should be [limits on that phrase’s usage](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/paul-weiss-solicitor-general-elizabeth-prelogar-hot-mess/). I didn’t see it on the list of clichés, at least not yet. Is that term code for “hysterical?” “Shrill?” And by the way, what is the male counterpart for “hysterical”? “Shrill”? “[Spermatorrhoeic](https://theconversation.com/spermatorrhoea-the-lesser-known-male-version-of-hysteria-9996)”? You tell me.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Biglaw Firm Sponsoring PGA Golfer
## Which law firm would have sponsored Happy Gilmore?

[Cozen O’Connor](http://cozen.com) announced that [it will be sponsoring](https://bol.bna.com/pga-golfer-gets-sponsored-by-big-law-firm/) PGA golfer [William McGirt](http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.31202.william-mcgirt.html) effective January 1. As reported by [Bloomberg BNA’s Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/pga-golfer-gets-sponsored-by-big-law-firm/), this isn’t the first time a golfer has sported a law firm logo — Thompson & Knight sponsored Harrison Frazar back in 2005 — but this deal nets Cozen some top-flight visibility with the 37-year-old McGirt, who won a PGA tournament last summer.

At all PGA tour events, with the exception of the Ryder Cup and The Presidents Cup, McGirt will wear the Cozen logo on his left chest.

In addition, Cozen is entitled to two corporate events per year, where Cozen lawyers and clients can tee off and get pointers from the golf pro, as well as a number of meet and greets throughout the year at PGA tournaments.

Enjoy your summer outing, Cozen-bound 2Ls!

Is this the future of Biglaw advertising? Might we soon attend a game at King & Spalding Field or rooting on NASCAR’s #36 Jones Day car? Well, it’s worth noting that the PGA attracts a genteel class of sponsors like [KPMG](https://floqast.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/kpmg-phil.jpg) or the [NYSE](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/dr/pga/sites/default/files/articles/stricker-steve-010712-640x360_0.jpg), institutions that routinely rub elbows with, and more importantly engage, Biglaw firms. Biglaw may rely less and less on the old boy networks of old when it comes to getting business, but they still have a natural home with the country club set.

Except the Jones Day car. That’s absolutely the redneck audience they’ve sold out their brand for, and they should get on the phone to coax Carl Edwards out of retirement immediately.

# 3 Questions For A Published Law Student Turned IP Practitioner (Part I)

One of my favorite things about writing this column is the ability it affords me to discuss interesting IP issues from a variety of angles. That effort is even more rewarding when I have a chance to follow up with people who have made a direct contribution to our thinking on one of those issues. Back in April, I [discussed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/design-patents-are-different/) an upcoming Alabama Law Review article, called “[The Secret World of Design Patents](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551668),” hailing its contribution to our understanding how design patent litigation actually works in America. In particular, I lauded the article for how it provides the IP community with “answers … to a number of basic questions about design patent enforcement.” Sorely needed information, especially when we consider the growing importance of design patents in the modern IP ecosystem.

Besides for the value of the article’s content, I was happy to see that the article was a product of law professor/law student collaboration. The article was co-authored by Northwestern Law’s [David Schwartz, ](http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/DavidLSchwartz/)together with our interview subject (a current Kirkland IP litigation associate), [Xaviere Giroud](https://www.kirkland.com/lawyers/g/giroud-xaviere). I am pleased that Xavi has graciously agreed to discuss her work on the article, while also sharing her personal path toward practicing IP law. While I have had the privilege of interviewing leading IP academics on these pages before, a written interview with a published law student turned IP practitioner had eluded me. Until now.

By way of background, Giroud is an intellectual property litigation associate in the Chicago office of Kirkland & Ellis LLP. She holds a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Arizona and a J.D. from Northwestern Pritzker School of Law. Prior to graduating from law school, Xavi was a Summer Associate at Knobbe Martens in the Orange County office and at Kirkland & Ellis LLP in the Chicago office. She was also a Public Interest Law Initiative Graduate Fellow at Equip for Equality in Chicago where she advocated for special education students. In the first installment of our two-part interview, Xavi shares how her undergraduate studies in engineering, coupled with exposure to certain aspects of patent practice, cemented her desire to practice IP law and how she built on those foundations to maximize her exposure to IP while in law school, culminating in her earning her current role as an IP litigation associate at one of the undisputed leading Biglaw firms in the space.

As usual, I have added some brief commentary to Xavi’s answer below but have otherwise presented her answer to my first question as she provided it.

GK: You have a science background and are currently working as a Kirkland IP litigation associate. Was there ever any doubt you would gravitate toward IP practice?

XG: No, I never had any doubts about that! I enjoyed studying biomedical engineering in undergrad, but I couldn’t see myself doing the hands-on designing and engineering long-term. A practice in intellectual property law gave me the perfect opportunity to continue to utilize my undergraduate degree, while taking a more bird’s-eye-view approach to technology. Though, I will admit, before taking an introductory intellectual property class in my first year of law school, I really had no idea what “intellectual property law” was. I was sold after my first year of law school during my summer associate experience. My first summer I focused on patent prosecution and had the chance to work on a number of projects in the medical device space. I loved sorting through patents, whether it was to analyze prior art or respond to a rejection from the Patent Office, because I learned so much about each piece of technology and how they were designed. From there, I tried to learn as much as I could about intellectual property law in law school — taking intellectual property law classes and joining the Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property — and I haven’t looked back since.

Xavi’s experience of not really knowing much about IP law before starting law school is very typical, and certainly mirrors my personal situation when beginning my legal studies. The tide may be changing though, as having basic IP literacy becomes more of a requirement for a successful career in many industries, a need driven by the increased value of IP in the modern global economy. With the growing number of IP-centric courses being offered at business schools, colleges, and even high schools, it is my hope that more students will have exposure to IP earlier in their educational careers, which could help attract even more talented young scientists with an interest in practicing law to eventual IP practice, as Xavi was able to do. In her case, it is great to see how exposure to IP practice as a summer associate helped inform her decision to pursue more IP classes and a spot on an IP journal in law school. Ultimately leading to her current position and what I hope will be a long and successful career in the field.

# Associate Bonuses You're Sure To Love
## More good bonus news for associates.

Ho! Ho! Ho! HoLove has come through with their associate bonuses!

That’s right, yesterday the Biglaw firm of Hogan Lovells announced their end-of-year bonus schedule. While it doesn’t represent much of a surprise — it’s a straight match of the bonus scale [set by Cravath last month](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/) — it’s still sure to bring smiles to the faces of associates.

For those who have somehow forgotten those magic numbers, here they are.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


HoLove associates will be eligible for these bonuses when they hit a minimum of 2,000 hours (this can include unlimited pro bono hours once a 1,850 billable hour threshold is met). The firm will also bump up bonuses for associates who made “outstanding contributions significantly in excess of expectations.” And those who fell below the hours requirement will have individual bonuses communicated directly to them.

(Read the full bonus memo on the next page.)

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Ranking The Best Biglaw Firms For Gender Equality
## Did your firm make the top 10 list?

From partnership promotions to attaining leadership roles, women in Biglaw continue to lag behind their male colleagues when it comes to equity in the ranks of their firms. A new survey aims to close that gender gap by examining the Biglaw workplace policies that could have caused it in the first place.

This week, the [Diversity Lab](https://www.diversitylab.com/), an incubator for diversity and inclusion in the law, and [ChIPs](http://chipsnetwork.org/), a nonprofit organization focused on advancing and connecting women in technology, law, and policy, released the first-ever Inclusion Blueprint, a survey that ranked Biglaw firms based on their policies for inclusion and advancement of women.

Here’s more from [Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/new-survey-rates-big-law-policies-to-build-gender-equality/) on the methodology:

Diversity Lab CEO Caren Ulrich Stacy, who designed the survey, which was mostly issued to Am Law 200 firms, said its purpose is to interrupt structures and unconscious biases that keep women out of leadership positions.

For example, the survey asked firms whether they track partners’ non-billable office work to make sure it’s equitably distributed across genders.

It also asked firms whether they’ve conducted a pay equity analysis in the past five years, and whether they’ve taken steps to fix any gender pay gaps they found.

The Inclusion Blueprint, while geared toward Biglaw firms as a whole, focused on their IP practice groups, which are known for being a wasteland for women in terms of gender balance. The survey was sent to 59 law firms but only 35 submitted responses, which is a bit disappointing. That said, here are the top 10 firms for gender equity based on their own policies. Did your firm make the top 10 list?

- Brooks Kushman
- Sheppard Mullin
- Baker Botts
- Dechert
- Goodwin Procter
- Morrison & Foerster
- Perkins Coie
- Reed Smith
- Taft Stettinius & Hollister
- White & Case
Congratulations to all of the firms that made the list. Gender equity in Biglaw is important, and these are the firms actually seem to care about it.

Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.

Paging former U.S. solicitors general: if you’re thinking of making a move into Biglaw, now is the time.

Just a few weeks after former SG Paul Clement [announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/kirkland-ellis-hires-paul-clement-viet-dinh-and-all-of-bancrofts-lawyers/) that he (and all of his colleagues at Bancroft) will be [moving to Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/a-closer-look-at-kirkland-elliss-pickup-of-the-bancroft-lawyers/), the most recent Senate-confirmed SG, Donald Verrilli, revealed that he’s [joining Munger Tolles & Olson](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/solicitor-general-don-verrilli-to-head-up-d-c-office-for-surprising-biglaw-firm/). Together with two lawyers he has worked closely with in the past — Michael DeSanctis, former managing partner of Jenner & Block’s D.C. office, and Chad Golder, former deputy associate attorney general — Verrilli will launch MTO’s new Washington outpost.

For the past 25 years, Munger Tolles & Olson has had just two offices (Los Angeles and San Francisco), so opening in D.C. represents something new for the firm. Yesterday I spoke with name partner [Ronald L. Olson](https://www.mto.com/lawyers/Ronald-L-Olson) about why the firm is making this move.

“For any number of years we’ve toyed with the idea of having a Washington office, and through the years we have been approached by a number of firms to make some kind of arrangement,” Olson said. “We always came to a pretty quick negative decision for a whole range of reasons.”

“What’s different about this is that we believe we have identified the right people to make this happen,” he explained. “Don, Michael, and Chad have the kind of values that we share, and they’ll integrate into our culture very well.”

In terms of how the move came together, Olson said that when Munger learned that Verrilli might be available, the firm reached out (directly; it did not use a recruiter). Through a series of discussions, it became clear to Olson and his partners that Verrilli has “the Munger Tolles & Olson DNA — absolutely dedicated to his clients, with a drive for excellence and a demonstrated commitment to public service.”

Former Jenner & Block partner Michael DeSanctis — who said he’s “super-excited” about working again with Verrilli and about moving to Munger, “a jersey I’m really proud to wear” — recalled when Olson and Verrilli first met.

“I had been talking with Don about his post-SG plans,” said DeSanctis, who was mentored by Verrilli in his pre-SG career at Jenner. “Coming back to Jenner was always the leading candidate. But as soon as Ron and Don met — I was there — magic happened. They took an instant liking to each other and realized how much they think the same way.”

Launching a D.C. office is a new venture for Munger, but it does not reflect any shift in the firm’s strategy of staying relatively small by Biglaw standards. “This is not Munger Tolles deciding we want to spread across the country,” Olson said. “This is all about getting the right people.”

Having just a few offices helps Munger preserve its tight-knit culture. Ron Olson noted how the firm hosts lunches three to four days a week, where lawyers from different departments come together to talk about an issue or an outside speaker makes a presentation. These lunches help Munger’s lawyers — at around 200 attorneys, the firm is intimate by Biglaw standards — get to know each other better. (The firm bridges the Los Angeles/San Francisco divide at these lunches using videoconferencing technology.)

When MTO opened its San Francisco office [in 1991](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fi-obama-lawyer-lafirm-20160928-snap-story.html), it was a “reluctant” entrant into the market, according to Olson. After identifying some talented lawyers in the Bay Area, it tried to convince them to move to L.A.; when that didn’t happen, Munger opened its S.F. office. It has grown that office to around 40 lawyers today, and it has fully integrated them with their colleagues in Los Angeles.

How large will the D.C. office get? Munger does not have any particular estimate or target for headcount in Washington.

“There is no five-year plan,” Olson said. “Our plan is to hire the best, expecting they will get the best results, and over time that will result in the best clients with the most complex problems. We’re not going to go out in Washington and say we need a full regulatory practice and pick up this lateral hire or that one. We’re going to hire outstanding talent, on a very deliberate basis, which will translate into real value for our clients, no matter where their problem is. This will make our value proposition even more compelling.”

Although Munger Tolles & Olson has historically attracted many former U.S. Supreme Court clerks — such as former MTO partners Michelle Friedland, John Owens, and Paul Watford, all now judges on the Ninth Circuit — it hasn’t had a huge Supreme Court practice. Will that change under Don Verrilli?

“I would expect it to, with someone of Don’s experience and stature,” Olson said. “We have had Supreme Court arguments before, but it hasn’t been a big practice for us. We look forward to growing the practice under Don and supporting him any way we can with talented lawyers from our other offices.”

“I’m very proud of the firm in general, and I’m very proud of this latest move with Don and Michael and Chad,” Olson concluded. “I’m anxious to start pulling them into helping our clients solve problems from around the country. When a client needs lawyers for its toughest problems, we want to be at the top of that client’s list.”

# Reminder: Don't Put Sexual Comments In Your Biglaw Holiday Cards!
## Some Dentons attorneys apparently needed this.

As we move into the holiday season, there are a few tips that every Biglaw attorney should keep in mind when it comes to holiday cards. First, get them done early! No one wants to be stuck hurriedly stuffing envelopes the week before. Second, remember to be inclusive. Regardless of your personal relationship to the holidays, realize that these are really professional calling cards so keep the tone as inclusive as possible. Is there anything else we’re missing?

Oh right… don’t make jokes about vibrators in your holiday cards. Apparently that was a reminder that Dentons needed to circulate several years ago.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As [covered by LegalCheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2021/12/ex-dentons-trainee-wins-misconduct-appeal-over-sexualised-christmas-card/), a former Dentons trainee in the UK received a published rebuke over a holiday card sent to another trainee with a vibrator reference — allegedly a callback to something the recipient had said a few weeks earlier — and the message, “Wishing a sexy Yorkshire babe a great Christmas.” The recipient reported the card and returned the two presents that came with it.

While it’s still not a good idea to spice sexual comments into your holiday greetings, the trainee in this instance successfully appealed the case, with the UK’s Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal [deciding late last month](https://www.solicitorstribunal.org.uk/sites/default/files-sdt/12223.2021.Fouracre.pdf) that inappropriate behavior does not necessarily trigger the attorney ethical rules.

But the adjudicator had failed to establish that it amounted to professional misconduct: “In her decision there was nothing to suggest that the Adjudicator had considered whether there was evidence which linked the Appellant’s giving of the Christmas card, to the provision of legal services, as required by Principle 6”.

So the professional rebuke is revoked.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But the moral of the story is still sound: be very, very cautious when making explicit jokes in a professional setting. Even if you think some prior joke opened the door, your perception can be way off. Better yet, instead of being “very, very cautious,” just don’t do it.

Solves everything.

# Global Law Firm Announces Cravath Bonus Match
## One more firm joins the ranks.

Maybe it’s more fair to say the firm “announced” a Cravath match, because this news is almost a month old at this point. It says a lot about how this current crop of associates see bonuses as a fait accompli that a timely match isn’t even seen as news.

A Dechert tipster just noticed the firm still lived on our “[naughty list](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/the-richest-firms-that-still-havent-announced-bonuses/)” of firms that haven’t announced bonuses and pointed out that the firm not only has matched, but did so mere days after Cravath set the scale:

Dechert LLP announced Cravath scale bonuses on 11/28 and sent individual attorney bonus confirmations on 12/14. As in the past, we receive bonuses on the first pay period of the new year.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Working in Biglaw is one of those rare endeavors where dull predictability is a virtue. A firm that acts quickly to assure its associates that they’ll be compensated in line with the market is something to be celebrated. Congrats to the Dechert folks.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# How Will We Act When The Courts Reopen?
## California is very slowly loosening some restrictions, with some counties letting go of all restrictions due to their rural nature (the state is not all SF and LA).

I don’t know what you’re doing with whatever free time you have while being at home. Some states have loosened restrictions, some have adopted some loosening. California is very slowly loosening some restrictions, with some counties letting go of all restrictions due to their rural nature (the state is not all SF and LA). What have I been doing? I’m watching a bunch of CLE programs, offered by law firms and CLE providers either at little or no cost. Free is always good, and even though I just reported my CLE hours in January, there’s nothing wrong with getting started on the next tranche of CLE requirements.

The courses I’ve watched have been varied, all with the consistent thread of the COVID-19 impact on the law, law practice, and society in general. However, what has been different is that in at least two of the courses, they have concluded with pleas for civility (say what?).

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I was surprised, as it was like actors breaking the fourth wall. The pleas are not something I’ve heard in CLE courses before. They are earnest pleas by two longtime practitioners (one a former judge) who understand well the “ants in the pants” reaction to either restart or start civil matters, but there will be the need to chill, most likely for an indefinite period of time.

When the courthouse doors are unlocked, and there will be different timeframes probably by state and even by county and perhaps by districts within counties, my nightmare, which I am sure is shared by others, is that the scene will be similar to the [running of the bulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sar6FiqUxts) in Pamplona, Spain. That annual event, originally scheduled for this July, has been canceled. No one wants to get trampled to death in the race to the courthouse steps.

A stampede by lawyers to file complaints (what about e-filing?), defense lawyers to file motions for summary judgment, and both sides to file contentious discovery dispute motions would not be pretty.

We need to simmer down. We know that civil cases will be at the bottom of the pile, at least for the foreseeable future. We know that criminal, juvenile, and certain other kinds of cases always take priority, as well they should. They always have and they always will. We know that judges will be even more stressed than they already are, giving already bulging dockets — and now more being piled on. Frayed judicial tempers may be more on display than ever before. No one has more than 24 hours in one day.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One retired judge mentioned that her former court is training civil judges to do criminal work. Whether they signed up for that or not is of no matter; that’s where attention will be paid for some time to come.

The whole concept of “in your face” between attorneys is, I hope, a thing of the past. Between face masks and required social distancing, perhaps the pettiness and downright unpleasant behavior exhibited by some attorneys will be extinct. Have you ever tried hollering into a face mask? The hot air expended would probably not be healthy. Have you ever yelled at someone six feet away? How can you be sure that the object of your wrath can even hear you at that distance?

Add to all this upheaval in the courts is what’s happening in Biglaw firms. Yes, I know most lawyers don’t practice in that environment, and sympathy for those in Biglaw may well be in short supply right now. However, especially for the newbies, who had expected upward trajectories in their careers, what has happened recently is definitely a shock to their systems and to the profession as a whole.

For those of us with still some memory, lots of kids (and I say “kids,” because I mean that literally) went to law school in the mid-oughts, and graduated into what had been, up to that point, the worst economy since the Great Depression. It was horrible for these newbie graduates, trying to find jobs, any jobs, even of the nonlawyer variety. Some of them have never had the careers, let alone the opportunities, that they thought they would.

And what happens to efforts, some better than others, to diversify the face of the profession? Some firms have been very earnest in their efforts, some more successful than others, but still a long way to go. What happens now? Rereading this post about the pandemic’s effect on law students is a sobering reminder that today’s law students have already been through tough times, seeing their family members [lose livelihoods and homes](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/law-students-in-the-age-of-coronavirus/) in the Great Recession. I used to think that the Great Recession should have been called a depression, but what is happening today puts 2008 in the dumper.

I think the profession will eventually come out of this, chastened by our experiences. It’s going to be all about “doing more with less.” It will be on a strict diet, shedding overhead, unnecessary expenses (bye-bye closing dinners) and other things that used to compose a “good life” at Biglaw. Those who are in solos and small firms are used to belt-tightening whenever the need has arisen.

To those who read ATL and are considering law school to ride out the pandemic wave, please [read Jordan Rothman’s post](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/please-dont-go-to-law-school-because-of-covid-19/) and take it to heart. Many lawyers went to law school during the Great Recession because they didn’t know what else to do and have lived to regret their career choices. The job market for lawyers, as bad as it was then, may well be worse in three or four years, given the quantum leaps in technology. It’s not a pretty picture but it may well be the new reality. What I do know is that pleas for civility, while nothing new, take on an even more urgent tone now.

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Discontent With Firm's Opaque Bonus Model
## What's inside the black box?

Historically, Haynes and Boone has come in all over the map when it comes to bonuses. It’s another firm with a black box bonus structure that leaves associates scrambling to figure out exactly why they’ve made what they’ve made in any given year. So far, the tips we’ve received are mostly negative — with associates complaining that the arcane formula the firm uses shortchanges folks at more senior levels. That said, if precedent is any guide, Above the Law will shortly receive a tip from an associate earning a full market bonus under the formula. How does a firm end up with such a spread? One tipster has a theory.

For the record, if it even needs repeating, black box bonuses are rarely good news for associates. In the best of cases it’s used to [obscure downward trend line in compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/kirkland-ellis-bonus/). In the worst of cases it’s used to atomize the work force and conceal arbitrary or discriminatory pay practices. It’s just a killer for firm morale to have everyone looking over their shoulder wondering if they’re getting paid what they deserve. And sometimes, this leads to associates trying to reverse engineer the formula to square bonuses with their friends.

One associate who admits to not having fully cracked the code claims to have worked out one insight:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
They seem to have taken on an “Eat-what-you-kill” standard for associates. So if you do work for a client with low negotiated rates you are going to be compensated less than someone doing the same work for another client that pays more for the same work.

There’s a certain appeal to the eat what you kill model. After all, you can end up on top of the world with a cut of a multimillion dollar payday. But you can also find yourself turning out your pockets because you’ve been working on low paying matters for a practice group that simply gets paid at lower rates.  Making these associates functionally second-class citizens isn’t only unfair, it can actually undermine a firm’s shared mission with associates avoiding partners offering lower rate work. Sure, sometimes the partners with lower rate work are poor fits for the firm, but just as often those partners are doing work servicing clients who bring in bigger paydays for other practice groups. That work needs to be handled without associates ducking it to preserve their bonuses.

In any event, Haynes & Boone folks should let us know (anonymously of course) what they’re getting so we can test out this theory. Good luck to everyone out there.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

My client said her firm had, more or less, a checklist of what they wanted in a lawyer they made partner.  And she had knocked herself out checking off every last damn item.

- Helped with firm marketing efforts (including hundreds of non-billable hours)?
- Worked with a variety of partners in various areas, including powerful group leaders and major rainmakers?
- Logged long hours — and billed those hours — including nights and weekends, producing top-quality written work that was universally praised?
- Cultivated positive relationships with existing clients, who produced enthusiastic feedback about her work?
- Worked on important matters in a variety of roles, including stuff like taking part in trials and depositions and handling matters relating to complicated, highly regulated industries?
- Brought in her own clients and began developing a meaningful book of business?
- Tackled meaningful pro bono work?
- Participated in events with summer associates and recruitment efforts?
- Supervised and mentored juniors and ran large teams on big cases?
- Anything else you can think of?

Other folks in her class, even junior partners at her firm, considered her promotion, at least to of counsel, to be a given.  As one put it, “If not you, then who?  You’re the dream associate, a superstar.”

The logic was simple:  They have to promote someone, and if it’s anything even vaguely resembling the meritocracy they claim it is, she had to be that someone.

But no, as you might be guessing, that’s not how things worked out.  They promoted no one.

After a year, or two, or (really) many years of “making the partnership sprint,” the firm told her she wasn’t up for anything — not partner, not of counsel, not senior attorney, nothing.  At her review, she was informed she could remain at the firm, as an associate, for as long as she wanted.  That’s what they were offering, in gratitude for years of devoted labor — more of the same.

Blockchain technology has come a long way since the early days of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. From the rise of NFTs and their impact on [copyright issues](https://www.pli.edu/programs/technotainment?t=ondemand&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2#SEGV338642) to employees’ growing interest in receiving [compensation in cryptocurrency](https://www.pli.edu/programs/employee-compensation-and-benefits-involving-cryptocurrency-trends-and-legal-issues?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), the legal implications of blockchain today are far-reaching.

It’s fair to say that all attorneys will likely encounter blockchain in their work, if they haven’t already, and can benefit from understanding the legal landscape around this popular technology. At a half-day PLI program, [Blockchain 2.0: 2022 Legal & Regulatory Developments](https://www.pli.edu/programs/blockchain-2.0?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2), an expert panel will provide an in-depth discussion of some of the hottest issues in this area.

The program will tackle the evolving landscape of regulation for tokens, DeFi, and NFTs and review enforcement actions related to blockchain technology, exchanges, advisors, broker-dealers, and investments. The panel will also explore taxation issues regarding blockchain, as well as the implications of blockchain technology in other markets, and how it impacts other legal issues, including privacy, jurisdiction and antitrust.

Other specific topics to be covered include:

- How the landscape of regulation of tokens, DeFi, and NFTs is evolving
- An overview of current legislation and state enforcement actions relating to digital assets and blockchain technology
- An explanation of the legal issues that arise when blockchain-based solutions are deployed in the market and best practices for addressing these
- Blockchain’s impacts on intellectual property law
- The tax implications of cryptocurrency
This program will build upon the fundamentals of blockchain technology for any attorney or professional looking to dive deeper into developing issues in this cutting-edge area of the law. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/blockchain-2.0?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

# Biglaw Firm Hands Out Stress Balls In Lieu Of Special Bonuses
## Associates seem to have been made even more stressed by this gesture.

Associates are really enjoying their ‘bonuses.’

On March 19, [Willkie Farr](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) announced that it would be handing out another round of special bonuses to associates. Shortly thereafter, [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) upped the ante on the bonuses being offered, and since then, dozens upon dozens of firms have hopped on the [bonus bandwagon](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/), inundating associates with cash.

Husch Blackwell — a firm that made $417,056,000 gross revenue in 2020 and came in 95th in the latest Am Law 100 ranking — hasn’t handed out bonuses just yet, but perhaps associates thought that they were finally being rewarded when this arrived at their homes earlier this week.

Ooooh, a big box. What’s in the box? Is it full of bonus cash? Come on, other firms started making bonus announcements a month ago — it has to be related to bonuses. What could it be? Let’s check it out…



It’s a care package with coffee, chocolate, lip balm, a stress ball, and Husch-branded sunglasses. Are associates’ futures are so bright at this firm that they gotta wear shades? Doesn’t sound like it, based on what we’ve heard.

No bonuses, just these $10 care packages!

-
The only thing smiling around Husch Blackwell’s offices these days is the stress balls they sent associates instead of the whopping bonuses given by other firms.

-
HB decides to provide stress balls for associates to use while waiting on their lateral application responses.

Eeek! They don’t sound too thrilled. Hopefully Husch Blackwell comes through with a care package their associates actually care about soon… one that’s filled with special bonus bucks. Good luck with that. At least associates now have stress balls to keep them occupied while they keep waiting.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Federal Judge Bashes The DOJ And Calls Out Biglaw As Too Expensive In The Same Case

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon of the District of Columbia does not seem pleased. And, I mean, it’s understandable.

You see, Arnold & Porter brought a case against the United States, pro bono, challenging a Department of Homeland Security policy barring New Yorkers from participating in the Global Entry program. In response to the suit, the Department of Justice said in court that no state that wouldn’t share motor vehicle records with the federal government, like New York, could participate. However, that wasn’t true. The DOJ later admitted the truth, and did away with the policy banning New Yorkers.

But now the time has come for Arnold & Porter to get paid for their pro bono work as part of the settlement ending the case. According to the terms of the agreement, A&P would get $206,500 based on its corporate billing rates (two partners and six associates reportedly worked on the matter)… provided the settlement gets judicial approval.

As I said at the top, Judge Leon is not a happy camper. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2020/11/17/simply-capitalized-judge-berates-arnold-porters-legal-fees-in-pro-bono-trump-case/) Law.com, he calls out the DOJ’s “embarrassing conduct” and says the desire to sweep the entire matter under the rug is what motivated them to agree to A&P’s fees:

“It is not every day the Department of Justice and their clients have to confess to written and oral misrepresentations on the record in a high profile case! It would appear that Arnold & Porter simply capitalized—unfortunately at the taxpayer expense—on the government’s apparent desire to dispose of the case as quickly as possible,” [Leon wrote](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2020cv0445-35) in his order denying the fees.

“I certainly hope, and expect, that the department’s leadership will take the necessary steps in the future, especially in cases that involve embarrassing conduct of the type here, to ensure that the fees agreed to by the department, and ultimately paid by the taxpayer, are indeed fair and reasonable.”

Despite the government’s poor behavior, Judge Leon went on to say that A&P’s corporate rates were not appropriate in this case:

“The court finds that charging defendants for time billed at Arnold & Porter’s standard, corporate rates is not reasonable under the circumstances here,” Leon wrote. “Arnold & Porter is, according to its own website, a ‘world-class’ firm, handling complex regulatory, litigation, and transactional solutions for its corporate clients’ most complex challenges. In a case of this kind, where the agreed-upon fees will ultimately be paid by the taxpayer, applying Arnold & Porter’s standard corporate rates make little sense.”

Judge Leon noted that using the Laffey Matrix, a model fee schedule used to determine reasonable hourly rates, assuming two partners and the two highest billing associates on the case, the reasonable fees would be $82,562. That’s… a significant reduction from to $206,500 the settlement called for.

# COVID-19 Can Change The Legal Industry For The Better
## COVID-19 can have a lasting and positive impact on the way many law firms and courts operate.

Everyone within the legal industry has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, many law firm offices have been shut down due to public health concerns, and numerous courthouses are also closed for business. This situation is dramatically affecting the way that many lawyers provide legal services and how courts administer justice. Although it is easy to think primarily of all the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the legal profession, it is possible that the legal industry may improve because it had to change for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Greater Flexibility With Working From Home

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
As mentioned in a few prior articles, [allowing employees to work from home is advisable in a number of circumstances](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/partners-shouldnt-expect-associates-to-be-in-the-office-at-9-each-morning/). Giving workers the flexibility to work from home can make it easier for employees to deal with childcare issues, car problems, healthcare appointments, or any number of matters all of us need to contend with in our daily lives. In addition, working from home can save time on commuting and might be much more enjoyable to people than trekking to an office where they have to see their bosses every workday. In addition, working from home can help law firms reduce real estate costs, often one of the biggest and most rigid expense law firms face.

Despite these benefits, before COVID-19, many old-school attorneys were unwilling to promote working from home. Indeed, [prior to starting my own shop](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com), I worked at a firm that spent a considerable amount of resources to build what they deemed to be the “office of the future.” On my way out the door, I told firm management that the office of the future was not to have an office, and the firm should look to expand work-from-home programs and cut real estate costs. However, I was told that in-person collaboration was best, and the firm needed to have a strong physical presence to operate.

Nevertheless, a variety of law firms are now required by regulations to have their employees work from home, and many firms have not missed a beat. Attorneys and staff have been collaborating over the phone, WhatsApp, Gchat, and through other methods, and many meetings are being held through videoconferencing apps. It is altogether possible that even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, law firm managers may be convinced that people can collaborate and complete tasks remotely, such that work-from-home programs will be expanded. In this way, employees might finally realize greater flexibility while law firms see significant savings on real estate costs.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

As mentioned in a prior article, [many smaller law firms make a significant amount of money on court appearances](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/how-small-firms-are-dealing-with-covid-19/). Indeed, attorneys usually bill not only for the time they spend in court, but the time they spend traveling to and from court. However, some court appearances are not worth the travel time it takes to make it to court. For instance, [prior to starting my own firm](http://www.rothmanlawyer.com), I worked at a shop that regularly made my colleagues and myself travel hundreds of miles to attend some court conferences. Oftentimes, we would have to fly to these conferences and spend almost an entire day just to write notes on what happened during a five-minute court appearance. Some days, because of travel delays and infrequent flights, I would bill 14 hours or more and spend nearly a thousand dollars of the client’s money on travel costs for a pretty unnecessary court appearance. I always wondered why such appearances couldn’t be done through the telephone or other remote means to save time and out-of-pocket expenses.

Now because of COVID-19, many judges are holding conferences through telephone, Skype, and other methods. The results have been mixed, but as people get more experienced with operating this way, the conferences have been running much smoother. Of course, sometimes there is no substitute to getting parties together so that they can talk about a case and work out issues. However, for some minor court appearances when substantial traveling is not worth the benefits, courts will hopefully learn from their experiences holding conferences remotely and be more open to teleconferences under normal circumstances.

Courtesy In The Profession

It is also worth mentioning that COVID-19 is requiring attorneys to cooperate with one another and be courteous in ways that I have never before seen while practicing law. Pretty much all of the attorneys I am working with have been sending courtesy copies through email because they know that few people are in offices to receive mail. In addition, attorneys are freely sharing information about adjournments, updated procedures, and other news related to the current situation. Furthermore, attorneys are coming to agreements and making deals in ways never before seen, since it is difficult to obtain any kind of judicial relief right now. It can only be hoped that such a cooperative and courteous sentiment in the legal profession continues after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.

In the end, COVID-19 has negatively impacted the legal profession. Indeed, the pandemic has interrupted the operations of many firms and has already led to numerous layoffs and pay cuts within the legal industry. However, it is also worth mentioning that COVID-19 can have a lasting and positive impact on the way many law firms and courts operate.

# The Recruiting Game Done Changed
## All of the timelines and guideposts that served as the foundation of entry-level recruiting have been eliminated.

So a bit of insight as to how this column, but a small corner of the internet content mines, comes together on a weekly basis.  Ideally, I have a couple of topics percolating, often based on issues that arose in the course of my work at Vanderbilt or based on where we are in either the recruiting or academic calendar.  Some weeks it can be a struggle to come up with an issue that I think is both interesting and from which I can squeeze anywhere between 750 to 1,500 words.  And then there are weeks where the perfect column idea appears out of nowhere in your email inbox.  As you might have already surmised, the latter is how this week’s column came about.  While I had originally planned to file the first of a two-part series on how to deal with 1L Fall grades in the job search — rest assured that those columns are forthcoming, beginning likely as early as next week — an email I received Wednesday afternoon entitled “NALP Updates Recruiting Guidance” shook up my writing schedule.

I have written extensively in this space on [numerous](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/december-1-the-date-all-1ls-who-want-to-work-in-biglaw-should-be-prepared-for/) [aspects](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/legal-recruiting-and-you-how-the-sausage-is-made/) of National Association for Law Placement, with particular attention being paid to the “Principles and Standards for Law Placement and Recruitment Activities.”  These are the guidelines, albeit voluntary, that have governed entry-level legal recruiting for decades.  Indeed, I devoted an [entire column](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/december-1-the-date-all-1ls-who-want-to-work-in-biglaw-should-be-prepared-for/) to December 1st and its importance (at times overstated) in the 1L recruiting cycle.  But the next time you see one of those pieces on the NALP guidelines pop up on your computer screen or device, I need to you follow in the footsteps of Ron Swanson.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Despite the innocuous title of the email, the announced changes to the Principles and Standards are sweeping.  These changes start literally at the beginning of the document with the title.  The word “standards” has been dropped and the new document is entitled “[Principles for a Fair and Ethical Recruitment Process](https://www.nalp.org/fair_ethical_recruitment).”  In the memorandum that accompanied the new Principles, the NALP Board of Directors indicated that the changes were being made in recognition that the member organizations (i.e., law schools and law firms) “have grown past ‘one size fits all’ Standards.”  Instead of uniformity, the new principles embrace a “standard of reasonableness that provides all members the flexibility necessary to innovate and thrive in an evolving marketplace.”  So what does that mean in practice?  Good question.  Having read all 2,271 words of the new Principles, I am reminded, of all things, of my 2L First Amendment class.  One day, the professor, renowned First Amendment scholar [Geoff Stone](https://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/stone-g), cold called me with a question regarding [“Wanted” posters created by anti-choice activists that targeted doctors](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131094218).  I gave a lengthy, and I thought highly cogent, response, to which Professor Stone looked at me and said: “That all sounds very nice, Mr. Alexiou, I’m just not sure you are actually saying anything.”[[1]](#_ftn1)  Similarly, the NALP Board has created a lengthy, well-written document that does not seem to actually say anything.

So if the new Principles do not say much, why did I call the changes “sweeping” up above?  The answer lies not so much as to what is in the new Principles, but rather, what has been taken out.  All of the timelines and guideposts that served as the foundation of entry-level recruiting have been eliminated.  No one-on-one meetings between Career Services and 1Ls until October 15th?  Gone.  The prohibition on formal applications, interviews, or offers between 1Ls and legal employers until December 1st?  Bye-bye.  The 28 days that 2Ls should have to make a decision on a summer associate offer?  Hasta luego.  The limit of five open offers that a 2L could hold at any one point during the Fall recruiting cycle?  Sayōnara.  There are other aspects that have been eliminated, but I have run out of synonyms or foreign language translations for the word goodbye.

So what does the legal recruiting system look like now?  The first thing that came to mind was the Wild West — please spare me the stories about how the Wild West was not that wild and actually had [stringent gun laws](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-winkler/did-the-wild-west-have-mo_b_956035.html), no one wants to see a [Deadwood movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4943998/) where everything is peaceful.  While the new Principles encourage law schools and firms to develop their own guidelines, at least initially, the landscape seems more like every student, school, and employer for themselves.  As I have [consistently](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/09/advice-for-ll-m-students-who-want-to-enjoy-the-u-s-and-work-here-after-graduation/) [said](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-recruiting-season-part-iv-offers/), there has never been a “NALP police” to stringently enforce the guidelines, but in my experience, all parties involved in legal recruiting tried to at least adhere to the principles as often as they could.  When a firm acted in a way that was improper, our office could site the NALP guidelines back at them in an attempt to correct their behavior.  Similarly, I stressed to students that they should familiarize themselves with the guidelines, as they would be invaluable in pushing back against an employer that was being over aggressive.  Now?  While Vanderbilt will set its own recruiting guidelines, I will be stunned if I do not have 1Ls reaching out to me soon after arriving on campus wanting to have one-on-one meetings ASAP, nor will I be shocked in the least if certain Biglaw employers start reaching out to 1Ls at elite schools in August or September, trying to scoop them up before anyone else gets the chance.  When I was applying for clerkships as a 3L, there was an infamous (and likely apocryphal) story about someone flying to an interview and having three voicemails on their phone upon landing.  The first was from a judge offering a clerkship, the second from the same judge telling the student they had one hour to accept, and the final message informing the student that the offer had been rescinded.  While I hope such “exploding” offers do not become a regular occurence in the Biglaw landscape, it is no longer prohibited.

So where does that leave us?  Today, I felt like [Cutty](https://thewire.fandom.com/wiki/Dennis_%22Cutty%22_Wise) in The Wire.  After a 13-year stint in prison, he returned to a Baltimore drug trade that had fundamentally changed and become more violent.  With the adoption of the new NALP principles, the legal recruiting game has also fundamentally changed.  Let’s hope it also did not get more fierce.

## Discover 2024's legal sector evolution with AI, ESG litigation, and new billing models, as analyzed by top industry experts.

The year 2024 marks a pivotal era for the legal industry, characterized by rapid technological advancements and significant shifts in legal practices. These developments are reshaping the landscape, and introducing new challenges and opportunities for legal professionals and firms.

“As we step into 2024, we’re witnessing a seismic shift in the legal sector, propelled by cutting-edge technologies and a redefinition of legal practice. This evolution is not just a trend but a fundamental transformation, dictating new paradigms in how legal services are delivered and managed,” remarks [Lateral Link Director, Ashleigh Goldberg](https://laterallink.com/team/ashleigh-goldberg/). 

The Influence of AI and GenAI in Legal Operations

[Michael Heise, haistack.ai CTO](https://laterallink.com/team/michael-heise/): “In 2024, the greatest AI influence in the legal industry will continue to be Large Language Models (LLMs). In 2023, tools like ChatGPT showed their power in answering prompts quickly and in different voices and styles. Law firms will look to harness this power with LLMs secured for and designed specifically for their firm. Challenges still lie ahead, like ensuring documents that make up the LLM do not violate ethical wall barriers, but the technology is too transformative to be ignored.”

Analysis: Everlaw predicts significant applications of GenAI in legal practice, with AI technologies automating up to 50% of legal tasks in corporate transactions.

ESG and Climate Litigation

[Zain Atassi, Principal, Lateral Link Chicago](https://laterallink.com/team/zain-atassi/): “2024 will see a rise in ESG litigation, reflecting the growing importance of environmental and social governance in corporate strategies.”

Trend Overview: The PHA Group reports an anticipated surge in ESG-related litigation, driven by increased corporate responsibility and public awareness.

Evolving Billing Models and Litigation Funding

[Lauren Smith, Principal, Lateral Link Partner Practice Group](https://laterallink.com/team/lauren-smith/): “The trend towards alternative fee arrangements is likely to redefine how legal services are delivered as client demands focus more and more on value.” 

Market Insight: The Law Society Gazette highlights a shift towards alternative fee arrangements,  such as flat or fixed fees, with flat fees becoming increasingly popular. Nearly half of all external legal spend in 2023 utilized such models.  While alternative fee arrangements tend to emphasize value over volume, they are most applicable in situations when the work product is predictable.  Alternative billing arrangements do not suit all work, e.g., litigation that could go in a variety of unpredictable directions.  

Cybersecurity Law

[Romina Filippou, Senior Director, Lateral Link Northeast](https://laterallink.com/team/romina-filippou/): “The rapid evolution of digital threats is making cybersecurity law a critical and growing practice area.”

Industry Perspective: The rise in digital threats and the evolving landscape of internet privacy and data protection laws underscore the growing importance of cybersecurity law.

Energy & Natural Resources Law

[Susan Agopian, Principal, Lateral Link California](https://laterallink.com/team/susan-agopian/): “As the world shifts towards renewable energy, the legal aspects of these resources are becoming more pertinent.”

Sector Analysis: The legal complexities surrounding renewable energy sources, including regulation and innovation, are driving demand for specialized legal expertise.

The legal industry in 2024 is poised for exciting developments, driven by technological innovations and changing market dynamics. [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/), with its team of seasoned recruiters and industry experts, is committed to guiding law firms and legal professionals through these changes, ensuring they remain at the forefront of the industry.

# Elite Law Schools Demand That Biglaw Firms Disclose Whether Students Will Be Forced To Sign Arbitration Agreements
## Will certain firms be banned from recruiting law students across the entirety of the T14?

Time’s up, Biglaw.

When news broke that a Biglaw firm was trying to get its incoming summer associates to [sign mandatory arbitration agreements](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/?rf=1) — agreements that would have required them to arbitrate all employment-related claims, including sexual harassment claims — many were outraged. Amid heavy criticism, the firm quickly backtracked, withdrawing its arbitration agreement not just for summer associates, but for all employees. But how many other firms intended to force students to arbitrate their sexual harassment claims? Several major firms have already [dropped such clauses](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/this-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-step-forward-and-do-away-with-mandatory-arbitration-for-all-employees/) from their employment contracts for summer associates, but countless firms have allowed similar arbitration agreements to lurk in the darkness.

Thanks to student advocacy and an alliance between the nation’s top law schools, those arbitration agreements are about to see the light of day in the #MeToo era.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Today, Yale Law School sent a survey letter on behalf of all T14 law schools to every law firm recruiting on their campuses, asking that the firms disclose whether they require summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements and nondisclosure agreements related to workplace misconduct, including but not limited to sexual harassment. Firms will also be asked to provide information regarding their policies for responding to workplace misconduct. On June 8, 2018, the results of this inquiry will be made available to students at all participating law schools so they can decide where they’d like to interview and where they’d like to start their careers.

We asked Molly Coleman, a rising second-year student at Harvard Law who’s part of the unified T14 campaign to address sexual harassment and discrimination in the legal profession, how the schools plan to address the situation if firms say they do require summer associates to sign such mandatory arbitration agreements. Will certain firms be banned from recruiting law students across the entirety of the T14?

It’s not yet totally clear what the immediate next steps will be if firms disclose that they do require these agreements to be signed. We’ll be pushing for a requirement that all firms who recruit on campus drop them from their contracts entirely, but our sense in talking to the administration is that their immediate approach will vary based on the number of firms that hold onto them. Since nobody seems to have a clear sense of how many firms this is going to end up being, I don’t think anybody’s plans are totally locked down.

Ultimately, our position is that while information disclosure is necessary, it can’t be the final step. Having the information out there without changing campus recruitment policies puts the burden on women and other marginalized groups to choose between either (1) opting out of professional opportunities that their peers feel comfortable accepting, or (2) accepting job offers knowing that they have signed away their rights should they experience harassment or discrimination. Because neither of these is an acceptable outcome, we’ll be continuing our push for an across-the-board requirement of all firms recruiting on campus.

We knew that time was running out for Biglaw, and it seems as if the final grain of sand in the hourglass may soon be falling thanks to student advocates who want to put a stop to this generational issue in the legal profession. Congratulations to every single one of our nation’s top law schools for standing up for what’s right. We hope other law schools sign on to support these new transparency measures.

How many other Biglaw firms are forcing law students to sign agreements like this, sending disputes into private tribunals beyond the prying eyes of the media or courts? How many law students have been bound to suffer in silence in the face of sexual harassment? If you know of any other law firms that require their summers to submit to antiquated agreements like this, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) at or text us at (646) 820-8477. We’ve received several thus far, and may discuss them soon. Thank you for your help.

# Making The Jump From Government Practice To Law Firm Partnership

A stint in public service is attractive to many lawyers. Government practice enables attorneys to improve public policy and promote justice, contributing directly to our collective well-being. But for many attorneys, government practice will be just one phase of a longer, multifaceted career.

After their time in government, lawyers frequently transition to private practice. For some, this represents a homecoming—many attorneys simply return to the firm for which they worked prior to entering government. Others are new entrants to private practice, drawn by the challenge of applying their government knowledge in a new context and by the lure of a substantial increase in compensation.

For a government attorney seeking to make this transition, the range and quality of available private practice roles will depend on several factors. Realistically, not everyone is competitive for law firm partnership, especially at the most prestigious firms. A former equity partner who left her law firm for a stint in a high-profile government post is in a different situation from a career government attorney whose expertise is not aligned with a hot law firm practice area.

Firms value seniority, expertise, and a business development track record

Whether partnership is a realistic aspiration for a departing government lawyer typically depends on three factors: seniority, nature of expertise, and history in private practice.

High-level government leaders tend to be strong partnership candidates, even if they have no prior law firm experience. The lawyers in this category are often political appointees. Examples include:

- General Counsel of an Agency;
- US Attorneys and First Assistant US Attorneys;
- Attorneys General and Deputies;
- Directors (such as Directors of Enforcement);
- Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of major divisions/committees etc.
Some government lawyers who are not in top leadership posts are nevertheless competitive for partnership on the basis of specialized and valuable expertise. A Senior Counsel with deep knowledge of a hot regulatory area such as privacy, cybersecurity, or international trade has a shot at becoming a partner. On the litigation side, partnership is realistic for attorneys with a proven track record of high-profile trial advocacy. An association with an elite group such as the Mueller Special Counsel team is ideal, but even other AUSAs who have accumulated substantial first-chair trial experience can have a solid shot at partnership.

When law firms assess the suitability of a government lawyer for partnership, one critical question is how successful the candidate will be in generating revenue for the firm. Service in a high-profile government role and/or expertise in a high-demand regulatory area will assist in marketing to potential clients. But the most reliable predictor of business development ability is having done it before. A government lawyer with prior experience as a law firm partner will therefore have a considerable advantage. Candidates with partnership experience are especially desirable if they have taken care to maintain relationships with their former private practice clients, as this is a strong signal of capacity to ramp up a book of business quickly.

Although the majority of lawyers who make the transition from government to AmLaw partner fit into one of the above categories, there are occasional exceptions. For example, a former agency attorney (GS-15) became a partner at a firm thanks in part to her former supervisor, who had sufficient business and clout at the new firm to push for the title. In this instance, it was particularly critical for the attorney to work with a recruiter to craft an effective business plan and to prepare for interviews. That preparation enabled her to make the business case to each interviewer she met, regardless of their practice area and location.

Equity or non-equity?

Experience as a law firm partner will be weighed heavily in the decision to offer [equity partnership](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/evolving-partnership-economics-the-equity-and-non-equity-models-are-starting-to-blur/) versus [non-equity partnership](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-it-better-to-be-an-equity-partner-or-non-equity-partner/). It is rare (but not unheard of) for all but the highest-ranking government lawyers who lack a business development track record to get offers for equity at the outset. Conversely, a former equity partner can reliably expect equity partnership offers, particularly where the partner is not seeking to ascend the AmLaw ranks significantly. (A candidate who was an equity partner at a small law firm may not be competitive for equity offers at top AmLaw firms.)

For former non-equity partners, a stint in government can be the perfect springboard to equity partnership. Candidates exiting government roles sometimes mention their non-equity status at their former law firm as the main factor motivating them to seek partnership opportunities at other firms.

What about more typical government lawyers?

For government lawyers who do not fit into the rarified categories described above, but are nevertheless committing to becoming a partner, there is still hope. It may be advisable to pursue opportunities at smaller or less prestigious firms, remembering that the first destination post-government need not be the last. Sometimes, an interim move to a lower-ranked firm can enable a candidate to lay the foundation for a second move in three or so years to join a stronger firm. Flexibility and strategic planning are especially important for lawyers in this situation.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Boies Schiller Takes Big Hit To 2020 Profits
## The firm won't be bringing in its usual haul as it regroups with a different mix of business.

It’s not necessarily surprising, but the American Lawyer reported this week that Boies Schiller Flexner will all but certainly be dropping out of the Am Law 100 this year after [2020 revenues dropped 38 percent and profits were off 54 percent](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/03/10/shaken-by-departures-boies-schiller-flexner-saw-revenue-plummet-38-profits-down-54/). The firm may still be [delivering big compensation for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/despite-changes-to-their-compensation-system-associates-at-boies-schiller-can-still-take-home-huge-bonuses/), but the partners took a hit with profits per equity partner falling from $3.37 million to $2.29 million.

The firm told the Law.com outlet that the firm’s financial hit stemmed from the COVID-related slowdown in litigation, given BSF’s heavy mix of contingency fee matters, with roughly 25 percent of its hours wrapped up in long-tail matters that don’t pay without resolution. Though when they do pay, [they can more than make up for years of effort](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/blue-cross-blue-shield-plans-to-settle-for-2-7b-and-thats-not-the-most-important-relief/). Meanwhile, American Lawyer was quick to note that the firm has seen heavy partner departures, many taking big-ticket clients and correspondingly significant books of business with them out the door. The two are in many ways related, with the firm’s contingency work making up a big portion of the portfolio in part because more “Biglaw like” work for clients like Apple left the firm. Losing some millions in billables in a year is still losing some millions in billables in a year, no matter how you slice it. On the other hand, revenue per lawyer — the number some cite as the more important figure in gauging firm health — was actually up almost 5 percent in 2020 so there are positives in the data.

Can reorienting the firm around this mix of business succeed? I typically infuriate the firm’s champions and detractors alike by responding, “I dunno.”

During the firm’s relative youth, it grew fast in a lot of different directions and with that growth came a lot of competing visions among the partnership for what the firm would become. Should it become a new Biglaw behemoth, a nimble mid-size, merge into an existing full-service firm, or cut back to a much smaller core? There’s a case to be made for and against each path and the firm had in its DNA the building blocks to potentially go down any of them. The “best” move is really only knowable in hindsight.

But I do know that [I’ve never understood](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/everyone-seems-to-be-overreacting-to-these-boies-schiller-departures/) American Lawyer’s fixation on this talking point:

Others have left in part due to Boies’ controversial representations of disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein and defunct company Theranos, which particularly rankled the firm’s West Coast clients, sources have said.

That seems gratuitously negative. On the other hand, legal media is reporting on [turmoil at Roche Freedman](https://www.law360.com/newyork/articles/1363322/atty-says-boies-schiller-spinoff-ousted-him-to-seize-crypto) and every headline calls it “Boies Schiller spinoff.” BSF can’t avoid negative headlines in stories about other firms. On the other hand, the [arrest of Joshua Schiller on a domestic violence charge](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/biglaw-partner-arrested-on-domestic-violence-charge/) and the subsequent revelation that he [continued drumming up business during the firm imposed leave of absence](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/03/03/boies-schiller-partner-joshua-schiller-continued-working-through-leave-of-absence-after-arrest-sources/) is firm business that observers actually need to take seriously.

As to those past matters, I’ve never heard those cited even from partners I’ve spoken with who left the firm. The recurring theme I’ve heard from those partners is that they thought the firm should have chosen a different strategic path. Which is fair! And had the firm gone down that alternative path, a different group of partners would have departed over the last two years. Everyone thinks that their preferred strategy would have been able to hold the whole firm together, and maybe they’re right but that seems presumptuous. I’m more inclined to believe the firm was going to shrink into something new one way or the other.

With COVID clearing up over the second half of the year, we’ll get an inkling of whether or not the firm is stabilizing into its new form next year around this time.

Legal data has never been more important than it is now. 2021 was a record-breaking year for many law firms who dramatically accelerated their growth rates compared to 2020. From profit and growth to efficiencies and strategic decisions, legal data can help uncover key trends from this record-breaking year that may not be readily apparent, making it a critical part of trend analysis for 2021 and beyond.

The TrueLaw Litigation Index – 2021 Law Firm Ranking is UniCourt’s third annual edition of our report highlighting the top 200 federal civil litigation law firms by case count for all United States District Courts. To develop this report, UniCourt downloads all publicly available civil PACER cases and we then leverage artificial intelligence and automation technologies to organize, structure, and normalize court data to identify the attorneys, law firms, parties and judges involved in litigation for trend analysis and litigation intelligence.

For the second year in a row, Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease, LLP is the top federal litigation law firm across all U.S. District Courts. In this article, we’ll review the data behind Vorys’s cases, who some of their top clients are, and how they beat out other law firms again in 2021.

How Vorys Clinched First Place

For an impressive second year in a row, Vorys has clinched first place in the TrueLaw Litigation Index. While Vorys has topped our charts for the past two years, the firm has been providing quality legal services for over 100 years. Since its founding in Columbus, Ohio in 1909, Vorys has gone from a small, four-person office to a legal powerhouse, employing close to 400 lawyers across eight offices in Ohio, Washington, D.C., Texas, Pennsylvania, and California.

Vorys prides itself on the firm’s record of success, representing clients from children’s hospitals and Fortune 500 companies to individuals from all walks of life. But Vorys doesn’t just provide exemplary client services, it has also been identified as a “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality” by the Human Rights Campaign, and consistently makes lists of best lawyers in the United States.

Vorys’ rise to becoming a two-time leader in U.S. District Court litigation is mainly due to one legendary rainmaker and mass litigator – William D. Kloss Jr., who represents Davol Inc. and C. R. Bard, Inc. While Vorys had a decline in overall case volume compared to 2020, Mr. Kloss, a 30-year litigation veteran, handled thousands of cases in 2021, leading his firm to the title.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

As in 2020, the majority of Vorys’s 2021 cases are concentrated in Ohio. The top five jurisdictions where Vorys litigated are:

- Southern District of Ohio – 3439
- Northern District of Ohio – 19
- Central District of California – 15
- Northern District of Texas – 5
- Northern District of California – 5
However, with access to federal litigation data, we can dig deeper into Vorys’s 2021 roadmap to first place, and go beyond simple jurisdictional lists. With legal data, we can uncover Vorys’s primary practice areas, top clients, and most active litigators. In the next section, we’ll discuss what these data points mean for Vorys and how law firms can use legal data to enhance their decision-making.

Dig Deeper with Legal Data

Legal data provides law firms with the ability to make targeted, knowledgeable decisions regarding litigation strategies, legal marketing, legal recruiting, and practice area development. It can also enhance their knowledge management and data analytics initiatives. Legal data isn’t just case specific. Utilizing litigation intelligence derived from legal data can uncover macro trends in areas impacting caseloads, clientele, and internal efficiency.

By breaking down litigation by case types, law firms can easily get a sense of where their business is coming from. Does the firm handle mainly one type of case within a specific practice area? Is there an area in which the firm is expanding, or wants to expand due to increased profitability?

Deep diving into caseload data allows law firms to divert focus, energy, and resources to the practice areas driving the firm’s success. Alternatively, caseload data gives firms the chance to highlight their next move: did you litigate significantly more of a certain type of case this year than last? It may be time to invest in expanding your practice to capture new available business opportunities.

Here are Vorys’s top ten case types for 2021:

- Personal Injury – Medical/Pharmaceutical Product Liability – 2252
- Personal Injury – Other Product Liability – 1089
- Intellectual Property – Trademark – 26
- Property – Real Property Product Liability – 23
- Contract – Other Contract – 21
- Civil Right – Employment Discrimination – 20
- Labor – Labor Standard – 14
- Civil Right – Other Civil Right – 7
- Property – Other Personal Property – 7
- Contract – Insurance – 6
Litigation volume, however, isn’t the only important metric to look at when seeking to understand a law firm’s litigation profile. A firm’s client roster can be just as, if not more, helpful to understanding a law firm’s business.

A client roster is like a private social media handle: it illustrates exactly who the firm wants to interact with, as well as who chooses to interact with the firm. Further, it highlights key clients and the strength or weaknesses the firm has with those clients.

Do you want to understand a firm’s health outside of what you can see on its website? Litigation data shows which clients stick with the firm long term, and which took their business elsewhere. What’s more, looking at competitors’ client rosters can be critical for understanding upcoming business development opportunities.

2021 saw Vorys represent a variety of well-known clients across multiple different disciplines. Below, we’ve listed some of Vorys’s most prominent clients:

Finance

- The Home Loan Savings Bank
- US Bank National Association
- Premier Bank
- Fifth Third Bank
- Global Lending Services LLC
Insurance

- Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield
- Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc.
- Community Insurance, Inc.
- The Western and Southern Life Insurance
- Acceptance Insurance Agency of Tennessee, Inc.
Retail

- Mary Kay Inc.
- Big Lots Stores, Inc.
- GNC Holdings, Inc.
- General Nutrition Corporation
- Abercrombie & Fitch Management Co.
- Victoria’s Secret Stores, LLC
- The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company
- General Electric Company
- Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc.
- Zale Corporation
Notable Mentions

- Google Inc.
- CBS Broadcasting Inc.
- Cushman & Wakefield Western, Inc.
- Abbott Laboratories
- Viacom Inc.
- FEDEX Ground Package System, Inc.
- The Boeing Company
- Monsanto Company
- Halliburton Energy Services, Inc.
- 3M Company
The strength of a firm’s litigation practice can be directly tied to its top litigators, so it’s imperative to look at who a firm’s litigators are, and how their case volume is spread out across a firm’s practice areas. Identifying top rainmakers can assist competitors in poaching the best lateral candidates with large books of business, give future clients an understanding of who they’ll potentially be working with, and help law firm HR departments highlight top performers for retention and promotions, such as partnership offers.

Here are Vorys’s top ten attorneys from 2021 and their respective caseloads:

- William Darrell Kloss, Jr – 3380
- Emily Anne Papania – 12
- Kent Allen Britt – 11
- Nathaniel Lampley, Jr – 10
- Wesley Abrams – 9
- Janay Marie Stevens – 9
- Thomas N. McCormick – 7
- Cory D. Catignani – 7
- Daniel J. Clark – 7
- Timothy B. McGranor – 6
Each of the data points we’ve looked at individually in this article tell an interesting story and give a small window into the larger picture of Vorys’s litigation and its performance over the last year. Combined together, these data points can be used to create a bigger, fuller portrait of who a law firm is, how they got there, and where they’re headed.

Success isn’t just about the money coming in – it takes a holistic, data-centric view of a law firm’s inner workings to uncover the best ways to expand, take on new clients, and ultimately, increase firm profitability.

Whether you need a dossier of client or competitor litigation portfolios for business intelligence, information to enhance your business development initiatives with data analytics, or a way to see litigation trends impacting your firm’s profitability in real-time, litigation data unlocks the intelligence you need to move forward with confidence.

# The Importance Of Authentic Networking
## You should always have a reason to connect with someone beyond 'What can they do for me?'

I was recently asked to share my “#1 career tip” with a group of young lawyers. Here is what I told them.

Everyone talks about networking…about starting early, and the importance of networking when looking for a new job.

But the real key is to practice authentic networking.

What does this mean?

It means networking to learn from others and to open your horizons, not just to advance your career.

It means that you should not be looking to build a network of superficial connections. Do not just connect with people you think can help you. Connect with people you think you can help as well.

You should always have a reason to connect with someone beyond “What can they do for me?”

You don’t need a deep relationship with everyone in your network, but it must be a relationship of give and take, a two-way street.

Perhaps you can’t offer a lot. But perhaps you can forward an article you think would interest them. Perhaps you can offer the chance to reminisce about your time at your shared alma mater. Perhaps as a younger alum, you can give an older alum a glimpse into what the school community is like today.

What does authentic networking mean in a time when we cannot meet people in person?

Keep your LinkedIn profile up-to-date. Connect systematically and in a timely manner with people you engage with virtually.

And remember connecting with someone in an authentic way is not a one-off. Use that time when you would have been at in-person networking events to keep up existing relationships. Check in with your contacts from time to time—because you care about them as human beings, not just when you are looking for a job.

Another lawyer suggested to me recently that by dropping the buzzword “networking” altogether and replacing it with “relationship building,” we will put ourselves in the right mindset. Perhaps she is right.

Remember that developing authentic relationships also means you don’t just look for the people at the top. It’s great if you can network with law firm partners and company executives, but you should also look for connections with peer lawyers, with administrative staff and janitorial staff. And with people outside the legal industry altogether.

Treat everyone with equal respect and positivity, and you’ll do well — in your career, and in your life.

# Biglaw Lawyer Layoffs -- 10,000 Of Them -- Could Be Just Around The Corner
## Which lawyers are most vulnerable to layoffs?

A back-of-the-envelope estimate of lawyer job losses in the forthcoming recession shows total losses, at 10,000 lawyers, will be significantly below the nearly 18,000 jobs lost [during the 2008 recession]. Notably, the changes at law firms, while recession-related, are not truly cyclical swings. Rather, they are structural changes whose necessity becomes clear in the down part of the cycle. The corollary, of course, is that one doesn’t have to wait for the cycle to turn to make changes. Indeed, wise firm leaders are working on them already.

–Hugh A. Simons, a former executive committee member at The Boston Consulting Group and chief operating officer at Ropes & Gray, [writes for The American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2019/02/26/the-next-recession-could-cost-10000-lawyers-their-jobs/) that layoffs — thousands of them — could hit the industry in the next recession. Simons specifically notes that the number of senior attorneys below equity partners (nonequity partners and counsel) have grown tremendously since the 2008 recession, but they may be particularly vulnerable in a changing economic times. “This oft-overlooked group can be a holding pen for lawyers who aren’t going to be made partner but who are important, and profitable, when business is strong,” he writes. “When business softens, their position is more circumspect.”

# Summer Associate Offer Rates (2016): Which Firms Had 100 Percent Offer Rates?
## Which law firms issued offers to all of their summer associates?

Aside from the summer associate who “[jokingly” slapped an associate across the face](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-made-that-summer-associate-slap-a-biglaw-lawyer/) and the summer associate who allegedly [flashed her coworkers](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/is-this-really-a-summer-associate-scandal/) at an event, we’ve had a slow summer in terms of summer associate gossip. We suspect that one of the main reasons for that — on top of their fears of indebtedness and unemployment — is that summer associates worked through Summer of $180K, and they’ve been on their very best behavior in the hopes of earning a grandiose paycheck as a first-year associate after graduating from law school.

Money makes the Biglaw world go ’round, and it also makes summer associates act like a bunch of little goody two-shoes. That being the case, you’d think that this summer’s offer rates would be absolutely awesome. But are they? Let’s find out which firms have handed out offers to 100 percent of their summers — information that rising 2Ls will want to know as the on-campus interviewing season starts up.

It seems like many firms haven’t issued offers yet — some wait until the summer program is done, and some even wait until summer associates are back in school. In fact, so far we’ve only heard about 100 percent offer rates at two law firms:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Winston & Strawn (Chicago): “The Chicago office made offers to 100% of the summer associates on the afternoon of July 21 during a group meeting. The summer program ends tomorrow.”
- Hogan Lovells (New York): “The Managing Partner of the New York City office of Hogan Lovells gave offers to everyone at a summer associate lunch and champagne bottles to celebrate. The summers here are really pumped about the firm and about getting offers on July 25, four days before the program was set to end.”
We normally see at least five or six firms from all over the country sending their summers back to school with offers in hand by this point. What could they be waiting for? Is that pie-in-the-sky $180K starting salary a bit too high for firms to willingly make offers to entire summer classes? Yikes. That’s a scary thought for those awaiting offers.

If you have offer rate information to share, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates) (subject line: “Summer Associate Offer Rates”), or text us (646-820-8477). We keep our tipsters anonymous. If and when we receive enough information, we’ll do a follow-up story.

Thanks a bunch, and to those of you who have already landed offers, congratulations!

In the wake of the attempted coup at the U.S. Capitol, the leaders of Crowell & Moring, a Washington, D.C.-based Am Law 100 firm, issued a statement calling for the “defense of Constitutional democracy,” demanding that the 25th Amendment be used to strip President Donald Trump of his title and duties. Crowell’s leadership hoped that the leaders of other law firms would join the call to remove a president whose actions have put our nation in danger, and many have done just that.

In a joint letter sent to Vice President Mike Pence, the leaders of 18 law firms plus several individual signatories called for Trump to be removed. These are the firms and lawyers that [signed on](https://www.law.com/2021/01/08/17-firms-join-crowell-in-seeking-trumps-removal/) to Crowell & Moring’s call for action:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The letter was signed by Crowell leaders as well as Am Law 200 firms DLA Piper by managing partner Frank Ryan; Foley Hoag by co-managing partner Jeffrey Collins; Sullivan & Worcester by managing partner Joel Carpenter; and Hanson Bridgett, by managing partner Kristina Lawson, as well as other leaders of the firm.

The letter was also signed by leaders and partners of Amin Talati Wasserman; Baker Thomas Oakley Greene; Brinks Gilson & Lione; Coburn & Greenbaum; Farella Braun + Martel; Kendall Brill & Kelly; Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss; Kenneth Reich Law; McNerney & McAuliffe; Phillips Nizer; Shaheen & Gordon; Vandevert Trade Law; Wilson Williams LLC; and WTAII PLLC.

Individual signatories include David Vicinanzo of Nixon Peabody; Joseph Hayden Jr. of Pashman Stein Walder Hayden; and Dawn Elaine Bowie of Yates & Wheland.

Below is the [letter](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20446593-crowellpenceletter) that was sent to Pence:

On January 6, 2021, we watched in horror as the U.S. Congress was subject to a mob’s raid and occupation of the Capitol, interrupting one of the most sacred traditions in our orderly transition of Constitutional power: the receipt and certification of the ballots cast by the states to the Electoral College. It was a scene framed by forcible illegal entry, assault on law enforcement officers, and a senseless death. It was the direct and predictable result of a rally summoned by the President, at which he reinforced false claims of a rigged election that have been rejected or outright disproven by every public and judicial review of our November 2020 presidential election. It was a riot incited by the President’s own words addressing that rally, and then excused by his words after it.

Lawyers have no special province when it comes to politics. We have our views, like all citizens, and we should act on them. But when it comes to defending our Constitution and our system of laws, we have a special duty and an exceptional perspective. In this moment, we must speak out, in devotion to these bedrock principles of our nation.

The President has proven himself unfit for office, and a reckless and wanton threat to the Constitution that he pledged to preserve, protect, and defend. We call upon the Vice President and the Cabinet officers to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, and to declare to the leaders of Congress that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. We further call upon all law firm leaders and all lawyers in government to join in this call, and to stand up for the democratic institutions and traditions of our republic and the Constitution that gives them life and protection.

Will the leaders of your law firm join the call to remove Trump from office?

The firm of [Proskauer Rose](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/proskauer-rose-llp/) has a renowned sports-law practice, with [clients](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/proskauer-rose-llp/company-overview.aspx) like Major League Baseball, the NBA, and the NFL. And it looks like the firm’s associates just scored a touchdown — in the form of a pay raise to the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/), starting at $180K.

There’s a small caveat. Unlike the firms that are matching in all U.S. offices, Proskauer is matching in most of its U.S. offices: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, D.C. Summer and incoming associates in these markets are also getting raises, per the memo (posted on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/game-set-match-in-this-biglaw-firms-major-offices/2/)).

These are all of the firm’s “major” offices, as one Proskauer source put it. The offices not included in the raise — Boca Raton, New Orleans, and Newark — are smaller in size, and they weren’t on the old $160K scale to begin with.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The memo does not speak to Proskauer’s international offices. As for more-senior classes, “the base salaries in all markets for classes beyond 2008, and the base salaries for those on special arrangements, will be communicated individually.”

Congratulations, Proskauer associates; this is a real home run!

UPDATE (6:05 p.m.): Or not. Here’s a dissenting voice:

Proskauer has treated its Boca, Newark, and NoLa associates terribly with regards to comp for years, but this is beyond the pale. People are furious.

[I]t’s always been said that we follow the market. They always argued that they paid top of the market for regional offices. I don’t think that can be fairly said now.

Winston with offices in Charlotte, Princeton, and a tiny one in Newark raised. So did Cooley in Colorado and Seattle. Both are less profitable than Proskauer. Both are raising across the board.

Top-paid Proskauer associates in these offices now make the same or less than the summers in big offices. It is particularly galling as we are expected to work just as long and hard as everyone else.

Will Proskauer do something for these other offices?

UPDATE (7:19 p.m.): Here’s another angry associate:

That is not one dissenting voice from the remote offices. That is the voice of many in the remote offices. Check [Vault](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/proskauer-rose-llp/company-overview.aspx) for salary structures in the remote offices ($145K Newark, $135K Boca Raton, and $110K New Orleans).

Per Vault, the salary scales in these offices top out at $180K in Newark and Boca and $145K in New Orleans. So first-year associates in the “major” markets now make as much as or more than seventh-year associates in the “remote” offices. Ouch.

(Random aside, a story for another day: why is Proskauer in these markets if it can’t afford to pay its associates at higher rates? I don’t mean this in the sense of “why is Proskauer lagging,” because I suspect that its pay in these markets is competitive for these markets. I mean this in the sense of “why is a high-powered firm like Proskauer operating in these lower-margin markets,” when the tendency (or at least aspiration) in Biglaw is to move toward more lucrative markets and more premium practices, shedding offices and dumping practice groups that are less high-margin.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If the associates in the “remote” offices are working on matters and getting billed out at rates that are comparable to their counterparts in the “major” offices, then it seems to me they should be paid the same. But if they are not — if they are considerably less profitable — then why are they still a part of Proskauer? If these offices are diluting profitability, why wouldn’t Proskauer try to spin them off?)

UPDATE (10:58 p.m.): A third upset Proskauer source complains about how the communication was handled:

The Executive Committee didn’t even give the associates in Newark, New Orleans, and Boca Raton the courtesy of including us on the email distributing the memo. They let us find out secondhand that we would not be receiving any sort of increase. We weren’t given any sort of explanation regarding the decision or even an acknowledgment that we do, in fact, work for the same firm and that our work for that firm is appreciated. Which is pretty rich considering the closing line of the memo.

That last line: “The Firm continues to thrive in all of our markets and we are deeply grateful for your enthusiastic and dedicated efforts on behalf of our clients.”

UPDATE (6/10/2016, 10:50 a.m.): Here’s a bit of insight into Proskauer’s “remote” offices and how they fit into the rest of the firm, from an alum of the firm:

Proskauer is in New Orleans solely because of ERISA litigation guru [Howard Shapiro](http://www.proskauer.com/professionals/howard-shapiro/). If he ever ceases to be a Proskauer partner for any reason, that office will close (Howard is a pleasure to work with).

Boca covers personal-planning client retirees (like the Florida offices of many other firms in that space). There is a bit of Health Care and L&E [labor and employment] as well as an outlier local real estate practice. I think they feel they need to stay in that market for their snowbird NYC clients.

Newark, it is no secret, exists to provide NYC-area L&E clients with lower-rate billing lawyers. This allows the firm to staff lower-profile wage and hour and discrimination cases for institutional clients at attractive rates.

Despite some really nice people in these offices, they were never seen (in my tenure) as having the same stature as NY, Boston, DC, or LA. Chicago is not a heavy-hitter office either, but the local market probably required the raise there too. But they have always pushed a “one firm” mindset for morale purposes, and this seems like an odd misstep.

UPDATE (6/10/2016, 2:40 p.m.): Still more about the Prosakauer offices issue, referring to the office in Newark, New Jersey:

[T]he “three-fifths compromise” that the firm has implemented for base salary (and even a smaller proportion) for bonuses has had a dramatic effect on the office’s ability to retain talent. Over the last few years, the number of associates in that office has likely decreased or been stagnant, with juniors and midlevels lateraling to other firms for a six-figure salary bump, or more senior associates giving up on partner track altogether and going in-house. I’ve heard that there hasn’t been an associate to partner promotion in the office [for a long time], which makes their decisions to ultimately jump ship all the more rational.

The idea that they are staffing lower-billing clients is a bit of a red herring. Those matters are staffed by attorneys from all offices, including those paying market, and those that do not. On the flip side, offices like Newark also staff the higher-billing matters, and on a given day, you’ll see half of the associates working in the NYC office.

# Biglaw Firm Keeps Salary Cuts In Force, Will Make Associates Do Extra Work To Recoup Lost Pay
## Associates at the firm seem less than thrilled.

As more and more firms make moves to reverse their COVID-19 austerity measures, either in whole or in part, Biglaw associates have come to expect the retroactive payment of compensation that was cut and some have been left wanting. But at some firms, the extra work associates need to do to recoup their lost cash just doesn’t seem to be worth it.

Baker Donelson — a firm that was ranked just outside the Am Law 100 at #101, with $378,877,000 in 2019 gross revenue — [slashed salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-100-firm-turns-to-furloughs-and-salary-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/) across the board back in April and furloughed an untold number of employees. Earlier this summer (in mid July, to be precise), the firm disclosed to associates how they could go about getting retrospective pay for the months their salaries were skewered.  To be brief, associates aren’t thrilled with the firm’s plan:

Essentially, we have to collect 125% of our revenue targets (which are all based on rates that none of us are actually getting so it’s more impossible than it appears) to get all of our retrospective pay. Even though our collections are up (August was 4% above pre-pandemic budget) they’re still sending emails basically telling us to not expect anything else any time soon.

In a confidential memo, Baker Donelson listed three ways associates could earn back some of their salaries (that memo is available in full on the next page):



Last, but not least, if an associate achieves at least 110% of their hours target, as of September 30, but have not exceeded one of the pay thresholds, that associate will receive a one-time payment that will bring their compensation to 90% of base pay.

What about their future pay? Is there any end in sight for the salary cuts at the firm? According to the memo, the answer is a hard no.

At this time, no one will be paid 100% of their salary prospectively.

Best of luck to everyone at Baker Donelson as they try their hardest to collect on the compensation they’re due — it looks like they may need it.

It’s Biglaw bonus season, and associates across the country are expecting to soon receive gigantic wads of cash from their firms. Something that associates perhaps aren’t expecting to receive from their firms are actual holiday gifts — but one firm is doing just that.

Just before [Cravath announced its year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) of up to $115,000, Skadden notified associates that they’d be receiving appreciation gifts as an expression of gratitude from the firm for their “extraordinary efforts” during these trying times.

What will associates at the firm be taking home as thank-you gifts from Skadden this holiday season? Here’s a nice note that all associates received with the details:

An iPad Pro, an Apple Pencil, and a Magic Keyboard are lovely gifts from the firm. It may not be straight cash, but all of these Apple accoutrements are worth in the ballpark of $1,000 or more combined. Let’s just hope that these holiday gifts from Skadden are all meant to be for personal use.

It’s nice to see a firm stepping up with a new and fun way to show their  associates some love. Are other firms taking similar measures? Let us know! Please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Thanks) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Thanks”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Bonus Season: Is It Time To Pay Double Associate Bonuses?

As the leaves begin to turn, we all know that Biglaw bonus season is just around the corner. Sometime in the next 4-6 weeks, we’re going to start hearing about the annual bonus structure that every major firm will blindly copy. After a year of [raises and mid-year bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2018-associate-salary-increase/), is there room for one more round of good news for associates?

Over at Law.com, Hugh A. Simons isn’t worried about bonuses as much as he’s afraid Biglaw is gearing up for another salary increase in 2019 and thinks it’s time firms [transition away from higher base pay toward massive bonuses](https://www.law.com/2018/10/16/we-should-double-year-end-associate-bonuses/) before the impending Trump recession locks Biglaw into pay structures and revenue targets they simply can’t maintain. He argues for doubling the size of bonuses — perhaps structured to be paid semiannually — to better reward associates. It’s an interesting, meticulously constructed theory, that spurs outside the box thinking in a sector known for lacking creativity. But it’s also a problematic model and one that I can’t envision the most elite firms adopting — which ultimately dooms it out of the gate.

If the past is a guide then once the salary changes by the early movers have stabilized, Big Law will copy the move unvaryingly nationwide. We should head this off for two reasons. First, another salary increase would be damaging to the profession. It fosters heightened discord with clients and strengthens their resolve to continue taking work away from Big Law. It’s not good for firms, partly because they’ll fall back on the instinctive response of raising rates, which is counter to their long-term health; partly because it disinclines firms to invest in innovation and technology. It’s not even good for associates: it raises the expectations of their billed hours which is not conducive to their long-term participation in the profession; through pressuring profitability, it leans against their prospects for achieving partnership.

This glosses over — though Simons gets there eventually — the real problem lampshaded in the first sentence: “Big Law will copy the move unvaryingly nationwide.” Salary increases aren’t bad for firms… they’re bad for Bumblefuck & Dimbleshit LLP’s Omaha office. If we’ve learned anything from the past two rounds of salary increases, it’s that despite initial grumbling, there’s a lot of give in the pricing for elite Biglaw services. The top Biglaw firms raise rates and the clients keep right on paying them. There’s no innovation slow down. Those firms just keep right on trucking like nothing happened. It’s not Cravath’s fault that the Am Law 51-100 feels obligated to follow its lead. Let Cravath keep raising salaries and push the rest of Biglaw to take a long, hard look in the mirror. After all, there’s no good reason for the [bimodal salary curve](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-most-important-chart-in-the-legal-industry-and-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-law/) and instead of trying to keep salaries in check to keep more firms in the top tier, it’s time to just force the issue and get some of these hangers-on to realize they occupy a different segment of the market.

The second reason is that a salary increase is an ill-suited response to the problem at hand, namely attrition (particularly at the more senior levels). Increasing bonuses rather than salaries (fixed costs) would be wiser at this point in the economic cycle; a bonus paid out half now and half at mid-year 2019 would directly address the problem we face.

On the one hand, this is unfortunately true. This is the gig economy at work — why pay for long-term employees when you can pay as you go? It’s cheaper in the long-run to reward employees when it’s convenient for management and skimp when it’s not. There’s an argument to be made that allowing associates to gather bonus rosebuds while they may could be their saving grace when a recession hits and firms have the option of slashing bonuses rather than laying people off. But call me skeptical of these sorts of bargains. When an employer says, “give me the option of paying you more (or less) on an arbitrary timetable of my choosing and maybe I won’t fire you,” it’s not a recipe for a fairy tale ending. It may more closely track trends in corporate America, but it’s another brick in the road toward deprofessionalizing the law.

On Monday, June 4, Milbank surprised the world by raising their salary scale to tee off of a starting salary of $190K. Above the Law was ecstatic.

This is true.

While we’re on the subject of Above the Law, he also mentions us while applauding the lengthy timetable for matching:

Another guideline for the compensation followers is not to feel rushed. One of the positives from the last round of increases, even if not lauded by Above the Law, is that firm responses played out over eight weeks. A message to associates that says the firm is watching the market, and that any move will be back dated, should quell any anxieties.

Trust me, it was lauded. Firms took what should have been a 2-week story and dragged it into 8-week traffic extravaganza. Next time, we sincerely hope it’s a 10-week process.

Milbank had not been thought of as a salary leader; the reason for their moving seemed to be “if we don’t do it, someone else will”. This isn’t a logic; this is a cliché.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I really don’t think this is the case. My sense is that Milbank’s logic was precisely that they had not been thought of as a salary leader and wanted in on that discussion. Milbank feels it gets short shrift from the firm rankings out there and believed it deserved to be considered an elite firm too and made this move to stake a claim. That’s why they didn’t really care that others would match or even that they’d eventually have to adjust their compensation to match the efforts of Simpson and Cravath to leapfrog them.

Simons is dead-on that Cravath’s adjustment should provide a model for the next round of salary increases. Cravath weighted the increase more toward senior associates — the ones most likely picked off by clients or lateral hiring. The problem is this clashes with his central thesis that firms should transition toward more bonus compensation. It’s the predictability of base pay that allows firms to combat attrition.

A bonus-centric compensation structure undermines the very predictability that keeps people locked into the Biglaw machine. Even announcing two-stage bonuses, with the second tranche paid six months down the road if people stay, can only provide six months of predictability. After that July payday, associates are on the market again — and that’s assuming hiring firms aren’t willing to cover forfeited bonuses, [which they increasingly are](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/if-firms-dont-think-recruiters-will-go-after-them-for-not-raising-salaries-theyre-wrong-this-email-proves-it/). Any firm offering higher base pay is going to win that recruiting battle, and as long as, say, White & Case can afford to raise base salary, they’ll do it and scoop up all the people fleeing firms that offer fickle bonuses.

And, yes, money isn’t everything when it comes to choosing a job, but it’s naive to think it’s not the primary factor in Biglaw work. If a lawyer’s ready to save the whales, so be it, but if they’re still planning to hang out in the Biglaw sector, they’re there for the money.

A first observation is that there are many ways to counter associate attrition that don’t involve compensation: the interest level of the work, the training they’re getting, respect for their personal lives, willingness of partners to push back on unreasonable client demands, avoiding re-work and unnecessary fire drills, personal bonds with peers and partners, long-term growth prospects at the firm.

Avoiding unnecessary fire drills? Free unicorn rides would work too.

But seriously, attorneys do care about these factors and when the whole market pays the exact same, these factors matter for a lawyer shopping around. The more firms individualize compensation the more these other concerns fall by the wayside in a mad grab for cash.

At some level, it’s the refuge of firms who fail on these fronts to rely most heavily on compensation as a retention tool. This is risky: compensation begets complaisance; it does not beget loyalty.

Perhaps it does not. However what definitely does not beget loyalty is telling someone that the bulk of their compensation will be decided on a whim post facto.

…salary increases shouldn’t be the same across all offices. But what, you say, of having “one firm” as a firm value? It’s naïve to think of values as absolutes; values inherently conflict. Another value firms would espouse is to treat people fairly. Is it fair to associates in New York that their brethren in Chicago are paid an amount that gives them 20 percent more purchasing power? From an economic perspective, the amount to pay Big Law lawyers in Chicago should key off the compensation they would get at an in-house or ‘small law’ position in Chicago—their true alternatives—not off the compensation of a Big Law lawyer in New York.

No one trolls the idea of paying the same salary in all offices [more than me](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/). That said, these smaller market salary bumps are really the flipside of the attrition coin. It’s all about Houston trying to entice the New York Biglaw mid-level who went to high school in Texas. When viewed from that frame, these wacky salaries make at least a little economic sense.

Another aspect of a moving toward greater rationality centers on the tradition of lock step salaries and hours-based bonuses. These systems are embodiments of Taylorism management theories of the 1890s; they don’t belong in people-centered businesses of the 21st century. People don’t progress at a single rate; a single measure of performance belies the multifaceted nature of the role; using hours as this single measure discourages efficiency and delegation. It’s daft: all law firms salute the notion that their people are their most important resource; they then manage their compensation with the techniques of the steam locomotive era. To state the obvious: progression rates should vary by individual; performance assessment should be multi-faceted and vary with the seniority of the role; and individuals should be guided on development through personalized interaction not arithmetic.

Ultimately, the problem with this proposed model is that it makes so much sense on paper but that’s just never going to live up to reality. Firms should be concerned with retention and enjoy latitude to adjust compensation to keep specific attorneys on the payroll when targeted by rival firms. But how a black box compensation model actually works out is a firm systematically undercompensates attorneys or engages in more troubling discriminatory practices — consciously or unconsciously. Perhaps it’s because lawyers are more risk-averse than other professionals, but transparent lockstep compensation is critical to the predictability that staves off attrition.

In short, this is a fine proposal that law firm management will inevitably screw up. A recession is probably coming. Firms probably shouldn’t raise salaries unless they are the barest of COLAs. Everyone should take a hard look at themselves. That’s my advice.

But if firms want to start handing out exorbitant bonuses, just let Above the Law know first.
