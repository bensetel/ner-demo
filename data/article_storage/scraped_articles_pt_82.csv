Our experts are working to bring our systems back online as quickly and safely as possible and we are aiming for our email system to be up and running today, 29 June.

Our clients are our utmost priority and we are working closely with them to ensure we maintain service. At this time, we have no evidence that the confidentiality of any client data has been compromised.

— an excerpt from a [statement](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/focus/dla-piper-malware-attack-update/) released by [DLA Piper](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/dla-piper/) in the wake of the global Biglaw firm being hit by a Petya ransomware attack earlier this week. The firm is currently [working with the FBI](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/dla_piper_works_with_fbi_as_it_grapples_with_malware_attack_says_client_dat) and the UK National Crime Agency to determine where the malware came from. Here’s what a partner in the firm’s [London office](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/06/28/dla-piper-working-with-fbi-and-nca-to-get-systems-back-online-after-ransomware-cyber-attack/) said about the ordeal: “People are managing surprisingly well and using personal emails. It’s annoying. We’re running around trying to keep clients happy. Clients are — so far — being understanding.”

# The Reason I’m Not Tom Cruise
## Being a lawyer today doesn’t resemble the prepandemic Hollywood version of it. And that’s a good thing.

The first firm I ever wanted to work at was [Bendini, Lambert & Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firm_(1993_film)). As a kid, sitting at home watching a VHS tape of John Grisham’s “The Firm,” I didn’t focus on the firm’s rampant tax fraud and mob connections. What I saw was Tom Cruise, all confidence and swagger, walking through a mahogany law library and getting paid to be smart and think on his feet. The law was cool, even dangerous, and watching Cruise navigate its twists and turns helped convince me that law was the path I wanted to follow.

I don’t think I’m alone in being inspired to the practice by something I saw on TV. Television and movies have long had a pretty defined vision of what the practice of law entails. In Hollywood, we as lawyers are always sporting perfectly tailored professional clothing, for a start. We’re always well-versed in whatever area of law our client needs help with. We go to court every day, say objection a few times, make an impassioned closing argument, then retire to our richly appointed offices for cocktails and witty banter.

Being a lawyer has always seemed tangible in media in a way that most other professions aren’t. There’s so much iconography to the practice of law. Briefcases and gavels, benches and robes, blind Lady Justice herself holding her scales. Lawyers are part of a millennia-old tradition, and carry responsibilities not just to our clients but to the systems of justice we live in. Being a lawyer comes with the power to be a hero, or a villain. We’re counselors, advocates, legislators, fixers. We’re the stewards of the corridors of power, or sometimes the seats of power ourselves. Lawyers, you would think, run the world.

And yet here I sit in my home office, wearing a T-shirt and flip-flops, preparing to connect to a Zoom meeting. Maybe later I’ll redline another document or create some exciting expense spreadsheets. Tom Cruise wheeling and dealing with mafiosos and models I am not.

The Pandemic’s Impact

 The pandemic forcing almost everyone to work from home certainly didn’t help maintain law’s glamorous image, but the reputation of the law has been misaligned with the actual practice for decades. The old school-cool attorney just doesn’t have much place in this world anymore.

Take litigation, which I’d argue is the most visible part of law in modern media. I don’t know any Perry Masons fighting it out in front of a courthouse jury every day. Many attorneys have full, happy careers never once setting foot in a courtroom, and those of us who are litigators by trade spend vanishingly little time in court. We spend our time doing briefing, taking discovery, and working toward resolutions outside the courthouse steps.

As unglamorous as it may be, it’s undeniably a good thing. Law has pivoted away from the old days where you’d meet your client Monday, pick your jury on Thursday, and break down the verdict with opposing counsel at happy hour Friday. Our focus as a profession has shifted away from fast and loose, from-the-hip trial litigation toward more careful, thoughtful, probing exchanges of information. As these procedures (and the bodies of law surrounding them) have matured, parties’ abilities to realistically value their prospects have increased tremendously. Rational parties can and do settle the vast majority of litigation they begin, because we have the tools today to know where our cases are most likely headed if they continue.

Mason moments are rare these days. To even get to trial, it takes the investments of hundreds of hours of time and exorbitant amounts of money on both sides. Dozens of jurors have to report for duty, and the judges and their clerks have to be brought up to speed. It’s just not usually rational to incur those massive financial and societal costs. Some facts have to be just too muddy to properly assess, or one or both sides have to be too dug into their position to make settlement a possibility. The trials that TV and movies love to dramatize only usually happen today when our more efficient, evolved mechanisms for resolving conflict have broken down.

Why Are We Here?

It helps to remember why attorneys exist in the first place. We’re the tools a society uses to help it function better. A colleague of mine often says attorneys and plumbers have a lot in common. Members of both professions wade into other people’s messes and use some specialized knowledge and hard work to help clean it up. Even the billing structures are often the same. If there’s any difference, it’s that plumbers probably work harder, aren’t paid as well, and likely have a healthier sense of perspective on their place in the world.

The prepandemic tangible perks of being a lawyer — large, opulent offices and clothes — were nice, but they might actually have been hurting the core of what we do. No amount of high-rise office space, bespoke business wear, Italian leather briefcases, or tufted leather furniture can do the same job as a well-written brief, an elegant contract revision, a thoughtful question, or an insightful analogy. In our world, substance still wins.

Stripping away the artifice and glamour of the practice of law leaves us with something that’s still noble and worthwhile. We’re here to shape and understand our world. We’re here to make sure the law stays vibrant and vital. We’re here to listen, counsel, and help people. That’s why I love what I do. Sure, I don’t mind sporting a suit once in a while, grabbing a drink in the lounge with my colleagues, and enjoying the amenities that the practice of law affords us. Wanting to be Tom Cruise is part of why I got into law in the first place. But now that I’m here, it’s the people I’ve helped and the relationships I’ve made that I’ll remember.

It’s the job, not the perks, that keeps me going day after day.

# Global Biglaw Firm 'Paralyzed' By New Ransomware Attack
## Uh-oh. What happened to this firm's cybersecurity expertise?

In May, the [WannaCry ransomware attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/is-your-firm-vulnerable-to-the-recent-ransomware-attack/) infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide, and global Biglaw firms like DLA Piper were quick to tout their [expertise in cybersecurity compliance](https://www.dlapiper.com/ja/japan/insights/publications/2017/06/wannacry-ransomware-attack/), offering solutions for affected companies up to and including crisis management teams and even a 24/7 [Rapid Response](http://www.dlapiperrapidresponse.com/) hotline. Today, it looks like the lawyers at DLA may have to dial their own number, because the firm was just hit by another quickly spreading ransomware attack called Petrwrap/Petya.

Here’s the message that was displayed across computer monitors at DLA Piper:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Petrwrap/Petya attack seems to have originated at the firm’s office in [Madrid, Spain](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/locations/madrid/?tab=lawyers). According to [El Confidencial](http://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/2017-06-27/ataque-ransomware-dla-piper-wannacry_1405839/), a Spanish-language digital newspaper, all employees there were ordered to shut down their computers immediately and have been forbidden to send emails from firm computers or make calls from firm telephone lines. Almost everyone at the firm — even the IT department — has gone home thanks to the complete and total lockdown of their computers and phone systems. “Don’t think people are happy not to be at work,” one employee said. “Everything is going to have to be recovered.”

DLA Piper's web portal is down. This is used to access sensitive docs

— Chris Bing (@Bing_Chris) [June 27, 2017](https://twitter.com/Bing_Chris/status/879714827685507072)

Per [Legal Week](http://www.legalweek.com/sites/legalweek/2017/06/27/dla-piper-hit-by-cyber-attack-with-phones-and-computers-down-across-the-firm/), the malware has since spread across firm’s offices, globally:

DLA’s phone system has not been working for much of the day and partners say they have been instructed to turn off their computers as a precaution. DLA offices in the UK, Europe, the Middle East and the US called by Legal Week all seem to have been affected, with some inside the firm saying email and phone systems have been affected with many systems now locked down as a precaution.

DLA said in a statement: “The firm, like many other reported companies, has experienced issues with some of its systems due to suspected malware. We are taking steps to remedy the issue as quickly as possible.”

Best of luck to everyone at DLA Piper as they attempt to repair the damage that’s been done. If only the firm had followed [its own advice](https://www.dlapiper.com/ja/japan/insights/publications/2017/06/wannacry-ransomware-attack/), perhaps its lawyers could’ve been better prepared for the latest ransomware attack.

# Beyond Biglaw: Freedom From Financial Obsession
## Beware of this soul-killing danger: the danger of becoming obsessed with the financial aspects of legal practice, and defining one’s self-worth by how lucrative (or not) your practice is at any given moment.

Every culture I am aware of looks at the springtime as a time of renewal. Nature itself experiences a revival of spirit this time of year. Many people experience a similar effect. The improved weather, signs of greenery, and longer days all contribute to a more expansive feeling about what is possible. The ancient holiday (over 3000 years old) of Passover, now being celebrated by Jews worldwide, invokes the theme of renewal. To that end, Passover is biblically ordained as a spring festival, and the entire presence of leap years in the Jewish lunar calendar is designed to ensure that Passover falls out in the Mediterranean spring season, when the first barley crop would ripen.

Apart from its celebration of the agrarian, Passover is also a holiday that poses questions about what freedom actually means. Is true freedom what we would consider a life of leisure, such as that enjoyed by the retired denizens of Scottsdale or Palm Beach? Or is it more important for people to have true freedom of choice in their lives, as in freedom from addiction or difficulties of all kinds that can hamper one’s full exercise of self-control? The answers to these timeless questions are at once apparent and elusive, and with the experience of each spring season we are forced to square our current lives with the lives we envisioned for ourselves. At a minimum, each spring presents an opportunity to harmonize our reality with our hopes, and start again down the road to accomplishing our goals.

As lawyers, we are taught to appreciate the value of hard work. At every step of our careers, the message is a clear one: if you want to achieve your maximum in this profession, you will need to work hard. Because some other lawyer who you are competing with, whether they be an adversary or colleague, is working hard to defeat you in some way. It starts in law school, with competition for grades and journal experience as a first year. Then OCI introduces the competition for summer associate slots at well-paying firms, or prestigious internships in the public interest area. Once a lawyer is gainfully employed, the pressure to perform by billing or at least working long hours begins. The treadmill never stops, no matter how senior the attorney. The promise is that all the hard work will result in a secure, if not bountiful, financial existence for the lawyer.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Of course, one of the joys of legal practice is the competition, so financial reward is not the only benefit of a career in legal practice. Another joy is the ability to always learn, and the never-ending challenge to improve as a lawyer. There is also the primary joy available to an attorney — the ability to serve and improve the lot of others. Every service profession demands long hours and hard work. Law is not an exception.

At the same time, lawyers practicing today encounter significant challenges caused by the increased pace of legal practice, and increased competition caused by lower client demand and a glut of practitioners. A legitimate response to these challenges is for lawyers — especially those fortunate to have thriving practices — to work harder. Many do, whether they are associates at large law firms asked to handle more work because of smaller associate classes, or government lawyers operating with fewer resources and smaller budgets. Even lawyers at smaller firms, who may enjoy more control over their schedules, nevertheless need to work as hard as their large-firm counterparts to remain competitive. Just preserving one’s financial position has become a greater challenge.

In this environment, for all the benefits of dedication to legal practice, and the thrill of competition, there is a soul-killing danger: the danger of becoming obsessed with the financial aspects of legal practice, and defining one’s self-worth by how lucrative (or not) your practice is at any given moment. Yes, making a living is an important part of why lawyers work as hard as they do. But when the desire to do well financially turns into an obsession, the potential for damage is significant. Lawyers who are desperate to succeed financially are more likely to cross the line of ethical behavior, or take unnecessary risks to “grow their practice” by taking on debt to finance marketing efforts or in pursuit of building leverage.

In short, giving up a sense of perspective about the financial side of legal practice is actually an abdication of one’s freedom. An addiction to greed, or profit at all costs, can be just as damaging to lawyers and the people around them as a substance abuse problem. Unlike substance abuse, which is rarely tolerated in the legal profession and never heralded, there is continuous pressure on firms and lawyers to demonstrate financial performance. In fact, the legal profession is extraordinarily open about financial performance, whether it be profits per partner or associate compensation at large law firms. Financial measuring sticks are readily available, and unsurprisingly many lawyers look at the performance of others and find their own lacking. Accordingly, it can be hard for lawyers who fall into the trap of focusing too much on money issues to extricate themselves — either through their own efforts or with the assistance of others — before lasting damage is done. The same is true at the law firm level as well.

All too often, we read in these pages of otherwise successful lawyers cutting corners in the pursuit of more money. As important as those stories are as cautionary tales, the better result for everyone would have seen those lawyers getting the help they need before their lives were destroyed. Perhaps by recognizing the danger, and tempering our natural instinct to glorify lawyers “making bank,” more lawyers will avoid giving up their freedom of choice when it comes to finances. Part of the message of Passover is that freedom comes at a cost, but nothing is as costly as enslaving oneself.

Over the summer, what should have been a feel-good story turned into a gripe-fest. Following the rest of Biglaw, Proskauer Rose [raised associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/game-set-match-in-this-biglaw-firms-major-offices/) to the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) — but only in certain offices. Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, D.C. — what one Proskauer tipster called the “major” offices — got bumped up to Cravath levels. Boca Raton, New Orleans, and Newark — the not-so-major offices — did not. This generated many complaints of unfair treatment from associates in the smaller offices (see the multiple UPDATES to [this post](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/game-set-match-in-this-biglaw-firms-major-offices/)).

It’s now time for year-end bonuses, and Proskauer is following the same playbook. Associates in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and D.C. will get the Cravath scale, to be paid on December 22. Associates in Boca Raton, New Orleans, and Newark will learn of their individualized bonuses on or before December 14. So some associates will feast on market-matching bonuses, while others will dine on mystery meat.

Associates in the major markets seem pleased:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- “Everyone here seems happy and relieved (some people were a bit nervous about what would happen as a result of post-Trump uncertainty). The scale is as expected since we were explicitly told that the firm would match market at a recent associate town hall meeting.”
- “We were not expecting anything more than last year’s bonus scale, what with the base-rate raises this year. Still exciting news, and feel confident that if any other firm ends up setting a new bonus scale, Proskauer will always go with market.”
- “Not surprised at all, but pleased nonetheless. The only surprise is the timing. Proskauer usually waits a few days for the dust to settle before announcing, but this year they announced within 24 hours of the first mover, which is new.”
- “Proskauer always follows the market, and is fast to pay. As a more general observation, the summer raises were bold and buzzworthy — this move is not. Going lower than 2015 would effectively be clawing back structured salary trumpeted when raises were announced. I feel fortunate, to be sure, but as a market observer, I don’t see how the scale could have landed lower without losing the goodwill generated by the summer raise.”
- “Firm is very consistent that we will follow the market wherever it lands, and so this is not a surprise, but still good news.”
And what about associates in the other offices? The ones we’ve heard from so far are taking a “wait and see” approach, but they’re probably not expecting Cravath-level bonuses (just as they eventually got base-salary hikes, but not as big as the NYC market raises). The long-term fate of the smaller offices — tied to specific lawyers, such as ERISA litigation king [Howard Shapiro](http://www.proskauer.com/professionals/howard-shapiro/) in New Orleans, or specific clients, such as wealthy snowbirds in Boca Raton — remains uncertain.

We’ve heard from many of the major NYC-centric firms, but dozens of others have yet to weigh in. When your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

# Morning Docket: 03.31.16
## * William Shatner has found himself at the center of a $170 million paternity lawsuit that was filed by a radio DJ who claims the actor had a fling with his biological mother. If we'd been able to reach him for comment, we imagine Shatner would've said something like this for himself: ""Oh my... God I am... not... the father."" [[People Magazine](http://www.people.com/article/william-shatner-sued-for-170-million)] * Judge Rosemary Collyer of the D.C. District Court may not have the name recognition some of her colleagues do, but she's had a hand in some of the most newsworthy cases we've seen in recent years. The ""systemically important"" judge just added another notch to her high-profile belt by stripping MetLife of its ""too big to fail"" label. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/03/30/a-systemically-important-judge/)] * ""When your basic human needs are at stake, you should have a lawyer to protect those needs. The consequences are too great."" Eighteen states are considering bills that would ensure legal representation for low-income people in certain civil cases, such as matters involving eviction, foreclosure, child custody, and involuntary commitment. [[ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/states-provide-lawyers-poor-civil-cases-38021512)] * Earlier this week, Debevoise & Plimpton launched the [Debevoise Women’s Review](http://women.debevoise.com/), a site that will aim to focus on the achievements of women lawyers and business professionals. The site will concentrate on ""the development, retention and promotion of female professionals."" Way to go, Debevoise! [[Big Law Business / Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/women-professionals-featured-on-debevoises-new-website/)] * More and more law schools are completely overhauling their coursework in an effort to put more butts in seats, and make sure those butts are prepared for law practice after graduation. Some schools have even significantly reduced tuition costs. For example, students can now attend Elon Law for the low, low flat rate of $100K.

# Partners Often Blame Associates For Their Own Failures
## Blaming others is often more satisfying to the ego, but sometimes it's better to be a little more self-reflective.

It is a well-known fact of human nature that few people like to blame themselves for their own failures, and individuals usually like to assign blame to someone else. It is really difficult for people to admit that they have fallen short, and it is much easier mentally to assign blame to another person. This manifests itself in many ways, and it can be seen in educational endeavors, sports, and in professional life. In my experience, very few partners blame themselves for their own shortcomings, and they far more often blame associates for failures at a law firm even though issues are the fault of partners.

I first realized this phenomenon when I was an associate in Biglaw earlier in my career. The firm at which I worked was having difficulty financially since we lost a huge portfolio of work, and afterward, many attorneys and staff in our office did not have enough work to do. The partners had not been able to find substitute business for people to work on, and this created a precarious situation for our office.

One day, the partners invited all of the associates in the office to a meeting that was advertised as a professional development training. At the meeting, it was conveyed that associates would be expected to work on business development and to start generating business. The partners conveyed that the burden of originating new clients could not fall on the partners alone, and the associates also needed to share in the responsibility of originating business. From the tone of the meeting, it seemed as if the partners were at least partially blaming associates for the financial position that the firm was in, and they were assigning the responsibility of originating business at least partially on the associates.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Expecting associates to originate business is completely ridiculous, and it was clear that this effort was partly because the partners did not want to own up to their own failures. Partners are usually older and have many more contacts who are seasoned lawyers or industry professionals who can refer work. At many law firms, partners also have a lower billable hour requirement so that they can focus more on originating business rather than billing hours. It was almost comical to believe that associates who were only a few years out of law school could originate the type of large corporate clients our firm usually served. Of course, originating business is routinely considered during promotion discussions, but this is rarely the job of associates, and the partners wanted to indirectly blame associates for the lack of work at the office rather than look inward at their own failures.

Another time, I was on a team of associates who were responsible for drafting papers connected with an important motion my firm was filing. The papers were solid, and the team did a really good job conveying the points that we wished to argue in connection with the motion. When it came time to argue the motion, we assumed that one of the associates who was most knowledgeable about the case would argue the matter. At the last minute, the partner decided that he wanted to argue it himself, which is not too uncommon at many law firms.

However, this partner participated in numerous activities beyond his law practice, and he was notorious for not spending enough time on matters at the firm to the detriment of clients. Rather than read the papers filed in connection with the motion, the partner just asked the associates to brief him on the facts and arguments he needed to convey, and I am pretty sure this was the only preparation he did for the argument. At the oral argument, the partner was flat-footed, hesitant, and was unable to recite some basics facts of the matter. Anyone could see that this was a substantial reason why we got a very unfavorable outcome from the motion.

Of course, the partner refused to admit that his lack of preparation torpedoed our efforts with respect to the motion. He blamed the associates for not drafting solid papers and for not sufficiently preparing him for the matter to be argued. However, if the partner would have just focused more on preparing for oral arguments, and read all of the submissions in connection with the motion, I am confident that we would have been able to obtain a different result.

All told, it is really tough to look inward at one’s own failures, and associates are an easy target of partner’s wishing to assign blame to someone other than themselves. However, this often does not achieve anything, and partners should try to be more self-reflective about their own failures.

For most folks, the NYC Marathon is a grueling endeavor that takes up their entire focus during the final lead up. For Quinn Emanuel’s [Luke Nikas](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/nikas-luke/), it’s just a weekend project he’ll have to get to after heading to trial the rest of this week.

This is an appropriate juncture for you to feel shamed over your workout regimen.

Nikas started running in high school — maintaining the right weight class made running the best workout strategy. But, as the old joke goes, “running” and “running a marathon” are about as similar as shooting a bullet and throwing it. For Nikas, getting into the hardcore running world came only a couple of years ago when he lost his uncle to pancreatic cancer. That brought him to [Project Purple](http://www.projectpurple.org/) and back into running. After getting back into it for a good cause, Nikas realized he could really make a go at this pastime.

His Project Purple running got him into the marathon world and a whole new level of training. Crack of dawn — or earlier — loops around the park racking up the miles and running races from 10Ks to half marathons throughout the year. Unfortunately it also brought him a pain in his shin that he was a bit too stubborn to address. “The doctor told me I had a shin splint that turned into a stress fracture and then turned into a fracture,” Nikas said. Medical orders forced him off of running for two months.

Undeterred, he bought a Peloton and kept swimming — workout methods that minimized stress on his shin — and managed to make the marathon and excel. Last year, he finished in 3 hours and 12 minutes. That’s about a 7:15 mile pace and good enough to finish 2,377 in the field of 52,706.

His reliance on swimming and biking during his recovery also opened up another opportunity to make all the rest of us look bad expand his competitive athletic career. “I thought, if I could do that well in the marathon having only had swimming and biking to train…” Oh no, I know where this is going. Yes, Nikas has entered an Ironman competition next year to show off his swimming and biking too.

Why not add Ninja Warrior to it, while you’re at it?

Good luck to Nikas in this weekend’s big event. The rest of the Quinn partnership is also rooting Nikas on and hoping he can improve on his already impressive time.

Mostly because all this time is unbillable.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Two Mergers In Span Of Two Weeks
## Exciting news, but will this inspire the firm to adjust its salary scale?

There must be something other than lead in the water in Philadelphia, because one Biglaw firm is on a spree when it comes to mergers.

Last week, Philadelphia-based Ballard Spahr announced that it would be merging with Minneapolis-based Lindquist & Vennum, effective January 1, 2018. Today, Ballard Spahr announced that it would be merging with D.C.-based First Amendment and media law powerhouse Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz, effective October 1, 2017. The combined firm will continue to operate as Ballard Spahr, and when all is said and done, the firm will have almost 700 lawyers across 15 offices. In the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, Ballard Spahr was ranked [99th for gross revenue](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784616627) and [95th for profits per partner](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784617547).

As far as Ballard Spahr’s merger with Lindquist & Vennum is concerned, the firms had been discussing a possible combination for at least a year prior to last week’s announcement. What as the driving force behind the merger talks? According to Ballard Spahr chairman Mark Stewart, the firm was very interested in “deepening [its] business and finance practice,” and the acquisition of Lindquist & Vennum would give the firm a “well-known and highly regarded mergers and acquisitions and private equity group.” Here’s some additional information on the merger from the [Legal Intelligencer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202797226923/Ballard-Spahr-Grows-to-650-Lawyers-With-Lindquist--Vennum-Deal?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

Lindquist & Vennum managing partner Dennis O’Malley will now be part of Ballard Spahr’s executive team, Stewart said, and a partner from Lindquist & Vennum will also join the compensation committee. In the one market where both firms are present, Denver, the Lindquist & Vennum lawyers will move into Ballard Spahr’s existing office.

Ballard Spahr’s merger with Levine Sullivan, on the other hand, will help bolster the firm’s renowned media and entertainment law practice. Since the firm was founded, Levine Sullivan has represented almost every major newspaper and television network in high-profile cases. Here’s more information from Ballard Spahr’s [press release](http://www.ballardspahr.com/eventsnews/pressreleases/2017-09-12-ballard-spahr-and-levine-sullivan-koch-schulz-to-merge.aspx) announcing the merger:

LSKS has been at the vanguard in representing the media in many of the most significant and consequential First Amendment cases in recent years. Last month, the firm achieved dismissal in federal court of a defamation suit brought against The New York Times by former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. LSKS also helped the Associated Press obtain the release of sealed documents in the Bill Cosby sexual assault cases; successfully defended NBCUniversal in a defamation suit brought by George Zimmerman, the man acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin; and succeeded in reversing a jury verdict against the estate of famed Navy SEAL Chris Kyle in a case brought by Jesse Ventura following the publication of Kyle’s best-selling book American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History.

Congratulations to Ballard Spahr on this exciting merger news. Who knows, with all of the extra cash coming in, the firm might finally decide to make the move to the $180,000 salary scale — and even if the firm isn’t willing to go that high, a smaller raise could still be in order. As it stands, the firm’s Philadelphia office, its largest, has a starting salary of $150,000. Last summer, Stewart said he had [no intention of raising salaries for first-year associates](https://bol.bna.com/180k-associates-not-at-this-firm-says-chair/) because the firm “could never explain it to the clients,” but with these changes on the horizon, perhaps the firm’s pastures will become a little greener for associates.

Most people understand that the wheels of justice move slowly and that it can take a very long time for some lawsuits to resolve. Indeed, it is very common for lawsuits to take several years to reach a resolution from the filing of the complaint to settlement, trial, or another kind of disposition. Recently, I was speaking with a colleague who was handling a lawsuit that has been going on for seven or eight years and showed no signs of slowing down. The conversation made me think of some ancient lawsuits I handled in the past and why some litigation matters take so long to resolve.

When I was a “street lawyer” earlier in my career, I had up to 44 litigation matters I primary managed. Of those cases, I believe that I had two matters that were over 10 years old (although thankfully, both of the matters resolved many years ago). One litigation matter was a case that had spent an incredible amount of time in hibernation, which mostly explained why it had taken so long to resolve.

The case was complicated, and it involved numerous defendants. This usually adds to the time it takes a case to resolve since each of the defendants needs to be deposed and also needs to go through the motions of the litigation process, which can add months or years to the time it takes a matter to be resolved. Unfortunately, one of the defendants passed away during the pendency of the litigation, which complicated matters. An estate needed to be established for the deceased party, and eventually, the executor of the estate for this deceased party was substituted into the case for the party who had passed away.

Later in the case, one of the defendants declared bankruptcy, which again created complications. The case needed to be stalled again so that matters with the bankruptcy entity could be resolved. Eventually the case against the bankrupt entity was severed so the matter could continue against the other defendants, and this required motion practice that required months of patience since the jurisdiction in which the case was venue was extremely slow.

By the time the case was ready for a resolution, people had difficulty locating stakeholders to the matter as well as documents and information relevant to the lawsuit. Some defendants were genuinely shocked that this case had continued for so long and could barely remember what the matter had been about. I believe the matter went for around a dozen years before reaching a resolution, and four or five attorneys at our firm had passed the file around as people joined and left our shop.

I had another matter that lasted for over a decade, and this length of time was attributable to other factors. This other matter was initiated when I was a freshman in high school, and landed on my desk in my sophomore year as a practicing attorney. The case had a number of defendants and concerned some complicated matters. The paper discovery in this case was intense and the deposition transcripts were just about as thick as I have ever seen for a transcript.

Sometime when I was in college, the matter had been appealed to the intermediate appellate court in our jurisdiction. This added a few years to the case since the matter needed to be appealed, briefed, argued, and, finally, the appellate court needed to render a decision. Eventually, the trial court needed to arrange proceedings that were ordered by the higher court. Another reason why the case lasted so long was that an additional party was joined years into the lawsuit, and the parties needed to go through the motions of amending the pleadings and allowing the new party to proceed with discovery to the extent not already exchanged between the other parties.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
By the time I left that firm, the case was still going strong against a few of the defendants. It was only years later that the case was finally resolved. Whenever court officers read the index number for that matter and realized that the case had been filed shortly after Y2K, they would gasp. However, none of the court officers, attorneys, or any of the parties seemed to be in a particular hurry to resolve the case anytime soon.

I would love to hear from other attorneys about marathon cases they handled in their own practices, and, of course, working on cases that have been kicking around for a dozen years or more is relatively rare in the legal profession. However, there are a few ways that lawsuits can get slowed down in the mud of jurisprudence, and this can make it so that lawsuits take much more time than usual to reach a resolution.

# Exploring A Lateral Litigation Partner Move
## Moving from a smaller firm to a larger one can give you with the opportunity to exponentially grow your practice.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on lateral partner moves from [Lateral Link’s](http://laterallink.com/) team of expert contributors. [Jonathan Birenbaum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanbirenbaum) is a Senior Director at Lateral Link, where he specializes in the recruitment of partners, counsel, associates and groups for law firms and attorneys for in-house counsel roles with corporate law departments in the New York area, the U.S., Canada and internationally.

As a Senior Director with Lateral Link, I have assisted many partners in career choices and in lateral moves. I like to think of my role as an objective consultant and advisor, with a cache of experience and lessons learned to share with my candidates. I’d like to discuss one recent lateral move that took place last year, as it was unique and challenging and may provide useful teachings for others contemplating a similar move.

In April 2015, I started a professional relationship with an up-and-coming, bright commercial litigation partner with a boutique firm in Manhattan. He had an impressive background, cutting his teeth with an Am Law 50 firm, and had a diverse set of cases under his belt. The partner had a solid book of portable business, and represented a key international entertainment company, along with a number of other clients that had given him repeat litigation business over the years. Although the boutique had been a great experience, the time was right to start exploring other options. We worked together for several months to map the market of AmL aw and boutique firms in New York, assess the relative pros and cons of potential suitors, and finalize his business plan. Then he was ready to pull the trigger. He authorized me to present him to firms that we thought would see him as an attractive candidate and offer synergies.

By May 2016, the candidate had received comparable partner offers from a bi-coastal full-service firm known for its top-shelf entertainment practice (“Firm A”) and an Am Law 100 firm (“Firm B”) to which we had moved a litigation group earlier in the year. The candidate felt that his practice fit better with Firm A and he was inclined to accept their offer. Then a wrinkle appeared: Firm A proposed a potential merger with the partner candidate’s entire boutique firm, and assured the candidate that the firm was still interested in hiring him individually if the merger did not come to fruition.

We were feeling good about his situation and strategized about whether the candidate should accept the individual offer, which was his preference, or enter the merger talks, which he understood would create a new issues and would likely prolong his transition to a new firm. He agreed that it made sense to explore the merger but was concerned about how long it would take for Firm A and his firm to share financial information and perform the kind of due diligence it takes to conclude that there was a business case for the combination. My experience has taught me that momentum can be key, so we wanted to make sure both parties stayed focused.

The merger talks ended unsuccessfully in August 2016. While the candidate still had two pending offers, he was not happy about the amount of time that had elapsed and decided that we should explore if there might be an additional firm that we could approach and that might provide him with an even more sensible option for him and his clients. We agreed that I should inform Firm B that he was not going to accept their offer, but we would continue the friendly conversation with Firm A as we forged ahead with new possibilities.

We identified a West Coast-based Am Law 200 firm (“Firm C”) that was looking to grow its litigation group in New York. Firm C also has an office in Asia and would provide the partner with a very strong IP and entertainment platform. Furthermore, one of the partner’s law school friends was a partner with the firm’s key West Coast office. To that end, we were able to cobble together my market intelligence and experience along with his friend’s view from “inside the fort.” After several meetings, including a fly out to the West Coast headquarters, we told Firm A that the partner had an offer on the table but that, based on the relative strengths of the latest firm to the table, he preferred to join Firm C.

By having thoroughly explored three different individual options and a merger opportunity, the partner candidate felt comfortable with the information he received as well as the comparison between the firms. This is a key point—when testing the waters, one should explore a few options within the desired space. As much of this process is subjective, meetings with key partners and decision makers go a long way.

The partner made another strong case to Firm C and, after clearing conflicts, they responded with an offer. After a brief period of communicating with his clients about his intention to move his practice to a larger international firm, as well as the negotiation of compensation and bonus, the partner accepted the offer and started with the firm just after the new year.

There were brief periods of trepidation for both the candidate and myself during the exploration process, particularly when he and his partners were in merger talks. To both of our credit, we never stopped communicating about what the partner wanted to achieve in his next move. While there were some sticky moments, I was very confident that the candidate was going to find the right firm and the right fit for him, his family and his practice. I believe that we accomplished this goal.

During the past two years, we have seen strong demand for commercial and specialty litigation practices from Am Law mid-market law firms, as well as from multi-practice national and New York City area full-service boutique firms. Many of these firms have their sights set on adding:

- up-and-coming litigation partners or counsel with solid levels of portable business in the $500,000 to $1M range, and
- groups of litigators with strong cumulative revenues to bolster their litigation practices or to better compete against firms with comparable litigation practice mixes.
Making a move from a smaller firm to a larger one can provide you with the opportunity to exponentially grow your current practice via cross-selling, introductions, and brand name. Such a move may involve exploring parallel opportunities with multiple firms until you find the one that works best for you. The lateral partner hiring process can involve intricacies and challenges that require patience, persistence and creative solutions. A trusted and experienced recruiter can provide guidance as well as creative solutions throughout the experience.

# Add Another Firm To The Cravath Match List
## And a bonus payout in the 2018 calendar year too.

As November winds down, a few more Biglaw firms are getting their bonus match announcements out as part of the industry’s early train. Does an early announcement make any substantive difference? Not really, but it speaks to the management’s responsiveness and commitment to some transparency with associates, both of which are nice intangibles for a firm to project.

So we can go ahead and add Willkie Farr to the list of November bonus firms. This morning, the firm informed its New York, Washington, and Houston associates that they will be receiving bonuses to match their peers across the market.

Here’s the scale again:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
2018 $15,000 (pro-rated)
2017 $15,000
2016 $25,000
2015 $50,000
2014 $65,000
2013 $80,000
2012 $90,000
2011 $100,000
2010 and senior $100,000

Bonuses will be paid on December 21, which is also a nice gesture in an age where firms increasingly try to push bonuses into the new year and leave associates holding the holiday expense bag until they finally see their money.

Congrats to the Willkie Farr gang. The full memo is available on the next page.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Today's A Great Day For Some Biglaw Associate Raises

It seems like such a long time ago that Milbank shocked the world of Biglaw and raised salaries — we were so much younger and innocent then. But in reality, it’s only been 10 days, but the matches (and those that’ve come over the top) have been much slower than in previous salary wars. But with the addition of Simpson Thacher special bonuses and Cravath coming over the top for senior associates, the market has seemingly (finally) coalesced around the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale.

Now the deluge of raise announcements can begin in earnest.

The latest firm to get on the good ship associate raises is Willkie Farr. With these raises (and bonuses), the firm is placing itself at the top of the Biglaw pile. And they matched early enough in the process that associates are happy, but not so early they’re market leaders or at risk of being outdone by prevailing market forces.

The UC Berkeley Law School Dean, [Sujit Choudhry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujit_Choudhry), along with the UC Board of Regents, has been sued by his executive assistant for sexual harassment.

Tyann Sorrell, who is currently on leave from her position, filed suit yesterday against Dean Choudhry, alleging that he repeatedly hugged, kissed, and touched her. The complaint details a series of escalatory behaviors that made Sorrell feel anxious and depressed until she felt she had no choice but to go on leave.

According to the complaint, the harassment began shortly after Choudhry took over the position of dean. It started with “bear hugs,” then Choudhry added in kisses and that old creepy standby, massages. The complaint alleges the escalation of physical intimacy began to take its toll on plaintiff:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Choudhry’s kissing and hugging plaintiff was a near daily occurrence. Choudhry’s conduct made plaintiff feel disgusted, humiliated, exposed and dirty. She wondered what she had done to make him think it was o.k. for him to touch her.

The complaint also alleges Choudhry made efforts to increase his physical contact with Sorrell:

Choudhry’s hugging and kissing Plaintiff quickly escalated to a near daily occurrence. At times, it occurred multiple times per day. At the same time, the hugs became tighter and more lingering and the kissing more intimate in that over time Choudhry’s kisses began to land closer and closer to Plaintiff’s lips. Choudhry also began kissing Plaintiff on the forehead.

Listen, I’m a hugger, very comfortable sharing a quick embrace with those I spend a lot of time with. But this? This seems icky. No boss ever ever needs to kiss a woman on the forehead. Besides the intimacy of it all, it strikes me as incredibly paternalistic and demeaning. And the complaint reads as though Choudhry was priming Sorrell to accept more and more physical contact — way beyond what she was comfortable with and beyond anything that was necessary for her job.

The plaintiff alleges she was intimidated by Choudhry and his behavior, and at first was hesitant to report anything:

Choudhry has a temper and was known for berating and being rude and dismissive of employees when they upset him or when things did not go his way. Choudhry would often say that if a person is not happy or if they feel that things are unfair in their workplace, they should leave and find another job.

According to the court filing, despite this reluctance she made several complaints throughout her time working for Choudhry to the Chiefs of Staff, but no action was taken until she directly confronted Choudhry via email and forwarded that communication on to HR.

As KTVU [reports](http://www.ktvu.com/news/102914394-story), the behavior was eventually investigated by the school, and he was disciplined, though not to the plaintiff’s satisfaction:

The suit says the university had concluded that Choudhry violated the sexual harassment policy and “admitted to hugging, kissing, messaging and/or caressing plaintiff at least multiple times per week.” Campus officials ultimately decided to dock the dean’s pay by 10 percent for a year, and he wrote Sorrell a letter of apology, the suit says.

Sorrell said in the suit that she tried “in vain to determine the reasoning” behind Choudhry’s discipline. A campus official later told her that he had “seriously considered terminating the dean but that the reason he had decided not to was because it would ruin the dean’s career, that is, destroy his future chances for higher appointment.”

All of which is how we wind up with this lawsuit. Tyann Sorrell believes Berkeley valued Choudhry’s future career prospects over her physical and mental well being.

According to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/03/09/dean-of-uc-berkeley-school-of-law-sued-for-sexual-harassment/), Berkeley Law officials declined comment on this “personnel issue.”

# Law Firm Merger Mania: Greenberg Traurig Flirts With A British Suitor
## Greenberg Traurig's CEO has criticized mergers with overseas law firms in the past, but could this particular deal make strategic sense?

In an interesting interview last fall with [Bloomberg Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/being-greenberg-traurigs-ceo/), the CEO of [Greenberg Traurig](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/greenberg-traurig/?rf=1), [Richard Rosenbaum](http://www.gtlaw.com/People/Richard-A-Rosenbaum), sounded skeptical notes about growth through international law firm mergers. Discussing GT’s refusal to follow the Biglaw herd, he commented that “the most important [trend] that we didn’t follow was massive growth overseas. It’s our opinion that you are not benefiting clients by having hundreds and hundreds, and sometimes thousands of lawyers, in China or all throughout the world.”

Now, a few months later, Greenberg Traurig is in [merger](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202748713806/Greenberg-Traurig-Confirms-TieUp-Talks-With-British-Firm?cn=20160203&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily%20Breaking%20News&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&slreturn=20160103141103) [talks](https://bol.bna.com/greenberg-traurig-is-in-early-talks-to-tie-up-with-london-law-firm/) with the overseas law firm of [Berwin Leighton Paisner](http://www.blplaw.com/) — a merger that, if consummated, would result in a firm of between 2,500 and 3,000 lawyers (assuming no major layoffs or departures). A firm of such size would be one of the world’s [top 10](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-global-100-the-worlds-top-law-firms-ranked-by-revenue-profit-and-headcount/) in terms of [headcount](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-global-100-the-worlds-top-law-firms-ranked-by-revenue-profit-and-headcount/2/?rf=1).

In fairness to Rosenbaum, he did offer a caveat to his criticism of mergers (emphasis added): “Your clients are not benefited by having firm after firm having thousands of lawyers in these places, unless you are excellent in all these places. And I can assure you that most of the firms that have those massive footprints are not excellent in all those places.”

So would a deal between Greenberg Traurig and Berwin Leighton Paisner result in that sought-after excellence and the ubiquitous business buzzword, “synergy”? Bloomberg [notes](https://bol.bna.com/greenberg-traurig-is-in-early-talks-to-tie-up-with-london-law-firm/) that both firms excel in real estate and are strong in other transactional practices too, including corporate finance, M&A, and private equity. Am Law [sizes up](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202748713806/Greenberg-Traurig-Confirms-TieUp-Talks-With-British-Firm?cn=20160203&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily%20Breaking%20News&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&slreturn=20160103141103) BLP as “a solid, upper midmarket firm with one of the U.K.’s stronger real estate practices,” but notes that “in recent years it has underperformed financially.”

Greenberg Traurig seems to be in an acquisitive mood lately, as reflected in its recent [hiring](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/morning-docket-01-20-16/) of Rudy Giuliani and Marc Mukasey away from Bracewell & Giuliani, where former NYC mayor Giuliani was a name partner. Will Greenberg move forward with the BLP deal? The firm said in a statement that it’s “working to assess the merits of this opportunity over the coming months and, if it moves forward, it will share more information.”

UPDATE (2/4/2016, 10:10 a.m.): There’s a reason why Greenberg Traurig is a [top-ranked law firm for social media use](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/which-firms-are-most-effective-with-social-media/). Last night, CEO Richard Rosenbaum took to Twitter to discuss the possible BLP tie-up with me and Casey Sullivan of Bloomberg:

Rule number two: when everybody else around you is yelling at you, asking you to make it up and condemning you for not making it up, refer to rule number one.""

# Power Niche Marketing: The Third (Marketing) Threebie – Knowledge Is Power

In my last two articles, I explained that when I need to remind myself of the most important basic marketing things to do, I am mindful of the three basic items, which I call the “Threebies.” In my last two articles, I wrote about the first two Threebies”:

The importance of [“being enthusiastic”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/power-niche-marketing-the-second-marketing-threebie-a-very-simple-one/) when marketing and meeting new people.

The importance of [“getting out and about.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/power-niche-marketing-get-out-and-about/)

In this article, I will talk about the last Threebie, which is:

Knowledge is Power

And we all want power, don’t we?

Ultimately, you have to have knowledge of something, or you aren’t that useful. Indeed, when you get right down to it, people, whether or not they are really thinking about it analytically, generally want you around if you are useful or potentially useful to them, and generally don’t really care that much if you are around if you aren’t that useful.

Consider when you were a kid. You were someone everyone wanted to be with because:

You always knew where the party was.

You were smart and could help with homework.

You were a good listener and a good friend type.

You were a girl magnet.

You were a boy magnet.

One way or another, there was something useful about you that made people want to be with you.

Obviously, what we are talking about here is much more sophisticated; however, you are trying to create something of use that makes you worth talking to or having around. For marketing purposes, that “something” is your “knowledge” of a topic that is of interest — or of use — to the people you want to have around you.

How do you get knowledge to have power? I will say now that you should pick an area of the industry in which you work and learn everything there is to know about it, so that you are a complete compendium of useful and cutting-edge information. This of course is what I call a “Power Niche,” as per the various articles I have written and will write.

For example, I am a real estate lawyer. So I read every single thing I can put my hands on pertaining to the real estate industry. Of course, I read the Wall Street Journal, but I also read books, publications, blogs, magazines and everything else I can find that deals with the real estate industry and/or the players in that industry. For example, I have my assistant send me any article on real estate that appears anywhere. That way, I am a wealth of information about real estate. It is astonishing how much I know and keep learning in my real estate niche. I have made myself very useful to be with because I know what everyone is doing and what is going on.

So if you are one of my clients, or someone I hope will be my client someday, it is obvious after speaking to me for a short period of time that I know a ton about the real estate industry and that I am able to provide value to you and I will be an extremely useful source of information, guidance, and advice.

Also, just to be clear, I am not out for “power” in the classic sense, to have the ability to push people around and lord it over my subjects. That simply isn’t my style, and it is not at all what I am talking about here. I am referring to the “power” to be useful. Indeed, it is great to have “power” to help your friends and your clients achieve their goals.

So, the next time you decide to market, remember to “Get Out and About,” to “Be Enthusiastic,” and to relentlessly seek knowledge because “Knowledge is Power.”

There may be a special fourth step or a “Fourbie” as I call it, so stay tuned…

# Things To Do Before You Quit Your Job In The New Year
## It's recommended that you consider your long-range and short-term career goals.

As we approach the end of December and the start of a new year, your mind might be toiling with the idea of moving on to greener pastures in your legal career. You’ve seen the headlines that the job landscape has become a job seeker’s paradise and the year of the “Great Resignation,” with rapid hiring, more room to negotiate higher salaries, and even opportunities for permanent remote work. Before you have one foot out the door, I recommend considering your long-range and short-term career goals, reflecting on your past performance evaluations, and pre-determining your financial requirements.

Consider Your Short-Term and Long-Term Goals

Whenever I consult with a potential client who is considering a career change after a decade or longer at a company or firm, I ask them to carefully consider where they see themselves in the short term and the long term. Most of my clients have been in the professional workforce for 15-plus years, and they are in the C-suite (at a general counsel or chief legal officer role) or positioning themselves for entry into the C-suite as the current second or third in command of the legal department. Your career exit strategy plays as much importance as deciding your next career step. That means considering what to do when you’ve reached the ceiling in your career and how you intend to wind down into retirement. There are several questions to ask yourself:

How long do I want to be in my next role for? Is it going to be the final rung in my career ladder? At what age do I want to retire? How do I want to navigate my retirement strategy? Many lawyers and C-suite leaders in general desire to [obtain a few paid board opportunities](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/how-lawyers-can-prepare-for-and-advance-into-the-boardroom/) as part of their career winddowns. If you’ve been at a company for an extensive period (a decade or two decades, for example), the next shift in your career might be the final stomping ground. What type of company do you envision yourself working for? Does the role encompass a hybrid focus (e.g., chief compliance officer and general counsel)? Do you plan to negotiate a specific term length for the C-suite role? These are important questions to ask and why I always recommend writing down your five-, 10-, and 15-year [career plans](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/creating-an-effective-career-management-strategy/).

Review Past Performance Evaluations

Performance evaluations are also intricate pieces of your career trajectory — they provide an enormous amount of self-diagnosing into your goals, objectives, and accomplishments. They also provide feedback from your executive counterparts and give terrific insight into things you’ve done well (which should be highlighted in your resume and LinkedIn profile) as they apply to your soft and hard skills. I always suggest reviewing your past performance evaluations as a starting place to understand the biggest projects you’ve led or undertaken and how those experiences are viewed by your executive counterparts. Performance evaluations provide important ingredients for future career recipe success. Always keep a copy of your past evaluations — you never know when you will need to review them and reflect on specific transactions or projects you’ve led. Performance evaluations are also a good starting point if you haven’t updated your resume for many years.

Before making the decision to depart from a company, consider how your bonus structure works and what you would be potentially giving up if you were to leave before you receive your bonus. Most company bonuses are paid out at the end of Q1 or in the late summer. Consider whether a shift into a new industry (healthcare, technology, manufacturing, etc.) can equate to new financial opportunities for higher earning power, or even the shift from a start-up to a well-established and mature company. The key is to always do your due diligence, make a pros and cons list, and weigh things carefully. I’ve witnessed clients shift from Biglaw to in-house with a sharp decrease in their initial pay yet acquire a larger playing field for fast-track career growth to other opportunities. I’ve also witnessed clients shift from a general counsel position at a private equity company to a deputy general counsel role at a publicly traded company with a five-year succession plan for the general counsel seat. The key is to determine what the five- to 10-year plan will look like for you at the subsequent company.

Remember, January is a time of abundance for career opportunities — as you begin to wrap up the final weeks of this year, don’t leave your career goals or your resume and LinkedIn profile out there in the dark.

# Law Firm Merger Activity Expected To Increase Thanks To Recession Fears
## Nothing like financial fears to get a firm ready for a merger.

We expect to see additional mergers announced in Q4 (although some may not be effective until 2023), and robust activity into next year.

— An excerpt from the latest Fairfax Associates report on law firm mergers in 2022, as detailed in the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/03/law-firm-mergers-still-below-average-but-robust-activity-expected-soon/). The report notes that law firm mergers remain below average, with 37 total mergers through 2022. Kristin Stark, a law firm consultant and principal at Fairfax, explained that recessions can help firms open up to merger possibilities when they perhaps weren’t as receptive beforehand. “There’s a lot of good reasons why firms start to explore mergers in a recession,” she said.

# How Strategic Listening Can Bolster Your Practice
## From intake to advocacy, this tough professional skill is essential for success. An interactive course from PLI will help you master it.

While lectures will always have their place in CLE, many attorneys would no doubt welcome a fresh program, one that mixes learning styles and uses engaging, interactive techniques to aid retention.

[“Strategic Listening for Lawyers,”](https://www.pli.edu/programs/Strategic-Listening-for-Lawyers?t=ondemand&p=369476&tCode=CNS2_ATL02&utm_source=ATL02&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) an on-demand CLE produced by the Practising Law Institute’s Interactive Learning Center, is one such program. 

Presented by Alicia Aiken, a principal at the Danu Center for Strategic Advocacy, the program uses presentations, scenarios, and sets of interactive questions to explain, illustrate, and reinforce important concepts related to strategic listening. This blended approach holds learners’ attention by varying the tone and tempo throughout the program, and by using narrative techniques as well as that classic retention tool — the quiz.

In the first of her brief presentations, Aiken calls strategic listening “one of the toughest professional skills for [an attorney] to master.” 

She explains that it’s important to identify  three types of listening, each requiring a different skill set: 1) listening to discover, 2) listening to partner, and 3) listening to advocate.

The program moves beyond just talking heads, with professionally acted and produced — yet highly plausible — scenarios. The first scene shows an attorney’s initial meeting with a client, when the attorney should be listening to discover. 

The character — her name is Terry — unfortunately does not do well. She repeatedly interrupts her client and doesn’t truly hear what the woman is trying to express, a disappointing outcome when the goal is to uncover information and build rapport.

An interactive set of questions follows this scene, reinforcing the lesson and engaging the viewer. A feedback section goes over the answers, another effective reinforcement and retention technique. Participants are  immersed in a narrative that is threaded with practical tips to improve strategic listening, including the importance of deferring judgment.

The second type of strategic listening is listening to partner. Understanding this skill requires a nuanced transition. This time, a set of interactive questions is offered before the narrative scene, which helps viewers shift from the earlier topic and begin thinking about a new set of problems.

Aiken notes that when listening to partner, the attorney begins to share the floor but does not command the stage. Space must be left for the client to reveal new information.

This section also notes the four steps in transition, culminating in an agreement as to what will happen next. Among the tips Aiken offers, she says the hardest may be to manage emotions — the attorney’s as well as the client’s.

“It’s normal to get frustrated if you don’t perceive that the session is productive, but giving in to emotions isn’t helpful,” Aiken says.

The last kind of strategic listening is listening to advocate, which can be objections in the courtroom, depositions, or adversarial interviews on behalf of the client. “Classic lawyer stuff,” says Aiken.

Listening to advocate is about controlling the agenda and listening to others with the intention to preempt, respond, and integrate. Multitasking is not only recommended, but necessary. 

Attorneys must read the room. They must get a sense of the best time to interrupt. Too late, and they risk having the client reveal privileged information. Too soon, and the attorney lacks authority, like jumping the gun on a hearsay objection.

The final scene in the case narrative shows a deposition nearly crumbling into disaster, where the client identifies more with opposing counsel than her own attorney. But Terry — the attorney learning to listen — regains control of the agenda in the end by skillfully managing emotions, both hers and the clients.

Though listening is essential for legal work, few lawyers are taught to do it well. This program highlights the concrete actions attorneys should take to succeed with strategic listening — without sacrificing zealous advocacy.

# Biglaw's 4-Day Mandatory Office Week Is A Big Gamble
## And the Supreme Court's ethical problems just won't go away.

Biglaw has always played follow-the-leader. Usually it’s about bonuses, but Skadden is taking a big gamble that the rest of the industry [will follow it back to a Monday-Thursday office work week](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/). If the rest of Biglaw doesn’t follow suit, the giant sucking sound you hear will be Skadden talent lateraling to rival firms. Also the Supreme Court’s ethical follies continued with John Roberts teasing a secret plan to [cure its ethical woes](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/john-roberts-supreme-court-ethical-failure/), while Gibson Dunn took a turn as legal industry laughing stock with [a shoddily researched letter on behalf of Harlan Crow](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/harlan-crow-gibson-dunn-senate-letter-clarence-thomas/). And the Court sided with a grandmother after the county stole $25,000 from her… but [dig a little deeper and her case wasn’t as sympathetic as it looked](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/it-turns-out-you-cant-steal-25k-from-old-ladies-according-to-supreme-court/).

# World's Most Fortunate Pro Se Litigant Represented By Judge Posner Now Also Represented By David Boies
## As the case moves to the Supreme Court, William Bond adds even more firepower.

David Boies

This story needs one of those “Individual Results May Vary” disclaimers. Because when you launch a pro se case against the government, your case probably won’t resemble William Bond’s. Bond managed to get Judge Richard Posner to volunteer to assist him, and subsequently represent him after the Fourth Circuit stupidly demanded that Posner and co-counsel Matthew Dowd, not Bond, sign their names to the brief [eviscerating the federal judiciary](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/judge-posner-files-first-brief-since-leaving-the-bench-lights-into-federal-judiciary/) for its terminally flawed pro se process.

Now that the Fourth Circuit kicked the case in a [remarkably lazy opinion](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/judge-posner-loses-appeal-in-laughably-lazy-fourth-circuit-opinion/), Bond is looking to take the fight to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it looks like he’s got David Boies on his side now.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Some pro se litigants get all the breaks!

In a motion filed Friday afternoon, Bond seeks an extension to file his cert petition. But in a surprising twist, the motion is signed by David Boies, with Boies Schiller’s Joanna Wright and Emily Harris also listed on the papers. Judge Posner and Dowd are still featured as part of the team, but it appears as though Boies is taking the lead as counsel of record at this stage based on his experience with Supreme Court advocacy.

Getting a cert petition picked up is a little bit of alchemy, but a motion featuring both Boies and Judge Posner on the cover should raise more than a few eyebrows in the cert pool.

Stay tuned, because I hear the test tube clone of Clarence Darrow wants in on this matter next.

# ChatGPT Accused Mayor Of Bribery Conviction, Faces Potential Defamation Claim
## Do robots dream of libelously claiming you molest electric sheep?

It was all fun and games when [ChatGPT proclaimed Clarence Thomas the hero of same-sex equality](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/chatgpt-crowns-clarence-thomas-as-champion-of-gay-rights-in-feedback-loop-of-stupid/) or botching legal research memos by [inventing fake law](https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/131658119/the-curious-case-of-chatgpt-and-the-fictitious-legal-notes), but now the public-facing AI tool’s penchant for hallucination has earned its creators [a threatened lawsuit](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/openai-may-be-sued-after-chatgpt-falsely-says-aussie-mayor-is-an-ex-con/).

Australian regional mayor Brian Hood once worked for a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Australia and blew the whistle on a bribery scheme. But since tools like ChatGPT haven’t mastered contextual nuance, Hood’s attorneys claim the system spit out the claim that Hood went to prison for bribery as opposed to being the guy who notified authorities. Hood’s team gave OpenAI a month to cure the problem or face a suit.

Ars Technica has tried to replicate the mistake but so far their test results came back correct:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Ars attempted to replicate the error using ChatGPT, though, and it seems possible that OpenAI has fixed the errors as Hood’s legal team has directed. When Ars asked ChatGPT if Hood served prison time for bribery, ChatGPT responded that Hood “has not served any prison time” and clarified that “there is no information available online to suggest that he has been convicted of any criminal offense.” Ars then asked if Hood had ever been charged with bribery, and ChatGPT responded, “I do not have any information indicating that Brian Hood, the current mayor of Hepburn Shire in Victoria, Australia, has been charged with bribery.”

But even if everything really has worked out for Hood, it’s only a matter of time before the system does this again. In the United States, robotic ramblings about political figures would lack actual malice and Section 230 would apply to the extent it just displays third-party statements — both obstacles for at least a few more months before this Supreme Court does something bonkers — but there’s not much to stop an algorithm from completely hallucinating misinformation about non-public figures with the imprimatur of authority.

It’s easy to dismiss the efforts of entertainment-level tools like ChatGPT. As of 2023, it’s hard to imagine a jury endorsing the idea that anyone takes GPT output without a 50-pound bag of salt. But when AI presents itself as conveying the accumulated knowledge and then gets that knowledge wrong or recklessly repeats misinformation, people are going to look around to exact a pound of flesh from somewhere and lawsuits are spendy even if they don’t end up going anywhere.

A standalone tool can likely cover itself in disclaimers shunting even the whiff of liability off on anyone dumb enough to use its results without verification. But these models won’t stop with standalone products and they’ll get integrated into other systems where the disclaimer gets blurrier. What happens if the algorithm aids a search engine and promotes dubious third-party claims over accurate ones? Has the algorithm taken an affirmative act to increase the publicity of the false claim?

It all comes back to [the importance of giving users insight into an algorithm’s reasoning](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/casetext-cocounsel-ai-tool/). We’re still in the “show your work” stage of GPT’s education and the primary technological task of the next few years will be keeping these language models from inadvertently screwing everything up. And that’s going to require human judgment and that’s going to require user interfaces providing genuine transparency. Because disclaimers not to take results at face value don’t mean much without the easy ability to check up on the system.

# Clerkship Bonus Raises: Three Is A Trend
## Raising clerkship bonuses in the wake of the Biglaw base salary raises makes a lot of sense.

Here’s a question we recently received from a law student reader:

Obviously everyone who is at these firms is thrilled about [associate salary raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). Any indication that they will also affect clerkship bonuses though? I realize it’s kind of a niche issue, but if clerkship bonuses stay the same then the opportunity cost of clerking just increased by $20K, which is nothing to shake a stick at when you have six figures of debt.

A very good point — and one apparently recognized by [Susman Godfrey](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/susman-godfrey/), one of the nation’s top litigation boutiques (in fact, the top litigation boutique, [according to Vault](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-law-firms-in-each-practice-area/?sRankID=276&rYear=2016)). From a [press release](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/clerkship-bonus-raises-three-is-a-trend/2/) the firm just issued:

National litigation boutique Susman Godfrey LLP has announced that it will be paying larger bonuses to lawyers for federal judicial clerkships. Effective immediately (and applying retroactively to all lawyers who start at the firm this Fall), Susman Godfrey will pay incoming lawyers an $80,000 clerkship bonus if they clerked for one federal judge, and a total of $100,000 in bonuses if they clerked for more than one federal judge.

That $80,000 clerkship bonus is one of the highest around. It beats the $50,000 that’s the standard rate for most Biglaw firms, as well as the $75,000 that [Quinn Emanuel announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/clerkship-bonus-watch-will-75k-become-the-new-standard/) in January.

This is, by the way, the third clerkship bonus hike that we’ve covered this year. In addition to Quinn Emanuel, the Denver-based litigation boutique of Wheeler Trigg O’Donnell LLP [raised to $60,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/another-firm-raises-its-clerkship-bonus-is-this-a-trend-in-the-making/) in April. So as we’ve said before, both in the [compensation context](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/3-makes-a-trend-new-york-market-really-is-180k/) and [outside of it](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1), three makes a trend.

Why is Susman making this move? From their press release:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The firm, which currently has nine former Supreme Court clerks, only hires lawyers who have clerked for federal judges. Firm founder Steve Susman states, “Requiring our new lawyers to have completed a federal clerkship assures that they have unique insight into how judges work and are able to make smart decisions in deciding what cases to take on.”

Co-Managing Partner Neal Manne adds, “These increased clerkship bonuses reflect our continuing commitment to hiring and retaining the best, brightest and most capable young lawyers.”

The enhanced clerkship bonuses definitely increase the allure of Susman to lawyers coming out of clerkships. Other attractions: cutting-edge work, brilliant colleagues, [big bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-susman-godfrey-are-these-the-best-bonuses-of-the-season/), and a [short partnership track](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/associate-bonus-watch-susman-godfrey-2/).

Of course, as we’ve noted before, it’s not easy to get a job at Susman. The firm hires only former federal law clerks.[[1]](#f1) And a federal clerkship is necessary but not sufficient to get a job at the firm; Susman is looking for [candidates who really stand out](http://thecareerist.typepad.com/thecareerist/2011/02/susman-qa.html).

Will this series of recent clerkship bonus hikes, combined with the raises in base salaries, cause a major Biglaw firm to go beyond $50,000? That’s surely the hope among the many law students and young lawyers who want to perform the public service of clerking but have huge student loans.

We expect that a large firm will make a move before too long. If and when you hear of a firm raising its clerkship bonus — or bonuses, plural, for multiple clerkships — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Clerkship%20Bonus%20Watch:%20%5BFirm%20Name%5D) (subject line: “Clerkship Bonus Watch: [Firm Name]”) or text us (646-820-8477).

P.S. What about those gigantic [bonuses for Supreme Court clerks?](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/supreme-court-clerkship-bonuses/) Per its press release, “Susman Godfrey will continue to pay the going bonus rate to lawyers who clerk for the United States Supreme Court.” What is that going rate? We’ve heard that $330,000, which was [slowly gaining traction](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/09/supreme-court-clerk-hiring-watch-into-2016-we-go-plus-scotus-clerk-bonus-news/) two years ago, is now standard. If you can provide us with (anonymous) information on which firms now pay $330K (or more), please [reach out](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=SCOTUS%20Clerk%20Bonuses) (subject line: “SCOTUS Clerk Bonuses”).

(Flip to the next page to read the complete [Susman Godfrey press release](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/clerkship-bonus-raises-three-is-a-trend/2/).)

[ [1]](#reff1) Susman’s requirement of at least one year of clerkship experience is why its [base salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prestigious-litigation-boutique-announces-nationwide-salary-raises-to-190k/) is effectively a Cravath match. As noted in the update to our [post about their recent raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/prestigious-litigation-boutique-announces-nationwide-salary-raises-to-190k/?rf=1), a “first-year” at Susman is a “second-year” elsewhere.

# Associates Billing Their Butts Off Until Biglaw Bonus Season Begins

Could today be the day that kicks off the 2016 Biglaw bonus season? Based on your responses to our survey, the answer, unfortunately, is probably not. Only 5 percent of survey respondents thought this year’s Biglaw bonus bonanza would begin before Thanksgiving, as it did in 2014, when Simpson Thacher announced its bonuses [ahead of the holiday](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/) (and perhaps even more notably, ahead of Cravath).

When do you think 2016 bonuses will be announced?

- First full week of December (55%, 565 Votes)
- Last week of November / first two days of December (40%, 411 Votes)
- Before Thanksgiving (5%, 51 Votes)
Total Voters: 1,027

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Based on past precedent, it seems much more likely that bonuses will be announced on either Monday, November 28, or Monday, December 5. Cravath tends to stick a schedule as far as these things are concerned, and in recent years, it has announced its bonus news on either the last Monday in November or the first Monday in December. Either way, Biglaw associates can soon look forward to their bank accounts being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkeys they’ll gobble down tomorrow.

While associates are busy counting down the hours until B-Day, they’re likely even busier counting up the hours they’re on track to bill in 2016 to meet their targets for bonus eligibility. Earlier this year, many firms announced increased billing requirements to go hand in hand with their increased salaries, and some associates have been scrambling to make up the difference. That being said, a whopping 65 percent of survey respondents are on track to bill 2000 hours or more in 2016.

Here are the full results from our survey:

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2016?

- More than 2400 (18%, 281 Votes)
- 2000 - 2099 (18%, 273 Votes)
- 1900 - 1999 (13%, 205 Votes)
- 2100 - 2199 (13%, 203 Votes)
- 2200 - 2299 (9%, 144 Votes)
- 1800 - 1899 (7%, 110 Votes)
- Fewer than 1600 (7%, 102 Votes)
- 2300 - 2399 (7%, 101 Votes)
- 1700 - 1799 (4%, 54 Votes)
- 1600 - 1699 (3%, 50 Votes)
Total Voters: 1,523

Remember these strong numbers when bonuses begin to hit bank accounts. You may have worked your Biglaw bums off, but almost 75 percent of survey respondents thought that this year’s bonuses would be no different than last year’s bonuses. Keep this in mind: Instead of complaining, be thankful that your salary is larger than it ever was before and that you’re receiving very generous bonuses on top of it.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish — including, of course, the first such announcement.

Keep your fingers crossed for happy bonus news this season! Happy Thanksgiving!

# The Ransomware Attack On Your Firm Is Coming And You're Probably Not Prepared
## Ransomware is on the rise and firms need to take it more seriously.

It’s a healthy instinct to harbor a good deal of skepticism in this world. That holds doubly true when it comes to the style of overhyped, “Which brand of soda will give your kids syphilis?” headlines that local news outlets use to stir up anxious suburbanites. So when discussing the threat of cyberattack, it’s easy to dismiss the constant barrage of threatening headlines — not unlike the headline to this article — as overblown.

Unfortunately, clients and law firms would do so at their peril. While anonymous cyberattacks may not be the biggest threat out there — getting cheated by your own is still more prevalent — its unpredictability makes it more terrifying.

There was a day when firms and clients had to worry about hackers invading their systems to steal sensitive business data and sell it to the highest bidder. But today, the easiest assault on a computer system is ransomware — a debilitating attack where an anonymous belligerent forces you to pay them to get your system back.

And it’s not a problem that only plagues large firms. Smaller firms can also become a repository of sensitive data, from corporate intellectual property to personal financial information used in writing wills and trusts. Nobody’s immune.

Indeed, ransomware doesn’t even need to find some sensitive data. Newer attacks go after the master boot record and basically brick computers until the owner pays the ransom. Who needs a specific file when threatening to grind billable hours to a halt for days on end does the trick?

Why has ransomware become the primary cyber threat out there? Antonio Challita, Director of Product Management at [CyberSight](https://cybersight.com), points to four primary factors:

1) Payment: The key to any transaction is finding the buyer most interested in what you’re selling. When it comes to stolen goods, who could want those goods more than the person who got robbed in the first place? Shopping illicit merchandise around the dark web introduces more players and more risk, while dealing with one party greatly improves the odds of getting paid quickly and quietly.

2) The US Government: It’s not that the government itself is launching ransomware attacks, but in 2017, Shadow Brokers gave the world access to the tools the NSA had been using to break into Windows devices. It’s the government investment backing this technology that made it so powerful. The WannaCry attack [was born of these tools](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/is-your-firm-vulnerable-to-the-recent-ransomware-attack/) and the Petya attack the next month managed to [cripple some Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/global-biglaw-firm-paralyzed-by-new-ransomware-attack/).

3) Cryptocurrencies: Thanks to a bunch of libertarian-minded tech nerds, we’ve now got a virtually untraceable means of exchange that hackers can request to make their getaway complete. According to Challita, some ransomware attacks even come with a guide instructing the clueless company or firm on how to set up a wallet and purchase the appropriate cryptocurrency. How helpful!

4) Ransomware as a service: The check on cyberattacks used to be the tech savvy of the criminal. Today, enterprising techies have built a new business allowing any fraudster with a dream to join the exciting world of cybercrime. The Dark Web boasts a few services allowing someone interested in launching an attack against a vulnerable target to acquire a new, previously unseen ransomware variant that no anti-virus service is prepared to detect. The service provider will also give the customer all the phishing leads they need to dupe someone into kicking things into motion. All they ask in return is a share of the profits, usually around 30 percent.

All these people need is an unupdated Windows device and a dream.

Attacks usually enter the system through a pfishing email, fooling someone into clicking on a zip file or pdf or some other file that kicks off a sequence of events that results in opening the door for the malicious program, but these are by no means the only points of entry. USB drives with a bad case of computerized gonorrhea are another dangerous vector that can easily befall attorneys, but the most threatening for firms has to be a vulnerability in remote desktop applications. Remotely accessing an office desktop is part of the daily business routine for many lawyers, but these access points aren’t always kept secure — and some 10 million computers broadcast open ports — which are easily searchable — at any given moment. Once an open port is identified via search engine, it just takes a brute force password checker to get into the system and give the attacker the run of your computer — and by extension, network.

Staying ahead of these attacks requires vigilance and strategic thinking. Keeping systems up-to-date with the latest patches keeps hackers from leveraging known exploits and antivirus software can keep a constant eye out for the electronic signatures of known attacks. Training employees not to do incredibly dumb stuff, like open obviously fake emails is a smart move too. But one option that Challita and CyberSight focus on that many companies don’t think about is taking a proactive approach to policing the network.

While antivirus software monitors for the signatures of known threats, it can’t deal in real-time with fresh, first impression attacks like those constantly evolving in the Dark Web incubators. That’s why Challita recommends a behavior-based security approach that uses machine learning to identify threats based on what the file is trying to accomplish. If an email attachment tries to get at a huge number of files quickly, or an unexpected file starts encrypting files, a behavior-based approach can reach out and shut it down, placing a quarantine on the suspicious file until someone can check it out.

Cyberattacks just aren’t science fiction anymore. But recognizing the need to take steps now, before an attack, to keep themselves and their clients secure, can save a firm from becoming the next embarrassing headline.

Wait until HR hears about this.

Above the Law is great for figuring out what the market rate for working Biglaw is, but trust that we’re more than a one-trick pony. We should also be your go-to if you’d like to learn more about the culture of the places you’re thinking about submitting a resume to.

Take Ince [for example](https://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/blogs/ince-in-firing-line-over-inappropriate-restaurant-behaviour-allegations/):

[Ince ](https://www.legal500.com/firms/1690-ince/263-london-england/)has launched a formal internal investigation after a viral tweet from a Cardiff restaurant owner claimed a group of its lawyers had behaved inappropriately towards a waitress.

Here is the tweet:

I’m not clout chasing or looking for likes.

I just think we should start calling out rich people who think they can treat people like crap [pic.twitter.com/sN5wplXDed](https://t.co/sN5wplXDed)

— 𝕃𝕖𝕖 𝕊𝕜𝕖𝕖𝕥 (@leeskeet) [May 4, 2022](https://twitter.com/leeskeet/status/1521981595447701506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Thankfully, Ince has responded with a quick handling of the situation. While sexual harassment may be a selling point for presidential candidates, it is a clear no-go in the quarters of the world where basic human decency is still expected of those participating in civil society. It is a blessing to know that we seem to be moving away from a Mad Men-esque normalization of harassment being a thing you grin and bear. Across the pond at least.

A spokesperson for Ince said: ‘The company has been made aware of allegations in the media in relation to senior staff attending a dinner on Wednesday evening. The independent directors have therefore initiated a formal investigation. Whilst it is ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment further.’

Accountability must be rough for the perpetrators though:



Good riddance.

Please tip your wait staff. Remember that if they smile at you they probably aren’t flirting — it is their job to be nice to you, after all.  And if your boss is a jerk at an upscale Jamaican restaurant, let us know via [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BBad%20Behavior%5D).

# Indiana Tech Law School To Close, Citing $20 Million In Losses
## Will other law schools close in its wake?

Indiana Tech School of Law opened its doors in 2013, amid cries that the state had [no need for another law school](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/01/how-many-law-schools-can-you-fit-in-indiana/). In its first year, [only 30 students](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/07/new-law-school-gets-just-a-third-of-its-expected-starting-class/) enrolled, despite the school’s goal of an inaugural entering class of 100. After being [denied](http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/schools/Indiana-Tech-law-school-denied-accreditation-7109440) accreditation in May 2015, the school was [granted](http://www.news-sentinel.com/news/local/Indiana-Tech-Law-School-granted-provisional-accreditation) provisional accreditation by the American Bar Association in March 2016. Shortly thereafter, the 20 remaining students in the school’s charter class graduated, and 13 of them registered to take a bar exam. Only three of them were successful, for an overall passage rate of [23.1 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/law-schools-abysmal-bar-exam-pass-rate-improves-to-23-1-percent/). This fall, the school enrolled [55 students](http://www.theindianalawyer.com/enrollment-jumps-at-indiana-tech-law-school/PARAMS/article/41200), its largest class ever.

Today, Indiana Tech Law School is announcing its closure.

At a meeting this afternoon, Indiana Tech University President Arthur Snyder is expected to tell faculty, staff, and students that the Board of Directors, citing [$20 million in losses](http://www.news-sentinel.com/news/local/Indiana-Tech-Law-School-to-close-next-June--losses-at-million), voted unanimously to close the school at the conclusion of the academic year. Its final day in operation will be June 30, 2017.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Faculty members are understandably upset, as many of them “accepted their appointments at great professional risk,” according to Stone Mattheis Xenopoulos & Brew partner [Christopher G. Mackaronis](https://www.smxblaw.com/team/christopher-g-mackaronis/), who represents a faculty member who prefers to remain anonymous. Above the Law was provided with a statement regarding the law school’s impending closure, which reads in pertinent part:

[This] abrupt reversal throws into chaos the lives and academic plans of the student body, who chose to enroll, and remain, at the Law School during its formative years based on the unqualified commitment of the University – a commitment that was regularly communicated to them. Indeed, the decision to close the Law School comes just months after the arrival of the largest entering first-year class of approximately 50 students – a class the University targeted with its unqualified commitment, the centerpiece of its recruiting message. The Law School’s tuition is just under $20,000.

“You don’t have to be a lawyer to be repulsed by this outrageous bait and switch,” Mackaronis said. No, you certainly do not. Not only do faculty and staff members feel as though they’ve been given the runaround, but students have been left holding the short end of the stick. What are they to do now that they have only part of their degrees from a law school that’s on the verge of going out of business? In an email sent to Indiana Tech Law students a short time ago, University President Snyder said the following:

Our first concern during this difficult time is for our law students. We will be working hard on behalf of each of them to ensure that the process for transferring, for continuing their legal education, and ultimately earning their law degree takes place with as little disruption as possible.

Our faculty and staff colleagues at the law school are to be commended for the efforts they have put forth in working with our law students. Despite their many positive achievements, we are not experiencing or projecting enough of a corresponding increase in demand by prospective students for the law school to remain viable into the future.

I know that many of you will have questions related to this decision. To assist in answering them, I have attached a Q&A document with more details on the decision and the process going forward. I also encourage you to reach out to me with other questions you may have.

Flip to the next page to see the three-page Q&A from President Snyder.

If these students would like to continue their legal education, they ought to look into seeing if any of their credits will be transferrable to another law school. If not, we implore them to immediately do some research on [closed school loan discharge](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/closed-school) — you can trust in the fact that if there’s anything worse than having tens of thousands of dollars of law school debt hanging over your head, it’s having law school debt from a school that abandoned you in the middle of your education.

Will more law schools close in Indiana Tech’s wake? Other law schools [certainly hope so](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/law-schools-agree-there-are-too-many-law-schools/). There’s a lesson to be learned here for students: If you continuously hear negative things about your school, perhaps it’s time to get out, before it’s too late.

# Biglaw Partner Linked To $100 Million Ponzi Scheme
## This... has got to suck.

Welp, this can’t be a great look for your business. Two professionals from Am Law 100 firm Baker Donelson have an investment business that…. seems to have loaned money to an admitted Ponzi schemer. Oh, and that included money invested with the pair by U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS). That’s not really an ideal business model.

[Jon Seawright](https://www.bakerdonelson.com/Jon-D-Seawright), a partner whose practice focuses on health care and tax law and who also happens to be on the firm’s board of directors, and [Brent Alexander](https://www.bakerdonelson.com/Brent-Alexander), a senior public policy advisor and a nonlawyer lobbyist at Baker Donelson, operate an investment company, Alexander Seawright LLC, apart from their work at the law firm. That LLC has been revealed to have financial ties to Arthur Lamar Adams and his company Madison Timber Properties LLC.

According to prosecutors, Adams operated a “sophisticated Ponzi scheme” and was able to fraudulently attract more than $100 million in investments, and that apparently includes receiving money from Alexander Seawright LLC. Adams has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and faces up to 20 years in prison.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
An attorney for Alexander and Seawright, David Kaufman of Brunini, Grantham, Grower & Hewes, said the pair were victims of the fraud:

“Brent and Jon are members along with others of Alexander Seawright Timber Fund I LLC. The LLC loaned money to Lamar Adams’ timber business, which turned out to be a complex financial fraud,” Kaufman said in a statement. “Brent and Jon were not aware of this fraud, and are profoundly concerned for the people who loaned money with them through the LLC.”

A firm spokesperson did its best to distance Baker Donelson from the entire affair, making clear while the firm’s name gets bandied about in articles like this one, the mess is “not a firm matter”:

“The U.S. attorney claimed Lamar Adams and Madison Timber Properties LLC created a ‘sophisticated Ponzi scheme’ with ‘false timber deeds,’ forged notarized signatures and many other false documents,” the firm’s statement said. “Baker Donelson did not represent Lamar Adams, Madison Timber Properties LLC, Alexander Seawright Timber Fund I LLC, or any lender or investor in her or his decision. While this matter is related to the personal business of employees of the firm, it is not a firm matter.”

It’s amazing how much can change in three short months. Over the course of your lifetime, can you pick out a three-month period in which your life changed as much as it has between March 1 and June 1? Speaking for myself, I can’t.

So many things are dramatically different as a result of the coronavirus pandemic — many things for the [worse](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/layoffs/), but at least a few for the [better](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/what-good-might-come-out-of-the-coronavirus-crisis/?rf=1). Law firm job hunting and recruiting are no exceptions.

Here are five ways in which job searching and recruiting have changed in the past three months:

1. There are far fewer jobs out there.

Let’s start with the obvious. In the economy writ large, we went from almost full employment in March to a projected [20 percent unemployment](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/05/28/coronavirus-2-1-m-file-unemployment-benefits-amid-covid-19/5265672002/) for May (when the labor statistics come out for this month). The legal sector has not been immune, losing an estimated [64,000 jobs](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/05/08/legal-industry-shed-64000-jobs-in-april-as-layoffs-and-furloughs-spread/) in April alone.

Large law firms have also retrenched, going from eagerly seeking laterals to furloughing or laying off lawyers and staff. If you’re receiving many fewer emails or calls from recruiters, don’t be offended or surprised; it’s not you, it’s the firms. A fair number of firms have implemented hiring freezes or are focusing on only high-priority searches.

2. Video interviewing: it is now, officially, “a thing.”

In the past, video interviewing over Zoom, Skype, or similar tools was the exception rather than the rule. For lawyers working abroad who wanted to return to the U.S., for example, video interviews were not uncommon, especially in the early or screening stages.

Now, of course, video interviewing is pretty much the only way interviewing takes place, thanks to the restrictions imposed to halt or slow the spread of coronavirus. And you know what? It has been fine. Speaking for myself, I have a fair number of candidates going through remote interviews right now, and nobody has had a snafu yet (knock wood).

Law firms and candidates are getting increasingly comfortable with remote interviewing. In fact, I’ve already had one candidate who was interviewed, hired, and onboarded remotely. He has been working for his new firm since late March, but he has yet to set foot in the firm’s physical offices.

The current crisis represents an excellent opportunity for firms that are willing to buck tradition and recruit remotely. These firms can scoop up top talent, while more conservative competitors sit on their hands.

3. It’s all (or mostly) about the partners.

Yes, there’s some activity in the associate market, but make no mistake: the market isn’t what it was like back in March. The associate space is much, much quieter, especially in previously booming transactional practices like M&A.

But partner recruiting remains robust, much as it did during the Great Recession. When the pie is shrinking, the way for firms to survive (or thrive) is by grabbing a larger slice of that shrinking pie. So firms are seeking out partners with big books of business, to help them grow revenue during these challenging times.

And partners are also quite willing to look around. In working on a few recent searches, I’ve found that partners at firms that have cut their compensation or that seem financially unstable are especially receptive to outreach these days.

4. Standards are higher.

This isn’t surprising. Video interviews, even if more common, aren’t the firms’ preferred way of recruiting — so if they are willing to go to the trouble of interviewing someone, that someone tends to be very impressive (or the need tends to be very dire). In a hot market, so-so candidates can get traction for various reasons, such as being in a coveted practice area. That’s not true today (yes, even for bankruptcy).

5. Firms want exactly what they want.

For the relatively few searches that are open, the firms want exactly what’s specified. In better markets, there’s usually some flexibility as to things like class year or practice area. But in this market, a buyer’s market in terms of legal talent, the firms are in firmly in control. And they’re taking the [Burger King approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Burger_King_ad_programs): they’ll have it their way, thank you very much.

These are just very general observations about the Biglaw job market today.

# The Ranks Of Biglaw Partnership Are Shrinking
## Your chances of making partner are dropping.

At the biggest of the Biglaw firms there’s a disturbing trend afoot — well, disturbing if you still hold out the faint hope of one day making partner at a Biglaw shop — the percentage of partners at the best firms is steadily decreasing. That’s according to data [collected by Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/1032555/why-biglaw-s-partnerships-are-shrinking) at 64 of the 100 biggest 100 firms.

Overall, the partnership numbers in 2013 went from 42.2 percent of lawyer headcount to 40.8 percent by 2017.

There are even 16 elite firms where the partnership clocks in at under 25 percent of headcount.

And, as with most Biglaw decisions it probably has something to do with money  As William Henderson, a professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law, told Law360:

“A smaller number of partners means a fewer number of slices that need to be cut up when you divide the profit pool.”

Ropes & Gray managing partner, David Chapin, also says that Biglaw is naturally conservative and that cautious nature plays a role:

“It’s fair to say that firms in general, and we’re no exception, are being more cautious about advancing people into the equity partner ranks,” Chapin said. “All firms have been, and we have been, more judicious in that respect.”

It also might be that more attorneys are opting out of the partnership hunt. Peter Johnson of Law Practice Consultants says lawyers instead prefer the world of in-house:

“The stigma about leaving a large law firm to go someplace else is not what it used to be… Going in-house used to be ‘going out to pasture.’ Now it’s a preferred job for many.”

Let’s hope that people who find themselves shut out of partnership opportunities find other rewarding work.

# WOW!!! Davis Polk Raises The Bar On Bonuses

That cheering you hear is coming from the offices of Davis Polk, where associates were just handed a cascade of good news beginning with some special bonuses. Remember when we were [applauding Cooley LLP for giving senior associates $7,500](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/)? Well, Davis Polk decided to blow up that scale like they were making a Michael Bay movie.

Domestic associates in good standing will be receiving special Fall bonuses in recognition of their hard work throughout [gestures wildly at everything]. Here’s what we’re looking at:

- Class of 2019: $7,500
- Class of 2018: $10,000
- Class of 2017: $20,000
- Class of 2016: $27,500
- Class of 2015: $32,500
- Class of 2014: $37,000
- Class of 2013: $40,000

Yowza.

International associates will receive separate case-by-case bonuses.

But that’s not the end of the good news. The message to associates also assured them that these bonuses are NOT replacements for the traditional year-end bonuses and that the firm expects to be handing those out on schedule too. Oh, and the firm expects that these annual bonuses “will not be lower than those paid out in 2019.”

That would mean that in the worst case, a first-year associate is going to take home $22,500 in bonuses in a year of unprecedented economic upheaval. Biglaw firms tend to stick together when it comes to bonuses. DPW just put a lot of pressure on its peers to match.

— Tim Corcoran, a law firm consultant who specializes in compensation issues, commenting on the fact that top law firms will [need to start offering more and more flexibility as a fringe benefit](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/07/15/as-law-firms-plan-office-returns-whole-remote-weeks-may-become-newest-benefit/) of sorts to keep up with the market.

# Everyone Should Have Black Friday Off
## Don't be a Grinch. It just makes more sense in most cases.

Everyone in the legal profession understands that people should not be expected to perform work on certain holidays. Christmas and New Year’s Day are definitely two such holidays. Thanksgiving, which most of us recently celebrated, is another holiday when people are generally not expected to be billing hours. The day after Thanksgiving, which many people now call Black Friday, should also be a day when legal professionals and others should have off from work since individuals usually have obligations that reasonably prevent them from working.

I always assumed that Black Friday was some kind of established holiday since I was used to taking time off during it. However, Black Friday is not a bank holiday for many financial institutions. In addition, the mail is delivered during Black Friday. It does look like the stock market only has a partial day on Black Friday, which must be a welcome treat for financial professionals.

Many law firms do (officially or unofficially) recognize Black Friday as time off for attorneys and staff. I worked at law firms which explicitly list Black Friday as a time when the office would be closed. I also worked at law firms that did not explicitly list Black Friday as a holiday, but people were not expected to show up to the office nor to perform work related to their jobs.

However, some lawyers definitely work on Black Friday. This past Black Friday was pretty busy for my law practice. As a self-employed lawyer, I do not at all mind working on Black Friday, since the flexibility of being self-employed is more than worth needing to work during periods when other lawyers might have off. But I noticed that some of my counterparts who work at law firms both big and small were working during Black Friday. Some of the tasks these attorneys completed on Black Friday could have definitely waited until Monday, when most people returned to work after the Thanksgiving holiday.

Of course, some attorneys do not mind working over times that attorneys usually have off. Lawyers might need to bill extra hours before the end of the year to meet requirements or earn a bonus. Even when I worked at a law firm that had Black Friday off, I did not mind billing hours over the Thanksgiving weekend to make sure I qualified for a larger bonus by the end of the year.

However, law firm managers should rarely require people to work on Black Friday if there are no emergent matters that require attention. The work-life balance has degraded in recent years since the work-from-home revolution has blended the lines between everyone’s work and personal life. Thanksgiving weekend is usually a time when people reconnect with family and friends in ways that might not be possible during other parts of the year. Moreover, many people travel during Thanksgiving to be with friends and family, and it is unfair to require these individual to perform work when they might not be able to efficiently complete work tasks.

Also, it is highly problematic to require attorneys and staff to perform work on a day that is between a holiday and a weekend. I think I wrote about this topic before, but generally if a holiday falls on a Tuesday or a Thursday, it is generous for employers to give workers the extra day off so they connect the holiday with the weekend to have a longer time off. It is hard to imagine that employees can be very useful if they just celebrated Thanksgiving and have the weekend to look forward to, so it usually make sense to just give workers time off for Black Friday.

In any case, if law firms have not explicitly added Black Friday to their list of recognized days off, they definitely should. Cutting workers a break over Black Friday helps lawyers and staff enjoy their Thanksgiving and helps preserve the work-life balance that has been under attack in recent years.

# The Biglaw Layoffs Are Far From Over
## It's highly likely that another firm will soon announce a reduction in force. But which one?

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

These are probably not the last reductions in force that we’re going to see.

— [Kate Reder Sheikh](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/kate-reder-sheikh), a California legal recruiter for Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/reed-smith-cuts-50-lawyers-and-staff-as-big-law-layoffs-continue) in the wake of [Reed Smith’s reduction in force](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/another-top-50-am-law-firm-cuts-its-global-work-force/). The firm is just the latest to cut jobs in the wake of a slowdown in demand and overcapacity among their ranks due to a lack of attrition, or “bloated payrolls,” as Reder Sheikh put it.

Chief Justice Roberts would like you to simmer down. (Nati Harnik/AP)

In what’s shaping up to be the first Supreme Court challenge involving the Mueller investigation, Chief Justice John Roberts stepped in to stay a D.C. Circuit ruling holding a foreign company in contempt of the Mueller grand jury.

Apparently, Mueller is seeking information from corporation in “Country A,” and that corporation claims immunity from the Mueller probe under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Last week, the lower court agreed with Mueller. The D.C. Circuit found that the case falls within an exception to the Act for activities that have a “direct effect” on the United States.

Clearly, the corporation here is a state-owned bank or financial institution. Mueller is following the money, whether that money is locked up in Russia or Saudi Arabia or wherever.

Over the weekend, the Supreme Court decided to get involved. [From Howe on the Court](http://amylhowe.com/2018/12/22/justices-asked-to-intervene-in-grand-jury-dispute/):

On Sunday evening, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked the district court’s order requiring the foreign corporation to comply with the grand jury subpoena or pay penalties. In a brief order, the chief justice directed the government to respond by noon on December 31 and indicated that the district court’s order would remain on hold until the government’s response is filed and either he or the full court takes additional action.

Folks, the Mueller probe isn’t going to be finished any time soon. Oh, Trump might find an attorney general to unnaturally end the investigation in order to protect himself, but the investigation doesn’t look to be “wrapping up.”

If the Supreme Court compels the foreign corporation to answer the subpoena, who knows what other crimes might be uncovered.

# Work Perk Alert: Are Music Rooms The Next Big Thing For Biglaw Firms?
## This Biglaw firm is making it easier for attorneys to rock to the beat during their work days thanks to its new music room.

Biglaw firms are doing all they can to make the return to the office sound more appealing to attorneys, and one firm seems to be hitting all of the right notes with one of the work perks that it’s currently offering.

Mayer Brown — a firm that brought in $1,908,000,000 gross revenue in 2023, putting it at No. 23 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — is staying in rhythm with the times by paying attention to its office culture. The firm recently added a brand new music room to its Charlotte outpost. [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2024/04/19/the-law-firm-disrupted-for-office-attendance-is-music-a-new-carrot/) has additional details:

Instead of [adding] one more conference room, they asked the question, “What could appeal to everyone, and bring younger and older generations together?”

The answer: a music room. Start with a lounge space—warm tones, comfortable furniture—but outfit it with a high-end record player and excellent speakers. And stock it with a pile of records, a figure that’s up to 200 now, along with books on music. (There’s also a TV in the mix.) And in a twist on traditional activities for summer associates, the Charlotte team gets to make a trip to a local record store to pick out a fresh stack of vinyl for the collection.

Personnel in the Charlotte office put the room to use in a variety of ways, according to [managing partner Eric] Reilly. Several groups have monthly meetings there, with music in the background. Others filter in later in the day, looking for a change in pace. And it works as a place to meet clients and break the ice.

“It’s able to provide a little bit of relaxation in the sometimes chaotic workday of a transactional law practice, where things can tend to be very fast-paced and stressful,” Reilly told Law.com. “Having a place to unwind and collect your thoughts and reflect throughout the day, even for a few minutes, has been helpful.”

Congratulations to Mayer Brown for its willingness to put its attorneys’ happiness first with this harmonious new offering. By staying in tune with its culture like this, the firm is making it a lot easier for employees to feel truly valued.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I practiced law for nearly 15 years and hated timesheets as much as the next person. But it’s just critical it be done on a daily basis. So I’m not surprised law firms are being more aggressive in requiring it and penalizing people, especially in this associate market, which has shifted. Now, they might not have done it two years ago, where it was a seller’s market. But now the shoe is on the other foot.

Even if it makes a 1% difference in revenue or collections or profitability—when you’re looking at firms generating billions of dollars, that’s a lot of money. So yeah, I think in tougher times, they want people to really focus on the basics. And people might also have more time to focus on the basics because it’s not as crazy as it was in 2021.

— [Jeffrey Lowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-lowe-b64a886/), founder and managing partner of advisory firm Jeffrey Lowe Partners, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/22/in-current-market-billing-discipline-more-critical-than-ever/) on the reason why entering time is “more critical than ever,” especially in a market like this one. Lowe’s critical commentary comes in the wake of [Sidley Austin threatening to dock year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/sidley-docks-bonus-late-timesheets/) by up to 50% if attorneys’ billable time is consistently entered late.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Overhired, And Now Associates And Staff Are Paying The Price
## Is overhiring responsible for the latest Biglaw layoffs? It's very likely.

Biglaw firms were thrilled to hire as many associates and business professionals as they could during the booming “post”-pandemic business years, but now that demand has cooled significantly, layoffs meant to “right-size” head count have spread across the industry.

Last week, Dechert — a firm that brought in $1,288,692,000 gross revenue in 2022 (down 3.94% from 2021), putting it at No. 36 in the most recent Am Law 100 — announced a [global reduction in force](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/am-law-top-50-firm-begins-reduction-in-force-will-cut-5-of-global-workforce/), cutting 5% of the firm’s workforce, including attorneys and business professionals. In total, these layoffs impacted 55 lawyers and 43 business professionals.

But what was behind the firm’s sudden overcapacity? A source tells the American Lawyer that it was very likely a case of overhiring.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Dechert appears to have been caught up in a boom-and-bust hiring cycle, with the private equity and finance ranks in particular swelling to meet rising demand and then leaving the firm with overcapacity concerns.

One source with knowledge of the firm attributed the cuts to overhiring. After a surge in demand that led many law firms like Dechert to hire associates beyond the normal scope of its hiring pool, “demand is returning to normal or maybe worse than normal, depending on how deep the recession goes,” the source said.

According to Am Law, Dechert’s 5% global cut will return its workforce to just around its 2021 staffing levels. At the end of 2021, the firm had 1,815 employees, and these layoffs will bring the firm’s personnel count to 1,798. How incredibly convenient!

Did your firm overhire in 2021 and 2022? Are you expecting layoffs to occur in the near future that will “right-size” the firm? Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us by email at  [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or by sending a text message to (646) 820-8477.

# Biglaw's 'Bank' Of Remote Days Will Only Make Associates More Frustrated About Having To Work From The Office

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

The law at the Am Law 200 level is really a 24/7 position. So I think that’s why associates get frustrated with the whole office policy to begin with. [It’s a difficult message for associates to hear], ‘You didn’t do enough’ or ‘It’s not enough that you’re on the grid 24/7. You need to be physically where we need you to be.’ I think that’s hard for them to swallow.

— [Michelle Fivel](https://www.hhflegalsearch.com/michelle-fivel), a partner and co-founder of the legal recruiting firm Hatch Henderson Fivel, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/07/17/with-big-law-marching-to-most-days-in-office-some-bank-remote-days/) on the latest push for associates to return to the office four days a week, with a “bank” of remote days available. Fivel went on to say these “banks” could help “lessen the blow” of needing to be in the office more often than not, but that it likely wouldn’t affect things from a recruiting perspective. “It’s a factor that people would consider, but it would be a rare situation that it would be make or break,” she said. “There are so many factors that come into play. I think it’s a plus in the firm’s column, but I don’t think it’s going to be enough.”

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

Biglaw special bonuses are being handed out across the country, and other firms better start paying attention, because the latest firm to hand out oodles of money to associates is a major West Coast leader.

Wilson Sonsini associates and counsel received great news this morning (this afternoon, on the East Coast) when a memo related to their forthcoming big-time bonuses hit their inboxes. This is what the special bonuses look like at WSGR (full memo on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/wilson-sonsini-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

Associates and of counsel who are on track to bill at least 1950 bonus-eligible hours in 2021 will receive payouts based on year-to-date hours billed as of May 31 and August 31, and make-up payments will be available. It’s also worth noting here that Wilson Sonsini is providing two weeks of well-being time off, 40 hours of which are billable and bonus eligible. More firms should get on board with billable vacations.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/wilson-sonsini-special-bonus-2021/2/) to see the full memo from Wilson Sonsini.)

# This Is What Happens When You Try To Scam A Biglaw Firm
## This was entirely predictable.

If I were an online scammer — I’m not, but if I were — I’m not sure I’d be targeting a major Biglaw firm. Sure, lawyers have a well-earned reputation as luddites — or at least behind the ball on tech issues, which certainly weighs in favor of them as targets. But on the other, perhaps more relevant hand, why poke a bear that has unlimited elite legal resources to throw at you?

Latham & Watkins is certainly one of those Biglaw firms with unlimited legal resources that doesn’t take too kindly to entities that try to scam its clients using the name of one of their partners. This week, the firm filed a lawsuit against domain names that are trying to impersonate Latham.

As per [Law.com:](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/01/latham-sues-domain-names-after-fraudsters-impersonated-partner-to-divert-payments/)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Per the complaint, the scheme began in April when the scammer registered a handful of domains that began with “LW,” a reference to Latham’s genuine domain of LW.com. Using 38 variants that included “LW-France.com” and “LW-Frn.com,” the unknown party attempted to impersonate Paris-based partner Alexandra Bigot.

“The scammer would then email third parties to ‘remind’ them of unpaid invoices,” the complaint stated. “The scammer even included vague threats to the third-party victims, suggesting that they ‘resolve it today to avoid other accusations.’”

Fortunately, as the complaint notes, Latham’s clients didn’t so much fall for the scam, as alert Bigot her name was being used in the scheme.

It seems unlikely that attempted scammers will come forward to defend the lawsuit, so a default judgment seems in the cards. Which… was always the most likely way this was going to end.

# Biglaw Firm Takes Harsh Stance On Productivity This Year
## Bill your hours or you won't be considered for a bonus.

Oof, 2020, what a year! Amirite? I know, we still have three months left in this interminable year, but still, we know it’s been a doozy of a year. But however long 2020 has seemed, that hasn’t always translated into a boon of billable hours for Biglaw associates.

The pandemic has exploded everyone’s personal obligations and whether stymied by remote learning, illness of themselves or a loved one, the emotional turmoil of social injustice, or depression, lots of excellent attorneys have found it challenging to bill at pre-pandemic levels. And that’s assuming the hours are even there in the first place. With the economic downturn that accompanied the pandemic, if an associate is ready and able to work, sometimes the hours just aren’t there. Whether it’s particular practice groups that have taken a slump, clients that are particularly hard hit, or [partners hoarding the hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/associates-left-searching-for-billable-hours-after-partners-take-them-all/), sometimes its more about the firm’s business model than anything an associate did wrong.

So, you might think that, given all these factors, if a Biglaw firm has billing thresholds to get year-end bonuses, they might loosen up some of those requirements in order to retain the best and brightest during this trying time — after all, not every firm even has these strict requirements. Well, when it comes to Arnold & Porter, welp, you’d be wrong.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Earlier this week, an email was sent out from firm leadership codifying a statement made in a town hall. The firm is encouraging associates to send in “hours messages” as part of their annual review process, for anyone who failed to hit the expected 2,000 hours threshold. Which, so far, so good. With all that 2020’s been, some consideration is warranted. But then the email goes on to explain that statement will only go towards whether an associate is still considered in good standing and the hours statement “will not impact bonus eligibility for 2020. The hours thresholds for bonus consideration remain unchanged.”

Yikes. I mean I guess it’s a step in the right direction that the firm won’t put an associate on a performance improvement plan or something just because they only managed to bill 1,800 hours in this crazy year, but I guess there’s a limit to Biglaw’s compassion.

And 2,000 hours is just nonnegotiable.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Full Retroactive Salary Restorations For All, Plus Some Bonus News

As 2020 draws to a close and holiday season quickly approaches, more and more Biglaw firms are announcing good news (or as good of news as can be expected considering they’re still doing business amid the never-ending coronavirus crisis).

Today, we have news from Stoel Rives, a firm that came in 132nd place in the most recent Am Law 200 rankings, with $236,541,000 in gross revenue in 2019. Back in October, the firm announced that it would be [eliminating all of its pandemic-related austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/biglaw-firm-announces-complete-rollback-of-covid-austerity-measures/) and prospectively restoring base pay for all attorneys and staff members. Earlier this week, Melissa Jones, the managing partner of Stoel Rives, sent a memo to all employees at the firm detailing plans to retroactively restore base compensation for attorneys. On top of that, Jones announced some bonus news:

[T]he [Executive Committee] confirmed that we will leave in place the bonus pools for all staff (including paralegals), associates, of counsel and staff attorneys as reflected in our 2020 budget.

The Practice Management Committee is meeting soon to allocate the bonus pool for associates, of counsel, and staff attorneys. We anticipate that bonus decisions will be communicated in early/mid-December, and that bonuses will be paid no later than Friday, December 18.

Associates are thriled by the news, and one source gushed, “Everyone is so happy under Melissa Jones’s leadership!” Payments to restore base compensation will be made by the end of November. Congratulations to everyone at the firm. Now that [bonus season has officially started](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/), we hope you get some good news soon.

# Nothin' Says Lovin' Like $180K In Your Paycheck

As the title suggests, the Doughboys and girls over at Pillsbury have matched the Cravath scale. From what we’ve heard there’s no memo (UPDATE: There is a memo… [and it’s here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/nothin-says-lovin-like-180k-in-your-paycheck/2/)), but they’ve agreed to match the Cravath scale across all of their U.S. offices. UPDATE: The top end of the scale is $315K.

And Pillsbury has a LOT of domestic offices. In addition to the obvious locales like New York and D.C., the firm has offices in Los Angeles, Austin, Houston, Nashville, Northern Virginia, Sacramento, San Diego (two offices), San Francisco, and Silicon Valley. The firm also has a Palm Beach office, but does not appear to have any associates there.

Pillsbury just missed the cut of [our last “irate associates” post](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/angry-associates-ask-wheres-my-money/), announcing their raises less than 2 minutes before the post was slated to go public. To let the firm in on exactly how testy its associates had been before this announcement, let’s share what they were thinking:

If I were one of our T14 summer associates I would seriously be looking at 3L OCI options. Management seems to be waiting for literally every other AmLaw firm to raise first. This strategy is just postponing the inevitable, unless the firm is in dire straits or they don’t value their associates, in which case they should tell us that too. I don’t think they realize how much the delay is hurting associate morale.

This was followed a couple days later with:

Guys, seriously. This is getting ridiculous.

Well, don’t worry Pillsbury lawyers, the salary situation is not a reason to worry about the firm.

# Partners Need To Leave Stroock ASAP, Lest They Risk Their Profits

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I read this email announcement from the firm leadership as giving everyone notice that they need to get out as quickly as possible so they’re not caught at the firm at the time it dissolves. If I were a partner at Stroock, even if I didn’t have a job lined up at a new firm, I would withdraw before the dissolution regardless.

— Professor [John Morley](https://law.yale.edu/john-d-morley) of Yale Law School, an expert in law firm failures, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/stroock-partners-profits-on-line-in-delicate-wind-down-process) on the advance notice that Stroock & Stroock & Lavan’s leaders gave employees, as a committee would soon be [dissolving the firm “at the appropriate time.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/stroock-to-dissolve-close-its-doors-after-nearly-150-years-in-business/) Partners especially need to heed Morley’s warning to get out, otherwise their ongoing fees may be at risk to creditors under the “unfinished business doctrine.”

# Vault Ranks The Best Law Firms For Diversity (2021)
## Did your law firm make the cut this time around?

Over the course of September, Vault has rolled out a variety of law firm rankings — from the firms that are the [most prestigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2021/) to the firms that offer the [best quality of life](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-in-america-2021/) to the firms with the [top-ranked practice areas in their region](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/vault-rankings-top-law-firms-by-practice-area-and-region-2021/) to the [best midsized firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/vault-quality-of-life-rankings-the-best-midsize-law-firms-to-work-for-2021/) — and there’s yet another important one that we’ll dive into today.

Money can buy prestige and can certainly improve your quality of life, but the diversity of your colleagues is worth more than what any salary scale can possibly pay.

In a companion ranking to the Vault 100, associates were asked to rank their own law firms based on categories most relevant to how the firm does at creating, maintaining, and fostering a diverse workforce, including diversity relating to racial minorities, women, LGBTQ individuals, and individuals with disabilities. To create the overall Best 30 Firms for Diversity ranking, Vault averages the scores from all four ratings.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
There was a huge amount of movement in the Top 10 this year. Which firms made the cut? Without any further ado, here are the Top 10 Best Law Firms for Diversity based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2021:

1. [O’Melveny & Myers](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/omelveny-myers-llp) (no change)
2. [Constangy Brooks, Smith & Prophete](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/constangy-brooks-smith-prophete-llp) (+1)
3. [Ropes & Gray](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/ropes-gray-llp) (+2)
4. [Carlton Fields](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/carlton-fields-pa) (-2)
5. [Paul Hastings](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/paul-hastings-llp) (+12)
6. [Eversheds Sutherland (US)](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/eversheds-sutherland-us-llp) (+12)
7. [White & Case](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/white-case-llp) (-1)
8. [Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/orrick-herrington-sutcliffe-llp) (-4)
9. [Littler Mendelson](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/littler-mendelson-pc) (-1)
10. [Clifford Chance US](https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/clifford-chance-us-llp) (+3)

It’s worth noting that O’Melveny once again swept Vault’s diversity rankings, but there are some other firms worth acknowledging here. Here’s some [additional commentary](https://www.vault.com/blogs/vaults-law-blog-legal-careers-and-industry-news/vaults-2021-law-firm-quality-of-life-diversity-and-summer-program-rankings-are-here) on that:

In this year’s 2021 diversity rankings, one firm stood out from the rest—for the second year in a row, O’Melveny took the crown as the No.1-ranked firm in every diversity category. The rankings also saw a particularly strong showing from five additional firms that placed in the top 10 in all five diversity categories: Carlton Fields, P.A.; Constangy Brooks, Smith & Prophete, LLP; Eversheds Sutherland; Ropes & Gray; and White & Case LLP.

# Year-End And Special Bonuses To Covet At Another Biglaw Firm
## Lots of cash to dump on hardworking associates.

If it seems like bonus announcements just won’t quit, that’s because there are a lot of Biglaw firms (and an increasing number of high-powered boutiques) that are eager to show their associates how much they are appreciated. And if in that process that can also prove that they can compete for the top legal talent during one of the busiest lateral markets on record, well, so much the better.

The latest firm to bring joy by announcing associate bonuses is Covington — a firm that took in $1,321,296,000 in gross revenue last year.

The good news for associates is that, yes, the firm will be matching both the year-end AND special bonuses that are making the rounds in Biglaw. Sure, that may not seem like a flex for a top 25 law firm, but Covington has, in the past, made some [missteps on that front](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/hope-for-fall-special-bonuses-is-fading-fast/). After [correcting course](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/top-30-am-law-firm-that-once-refused-special-bonuses-now-offers-them-as-part-of-year-end-bonus-scale/), it is nice to see them match all the money going to associates at competitor firms without much fuss.

The bonus scale at the firm is as follows:



You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/covington-bonuses-21/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Partner Used To Think 2400 Hours Was The Bare Minimum -- Now She's Left The Practice Entirely
## Quinn Emanuel partner Jennifer Kash realized 3500 hours/year were taking a toll, so she walked away.

Back in 2012, we wrote a story about Jennifer Kash, a Quinn Emanuel partner who sent around an email asking her associates to let her know their availability for more work. That’s not an uncommon ask in the Biglaw universe, but the takeaway from Kash’s email was that any associate billing under 2400 hours/year was still open to more work in the firm’s estimation:

In case you forgot: 5 is crazy busy, 4 is could do something but it would hurt and would have to be very small, 3 is you have some bandwidth and might be able to take on some more work, 2 is I could take on a bunch more work, my plate is not full, 1 is you need lots of work.

One further note, based on how busy everyone is if billing under 200 hours a month you are a 3.

At the time, we described Kash’s email as emblematic of the way firms see associates as consistently underutilized — a mindset that can level undue stress and potential burnout.

Today, Jennifer Kash would likely agree with that assessment. While associates working 2400+ and still getting assigned more work may sound miserable, Kash was billing 3500 hours at the time and only making due with healthy doses of Adderall. It’s easy to think of law firms as pyramid schemes because, in a sense, they are. But just because the associates grinding out hours at the base are whittled down to the partnership tier doesn’t mean the partners have stopped billing themselves. Many partners are juggling as much or more.

The former Quinn Emanuel San Francisco office chief is now living in the Caribbean running a non-profit called Virgin Independence, which helps transitional youth in finding jobs and training and working on a new program that invites attorneys to join her in St. Vincent and the Grenadines to get the support that lawyers rarely get while trying to manage their schedules.

[The Lawyer’s Escape Pod](https://thelawyersescapepod.podbean.com/) is an excellent podcast hosted by Megan Smiley that peeks outside the legal industry to show lawyers that there is, in fact, an escape route. Smiley [posted an interview with Kash](https://thelawyersescapepod.podbean.com/e/jen-kash-talksabouttheburnout-that-comes-with-3500-billable-hour-yearshow-she-left-the-firm-toget-healthy-and-startinghersecond-actin-the-caribbean/) where she opened up about her worldview as a partner and how she went from Biglaw big wig to living in the islands.

On the show, she describes the isolation that can form around partners in the Biglaw system:

Law firm system not set up to support people at the top. Because we so assume once they get there and they have money and they’ve made it through the ranks of associates that there’s no longer going to be problems they need to address and there is. And the problem is there’s no place to go and no resources available to them because they don’t have any confidentiality and they need support in a way that’s embarrassing and that they’re not willing to maybe sometimes let their egos be set aside to address.

It’s a great way to close the loop on the article we posted seven years ago — time has a way of changing perspectives. Jennifer Kash wants lawyers to understand that taking care of themselves isn’t something they can just put off because the money’s good.

Here is one of the great revelations of marketing. This is something I figured out over time and I am not sure exactly how. Certainly no one told me this and I didn’t read it anywhere. Maybe it is because I was a math major and just think about things mathematically. It is this:

Marketing is a game of pure statistics.

Ask anyone – I mean anyone – how they got their clients or their customers – especially their first clients or customers — and it is (almost) always completely serendipitous. It was a result of a series of events that could not be predicted or planned for.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“I was picking up my three-year-old daughter from a play group because my nanny who usually does was sick, so there I was. I met the mom of my daughter’s friend, who happens to be a high-powered… and we were talking. I mentioned…. and then she said……. and the next thing you know, there I was…..”

It is all completely random. Indeed, if you make a marketing plan with ten target customers or clients, it almost always works out that your best shot fails and one you thought had no chance at all turns into a big win.

In the legal world, if you ask a big rainmaker for advice you will hear everything, and stated with incredible confidence too, as to how you get clients. You hear:

It is on the golf course – that’s where “real” business is done.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
It is from across the table – clients see you take their lawyer to the cleaners and they want you on the next matter.

You just do great work and the clients will find you.

You meet people at the synagogue or church and then talk business later.

You get clients from referrals.

You just be a nice guy, since clients like to work with people they like.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
You just be an asshole, since clients want someone tough working for them so they can feel protected.

The reason you will hear just about everything from all sorts of people is that this happened to work for this particular rainmaker, so she thinks it is critical, and the be-all and the end-all of marketing success, but it is (almost) always happenstance that tricks the person into thinking that is “the way” when it is just “a way” that happened to succeed in that circumstance.

You simply cannot predict what will happen.

Of course, I cannot “prove” my theory that it is all about statistics; however, I am pretty certain I am right. So please consider trusting me here.

Now all this talk about statistics may sound very depressing. “Bruce is advocating the randomness of life, which effectively means not only marketing, but life itself, is purely random and therefore pointless. Gee!”

However, once you accept my theory that marketing is essentially random and statistically based, and you get over being a bit shocked by that, some amazing revelations spring from it:

First – if you know you cannot predict outcomes, then the best chances of success will come from making as many marketing attempts as possible.

Second – you should spend as little time as possible on each attempt, since you are trying to maximize the number of attempts.

Third – within the framework of the first two points here, you should make the attempts as effective as possible.

That is what a statistician/mathematician would do with the foregoing information, right? Instead of trying to pretend the world is not what it really is, a mathematician would just do the foregoing, wouldn’t she? It is all just simple math – I don’t think of myself as a weirdo (although that is of course a subjective self-evaluation); however, I live my life by mathematics, since math doesn’t lie to you. It tells you the truth which, as I noted above, I highly value, and then I work from there.

Ultimately, the lesson I am giving you here is that, whatever you are doing with your marketing, be efficient with your time. Spending twenty hours writing an article will make you “feel good” like you are “marketing” and doing something useful, but just playing the mathematical odds, this is not a strategy that is as likely to succeed as would spending those twenty hours doing the other things I have suggested to you in prior columns and will suggest to you in future columns.

You should have no reason to be depressed about this revelation. Indeed, instead, you should be energized and excited by it. You just learned a key fact in how to play the marketing game:

Make as many attempts as possible.

Spend as little time as possible on each attempt.

Make your attempts as effective as possible.

It’s just kind of the right thing to do. [Law grads joining Biglaw firms are] highly likely to pass the bar exam anyway.”

— [Timothy Powers](https://www.haynesboone.com/people/p/powers-timothy), managing partner of Haynes and Boone, offering [support for diploma privilege for the class of 2020](https://www.law.com/2020/07/22/law-firms-feel-waves-made-by-bar-exam-changes/), noting that he’d expect a fair number of his Biglaw colleagues to support it as well, considering the bar exams’ current state of flux due to the pandemic.

# The Business Of Fun
## In a post-pandemic world, remote workers crave fun. Most firms are failing to deliver.

Zoom and other remote work tools reshaped the legal industry in the nearly three years since the start of the pandemic. Who among us doesn’t love the thrill of secretly taking a professional meeting in pajama pants? Yet, for all the utility we derive from remote working, there remains a rich debate on exactly how to blend them with the traditional in-office business model.

Much of the discussion has focused on what will yield the best mix of productivity and culture. Among larger firms, most have settled on the so-called Kirkland model, which requires attorneys to be onsite at least three days per week. But there’s evidence that model isn’t taking root the way we’d expect. I recently attended a law firm managing partner conference, and a speaker from a large consulting company that evaluated the effectiveness of the model called the three-day model a “flop.” Enforcement is inconsistent, which can damage morale, and attorneys that highly value flexibility have ample opportunity to find alternative employment even in a tightening labor market. Worse yet, the training, mentorship, and culture that law firm leaders seek to cultivate are being hampered by the lack of face-to-face contact.

Is there a way to foster culture and cohesiveness that firms need without sacrificing the flexible remote working tools that attorneys want? There is no easy answer to this question. But I’d like to propose one element of the equation that law firm leaders are missing: how can we interject some element of fun into the new work world?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
A Core Human Need

Fun is not something we typically associate with the high-level practice of law.  There’s little “fun” to be had in sifting through thousands of pages of paper, polishing the ninth draft of a nondisclosure agreement, or reading dozens of cases looking for the one turn of phrase or fact pattern that might change the tide of your case.

Yet, the circumstances surrounding those long, plodding hours we spend can often be a riotous good time. I’ve got more stories than I can remember of spending long nights working beside colleagues on tough cases, cracking jokes as we got tired and loopy, and basking in the feeling of being part of a team that is pulling off something great. Any drill sergeant will tell you that trying times are a strong bonding agent. It’s not only the difficulty of a task that brings people together; it’s also the extra savor that comes from finding fun together in places where it feels like fun shouldn’t exist.

In this way, the three-day-per-week Kirkland model is not off base in its goals. Happiness is a core human need. The funny stories that you hear at the water cooler or the spontaneous happy hours after (or during) work foster a level of social connection among a firm’s teammates. In this way, being in the office likely does bring some level of fun to the work experience. Because of this, and the training and mentorship benefits that come from serendipitous interpersonal communication, you can see why leaders would default to what they know: let’s get people on site to ensure their core need is met. Simple enough, right?

But what happens to the large segment of lawyers in today’s world who aren’t in the office most of the week? Among these are top-quality lawyers who may be dedicated to work but who’ve also made the life calculus that the benefits of flexibility, minimizing commutes, and spending more time with family outweigh coming into the office three days per week. Those who are not in office are not only at risk of being put on the “B-list” because of their perceived lack of dedication, but they don’t have a mechanism for the “fun” that connects people to one another and the office.

This increasingly large segment is left devoid of this core human need for happiness and deep connections. Even the biggest proponents of flexible working have to admit that it’s hard to develop and maintain new relationships through a computer. I’d argue that firms should be concerned about this at a human level. But, even if they’re not, they should be concerned because this could translate into continued recruiting and retention challenges. Yes, the issue may subside as the economy tightens and lawyers are less mobile but, make no mistake, it will come roaring back the moment options begin opening up.

So if forcing people onsite isn’t the answer, what are Biglaw firm leaders to do?

How We Retreated To Move Forward

Firms need to get creative. In an age of flexible working, I’d argue that much of the cost savings that firms realize from real estate and travel need to be reinvested in social activities where remote and in-person workers can gather on a more frequent basis. This means more practice group gatherings, office parties, and team celebrations. The focus of these events can’t be just work. Leaders need to ensure that they maximize in-person time by providing opportunities for fun and deep human connections that people crave.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Firm leaders will need to flex their right brain hemispheres and get creative to pull this off effectively. Classic events like the time-honored “firm retreat” need to be reimagined. When I was coming up the associate and partnership ranks, firm retreats were a time for CLE, business meetings, and then some socializing in the evenings once the work was done. All of that has value, but these days it’s cheap and easy to find CLE tailored to your specialty online and cross-office business meetings can be easily held on Zoom. Moreover, I can’t think of a single CLE or business meeting that I ever attended which would have changed the mind of an attorney thinking of leaving the firm — or of an attorney considering joining.

We kept these principles in mind when we planned our recent firm retreat at [Fennemore](https://www.fennemorelaw.com/). Our retreat philosophy leaned into facilitating the fun that’s been so lacking the past three years.  Our “Into The Future” retreat had a classic ’80s theme, complete with a rented DeLorean. We crafted fun swag bags, music, videos, and events that were all about getting our people together to laugh and make memories.

And our team rose to the occasion. People dressed up and let their hair down. We had an attorney attend in a full-body ALF costume, as well as another rocking a Teen Wolf look. When we put in the time, money, and effort to create a space to have a good time, our people made one. I think we generated the fun we were hoping to, and maybe even more.

You Can’t Afford Not To Have A Good Time

All this fun isn’t just a squishy sentimental notion. Fun feels great and bonds teams, but fun also has serious ROI. Fun might be the difference between keeping and losing a good attorney, or between gaining and missing out on a new team of laterals. When you consider that losing an attorney can cost a firm over $250K between lost revenue and the cost of recruiting to replace them, firms can’t afford not to try to make themselves a joyous place to spend time.

Fun is also first-class marketing for a firm’s brand. I was pleasantly surprised to see the positive responses on social media, both internally and externally, that our fun-focused retreat was able to generate. I saw one attorney proudly post “Does your firm have a DeLorean?” on their socials, while others circulated unboxing clips of their swag bags. Retreat guest speaker and editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur Magazine Jason Feifer even [posted](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7029122079480246273/) on LinkedIn about our training and mentorship “Hackathon” event, noting we have a “creative, forward-thinking culture — not what I usually associate with law firms.” Fun creates FOMO. If your firm is where the good things are happening, you’ll never be at a loss for the talent you need to grow.

For all the varying philosophies within firms about remote work culture, all of us at heart want to achieve the same goal. Every one of us wants to build a firm that is the best possible place to work at. How we get there will differ from attorney to attorney, but I think all of us can agree that our ideal firm is somewhere that facilitates the bonding, connection, and fun that fulfills us as the social creatures we are. If we can focus on that larger philosophical goal, the steps to get us there might just become that much easier for all lawyers to get behind.

Well, well, well. What have we here? Could it be? Yes! It’s another firm that’s matching the new Milbank salary scale. It was just last week that this firm was busy [“monitor[ing]” the market](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/norton-rose-no-match/) instead of boosting associate salaries, and now here we are, with a match in hand.

The firm we’re talking about, of course, is Norton Rose Fulbright, which brought home $1,877,933,000 gross revenue in 2020, ranking it at No. 13 on the most recent Am Law 100. Sources tell us that associates are “thrilled” by the news of their bigger, better salaries.

Here’s what the brand new salary scale looks like at NRF:



Before you get too excited, Norton Rose is doing the same thing it did during the [last round of raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/top-ranked-biglaw-firm-announces-market-raises-but-only-for-associates-in-some-offices/), and applying this new salary scale to only some of its offices. Associates in the firm’s California, New York, Texas, and D.C. offices will be on the $215K pay scale, while those in Minneapolis and St. Louis will have “opportunities to earn into the national pay scale.” Information on how associates can do that will be released shortly.

Congratulations to (almost) everyone at the firm on their new market salaries. For those in smaller markets, just remember, any raise is better than no raise!

# In Before The Wire -- Another Firm Raises Salaries
## What a nice way to start your three day weekend.

It’s just a few days before July 1, the effective date of most Biglaw firms’ associate raises, and the good folks at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman have, at last, stepped up to the plate. In a memo circulated today, associates learned that Kasowitz would raise the associate compensation scale to match the one set forth by Cravath earlier this month.

The firm is fully matching the MoneyLaw raises, starting first-year associates with base compensation of $180,000 and raising more senior associates between $20,000 and $35,000, depending on their class year. Summer associates will also see a raise. Counsel and associates more senior than the class of 2008 will be assessed on an individual basis. The new salary rates will be effective starting Friday — what a nice way to start your three-day weekend.

The one snag in general associate jubilation? Raises are only for the New York office. However, the firm notes that associates outside of New York will receive individualized information about their salary. Fingers crossed it’s good news for them as well.

# Biglaw Firm Wows With New Parental Leave Policy
## Hopefully other Biglaw firms will take note.

Recently there’s been a run of firms [announcing new](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/firm-offering-unlimited-parental-leave-for-all-parents/?rf=1) and[ improved plans](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/more-good-news-on-the-parental-leave-front/) for parental leave, though they’ve tended to come from the small — but prestigious — boutique firms. But on Friday, a Biglaw player decided to get in on the action announcing an impressive new program designed to provide new parents of all genders an opportunity to bond with their new babies.

Fenwick & West [announced](https://www.fenwick.com/Media/Pages/Fenwick-Expands-Parental-Leave-Policy.aspx) all attorney parents, irrespective of gender or caregiver status, will get 16 weeks of parental bonding time. Birthing mothers will receive 22 weeks of paid leave — the 16-week bonding time plus a minimum of 6 weeks pregnancy disability leave, which could be up to 29 weeks, depending on the actual time of disability.

As Fenwick managing partner Rodger Cole notes, this is an essential part of supporting their employees: “We want all of our professionals to flourish both personally and professionally. Programs like the new parental leave policy reflect our continuing investment and dedication towards that goal.”

This is only the latest way that Fenwick supports working parents at the firm:

Fenwick continues to enhance the ways it supports parents who return to work. The firm offers access to consultants and coaches to help with back-to-work transitions, backup daycare and other childcare resources, a milk-shipping program for nursing mothers who travel on business, and privacy rooms in all firm offices, including the option to install privacy blinds for mothers who prefer the option to pump in their own office.

Plus, the firms offers a Transition Mentor Program and Parents Affinity Group to provide networks of support to parents. They also have various flexible work options available for attorneys interested in working a reduced schedule for a time after returning from leave.

Congratulations to Fenwick for stepping up their leave program. Hopefully other Biglaw firms will take note.

# Quinn Emanuel Benchslapped For Saying Use Of 'N-Word' Was Bad Joke
## The judge wasn't particularly amused by this 'joke.'

Her Honor is displeased.

I was baffled by the description of this as a joke. I just don’t understand the humor. I don’t understand how someone thought it was humorous. I don’t understand why Quinn Emanuel is taking the position that it was a joke.

I was surprised [that the firm] attempted to cast the use of the N-word as a poor attempt at humor or a bad pun. Remarks such as those are unacceptable in a civilized conversation. When they happen in a workplace, particularly when they come from a supervisor, not only are they unacceptable, they can be a basis for civil liability.

— Judge [Valerie Caproni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_E._Caproni) of the Southern District of New York, in remarks made from the bench as she refused to dismiss a former secretary’s [discrimination complaint](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/03/12/quinn-emanuel-loses-early-bid-to-throw-out-race-bias-suit/) against Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. The plaintiff in this case, Spencer Marin, claims that the firm’s director of trial logistics [called a black staff member a “re-n***er”](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/03/12/quinn-emanuel-loses-early-bid-to-throw-out-race-bias-suit/) after the staff member had second thoughts about sharing her food during a trial in California. Marin alleges that after he complained, he was sent back to New York.

# Always Remember The Federalist Critique Of The Bill Of Rights
## Be careful with nonexclusive lists.

Way back in the 1700-whatevers, back when Hamilton took place, the Federalists famously opposed the Bill of Rights because they thought it was confusingly redundant. Their concern was that, since the Constitution already set forth that the federal government was one of limited, enumerated powers, to enumerate some of the rights allocated to the people would make people think that those were the only rights held by the people. As a matter of political prediction, this wasn’t too far off. But even more accurately, it was a very good model of how people read lists.

For whatever deep reason of human psychology, people always tend to treat specific lists as exclusive, even if intended and clearly presented as otherwise. People focus on the immediate items listed out over anything else. This is surprisingly applicable to the practice of law. For instance, in document demands, while “including but not limited to” constructions are common, I’ve always secretly suspected that many reviewers do nothing but work off of the list alone. Am I too cynical? Very possibly, but even if it’s only sometimes true, it’s worth factoring into how you draft document requests. Resist the urge to rely too much on “including but not limited to,” and instead spend a little extra time to list anything you care about at all in the enumerated items.

Beyond document requests, then, this principal applies to other things as well. Lists are big, exciting things. For instance, in a brief, lists take up a surprising amount of space and tend to draw the eye, especially lists with pleasingly odd numbers such as three or, if we are getting elaborate, five. But they tend to be so exciting that they draw away from the rest — if you make a more subtle point around the same page, it’s likely to not get as much attention.

The same applies in communicating at any time, be it with a judge, adversary, or colleague. Specific points always tend to get the attention, and crowd out more general points. If you carefully choose your specific point, this is an asset: you are intentionally drawing attention to the point you wish to, and doing so properly. But if you intended your specific points to be only examples, then you have backed yourself into a quagmire by your words, however well intended they may have been.

So remember, as you go about your days, the lesson of the Federalists and their handling of enumerated lists.

# Cravath Announces Bonuses -- Now The 2019 Bonus Season Can Really Begin
## What does the perennial compensation leader have to say about 2019 bonuses?

This year, bonus season came early, what with Milbank jumping the gun and announcing bonuses very early — [November 7th](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/), to be precise. But with bonus levels the same as last year, lots of[ folks were actually disappointed](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/biglaws-reactions-to-same-bank-bonuses/) about the static amounts and thought Milbank had work to do to live up to its “Thrillbank” moniker.

So with the first bonus volley welcomed, but a little lackluster, Biglaw waited for perennial compensation leader, Cravath, to make their move. If they up the ante, then that becomes the new industry standard for those firms wanting to prove their position at the top of the Biglaw heap. If they hold the line, well, with[ fears of a recession looming](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/just-because-billing-rates-are-up-doesnt-mean-bonuses-will-follow/), who could blame them? But either course would shape the tone of the rest of the bonus season.

Well, the wait is over. This afternoon, they announced, and, well, here are the numbers:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000

Yup, it’s the same as Milbank (and last year’s bonuses). So, for the time being at least, Cravath is letting Milbank set the standard. It seems likely that now that these two compensation powerhouses have weighed in, the rest of the industry will fall in line. [(Read the full memo on the next page.)](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/2/)

Early reactions from ATL tipsters are similar to the murmurings from Milbank’s announcement:

Cravath announces bonuses and they’re the same. Cravath associates disappointed given many recent successes for the firm and the fact that 2018 compensation was higher with summer bonus.

But the economy is in a precarious position, and this move is right on-brand for a traditionally risk adverse industry (and still generous despite them being the same as last year’s bonuses).

# Kasowitz Suing Its Janitors Just In Time For The Holidays
## Timing is a big part of litigation and this... isn't great timing.

The festive season is already going to be a little dimmer than most years thanks to the pandemic and global economic meltdown. But over at Kasowitz, the holidays are just another opportunity to extend their brand — a brand that’s recently gotten them [openly mocked by the Lincoln Project](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/kasowitz-benson-told-to-peddle-their-scare-tactics-elsewhere/) — by suing their own custodial staff.

The NY state court summons — dated last week — names ABM Janitorial Services Northeast and Quality Building Services as defendants in an action for “breach of contract, breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment,” arising out of alleged overpayments to the tune of $563,717.31.

Obviously the summons doesn’t provide a lot information and the complaint is not readily available online yet, so we can’t pass judgment on the merits of this action. Could Kasowitz be trying to recover payments for custodial services charged while out of the office? Because that could drastically change what a client might need from a janitorial contract. On the other hand, custodial services are broader than just picking up after people who leave a cloud of crumbs around their desk after eating their fourth straight meal in the office and a lot of what they do is necessary even if no one is showing up. And how many months does it take to get half a million behind before it gets to this point? It will be interesting to see the whole scope of this action.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But aside from the substance of the claim, as we often point out, the business of law is as much about the business as it is the law and sometimes discretion is the better part of valor when it comes to protecting the former. After a public clowning for advancing claims that Jared Kushner was defamed by his own direct quote and coming off a year that [saw a disturbing revenue miss](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/04/30/kasowitz-revenue-fell-in-2019-but-firm-optimistic-about-disputes-renaissance/), maybe the holidays isn’t the time to pick a public fight with service personnel.

I mean… wait until January at the very least!

(Feel free to check out the summons on the next page.)

# Latham Joins The Market For Associate Compensation -- Is This A Good Time To Ask If Staff Will Get The Same Love?
## While we celebrate associate raises, perhaps it's time to think about all the other employees that make a Biglaw firm run.

No one really expected Latham to sit out the latest round of associate salary increases. The firm is too big and the momentum to match is too strong at this point. Would Latham have really walked into on-campus interviews paying associates less than their peers? Of course not.

So, as expected, Latham will be matching the market scale all the way up, including summer bonuses for all U.S. associates as well as those in the Middle East, China, and the UK. So this is good news for a lot of people, even if it did take the firm an inordinately long time to get around to announcing it.

The bonuses aren’t as happy. Even though the firm matched the summer bonuses, they’ll be awarded based on end-of-year standards with no provision to “catch up” by billing more down the stretch. UPDATE: Tipsters say that they will be “trued up” which makes sense because it is the emerging market standard.

In any event, one group that doesn’t necessarily see this as good news are the secretaries and the rest of the staff. Perhaps this is a good time to address just what raises look like to the hardworking people who aren’t getting nearly $200K to make rookie error after rookie error. On the one hand, firm staff aren’t burdened with the same crippling debt as associates, who see a good chunk of their hefty salaries shunted away toward debt servicing every month. On the other hand, cost of living increases don’t just impact lawyers, and the whole staff have seen the real value of their wages sink too. And given that we’ve been justifying this round of raises as all about inflation, there’s not really a good reason to leave the staff out of it.

While this disparity impacts every firm to varying degrees, it’s fitting to raise during a conversation about Latham because the firm recently issued raises for some legal secretaries according to tipsters and the results were… uninspiring. Reports that secretaries secured raises of pennies per hour highlight how extreme the gap is between the lawyers and the rest of the staff when it comes to compensation.

And it only gets worse every time we have another round of raises.

# 70 Percent Of Biglaw Firms Are Not On Board With $190K For First Year Associates
## The gulf between the Biglaw haves and have-nots continues to grow.

We’ve spilled a lot of digital ink here at Above the Law detailing [every move in the associate salary wars](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2018-associate-salary-increase/). And, as last summer proved, that can be exciting. Last June, Milbank thrilled the Biglaw world with new base compensation for associates, starting first-year associates at $190,000. Not to be outdone, this was matched by Simpson Thacher, who topped those numbers by adding a special bonus to the raises. Cravath finally came to play, slightly increasing salaries from the Milbank scale for senior associates. All of which resulted in a [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale, and every time a firm matched, ATL was on the scene.

But, nearly a year later, it seems not everyone was excited to pay junior associates with no work experience $190,000. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/05/22/many-firms-didnt-buy-into-the-latest-round-of-associate-pay-raises-report-finds/) Law.com, a study by the National Association for Law Placement (NALP) reveals that most firms held the course on starting salaries in 2018:

Few firms, in fact, have hit the $190,000 benchmark, according to the report. Although $190,000 is the most frequently occurring salary in Big Law, accounting for 29.3% of reported first-year associate salaries, smaller shops and firms with head counts between 501 and 700 didn’t budge and reported flat associate salary growth in 2018.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The NALP Associate Salary Survey included respondents from more than 300 firms, with 70 percent of them with more than 251 attorneys.

In a statement on the survey, NALP executive director James Leipold threw some shade our way — but we can take it (and we know you love reading about it, so…):

“As with other associate base pay hikes in the past, while the press focus is usually on how quickly law firms race to meet a market change like this one, the data reveal that there are in fact many large law firm offices that are still not paying $190,000 as a base first-year salary,” NALP executive director James Leipold said in a statement.

There were also [regional differences](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/) in associate starting salaries. Most associates on the $190,000 scale work in major markets, such as New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, or Dallas.

# Black Paralegal Mistaken For Drug Dealer Left 'Humiliated' By Encounter With Police
## He was headed to a client meeting and wearing business attire when he was stopped and searched.

A Black paralegal is speaking out after a racial profiling incident by police left him feeling “vulnerable and targeted.”

This story comes to us from [Legal Cheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/03/black-paralegal-felt-vulnerable-and-targeted-after-being-stopped-by-police-on-the-way-to-visit-a-client/), a legal website that’s based across the pond in England. According to LC, Eldred Taylor-Camara, a caseworker for a London-based solicitors firm, was traveling by train when several British Transport Police (BTP) stopped him for questioning and searched him because he “look[ed] suspicious.” Here are the details:

When he asked the officers for an explanation as to why they had stopped him, Taylor-Camara says they told him he looked “lost” which “raised their suspicion”.

The paralegal, who was wearing a suit at the time, said the experience made him feel “felt vulnerable and targeted,” and that he was “concerned by the glaring mistakes” by officers “purportedly acting on intelligence”.

The police said they had received “intelligence” and that the aspiring lawyer matched the description of an “extremely violent” drug dealer in the area.

However, Taylor-Camara believes that he was racially profiled and that police failed to provide a “robust explanation” as to why he was stopped for “extensive questioning”.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Taylor-Camara said the police run-in “unnerving,” and it “showed the disassociation of the police between themselves and those in the public who are likely to encounter this kind of treatment — specifically, people who are Black and male.” He continued, saying, “Due to the conduct of the officers and the inadequacy of the response to my complaint, the only plausible rationale that I could draw at the time is I was stopped because I am a young Black man.”

Taylor-Camara filed a complaint with BTP, but to no avail. It said: “The conduct of the officers left me feeling intimidated and publicly humiliated. Despite my formal attire and explanation that I worked for a solicitor’s firm, I was treated with suspicion and subjected to extensive questioning.”

BTP offered this statement, in relevant part, following Taylor-Camara’s decision to go public with his treatment:

“Following the stop a complaint was received and, as with every complaint we receive, was subjected to a thorough investigation by our Professional Standards Department (PSD). Body worn footage of the stop was reviewed by senior officers and accounts were taken from all the officers involved. The result of this investigation was that the service provided was acceptable and no further action was taken.

Our officers who patrol the railway and engage with passengers every day are not there to cause distress, but to ensure everyone is safe and that the network remains a hostile environment for offenders to operate in. Stopping passengers to speak to them is part and parcel of that, and we will always provide our full rationale for doing so.”

In comments given to [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/black-solicitor-racially-profiled-police-b2297295.html), Taylor-Camara said, “The most important thing for me is spreading awareness about this issue. For those who experience it, I’m aware that this is nothing new. However, for those who are trying to pursue a professional career, thinking it affords them protection from being profiled … I want them to be aware that this is still a possibility. It’s important to highlight this reality, so it informs others.”

# Mo Money, Mo Problems
## Biglaw’s latest salary hikes are a big problem for associates

The salary wars are on again. The first domino fell last week when Milbank [raised its first-year starting salary](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) in New York to $190,000. The major players in the New York market [started following suit](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises-2018/?rf=1) shortly thereafter. All expectations are that most New York firms will have made a move in the next few weeks, in time for on-campus recruiting of next year’s batch of first-year associates. And as goes New York, so goes the rest of the U.S. marketplace. First-year salaries in all 50 states will likely creep up over the coming weeks and months. Speaking as an advocate for associates everywhere, this is likely a disaster in the making.

The Underbelly of Big Salaries

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The victims of the latest salary wars will be associates. How is that possible? Isn’t giving associates more money a good thing? Yes and no. If you’re an associate whose only goal is to make bank for a few years and cash out, these raises are great news. However, if you’re hoping to build your practice over time, make partner, and have some semblance of a personal life, these raises may turn out to be your worst nightmare.

As I’ve written about over the past months, law firms today outside of the Am Law 25 are facing unique and daunting challenges. [Alternative legal service providers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/king-kong-is-coming-to-crush-your-practice-with-a-calculator/) are taking a chunk out of a marketplace we used to have to ourselves. The vast majority of industry growth is being [gobbled up](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/in-defense-of-more-sizzle-less-steak/) by those already at the top of the market. Firm clients, [and even firms themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/a-crisis-of-confidence-in-law-firms/), are doubting that lawyers are up to the task of keeping pace with the changing demands of the industry. Demand remains stagnant as more clients are dragging work in-house. It’s tough everywhere outside the top of the market, and it appears it’s only going to get tougher.

Milbank, Cravath, Kirkland, and the other megawatt law firms can pretty easily afford to offer salary bumps. They’re the ones seeing major growth, and the ones who aren’t feeling major client pressure to keep their rates down. It makes all the sense in the world for them to throw more money at recruiting, because they have the money to do it. Yet it’s a foregone conclusion that the rest of the legal market, which isn’t seeing those kinds of gains, is going to follow suit shortly. Rather than ask whether they should, firms will double down on our existing, dated, broken legal model and raise their incoming salaries.

When your revenue is flat, and you increase your costs, one of three things has to happen. Either (1) profits go down, ticking off your partnership, (2) hourly rates go up, angering clients (at least one in-house attorney client is already venting their frustration at these new raises, calling them “[astounding](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-tone-deafness-is-astounding-an-in-house-hot-take-on-the-190k-salary-scale/?rf=1)” in their tone-deafness), or (3) the demands on associates to earn those new salaries go up, burning out the incoming classes.

Every single one of these results is bad news for a law firm, and since bad news tends to run downhill, it’ll be bad news for the associates who are supposedly benefiting from these salary raises. If the partnership gets grumpy, the risk of defections increases, while the firm’s ability to attract new books of business laterally decreases. If the clients get angry, they’re at risk of moving their business over to a firm with a more value-oriented approach, or clawing it back in-house. Most firms don’t want to see either of these scenarios happen, so they’ll probably opt for door number three: demand more of their incoming associates in order to justify their new salaries.

Biglaw Meets Karoshi

The fact is, we can’t afford to ask more of our associates. Or rather, our associates can’t afford to have us ask more of them. The conversation on whether the legal market has healthy expectations is over. It doesn’t. Our market, as it currently exists, expects long hours of high performance. Many firms expect major sacrifices of their associates’ personal lives. We already ask too much of them. Asking more is a bad, bad idea.

This subject can literally be a life-and-death issue. Over in Japan, young employees have overworked themselves to death so often that there’s a word for it: [karoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kar%C5%8Dshi). Otherwise healthy kids in their 20s and 30s are dropping dead from strokes and heart attacks due to intense, unceasing work expectations. It isn’t limited to Japan, either. Speaking personally, I nearly died back in 2013 from a rare form of kidney disease, induced in part by the insane hours I was keeping. It shouldn’t take a brush with the hereafter to make us realize that the course we’re on, as an industry, is untenable.

There’s also the rarely discussed problem of what to do with midlevel and senior associates. The big players in New York tend to boost all associate salaries in proportion to one another, but the rest of the market often can’t afford to do so. Many firms just boost their first-year associate salaries to keep up the perception they’re paying top dollar for talent, but scale back when it comes to bumping their more established associates’ salaries. The end result is salary compression, where a senior associate may be more profitable and capable than a first-year, but not making materially more. The senior associates get justifiably angered, and the junior associates look ahead a few years and only see a future of more responsibility for modest compensation increases. When the sugar high of this national salary bump wears off, the vast majority of the recipients of those raises end up less happy, not more.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Being a first-year associate isn’t easy. I remember how scary it is, how hard of an adjustment it is to make. You’re working longer hours than you ever have, you’re learning how to handle office politics, and you’re realizing how thoroughly law school failed to train you for actual practice. To all the law graduates and first-years reading this, please know [I’m with you](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/a-letter-to-an-incoming-associate/). Being told a salary raise is a bad idea may feel callous, but it comes from a place of compassion. I’m not some old coot in a rocking chair raging about how kids these days have it too easy. To the contrary. I’m saying this because I want associates to be functional, happy, healthy human beings — not profit-generators to be replaced when they inevitably wear out.

Full Bank Account, Empty Soul

Too often, law firms forget they have tools in their toolkit beyond raising salaries. Lots of firms pay their associates well. Precious few train them up, give them early chances at advanced practice, and treat them as valued human beings. Associates cannot live on direct deposits alone. Let’s try feeding their souls in addition to their bank accounts and see how that goes for a while.

The results might just surprise everyone.

# The Most Searched For Biglaw Firms (2022)
## What did your firm do last year that made people search for it over and over again?

Biglaw firms are ranked in a multitude of ways, from gross revenue to size to quality of life and even prestige. But what about what may actually matter most, the number of people who are searching for these Biglaw firms on Google? Those searching could be associates and partners interested in salary information or looking to lateral, existing or potential clients, and even members of the media interested in tracking down a hot law firm story.

So, which Biglaw firms came out on top of this new ranking? For that, we turn to the [Mad Clientist blog](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/the-most-searched-for-law-firms-of-2022) of BTI Consulting Group. Without further ado, here are the most searched Biglaw firms in the Am Law Top 30:

Sidley
Morgan Lewis
Latham
Jones Day
Skadden

It’s no wonder that Sidley is leading the pack here. The firm was targeted by Republican Texas legislators over its [abortion travel costs policy](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/texas-legislators-threaten-sidley-over-abortion-care-travel-costs/) in the wake of Roe v. Wade being struck down as unconstitutional. Jones Day landing in at the top of the list isn’t a shocker either, considering the fact that a book was released last year that provided a deep dive on [how the “evil empire” handled many of Trump’s legal affairs](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/jones-day-the-evil-empire-of-the-biglaw-world/) during his presidency.

And here are the most searched Biglaw firms in the rest of the Am Law 100:

Cravath
Wilson Sonsini
WilmerHale
Nelson Mullins
Morrison Foerster

Of course Cravath is No. 1 here! The legal world was waiting on pins and needles to see what its 2022 year-end bonus structure would look like. Would it [match Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-bonus-season-begins/)? Of course [it would](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cravath-bonuses-22/). And the rest of the [Biglaw market quickly fell in line](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2022/) after Cravath gave the bonus scale its seal of approval.

# Nationwide Pay Raise Watch: A Biglaw Firm Moves To Market Across America
## Does this mean anything for the broader Biglaw market? Only time will tell.

It was just yesterday that we launched our [“NY to 190” series](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/ny-to-190k-5-arguments-in-favor-of-a-biglaw-pay-hike/), providing arguments in support of a Biglaw pay hike. We noted that pay raises had been spreading to smaller legal markets around the country, and that considering we now live in an increasingly interconnected age, geography should be less relevant to compensation. We’re happy to report at least one firm took these arguments to heart.

People tell us that [Hunton & Williams](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/hunton-williams/) has moved to a national $160,000 salary scale for all U.S. associates. A spokesperson from Hunton has confirmed the firm’s pay raise across all offices. It may not be $190K, but it’s certainly a step in the right direction.

Here is what one of our tipsters tells us about Hunton’s bold move in terms of salary:

While this doesn’t impact associates in markets like DC and NY, whose starting salary was already $160k, for those in other markets, like Richmond (the firm’s biggest office), their starting salary moved from $145k to $160k. The rest of the pay scale has adjusted accordingly. People are very excited, and this move was fairly unexpected.

“Hunton has always been the market leader in places like Richmond, and this move continues that trend,” a source said. Hunton associates across America will be making New York money in places like Atlanta, Georgia, and Charlotte, North Carolina. The increase in purchasing power Hunton bestowed upon its associates is worthy of praise.

Congratulations, Hunton & Williams associates! You’ve earned it (literally).

With OCI season just around the corner, law students will certainly want to give Hunton & Williams a second look now that it’s brought market pay to all of its offices.

The unprecedented demand for lateral associates over the past year is reaching a crescendo: with year-end reviews and bonus distributions out of the way, peak lateral associate hiring season is upon us.  There is no better time to craft and refine your resume for maximum marketability in a competitive lateral applicant pool.  At Lateral Link, we constantly engage with associate resumes and are well attuned to the most common areas for improvement.

Your resume is one element in the lateral hiring process over which you have complete control.  While there is no one-size-fits-all model for drafting an exemplary resume, implementing some best practices can help enhance your candidacy and set the tone for a positive interview process.

Structuring Your Resume

Keep in mind that firms focus on three main factors when reviewing lateral associate resumes and extending interview invitations: (1) law school ranking and academic performance; (2) the reputability and practice sophistication of the associate’s current firm; and (3) having the level of experience needed to fill the associate role.  In addition, firms consider elements such as diversity, firm committee involvement, pro-bono work, and leadership roles in bar associations and community organizations.

The two most important sections are Experience and Education.  The optimal order of these sections depends on your tenure.  For junior associates with academic credentials at least as strong as the prestige of your current firm, beginning with the education section is customary.  At the junior level, your academic performance matters more to firms, and you will also have less law firm experience to describe.  If you are a junior associate who attended a lower-ranked law school or attained a mediocre GPA, but you work at a prestigious firm, it is better to lead with your experience section.  You may also consider beginning with your experience section if you have more experience than would be typical for your year level (e.g., a corporate associate with substantial ancillary document drafting experience or a litigation associate with motion practice or deposition experience).  Leading with your experience section in this context can be particularly helpful if you are applying for a position where you may be just under the targeted year level.

For mid-level and senior associates (i.e., third-year level and up), firms will generally expect you to lead with your experience section, demonstrating core practitioner skills and establishing that you will be able to hit the ground running.  Firms typically also expect a deal-sheet for corporate transactional associates when they reach their third year of practice.

After your experience and education sections, you should include your bar admissions (if relocating, you can include a brief explanatory statement about your bar admission status or bar eligibility in the state of the firm’s office).  You can also include positions held in bar associations as well as involvement in community and philanthropic organizations.  For associates with a significant gap between college and law school, it is helpful to include your work experience during these years.  Showcasing this experience can be especially helpful for IP associates who were engineers prior to attending law school.  It is appropriate to include interests or hobbies outside of work, as this can help make an associate more relatable in the interview process.

Either one or two pages is an acceptable length.  However, if your resume is two pages, it is critical that there be some content relevant to practicing law on the second page.  Do not devote a second page only to interests or hobbies.

Education Section

The education section, and specifically your law school section, should highlight honors such as cum laude, magna cum laude, with Honors, with Distinction, and Order of the Coif.  I recommend including your law school GPA if it is at least 3.3.  While most firms will have your law school transcript, attorneys briefly reviewing your resume may assume your GPA is low if you do not list it.  Class rank is helpful to include only if you are in the top 20% of your class.  Law review membership is the most valued law school credential after academic performance.  Editorial positions and membership on primary or other law reviews should be highlighted.  It is also helpful to include positions and membership in student organizations, such as the Student Bar Association and diversity affinity groups.  Finally, while I do not see this mistake frequently, I see it often enough to mention — your degree is a “Juris Doctor,” not a “Juris Doctorate.”

Firms are less focused on undergraduate academic performance and do not typically expect you to include your GPA.  For most majors, you should only include a GPA of 3.5 or higher.  However, IP associates with hard science majors should include their GPA if it is at least 3.3, as firms look closer at candidates’ college grades for patent prosecution and IP litigation positions.  Note that for consistency, if you are not including your law school GPA, you should not include your undergraduate GPA.

Experience Section

The law firm experience section of your resume should effectively demonstrate substantive experience handling sophisticated matters in your practice area.  It is essential to provide details regarding both the types of matters you have worked on and, importantly, your specific role and the assignments you completed for the transactions or cases.  Law firms want to know what types of assignments prospective associates can handle from day one.  In reviewing associate resumes, I often see initial drafts containing general practice descriptions, such as: “Represent and advise clients on a range of M&A, private equity, and other corporate transactions.”  An improvement of this description will encompass more pertinent details on the client base, types of transactions, and deal-size range, such as: “Represent private equity sponsors and public and privately held corporate clients on complex transactions ranging from $100 million to $10 billion in deal value, including mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, divestitures, growth equity investments, joint ventures, and other corporate matters.”

Litigation associates should similarly describe their practice in detail.  An example of a compelling introductory bullet point for a litigation associate: “Represent public and privately-held companies and shareholders in federal and state court in connection with a variety of litigation matters, including litigation under federal securities and commodities laws, class action defense, breach of contract and restrictive covenants, breach of fiduciary duty, media and defamation law, and other complex commercial litigation.”

Following an initial practice overview bullet point, it is vital to detail specific functions you performed on matters and the types of work product that you completed.  In describing your work, remember that corporate transactional practice groups appreciate document drafting and negotiation experience more than due diligence.  Thus, the second experience bullet point should specify the types of transactional documents you have drafted, prioritizing primary documents over ancillary ones.  Litigation associates should lead with deposition, trial, and motion practice experience over document review and written discovery.

The law firm experience section should also contain involvement in firm committees and other initiatives, such as summer associate recruiting, diversity and inclusion affinity groups, and pro bono work.  Including committee positions and participation demonstrates leadership qualities, good corporate citizenship, shared DEI values, and being well-regarded at your current firm.

Be sure to consistently use present tense for your current position and past tense for previous positions.  Additionally, while not major issue, if listing a series of matters or types of work product, there is a slight preference for using a serial/Oxford comma.  The most important thing is to be consistent.

# Faegre Baker And Drinker Biddle To Merge
## Big news for a soon-to-be big firm.

So many firms announce “advanced merger talks” that end up going nowhere, it’s nice to see some crazy kids go out and actually make it work. While the firms have not made a public announcement yet, reports are that the Faegre Baker’s and Drinker Biddle’s partnerships voted overwhelmingly to merge effective February 1, 2020 to become Faegre Drinker. That tracks with a domain name that was preemptively registered in October.

The merger creates a new firm of nearly 1,200 lawyers and over 400 equity partners that ALM Intelligence recently predicted would be sufficient to [push the new firm into the Am Law 50](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/11/13/faegre-baker-daniels-drinker-biddle-in-merger-talks/).

The new firm will have 22 offices, overlapping in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. That’s actually a surprisingly low amount of overlap for two firms of this size.

# Travis Kelce Offers Andy Reid Critical Legal Insight During Super Bowl
## Some solid legal meme work last night.

At one point during the Super Bowl, Kansas City’s struggle to score points prompted Travis Kelce to get in his head coach’s face to air some sort of complaint about the offense. Andy Reid didn’t seem to mind much, claiming that his fiery relationship with Kelce “[keeps me young](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/super-bowl-2024-irate-travis-kelce-screams-at-andy-reid-heres-what-they-said-about-it-after-chiefs-ot-win/).” Which is a feat since Reid is now — with Pete Carroll and Bill Belichick out of jobs — the oldest coach in the game.

In any event, the image proved memeworthy and while a lot of social media communities tried to make it their own, lawyers really went above and beyond last night.

Maggie Webber and her newborn son

What could possibly be more exciting than graduating from law school knowing that you’re about to embark upon a career at a law firm with a [starting salary of $180,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/branch-office-raises-push-texas-firm-to-match-180k/)? Giving birth to your first child during your law school graduation.

Meet Margaret “Maggie” Webber, a recent graduate of the University of Houston Law Center. She was supposed to walk across the stage to receive her law degree on May 13, but instead, she went into labor. “I love the timing, I wouldn’t have changed a thing,” she said. Here’s more from the [Houston Chronicle](http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/UH-law-student-gives-birth-on-graduation-day-11171733.php):

Webber said she took most of her tough classes early in her law school education so classes were lighter during her pregnancy. …

When asked if [her son] Beau will retain some of the lectures, Webber laughs, “I sure hope so. I just hope he doesn’t argue with me too much when he’s older.” …

“It was a great experience. The administration was really helpful,” Webber said of going to school while pregnant. “People do hard things every day. Being pregnant and going to law school is hard, but there are harder things.”

Webber plans to take the Texas bar exam in July, and will begin working at the Houston office of Vinson & Elkins this fall. Luckily, the firm — named on [Yale Law Women’s Top Ten Family Friendly list](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/the-top-10-most-family-friendly-law-firms-2016/) — offers flexible working arrangements, a new parent mentoring program, and subsidized child care.

What a memorable way to “graduate” from law school. Congratulations to Maggie Webber on the birth of her son, and best of luck on the bar exam!

# Biglaw Firm May Never Go Back To One Of Its Offices Full Time Thanks To COVID Lockdown Rules
## We suspect many more firms may soon come to the same realization.

What with the rollback of the majority of its coronavirus crisis austerity measures, Biglaw may have thought it was done with COVID-19, but COVID-19 is far from done with Biglaw. The pandemic continues to rage across the globe and things are only getting worse, with certain countries already reinstituting regional lockdowns. Take, for example, what’s currently going on in Ireland. The situation has gotten so bad, so quickly, that the country has moved into the highest level of its COVID-19 restrictions, imposing a six-week shutdown in an effort to flatten the curve as cases continue to rise. More than 100,000 jobs are expected to be lost in mere days.

Given recent events, Eversheds Sutherland — an international firm that comes in at No. 35 on the Global 200 rankings — isn’t sure that there will ever be a full return to employees working full time in its Irish offices in Belfast and Dublin. [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/2020/10/27/eversheds-does-not-expect-to-ever-return-to-full-time-office-work-in-ireland-292-76254/) has a statement from the firm:

An Eversheds spokesperson said the firm is “very well placed to once again acclimatise to remote working” following its long-term focus on technology, but does not “envisage there will ever be a full return to the office”.

The firm has “established ‘operational groups’, leveraging the expertise of our colleagues across the world, to plan for the future of our working environment”.

“We are confident that the measures we have put in place will equip our people to meet the demands of the new normal working environment”, the spokesperson added.

Biglaw firms will be doing even more remote working as we inch toward 2021. Let’s hope things improve when it comes to COVID containment in the months to come.

# Wait A Second, Why *Is* Sidley The Employer Targeted Over Abortion Travel Costs Policy?
## Hmmm.... makes you wonder.

In the wake of the[ Supreme Court’s demolition of reproductive freedom](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/the-end-of-roe-is-here/) precedent, a number of employers (including a bunch of law firms) have decided to cover the travel costs of employees, should they seek an abortion or other banned procedures in jurisdictions where they’re no longer legal. But only one — Biglaw firm Sidley Austin — [received a letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/texas-legislators-threaten-sidley-over-abortion-care-travel-costs/) from the ironically named Texas Freedom Caucus threatening a number of repercussions over the policy.

Now, as [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/white-house-slams-texas-republicans-targeting-sidley-on-abortion) Bloomberg Law, the White House has weighed in on the threatening letter, with assistant press secretary Alexandra Lamanna saying, “These punitive actions and extreme proposals from elected Republicans are exactly what the President has been warning about.” She continued:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“The Supreme Court’s outrageous decision,” Lamanna said, “has given these Republican officials the green light for a radical agenda—including a nationwide abortion ban passed by Congress—and they are accelerating their agenda to take away Americans’ rights, now attacking the Constitutional right to travel between states at will.”

Although [some media reports](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2022/07/08/sidley-and-law-firms-get-warning-from-texas-lawmakers-on-abortion-pay-policy/) have posited that the letter from the Texas Freedom Caucus was a warning to all Texas firms, it is not, in fact addressed to all Texas firms. Just Sidley. And that’s despite [numerous Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/06/which-biglaw-firms-will-cover-travel-expenses-for-employees-who-can-no-longer-access-abortion-care/) with offices in Texas coming out and saying they’d also pay for travel costs if an employee wants abortion care. Indeed, according to the [Caucus’s own website](https://www.freedomfortexas.com/blog/), the only threatening letter they’ve sent out — to any employer at all — has been to Sidley.

Inspired by an email from a tipster, this fact got me thinking about why Sidley was targeted. The [most prestigious law firm](https://firsthand.co/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/texas) in Texas, Vinson & Elkins, has also pledged to pay for employees’ travel expenses, [but curiously](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/this-biglaw-firm-is-flip-flopping-harder-than-ihop-on-supporting-the-right-to-choose/), haven’t been threaten like Sidley. Kirkland & Ellis is the law firm that makes the most money and will also cover travel costs, and… no letter. Could it be, and this is speculation, that of the prestigious law firms in Texas, only a few have women leading them? Hence that letter, addressed to Sidley’s Yvette Ostolaza.

Maybe Dick’s Sporting Goods’ CEO Lauren Hobart should expect a similar letter soon.

# The Best Brands In Biglaw: A Mostly Subjective Ranking That We Can Talk About!
## Are these the best law firms in the world? Maybe. Maybe not.

Everyone loves a good ranking. There’s something about the human psyche — or at least the American psyche — that can’t get enough of putting things in a proper order and imbuing that list with outsized importance.

Some rankings are fairly objective. We can rank the top scoring teams of the season and we can tell everyone which firms are making the most money. Or… [maybe we can](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/just-how-accurate-are-am-laws-rankings/). What those rankings mean is another question altogether. Top scorers don’t necessarily win. Revenue generating behemoths may be houses of cards. But there’s at least something tangible there.

Other rankings are more subjective. That doesn’t actually render them meaningless. In a sense, they can be more “accurate” because they covertly reflect a tangled mess of overlapping objective factors that the respondents may not be able to consciously untangle. Still, it’s a list of “feels” so a ranking like this has to be taken with an ample dosage of sodium.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
BTI Consulting Group just put out its [2019 list of “brand elite,”](https://www.bticonsulting.com/brand-elite-for-law-firms) which attempts to track the firms that clients trust by tracking clients’ “unprompted responses to the consulting firm about which law firms they believe meet a number of different criteria making up a strong brand.”

It’s actually a cool way of getting to the heart of who clients trust. On the other hand, it’s far more Family Feud than Jeopardy. When clients speak highly of a particular firm, are they complimenting the firm or their law school buddy who handles some limited work for them? We don’t know. It’s a collection of “feels” — take it for what it’s worth and don’t give it more determinative power than it warrants.

So, with that said, “we asked a bunch of GCs about the best brand in Biglaw… survey says!”

# Black Hair, Big Law (Part I): It All Started With Ketanji
## Is natural Black hair compatible with working in Big Law? Of course, the answer is yes.

I’ve always found the superficial side of deep, probing questions oddly compelling. When President Joe Biden announced that he was going to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court, my first remark, of course, was, “That’s great but, how will she wear her hair?”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I’ve been not-so-secretly obsessed with hair, specifically Black hair, for as long as I can remember. Just like someone else’s French fries always taste better than your own, it’s the same with obsessing over hair. Other women’s hair-care routines much are much more exciting than my own.

For ages I’ve had a love/hate relationship with my hair, but it’s come full circle and I now absolutely love the way my hair coils. I love my tiny 4A ringlets. That being said, I don’t love the shrinkage. I don’t love the fact that my hair looks five times shorter than it really is. I don’t love the fact that growth seems to take forever grow. So am I “happy to be nappy”? Sometimes.

I do struggle, quite terribly, trying to achieve a polished look. There are some women who do it incredibly well. How I envy the sophisticated Olivia Popes and Ketanji Brown Jacksons of the world. I have never been able to master the effortlessly chic look.

Since having kids, however, my version of effortlessly chic now includes a (nearly) stain-free T-shirt, black yoga pants a size too small as I’m still trying to shift this pandemic weight-gain, flip-flops exposing the fact that my last pedicure was way too long ago, no make-up, reading glasses that only Velma from Scooby-Doo could appreciate, and wearing my hair slicked back in a banana clip showing off a single Afro puff. Yes, that’s me at my pandemic best.

Accordingly, when Ketanji Brown Jackson was finally nominated to the Supreme Court, while most academics and lawmakers were delving into her judicial and public defender past, I found myself admiring her sisterlocs and wondering how other Black attorneys and judges wore their hair daily?

Though I’m excited about what the future after law school holds, I’m equally trepidatious about starting a new job as an associate at a law firm after three years of WFH-do-nothing-with-my-hair bliss. My apprehension revolves around being utterly unsure about how diverse the law firm will be. Will they be accepting of my natural hair? As someone who is frequently the only Black person in any given situation, the anxiety is real.

Will I be the only Black associate at the firm? Are all the other Black staff part of the cleaning crew and cafeteria? Will they confuse me for the cleaning crew? How much of myself will I have to adapt/change/bury to “look the part” of a superstar in a firm steeped in male, white, corporate traditions? These questions constantly circle through my mind like hamster on a tread wheel.

Thus, when I was asked what sort of event the Black Law Student Association should do, I mentioned a Black hair, Big Law symposium.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
On October 27, 2022, the Black Law Students Association at George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School successfully held the [Black Hair, Big Law Symposium.](http://blackhairbiglaw.com/) It encompassed speeches, Black history, the CROWN Act, original research, and writing. The ultimate question of the event was “Is natural Black hair compatible with working in Big Law?”

Of course, the answer is yes. As one of our symposium speakers, Karis Stephens, a 3L from Penn said, “The legal profession which puts adherence to the ‘black letter law’ on a pedestal must make room for Blackness. And as it stands, this hair growing from my scalp is a legal battleground.”

Our headlining speakers included American Bar Association President Deborah Enix-Ross and CROWN Act architect, advisor, expert, and law professor Wendy Greene. Additionally, law professor Leslie Thomas KC, a barrister from the United Kingdom, spoke on “Why my barrister’s wig is culturally insensitive.” Law professors Patricia Broussard of FAMU and Shelly Page of Southern Illinois University were in conversation on “Policing our bodies: The expectations and professionalism of Black hair in law.” We also had Binta P. Mamadou, an associate at Allen and Overy LLP and founder of Visions Braid Bar. An attorney and the founder of a Black hair salon? Could anyone be more perfect to speak?

As part of the symposium, I coordinated and wrote the research analysis on the Black Hair Legal Professionals Survey. We surveyed over 200 lawyers, law students, paralegals, and other legal professionals about Black hair at their firm.  We received nearly 100 captivating firsthand experiences where hair was an issue at work for legal professionals.  We captured this in our [research](https://blackhairbiglaw.com/research) paper and [anthology](https://blackhairbiglaw.com/anthology).

Through our results we’ve been able to extract thought-provoking insights about how Black women wear their hair for their job interviews as opposed to how they wear their hair on a daily basis once they get the job. We have also extracted what percentage of individuals have changed their hair to feel more professional at work.

I’m thrilled with the results of the symposium and adding to the national dialogue on Black hair, natural hair, and now the dangers and controversies around [hair relaxers](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/i-did-not-expect-perms-to-be-legally-relevant-yet-here-we-are/). The symposium made me realize that there were other Black law students and legal professionals who share the same hair anxieties as me. Talking about it empowers us. Researching it gives us the data we need to make and be the change in Big Law. It’s all very exciting, and I can’t wait to share the results of our research in this Black Hair Big Law series.

# ATL Holiday Card Contest: The Winner! (2019)
## Congratulations to the new champ.

Last year, 3000 votes were cast in our annual holiday card contest which was an impressive showing for attorneys mostly disengaged from anything but their bonus memos that time of year. This year, over 19K votes were cast to crown this year’s champion.

The uptick in voting is assuredly the result of a back-and-forth contest where multiple entries vied for the top prize keeping everyone engaged. Ultimately, one firm pulled away from the pack and came close to doubling up second place when all was said and done.

This year’s champion is [Goodman Allen Donnelly](https://www.webbycards.com/2019/goodman/holiday-ecard.html), who brought us an animated based on cartoons drawn by founding partner Michael Goodman. Three-time champion [Wolf Greenfield](https://info.wolfgreenfield.com/happy-holidays-from-wolf-greenfield-2019) came in second with another stop-motion masterpiece and [Heyman Enerio Gattuso & Hirzel](https://hegh.law/2019-card.html) rode the BoHEGHian Rhapsody joke all the way into third.

# Accreditation Woes For Dallas's First Public Law School
## This isn't Jim Bob's Law School, but that doesn't mean the ABA will rubber-stamp accreditation.

After opening up two years ago, UNT Dallas Law School is now in danger of not being accredited by the ABA. And sure the ABA has its own [fair share of accreditation issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/aba-may-be-stripped-of-power-to-accredit-new-law-schools/), but despite its penchant for granting new law schools the necessary credentials, it recently found that the academic standards at UNT are not up to snuff. As the Dallas Morning News [reports](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20160808-unt-dallas-law-school-in-danger-of-not-getting-accredited.ece):

“It appears that the law school is admitting applicants that do not appear capable of satisfactorily completing its program of legal education and being admitted to the bar,” said the report, which was obtained by The News.

[Dean Royal] Furgeson said the school looks at other criteria when admitting students, including work history, advanced degrees and military service.

“We give careful consideration to other factors like grit and hard work that we think are indicative of their ability to get past the bar and become lawyers,” he said.

The school could try to assuage the bar association by requiring higher LSAT scores. But then the school stands to lose students — and tuition dollars.

Though the school’s first class has yet to graduate, meaning we do not yet know how they’ll fare on the bar exam, last fall one-fifth of students in that first class were on academic probation. So though the admitted students’ poor LSAT scores also feature in the ABA’s concerns over the school, there are other data points to give one pause.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

School leaders are touting [familiar lines](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/allowing-law-students-to-fail-the-bar-exam-is-not-a-good-way-to-diversify-the-legal-profession/) about the necessity of diversity in the legal world, which, is certainly true — the legal profession is in need of diversification by nearly every metric. But law schools also owe it to the students they admit to make sure they’ll be able to pass the bar exam and actually join the legal profession. Otherwise the debt accumulated by the students is no more than so many feathers in the law school’s nest, [with no tangible benefit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/allowing-law-students-to-fail-the-bar-exam-is-not-a-good-way-to-diversify-the-legal-profession/) for the students or society at large.

UNT Dallas Law is going to continue the accreditation process, in the hopes they’ll be able to get over that hurdle:

School leaders will go before a council of the bar association in October and argue why the school deserves accreditation.

“We’re glad we have a chance to go to the council and make our case, which we will do vigorously,” said Furgeson, a former U.S. District judge. If that doesn’t work, he said, “We’re gonna do whatever it takes to get there.” Schools can reapply.

As for students, well, they’re left waiting. Though optimism seems to be on the agenda:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Rachel Hawkins, who’s starting her third year at UNT law, said she and her classmates knew the risk when they enrolled. “We all took a big leap of faith and a gamble,” said Hawkins, who works in online marketing and goes to UNT part-time.

Still, she figured the school was too big to fail. She remains optimistic the school will succeed.

“This is UNT. This isn’t Jim Bob’s law school,” Hawkins said. “This is a public institution. This has been in the works for a long, long time.”

No, this isn’t Jim Bob’s Law School, but that doesn’t mean the ABA will rubber-stamp accreditation. Let’s just hope this irrepressibly sunny law student is actually able to transition into a career in the law.

# Biglaw Firm Kicks Off The New Year With A Round Of Layoffs
## The firm is citing a lack in demand as the reason for these job cuts.

With the threat of decreased demand thanks to the economic turndown, Biglaw firms are trying to get in shape and right-size for the new year. Unfortunately, that means firms are shedding attorneys and staff through layoffs. We’ve already seen layoffs (both stealth and outright) hit some of the most successful law firms, like [Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/stealth-layoffs-arrive-at-worlds-richest-biglaw-firm/), [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firm-makes-2-rounds-stealth-layoffs-billable-work-disappears-gunderson/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/), and [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/). Today, we have the details on even more layoffs, and the news is not good.

Stroock & Stroock & Lavan — a firm that pulled in $274,000,000 gross revenue in 2021, landing it in 128th place on the Am Law 200 — has laid off laid off 27 employees in total, a combination of both attorneys (nine) and business professionals (18) as the firm readies itself for a drop in demand.

The firm issued a brief statement on the matter, per the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/09/stroock-latest-big-law-firm-to-lay-off-staff-attorneys/):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Following a comprehensive review of each of our practice groups and the demand to be serviced by them in light of the current slowdown, we determined that we had more attorney and staff resources than we needed for the foreseeable future,” the statement reads. “Therefore, we decided to separate from nine attorneys and 18 staff/business professionals, with severance and other support being provided to help ease the transition. We wish our colleagues the best in their future endeavors.”

Through a spokesperson, the firm said that the layoffs on the attorney side were all “non-partners.”

Best of luck to those who are being let go from Stroock.

# Law Firm Meets Incubator: Driving Legal Innovation From Within
## Clifford Chance Applied Solutions provides another model that law firms can look to for practical means of driving innovation forward.

In [last month’s article](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/bringing-the-vc-into-the-law-firm/), we discussed how Dentons is pursuing an outside-in investment model in legal tech innovation by working with Nextlaw Labs and NextLaw Ventures. Leverage of a venture capital model is a unique approach for a law firm to spur innovation — but there are certainly other approaches.

To highlight a different and perhaps more traditional approach, I reached out to Jeroen Plink, CEO of Clifford Chance Applied Solutions. Jeroen boasts more than two decades of experience in legal technology development and became a pioneer of legal tech long before it was a familiar phrase in our industry. He started at [Clifford Chance](https://www.cliffordchance.com/home.html) as an associate in the firm’s Amsterdam office and went on to found a legal tech software company which he sold to Practical Law Company (PLC) in the UK. In 2007, he established PLC US, of which he served as the CEO.

I’m sure most of you are familiar with PLC and the then groundbreaking approach to providing actionable content to help lawyers with processes such as managing buy-outs and handling contract management. After the company was sold to Thomson Reuters in 2013, Jeroen continued work in the legal tech space as an advisor for investors in legal tech companies. Through his advisory work, he came back in contact with Clifford Chance, working with Bas Boris Visser, Partner and Global Head of Innovation and Business Change at the firm, to discuss innovation in the law. The result of their work together has taken the form of Clifford Chance Applied Solutions, an organization within the firm, with Jeroen as its CEO.

“We are seeing tremendous pressure for in-house teams to increase speed and efficiency, lower costs and simultaneously play a more strategic role within their organizations,” said Jeroen. “The Applied Solutions team works closely with Clifford Chance’s clients to meet that demand. Our chief objective is to work with the firm’s clients, technology partners and lawyers around the world to develop new tech solutions that aim to solve some of the most common challenges facing practitioners.”

The key difference between Dentons’s model and Clifford Chance’s is the role that the firm takes. In Dentons’s case, the firm acts as an anchor investor in an independently run VC fund that seeks new legal tech startups to support. In Clifford Chance’s model, Clifford Chance Applied Solutions is a company related to the firm, creating software solutions for its clients.

Clifford Chance Applied Solutions is one of three units underpinning the firm’s Innovation and Best Delivery strategy, governed by Clifford Chance’s innovation leadership group. The other two units are Clifford Chance Create, which focuses on defining the future of legal services through collaboration, exploration, investment, and testing; and Best Delivery, which brings together experts in process improvement and legal project management together with lower cost delivery centers and technology solutions to help lawyers.

“Clifford Chance Applied Solutions combines the firm’s legal expertise and industry-leading software to help our clients cope with increasing regulatory pressure,” Jeroen explained.

Ideas for new products for Clifford Chance Applied Solutions come from clients and lawyers in the firm. Selection of new ideas is a rigorous process that includes various stakeholders. Before the firm makes a decision to invest in a new product, various criteria need to be met, the most important one being that the product could provide meaningful benefits to their clients. Another important factor is the desire for products to leverage the firm’s practice areas.

“Our product development team includes people with strong experience developing products from the legal market. Our recently appointed head of product has been a finance partner at an Am Law 50 firm, followed by over 10 years of product development experience at PLC and Thomson Reuters.” Jeroen said. “An important aspect of our development methodology is to include the end users and Clifford Chance lawyers throughout the process, collect their underlying knowledge, and combine their know-how with the right technology solution.”

While some solutions may be very niche and specific to a particular market, Jeroen and his colleagues have identified a number of use cases that are independent of practice areas. “Using CCDr@ft, our document automation as a service offering, we have automated, for example, all mid-market loan documentation for a large bank allowing over 2,000 loan officers, not lawyers, to create all loan documents independent from the legal team. The same technology is being used in a large media investment fund to automate corporate structuring transactions,” said Jeroen. “This solution aims to increase efficiency and ensure consistency and compliance with the firm’s policies whilst reducing the workload of the legal department. One bank recently reported a 20 percent increase in workload but using this technology they were able to stay at the same headcount.”

Through their work with Clifford Chance’s clients around the world, the Applied Solutions team has a unique view on challenges facing lawyers and the tech solutions that will help overcome those challenges. “Historically, in the US, eDiscovery and legal research were the main focus for legal tech,” Jeroen said. “In the last few years, in both the UK and in the US, the focus is shifting to software that helps clients to better understand what’s in their data. In legal research, artificial intelligence is playing an increasing role. I think that data extraction has significant potential for functions such as due diligence. We’re also seeing some firms use data science to extract value from historic matters including time writing systems to standardize matters and enable better assessment of fixed fees.”

Clifford Chance Applied Solutions provides another model that law firms can look to for practical means of driving innovation forward. As we see more examples of firms creating means for developing legal tech, we may see an acceleration not only in rate of adoption of new solutions, but also new use cases for the industry to solve.

It seems that the Trump administration tries to pick a battle with the media on an almost daily basis. And while presidents often have a contentious relationship with the press, the current administration’s tenor in dealing with the media is more aggressive than before. When the weight of the United States government is levied against some poor reporter, where do they turn?

Increasingly, they turn to Biglaw. Specifically, Davis Wright Tremaine, the Seattle-headquartered firm that finds itself on the front lines of Trump’s temper tantrums time and time again. Eriq Gardner from Hollywood Reporter just put out [a profile of the firm’s work](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trumps-war-fake-news-law-firm-defending-free-press-1197104) protecting the press over the last couple years:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

Its fingerprints are present across the media spectrum. Jokes told by late-night comedians? Often vetted by its lawyers. #MeToo stories published over the past 18 months? Quite frequently, a DWT attorney responds to threatening letters from the alleged perpetrators. And in court, the firm is tackling huge First Amendment cases, representing the likes of CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post in everything from defending defamation claims to securing access to critical documents and regaining access after being exiled from the White House. Simply put: This Seattle-based firm has outsize influence on media at a particularly critical moment. (DWT counsels THR too.)

[Katherine Bolger](https://www.dwt.com/people/katebolger/), who along with [Nathan Siegel](https://www.dwt.com/people/nathansiegel/) represented BuzzFeed in the defamation suit surrounding the publication of the Steele dossier called the case “trippy — that’s a legal term.” It’s what happens when you’re managing a case with enormous repercussions for the future of the free press in America… yet also about prostitute pee parties.

We’ve already featured in Above the Law some of the scathing work of [Elizabeth McNamara](https://www.dwt.com/people/elizabethamcnamara/), who [ripped Trump’s attorneys a new one](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-eviscerates-trumps-cease-and-desist-letter/) when Trump was looking to silence Tony Schwartz from talking about his experiences co-writing Trump’s Art of the Deal. Everywhere you look, Davis Wright Tremaine’s been all over the media landscape from ABC to South Park.

Sometimes it’s not even clear who all the firm is representing. Gardner’s article includes the story of [Rachel Strom](https://www.dwt.com/people/rachelstrom/), a DWT partner who was in an SDNY courtroom when Michael Cohen was first hauled into court. Appearing unsolicited at the hearing, Strom started asserting the interests of her range of media clients in real-time:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
At the beginning of that proceeding, U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood expressed an inclination to hold the hearing behind closed doors. It was Strom, without any invitation, who stood up from the benches in the public gallery to argue that there was a First Amendment right to access the courtroom and that the “cat was out of the bag” with respect to the Cohen raid. Not only did she sway the judge, but as the hearing turned to questions about what would be publicly filed — including whether the names of Cohen’s clients would be released — Strom persuaded the judge to defer to a presumption of openness. It eventually resulted in Cohen’s admission that he had advised Fox News host Sean Hannity.

For the firm, Donald Trump has generated a good deal of business. And it couldn’t be coming at a better time with technology expanding the First Amendment legal issues, DWT is positioning itself at the heart of Trump’s high-profile battles and locking down its reputation as a top player in the game.

## Bonus announcements sure make the day fly by!

Biglaw’s bonus season is really getting rolling! Despite the cautious economic outlook, the best of Biglaw is still giving out impressive bonuses to associates.

You always expect an elite firm like Sidley to pony up the bonus money that puts them at the top of the scale (the firm made $2,795,426,000 in gross revenue last year making it #7 on the Am Law 100), but associates still breathe a sigh of relief when they get confirmation. Today,  Sidley announced their own bonus scale, and YUP, it is a match of the prevailing market rate.



Those with “higher productivity and/or exceptional performance” will receive even more in bonus money –indeed, “in some instances significantly more” money is on the table. Bonuses will be paid prior to December 31.

As is [the firm’s tradition](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/sidley-bonuses-21/), the memo also reflects the new salaries for each class year. Though it is a raise for individual associates, it is not a change to the compensation grid, rather an acknowledgment that each class year is graduating to the pre-established salary for an associate that’s one-year older. However, the firm did add ninth-year associates[ to their salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/sidley-re-raise-22/), with a base salary of $425,000.

You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/sidley-bonus-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Philly Firm Settles Suit By Former Associate Claiming He Was Bilked Of Bonus Money
## The suit would have offered an interesting inside look at one firm's billing and bonus practices.

The most dangerous place in Biglaw is between an associate and his bonus. As we know here at Above the Law, after years of fielding complaints from angry associates, it’s not just about the money; it’s about the respect (or lack thereof). When you work as hard as so many associates, you want to feel that your employer appreciates you, your work, and your time.

So tongues definitely wagged over the [lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/lawyer-accuses-former-firm-of-ripping-off-associates-through-creative-billing/?rf=1) filed last year by Ryan Leonard against his former firm, Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel, a more than [century-old firm](http://www.obermayer.com/our-firm/overview/) founded in Philadelphia that now boasts eight offices across four states. Leonard alleged that the firm used a system of “pro-rated credit” that had the effect of decreasing associate bonuses and increasing partner compensation.

The suit would have offered an interesting inside look at one firm’s billing and bonus practices — if it hadn’t [just settled](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784231419/Obermayer-Settles-Dispute-Over-Associate-Billing-Bonuses?kw=Obermayer%20Settles%20Dispute%20Over%20Associate%20Billing%2C%20Bonuses&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&cn=20170421&src=EMC-Email&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily):

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge John M. Younge entered a settlement order late Thursday afternoon in Leonard v. Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel. The order included a letter from the mediator, Judge A. Michael Snyder, which said he understood that the firm sent settlement documents to plaintiff Ryan Leonard, which would be executed “with minimal revision.”

Both Leonard and Obermayer Rebmann declined to comment on the settlement or its terms.

Obermayer Rebmann must be glad to put this bonus battle to bed. Regardless of what (if anything) the firm paid Leonard to go away, the lawsuit presumably wasn’t good for the firm from a publicity and recruiting standpoint.

Moral of the story for firms: give associates the benefit of the doubt come bonus time — or else.

# Law Firms Should Offer Healthier Food Options When Paying For Employee Meals
## Even if people generally appreciate the free food provided by law firms, more shops should offer healthier food options for attorneys and staff.

One of my simple pleasures in life is when I am able to score a free meal. When I was in college, I subscribed to an email list that broadcast all of the events on campus that had free food, and I made sure to attend those events to score free grub. In law school, I remember once attending five free food events in one day! Given how broke I was as a student, the free food I was able to score really helped preserve my bottom line and let me devote money toward other purposes. When I started working at law firms, I was happy that many of the shops at which I worked also offered free food for training sessions, team meetings, and other firm events. However, based on conversations I had with individuals within the legal profession over the years, even if people generally appreciate the free food, more shops should offer healthier food options for attorneys and staff.

I worked at four different law firms [before opening my own practice around five years ago](http://www.rothman.law). Each firm I worked at offered different free food options to attorneys and staff. One offered free pizza at pretty much every event, and the pizza was almost always plain or pepperoni. Another shop at which I worked offered deli sandwiches like turkey, pastrami, roast beef, and the like. A different firm usually only offered really good New York bagels and cream cheese one morning each week, and the only time I ever considered filing a worker’s compensation claim was when I sliced my hand one morning cutting a bagel.

I made sure to eat as much free food as I could while employed at these shops as I did when I was a student. Most of the time I was working as an associate attorney at various shops, I tried to save money so that I could pay off my student loans earlier. Any money I could save on food was money that I could use to pay down my student debt. Moreover, I generally like eating copious amounts of food (and I even participated in a bunch of competitive eating events in my younger years) so any type of free food is a serious windfall for me.

I am a huge fan of deli sandwiches and pizza, so when the law firms at which I worked offered these foods, I was delighted. However, people with whom I worked complained about the food offerings of some law firms. Some individuals tried to eat healthier, and other people with whom I worked were on various diets. They said it was difficult to stick to their eating goals when the law firm only offered unhealthy food to attorneys and staff.

Some of my colleagues also said it was difficult for attorneys and staff to interact with others socially since only unhealthy food was offered by law firms. Eating is often a substantial part of social occasions, and attorneys and staff did not want to seem like poor sports for refusing to eat at various firm events. Some attorneys I spoke with said that this even made it more difficult for them to interact with important partners and be assigned to favorable teams.

I am no expert, but law firms can provide healthier food options without too many issues. For instance, ordering a large assortment of sushi could be good to offer a group of people, and although I am no nutritionist, this could be healthier than pizza or other similar food. Moreover, offering more salads to attorneys and staff can also help employees meet their eating goals while socializing with other people at a law firm event.

To be clear, I am extremely grateful for all of the law firms at which I worked that offered free food to attorneys and staff during events. This helped people interact with coworkers, and offering food can make it more likely that people will attend an event that is merely optional. However, some people have complained to me over the years that they wished law firms offered healthier food at events, and with some planning, law firms can make events more accessible to people who eat different kinds of food.

# A Leading D.C. Law Firm Finally Announces Raises For Associates

Earlier today, we brought you news of a merger between two Biglaw firms that was [dead on arrival](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-failed-merger-might-explain-why-these-firms-havent-announced-raises/). Arnold & Porter, a firm that had a challenging year in 2015, had its eye on Kaye Scholer, but the combination was simply not meant to be. At the time, we wondered whether the failed merger was the reason why both firms had yet to announce raises for associates in line with the new Cravath salary scale.

It seems that all Arnold & Porter needed was a gentle nudge in the right direction, because just moments ago, the firm notified its associates that they would finally receive their raises. “I’m sure it was only done begrudgingly because they were backed into a corner, but A&P has officially matched for all U.S. associates and summers,” mused a source. The firm’s scale starts at $180K for the classes of 2016 and 2016, and ends with the class of 2008 and those senior earning $315K. Associates in the firm’s European offices will have their salaries reviewed separately in the next few months.

Congratulations to all Arnold & Porter associates! Good things come to even those who impatiently wait.
