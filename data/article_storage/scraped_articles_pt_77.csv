# The 500 Largest Law Firms
## The NLJ 500 is out! It's like the NLJ 250... but more EXTREME!

Ranking law firms is [a difficult task](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2017-power-100-law-firm-rankings/). What does one value in a firm? Prestige, employee satisfaction, blockbuster cases and deals, consistent clients, PPP… there’s an argument for measuring law firms along each of these vectors and developing complex equations to create the definitive value of each firm.

Or there’s counting the number of lawyers and calling it a day.

The National Law Journal takes the latter approach, aggressively grasping for the ranking clickbait with the NLJ 500, which is just a list of law firms based on size. NLJ is apparently the insecure guy in your locker room of legal publications. Seriously, the Am Law 200 is not extreme enough for these people? Could you even name 500 law firms? I’m old enough to remember the NLJ 250… which was already a ridiculous list.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

But, if you’re interested in straight-up counting, here are the [top ten largest firms](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202791138666) in America:

1. Baker McKenzie
2. DLA Piper
3. Norton Rose Fulbright
4. Hogan Lovells
5. Jones Day
6. Latham & Watkins
7. White & Case
8. Greenburg Traurig
9. Morgan Lewis
10. Sidley Austin

Check out NLJ if you’re really hankering to know what firms are 11-500 in headcount. Congrats to Baker McKenzie, which has as many equity partners (709) as Proskauer has total attorneys.

And while the spike in coronavirus cases across the country is proof the virus is still a pandemic, the economic ramifications of the disease are still happening too.

Such is the case with Am Law 200 firm, Miller Canfield. Last month, the firm instituted some temporary furloughs of both attorneys and staff, as well as some lay offs. As firm CEO Michael McGee said:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the wake of the economic slowdown caused by COVID-19, particularly in the auto sector, the firm was forced to implement firm-wide cost-cutting measures consistent with industry experience, including temporary furloughs and a few separations. Of the temporary furloughs, two were full-time attorneys, including one associate. Of the separations, one attorney was a principal and six were non-principals, including three associates.

# Boies Schiller Transition Process Continues With Two New Managing Partners
## Change may not be coming fast, but BSF is trying to stay ahead of it.

It’s sometimes hard to remember that Paul Cravath and George B. Case and Leo Gottlieb were all real people. Their names have hung on the doors of their respective firms for so long that they seem almost mythic. But every one of those lawyers faced a moment where they had to plan for their firm to go on after they finally hung up their practice.

Boies Schiller and Flexner isn’t as old as those firms, having only been founded in 1997, but the firm finds itself at the crossroads that those other firms did in more sepia-toned eras planning the transition of the firm from one helmed by the names on the door. It’s a process that has already [shifted a lot of the day-to-day management to a committee](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/david-boies-dishes-on-firms-transition-strategy/), but just yesterday the firm took another big step on this journey by announcing that the firm will vote to name two new managing partners, suggesting the firm has keyed in on the pair that will take on full firm leadership when Boies and Schiller decide to retire.

From the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-boiess-law-firm-names-likely-successors-11576164238?mod=hp_lista_pos1):

Boies Schiller this week named for the first time managing partners who don’t have their names on the door. The two new leaders, New York-based Nicholas Gravante Jr. and London-based Natasha Harrison, have been tapped to guide the firm into its second generation.

When asked about the announcement, Boies explained, “I think where we are with two new managing partners who have the support of the entire firm, and who are both able to drive the firm’s commercial success and committed to the firm’s culture, validates the way we have approached the transition.”

Gravante told the Journal that his priority will be reorienting partner compensation to encourage more hustling for new business. It’s a natural shift now that the firm is less dependent on servicing cases brought in by the named partners and more dependent on the next generation.

Not that either Boies or Schiller seem in a hurry to leave the practice. The Wall Street Journal coverage hinted that some might chafe against a transition process with no clear endpoint:

The slow-moving transition, spearheaded by Messrs. Boies and Schiller, has frustrated some partners internally, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Um… this seems like the sort of thing you don’t want to rush. For his part, Boies said “because we started early, we have had the luxury of moving slowly and getting it right.” That sounds like the right idea, especially with a firm going through its first major transition. The third or fourth generation can afford to swing seamlessly to a new regime, but the first move requires some real care.

But with a new regime coming into place, the firm is prepared for the day that will probably come sometime in the next decade.

# Associate Bonus Watch: The Skadden Shoe Drops
## As in the past, top performers in senior classes get some extra cash.

Last night, we [identified](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-to-the-rescue/) Skadden Arps and Sullivan & Cromwell as the only two firms that might dare to top [Cravath’s generous bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/). As of this morning, it’s all eyes on S&C.

Skadden just announced bonuses. It’s matching the Cravath scale — for the most part. Certain SASMF associates will get more than the Cravath amounts, but because this has happened in past years, it’s not as exciting as it sounds (and won’t cause other firms to make retroactive changes to their bonus schemes).

As we’ve explained in prior years, [Skadden Arps](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/skadden-arps-slate-meagher-flom/) does not issue a universal bonus memo listing every associate class and their bonus. Instead, a memo from executive partner [Eric Friedman](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/eric-j-friedman) goes out to each class stating the applicable bonus for that particular class. (We’ve posted the memo template on the next page.)

We’ve confirmed Cravath matches for the classes of 2013, 2010, and 2009, which suggests matching up and down the scale. As one Skadden source said, “Looks like a match across the board. People are happy, but they aren’t high-fiving in the hallways like in 2014.”

As in prior years, some top-performing associates in senior classes — the class of 2010 and senior, we believe — will get more than the Cravath scale. How much more? As noted in the class of 2010 memo (also posted on the next page), “In recognition of extraordinary performance, some associates will receive a bonus of $100,000.” We have confirmed that top-performing associates from the class of 2009 will also get $100,000.

One source suggests that Skadden’s definition of “top-performing” is generous: “For sixth-years [class of 2010] and up, they’re really setting above-market bonuses, as most associates seem to receive the higher amount.” So that’s nice.

Although many of the major players have announced, we will continue to cover bonuses vigilantly, as different market segments — [Magic Circle](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-magic-circle-firm-speaks/) shops, elite [boutiques](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-bonuses-arrive-at-boutique-firm/), West Coast powerhouses — start to weigh in. When your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

# Top Biglaw Firm Announces $1.73 Billion In 2020 Revenue

The coronavirus crisis brought unprecedented changes to the legal profession, with some firms instituting salary cuts and others opting for furloughs and even layoffs. But at the end of the day, the biggest and most successful of Biglaw firms came out ahead, posting record revenues, the world’s financial difficulties be damned.

Which top-ranked Am Law 100 firm recently announced its seventh consecutive year of financial growth?

That would be Greenberg Traurig, a firm that’s currently ranked at No. 14, having brought in $1,641,790,000 gross revenue in 2019. According to a [press release](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/news/2021/2/press-releases/greenberg-traurig-reports-7th-consecutive-year-of-record-revenue-announces-elevations), in 2020, the firm brought in revenue of $1.73 billion, representing a 5.48% increase compared to 2019.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
[Richard A. Rosenbaum](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosenbaum-richard-a), Greenberg Traurig’s Executive Chairman, had this to say of the firm’s financial success in 2020:

2020 was a year of unprecedented human challenge, but was also a year of unprecedented strength for Greenberg Traurig: financially, achieving both record revenues and record profits, with a profit-per-partner increase in excess of 6%; culturally, becoming closer than ever; and qualitatively, elevating our excellence and the consistency of our service worldwide.

Congratulations to Greenberg Traurig for coming out ahead during the pandemic. We wonder when other Biglaw firms will begin to humbly brag about their success in these trying times.

# Inside Straight: How Many People Should Attend The Meeting? How Long Should The Memo Be?

How many people should attend the meeting?

At a law firm: The smallest number possible, consistent with getting the job done. Why invite extra people to a meeting?

I suppose I’ll add one caveat: Very occasionally, an associate, whose time will not be billed, will be invited to a meeting to get a sense of what’s happening behind the scenes. But generally, the fewer people who attend a meeting, the better. The meeting will be more efficient and will cost less.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At a corporation: Invite lots of people.

We should invite people who are irrelevant to making the decision, just to make sure that they’re in the loop — or not offended by having been left out of the loop.

We should invite a few junior people. If they have the time to attend, why not? And attending will give them exposure to some of the muckety-mucks and let the junior folks see how we make decisions. And the junior folks might be interested in some of the topics that we’ll discuss.

Everyone’s time is costless — because you’re generally not being billed out by the hour — and many people could be interested in the meeting, or offended by not having been invited, or whatever. So the group expands.

But then it gets funny.

What’s the proper length for the memo describing the decision reached at the meeting?

At a law firm: It’s okay to create a 10-page memo.

Recipients of the memo will want to know the thought process that went into the decision-making. Recipients will want to see that you considered various permutations and that you excluded those permutations for good reasons. We don’t mind if the memo’s a little long — readers can always skim — but be sure to cover all the relevant content for those who are interested.

At a corporation: Three bullet points.

Are you kidding? People are busy. Nobody’s going to read an email that goes into a third or fourth paragraph. That takes too long, and it’s too much to digest. Anyway, people are accustomed to reading bullet points, and people almost never receive memos. Distill the decision down into the things that matter, and convey those things in a few bullet points. Maybe one PowerPoint slide. Without too many words on it. People might read that much, but you can’t take too much of their time.

I’m really not passing judgment on this. There are good reasons for different organizations operating in different ways. I’m just observing. Maybe there’s something to be learned from the observation.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Is Offering $75K Associate Referral Bonuses
## And that's on top of the $200K signing bonuses being offered for its Houston office.

The Biglaw lateral market is still burning hot, and law firms are trying every move they can think of to get more associates in the door — up to and including offering current and former employees referral bonuses for successful hires.

The latest firm that’s turning its associates into recruiters is Willkie Farr & Gallagher. According to a report from [Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/willkie-farr-75000-referral-bonuses-big-law-talent-war-2022-2?r=US&IR=T), the top 50 Am Law firm is willing to pay $75,000 referral bonuses to associates who help the firm make qualified hires. Here are some additional details:

The bonus payments are split into two parts, with associates receiving the first $50,000 after the new hire arrives and the remaining $25,000 when the hire has worked at the firm for a year, a copy of an internal email reviewed by Insider showed.

The bonuses are meant to help the firm recruit experienced corporate laterals, said the email, which was sent by Danielle Scalzo, a Willkie partner in New York.

That’s quite a bit more money than what some other firms are willing to pay in referral bonuses. For example, Shearman & Sterling recently rolled out a program [offering $25,000 to former attorneys](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/this-biglaw-firm-is-handing-out-up-to-25k-to-former-lawyers-who-refer-new-associates/) who refer potential new hires. But then again, Willkie is all about rolling out the big bucks for new recruits.

Willkie is reportedly offering up to $200,000 in precleared signing bonuses for midlevels its office in Houston, Texas. “Most firms don’t do that,” said a recruiter who spoke to Insider but wished to remain anonymous. “It’s almost always just an after-the-fact kind of negotiation.”

What is your firm doing to lure in qualified associates during these unprecedented times? Whether it’s raising salaries to match the $215K soon-to-be market standard or offering referral bonuses, we want to know. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us.

As the oldest millennials turn 40 this year and increasingly take on law firm partner roles, we want to know how unique — or not — the generation’s outlook on law firm life truly is. 

As[ the final installment](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2bNVZ1B8zigoh8i) in this year’s series of surveys conducted in partnership with our friends at Major Lindsey & Africa, we want to ask about topics as varied as law firm leadership, compensation practices, legal industry bias, and whether partnership is still the brass ring. 

Please take a couple of minutes and [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2bNVZ1B8zigoh8i). (And please note we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take the survey!)

If you have not taken the first survey in our series, “Priorities,” [you can do so here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6EayshZZjGVlJ5Q). And [click here to take our second survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8c5uQBXjhMxEC7I), “Goals.”

# Definitely Take At Least Some Time Off This Holiday Season
## It is still important to relax and recharge around the holidays, even though self-employment is much more of an eat-what-you-kill system than working as an associate at a firm.

The holiday season is definitely upon us. Every other commercial on television has a holiday theme, and individuals have already started wishing people a happy holidays if they do not plan to speak to them over the next several weeks. The holidays are usually a period to take time off from work to spend precious days with loved ones. However, because of the erosion of the work-life balance, many people might work during the holiday season since they need to meet year-end deadlines or accomplish other goals. Nevertheless, people should definitely take some time off around the holidays to rest and recharge, since this can have numerous advantages.

When I worked as an associate at a bunch of different law firms, I had varying degrees of success at taking time off around the holidays. As an associate in Biglaw, it was difficult to take any time off since we were always expected to be on call if a partner needed us to complete an assignment. Since we owed our high salaries to the firm, it was difficult to say “no” to a partner when work over the holidays was needed.

At other firms, it was much easier to take time off around the holidays. The pay was lower, and one of the tradeoffs was that it was much easier to take time off around the holidays or at other times during the year. Indeed, many attorneys and staff would basically take the last two weeks of the year completely off, which was an amazing experience when I tried it. Legal work slowed around that time of year, so it made sense to take time off when expectations from clients, courts, and adversaries were minimal.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After starting my own practice, it has been much more difficult to take time off around the holidays. I largely need to complete all of the tasks associated with my files by myself, and I usually need to use any downtime to catch up on work. Moreover, clients may have expectations of me around the holidays, and there is no partner or someone else who can step in to assist a client if I am out of pocket. In addition, self-employment is much more of an eat-what-you-kill system than working as an associate at a firm, and taking time off around the holidays can impact my bottom line.

However, it is still important to relax and recharge around the holidays. For one, this is the right thing to do for your friends and family. Holiday moments are priceless, and time spent with family and friends around the holidays can lead to cherished memories for years to come. When I was in law school, I did not return home for Thanksgiving and other holidays so that I could get a jump on finals studying and complete other academic assignments. Looking back on it, I would rather have the cherished memories of being with my family than being in a dorm room around the holidays, and any academic benefit I got from staying on campus was not worth the sacrifice. In a similar vein, the memories you make around the holidays will stick with you far longer than any small work advantage you might get by not taking time off.

Moreover, taking time off around the holidays can help lawyers relax and unwind in a significant way. We all know that the legal profession is stressful. Attorney burnout is a huge problem and could be one of the reasons why so many lawyers leave the profession for other careers. Lawyers should remember that their work is definitely a marathon and not a sprint, and it is important to take breaks to recharge the batteries.

Whenever I take time off from work, I come back more energized and relaxed than ever before. This ensures that I can attack my files with a new kind of vigor after returning from a break than I had after working uninterrupted for a long time. The holidays are a nice built-in break that everyone gets to take, and there is definitely less stigma taking time off around the holidays than taking time off at any other point throughout the year. Lawyers should lean into this natural break to take time off to recharge their batteries.

# Unexpected Threats To Cybersecurity/Confidentiality: The SEC And ChatGPT

Ed. note: This is the latest in the article series, Cybersecurity: Tips From the Trenches, by our friends at [Sensei Enterprises](https://senseient.com/), a boutique provider of IT, cybersecurity, and digital forensics services.

The Security and Exchange Commission Subpoenas Covington & Burling for Client Names

This story came out of left field. Since when does the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) go to court asking a law firm to identify clients impacted by a data breach? The Covington & Burling cyberattack happened in 2020. Covington has said that the attack was aimed at a small group of lawyers and advisors to secure information about the incoming Biden administration’s policies on China. The firm said it notified all clients whose information may have been compromised.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Nearly 300 publicly traded companies had their data accessed or stolen in the data breach. Covington was clearly not happy to receive a subpoena asking for the names of the clients impacted.

Has the SEC Lost its Mind?

We confess that was our first thought, but further research indicated that the SEC has a point. When the SEC sued Covington in January to compel identification of affected clients, it was part of an investigation into possible securities law violations associated with the breach. That is, after all, part of the mission of the SEC.

The SEC said that its subpoena was narrowly targeted and did not ask for information that was covered by attorney-client privilege. Why did it make the request? It said it was trying to determine if the breach resulted in insider trading and whether all required disclosures were made to investors about the breach.

Covington didn’t see it that way. It accused the SEC of going on a “fishing expedition” and trying to compel the firm to turn over information that might cause its clients to be scrutinized without evidence of misconduct.

“The SEC’s effort to compel Covington to help the agency investigate the firm’s clients, without any evidence whatsoever of wrongdoing by Covington or those clients, is an assault on the sanctity and confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship,” Covington told the Washington, D.C., federal court hearing the case.

Covington also warned that the SEC’s action could chill cooperation between law firms and the government during future cyberattacks. It noted that there might be a “cascading series of dilemmas” for firms caught between reporting breaches and protecting their clients.

Law Firms Unite to Back Covington’s Arguments

The rally round the flag movement coalesced quickly. On February 21, some 83 law firms backed Covington’s opposition to releasing client names under the circumstances noted above by the SEC. They underscored the danger of weakening the principle of attorney-client privilege.

We think it is fair to say that we can expect a battle royale in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

ChatGPT Warns Users of the Dangers of Giving it Sensitive/Confidential Data

ChatGPT is quick to warn users about the dangers of giving it sensitive data.

A friend of ours asked this question of the AI: When can ChatGPT leak information it receives from its users?

We chuckled at the use of the word “leak” and, predictably, ChatGPT set our friend straight by answering at the outset “As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to leak information intentionally or unintentionally.” A bit of a scolding there we thought!

But it went on to note, “However, it is important to note that any information provided to me is stored in a database, and as with any database, there is always a risk of a security breach.”

Lawyers should read that sentence slowly a few times because we have already seen lawyers giving confidential data to ChatGPT in their research questions. It seems that many lawyers have not fully understood that everything they type into ChatGTP will likely live forever.

Maybe you need another sentence of caution from ChatGPT? Here you go: “It is also important for users to be cautious about the type of information they provide to me or any other AI language model, as there is always a possibility that the information could be inadvertently shared or compromised.”

ChatGPT is doing its level best to make sure attorneys abide by their ethical duties!

Can Cybercriminals Use ChatGPT to Write Malware? Sure

Threat intelligence company Check Point Research has recently noted that while Open AI, the creator of ChatGPT, has imposed restrictions on how ChatGPT can be used, posts on a dark web hacking forum revealed that it can still be used to create malware.

Anonymous users on the forum tell others, “the key to getting it to create what you want is by specifying what the program should do and what steps should be taken, consider it like writing pseudo-code for your comp[uter] sci[ence] class.”

Using this method, hackers can create a python file stealer that searches for common file types “that can automatically self-delete after files have been uploaded or an error is encountered while the program is running. The method is designed to remove any evidence of hacking.”

Well, that’s a little scary to folks like us who manage cybersecurity for a living. If we can fool AI into helping us with malware or fixing buggy malware code, we have another obstacle to protecting law firm from cyberattacks.

Cybercriminals Bragging on the Profits from Using ChatGPT

Cybercriminals affirm that ChatGPT is a great way to “make money,” claiming they make more than $1,000 per day. Many experts believe that they make their money by impersonating women and engaging in social engineering attacks on vulnerable targets. We won’t explain further, but you probably get the idea.

Cybersecurity experts have affirmed to Cyber Security Hub that, according to their forecast, the top cyber security threat of 2023 will be crime-as-a-service. They also say that ChatGPT has expedited the process by creating malware for free.

Want some more troubling cybersecurity news?

A February survey from cybersecurity company BlackBerry shows that, of 1500 cybersecurity experts, 74% said they worried about ChatGPT aiding in cybercrime. Seventy-one percent ChatGPT is likely already in use by nation-states attacking other counties through hacking and phishing.

Final words

After all we’ve read about misbehaving AI and AI hallucinations (and we have borne witness to some of them), it occurs to us that the final words for this column should go to Stephen Hawking: “Artificial intelligence will either be the best thing that’s ever happened to us, or it will be the worst thing. If we’re not careful, it very well may be the last thing.”

# Biglaw Bonus Bonanza -- With Extra Cash For Big Billers
## The January bonus announcements just keep on coming.

There are two main schools of thought when it comes to Biglaw bonuses. The first, [led by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/), announced their bonus scale early and paid their associates for their hard work in 2018 before the calendar rolled over to 2019. The other group waits to squeeze all the billable hours out of 2018 to announce their bonuses — even though, for most of the firms, there’s little doubt they’ll match the industry standard set in November.

Vinson & Elkins falls into the latter category. But the good news for associates is that the firm announced bonuses this week, and they are indeed matching the market scale:

In addition, associates who had an extraordinary year had an opportunity to earn between 1.10 and 1.35 times the first level bonus.

# Teamwork Comes In Many Forms

Reading [Peter Garnett’s article](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/take-a-vacation-escaping-the-stress-of-being-a-lawyer/) on vacations as an important part of an attorney’s life and their relationship to the practice of law and servicing of clients made me think about what we decide to do outside of the practice of law and how it can help us become better service providers to our clients. Teamwork is an important part of family life, but I want to focus on what we do outside of our family relationships and how it can help us improve in the practice of law.

I was an avid scuba diver for over 45 years, with over 1,000 dives throughout the world. Fundamental to safe scuba diving is the buddy system. It is universally required that you have a dive buddy each time for safety reasons. If something goes wrong, your dive buddy can save your life. But just like teamwork within a law firm and a law firm with its client, teamwork as a good buddy is the result of proper planning and realizing you have a life-and-death obligation to your dive buddy.

Before a dive begins, you and your buddy check each other’s equipment to make sure that it is operational and in proper working order, to avoid entanglements and other problems during the dive. You also plan out your dive in advance as a team. You study the local map and determine the direction of the current to come up with a dive plan. Once you descend, you look for sea fans, which I call nature’s sea computer, to verify the current’s direction and strength. For safety reasons, you always start your dive against the current and then as you get more tired and have to return, you use the current to come back to where you meet the pontoon boat used to transport you to the dive site.

You have to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each person. For example, Leslie, my significant other, who has been my dive buddy on over 500 dives, has trouble initially descending. As her dive buddy, I initially descend to only 15 to 20 feet to make sure that she can begin her descent. Once she is 15 feet deep, she has no problem. I am the stronger swimmer, but she is much better at conserving her oxygen, so she can last a lot longer underwater.

Teamwork requires that if there is a heavy current, I take the lead in going against the current at the beginning of the dive to make it less taxing for her. When we are underwater for over 45 minutes, especially if it is a deep dive, she continually signals me to check my air gauge to see how much air I have left in my tank so we can do a safe ascent together. During the dive, if either of us sees something that the other would enjoy, we make sure to let the other person know what has been spotted and give them the option of enjoying the moment.

Since I have a good eye, I normally take the lead and look for interesting things whether on the reef or in the open ocean. I continually look in all directions because things change so quickly on a coral reef.

If I am running out of air or she is uncomfortable during the dive, we come up together and return to the boat together. We are a team, and we never abandon the other person underwater. Also, because getting back onto a rubber pontoon boat requires a lot of strength, Leslie goes first so I can give her help in getting over the side of the boat, especially in rough water where the crew is unable to get her tanks off first.

I also bike raced for many years. It is the ultimate team sport. Just as in scuba diving, you need to plan out your strategy before the race begins. In a one-day race, there is normally a sprint at the end of the race. The team knows who the best sprinter is, and the plan is designed for various stages of a race. How do you preserve the strength of your best sprinter so that he or she has the necessary burst of energy to cross the finish line first? During the race there are often breakaways and the team has to make decisions as to whether to chase down the breakaway or stay with the pelaton. The situation can change quickly because that decision is based on how far ahead the breakaway is and how far away the finish is. Also, you have to know how each member of your team is doing at that time because your stamina and the ability to keep up that level of energy varies from day to day and for each rider in different types of terrain. If you want to chase down the breakaway, how many riders do you use to breach the gap and then try to slow down the breakaway group?

The goal is to get as many members of the team in the proper place while every other team is organizing for the sprint. Your planning is supposed to determine which rider or group of riders will initially lead the sprint group, with your sprinter to be in the best position within the final 300 to 500 meters. Each team member has a designated role in the final sprint with one person leading out the best sprinter so that he or she can pick the right moment and be in the right position to draft past you to the finish line.

As lawyers servicing our clients, teamwork has many facets. Critical to the success of any assignment is complete cooperation between the client and his or her attorneys, and this begins at the initial meeting.

The continuation of open and complete communication between client and counsel is an ongoing process, especially in commercial cases where documents produced in discovery can call into question the attorney’s original understanding of the case. It is especially important that the attorney be aware of potential weaknesses in the client’s position in investigations and litigations so that everyone can be properly prepared on how to handle facts that are unfavorable on their face. Teamwork within the law firm is also important as tasks are assigned to various persons and everyone must do their assignment properly and on time.

The lessons we learn outside of the law office have a direct impact on our ability to coordinate with our clients and colleagues at the law firm with the goal of improving the quality of our service to our clients and for the client to obtain the best result.

“Because I am a woman, I must make unusual efforts to succeed. If I fail, no one will say, ‘She doesn’t have what it takes.’ They will say, ‘Women don’t have what it takes.'”

– Clare Boothe Luce

I have had some amazing mentors so far in my career, but they’ve mostly been men and it’s mainly men that I’ve seen championing female candidates for promotion. The majority of my role models in the legal profession are also male. I find this really frustrating as I would genuinely welcome some more women to look up to. I provide legal services for two heavily male-dominated sectors, banking and real estate, and I have begun to see women emerging into leadership roles more frequently, especially in-house, but the pace of change seems to be slow. This pace may change more rapidly in the UK when, from 2018, a number of businesses will be forced by law to publish their gender pay gap disparities. I am confident it will at least be a tool for accountability and will provide a platform for women to have conversations on a previously opaque issue.

Statistics demonstrate a clear lack of gender diversity within law firm partnerships. So, what is it about this profession that means women are not progressing?

A 2014 Chambers Student survey indicated that levels of female trainees in a spread of UK-based law firms ranged from between 48.6% in the Magic Circle to 64.5% in the regional firms, meaning there are, on average, more women being trained than men. The 2014 survey suggests that the percentage of female partners in law firms drops drastically to as low as 17.5% in the US firms to 26% in the regional firms. Something is going fundamentally wrong with how the profession nurtures, develops and retains female talent if more than half of all those trained are not staying in private practice.

Crucially, law firms are likely to be missing out financially from this lack of senior female representation. Earlier this year, the Peterson Institute for International Economics in collaboration with EY produced a report entitled [“Is Gender Diversity Profitable?”](https://piie.com/publications/working-papers/gender-diversity-profitable-evidence-global-survey), which was backed by analysis of 21,980 global, publicly traded companies. The report found resounding evidence that having at least 30% of women in the “C Suite” (senior executive roles) adds 6% to net profit margins.

The fundamental question is: How do we achieve better gender balance in law firm management specifically?

There are four techniques that I think are essential and that could be deployed by law firms simply and quickly in relation to their women:

1) Spotlighting

One of the points that Sheryl Sandberg’s book [Lean In](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385349947/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385349947&linkCode=as2&tag=dealbreaker-20&linkId=ZTOQ2BAVQMCMOHJY) (affiliate link) hit upon so accurately is the issue women have of making themselves heard and getting attention for themselves, their brand, their attributes and abilities. By consciously spotlighting women in the organisation, the pace of change in diversity misalignment may well accelerate. I have seen this done very well where women, who are not already partners, are encouraged to take on responsibilities and speak about the performance of the initiative they are tasked with to the partnership on a regular basis. It is the exposure of women to management and management to women that can help begin to bridge gaps. Equally, if partnerships have women at the table but they are in the minority, asking them for their thoughts or contributions is a very good way to spotlight female perspectives and make time for their voices to be heard.

2) Empowerment to lead

Leadership involves the complicated dynamic of motivating different individuals to achieve a joined-up aim. I am always reminded of the difficulties of leadership when I watch episodes of “The Apprentice”, which is a British TV show that tracks a set of candidates who are seeking seed capital for their businesses as they perform team tasks over several weeks. The best team leaders are usually those that are able to identify the strengths of the wider team quickly and communicate effectively to direct those strengths. Corporate law firms are rich with leadership opportunities because, essentially, they service a series of mini projects, whether they are cases, advisory matters or transactions. They are also typically hierarchically structured, so internal reporting lines can be easy to establish without too much fuss. If departmental managers are focussed on developing women in their team, they must empower them with leadership opportunities frequently, so that a leadership skillset can be honed.

3) Marketing Plans

If law firms could give more strategic thought to how they ensure that women can be involved and remain involved in marketing in law firms, I am almost certain that more women would make it to partnership. Client support is absolutely critical to the process of becoming a partner. If clients want to work with someone, they will probably exert the right amount of pressure on that firm and provide the positive recommendations needed to propel that person through the system. If women are not getting enough marketing exposure with clients at the firm, the reasons for that should be analysed and addressed. If it is because a woman cannot commit to evenings, question whether they could market with clients who prefer breakfast or lunch events? If it is because they don’t appear to like sport, question whether they’d like to go along anyway? As a business-development exercise, people are often prepared to spend time at events they may not choose to attend personally if it means they can meet new contacts. Question whether too much budget is being spent on too narrow a set of activities and whether people have diverse ideas that could encompass a broader spectrum of participants.

4) Maternity Coaching

I was offered the services of a maternity coach when I was pregnant at work and it was particularly helpful in planning my exit and re-integration into the firm. Lots of people won’t appreciate or understand the value of it and may dismiss it as nonsense, but I credit it as a primary reason that I have remained in private practice. I had very few role models to look up to when I had my children and those who were around were, quite understandably, frantically busy with their own workload and family commitments. I was the first of my group of departmental associates to have children and so I didn’t have a lot to benchmark from by way of managers or peers. I leaned heavily on that outside advice to work on ways that I could give the right messages in departing and returning to work and managing visibility whilst I was away. It is a financial investment by the law firm, but one I would encourage firms to make. When the law firms consider how much they have already invested in training women at entry level, it is a relatively small investment to provide a few hours of coaching in order to try and retain a valuable talent pool. It is also educational for the firm itself, which will receive information on what the coaches are seeing other firms do for their women and the types of adaptations and practices that are proving successful.

I have no desire whatsoever to be a Queen Bee in my organisation; I truly hope that senior women in law firms will make a concerted effort to support initiatives that benefit other women. We can’t work this unbelievably hard to prove ourselves as capable, only to pull up the rope ladders behind us.

# Eliminating Politics From Politics
## Why don't we elect politicians who broadly campaign on the basis of taking politics out of politics?

Think for a moment about a tough political issue.

In the year 2034, for example, the Social Security program will no longer take in enough money to pay benefits at the current level. If we want Social Security to continue to operate in its current form, we have to fix that.

Every sentient person in the country knows how to fix it: We must raise the eligibility age beyond age 62, raise the full retirement age beyond 67, and increase the amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax. (Employers and employees currently contribute 6.2% of wages to Social Security, up to a cap of $160,000 in 2023. You could raise that cap — slightly increase it, or double it, or triple it, or eliminate it entirely — if you were considering reforms.) We should also consider means testing Social Security, so rich people who don’t need Social Security benefits are paid less or nothing at all.

This has to be done slowly, to avoid hurting people who are already at or near retirement age. Perhaps, for example, we could say that for people currently younger than 40, the eligibility or full retirement age goes up by a year, or those ages slowly go up for younger and younger people.

Devising an appropriate solution would take some horse-trading, but this could be solved by putting a couple of smart people alone in a room for a couple of days.  The problem isn’t hard; it just requires compromise.

Our political system doesn’t permit this. Gerrymandered congressional districts mean that Democrats are generally running in heavily Democratic districts, and Republicans are generally running in heavily Republican districts. In 2022, elections for fully [84% of House seats](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/921157591636742161#) either were decided by 10 points or more or were uncontested. This means that Democrats basically can’t lose in general elections; they can lose only in primaries in which they are attacked from the left.  Similarly, Republicans basically can’t lose in general elections; they can lose only in primaries in which they are attacked from the right.

Democrats in Congress are thus encouraged to take far-left positions (to avoid any primary challenge from the left), and Republicans are encouraged to take far-right positions (to avoid any primary challenge from the right). Nobody is encouraged to reach a fair compromise in the middle, even if compromise would be best for the country. Instead, you take an extreme position, avoid a primary, cruise to victory in the general election in your gerrymandered district, and keep your job.

If anyone had the temerity to suggest that the Social Security system could be saved in a heartbeat by reasonable compromise, both sides in Congress would erupt in horror. Democrats would insist that it’s outrageous to suggest that the retirement age be raised because that amounts to a cut in benefits, which Democrats won’t countenance. And Republicans would insist that it’s outrageous to raise the cap on the amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax, because that’s a tax increase, which Republicans won’t countenance.

The political system thus forces the Social Security system, which could be fixed in a heartbeat, to continue on the road to financial disaster.

In another area, we’ve designed a system to remove politics from politics. It’s extremely hard to close military bases, because if you close a base in one Congressional district, you eliminate a ton of jobs in that district, which could cause the local member of Congress to lose his or her seat. Closing military bases thus becomes a heated political issue. To take the politics out of base closings, Congress enacted the [Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/4454944101251496/921157591636742161#) under which the Secretary of Defense proposes which bases should be closed, an independent nine-member panel evaluates the list (by taking testimony, etc.) and has the chance to revise the list, the panel is required to provide its list of proposed closures to the president by a specified date, and the president passes the list on to Congress with the provision that the list must be approved or rejected in its entirety — no haggling is permitted.

This takes the politics out of politics, forcing Congress either to accept or reject wholesale the reasonable choices made by the panel.

Why not do the same thing with Social Security? Set up a panel, let the panel propose changes, and then vote on whether the changes suggested by the panel should be accepted or rejected as a whole.

This would permit the politicians on both sides to grouse — “I hate the benefit cuts” or “I hate the tax increases,” but “I wasn’t permitted to change the proposal; the damned panel forced my hand” — while solving an important national problem.

Come to think of it, why don’t we elect politicians who broadly campaign on the basis of taking politics out of politics:

What’s your position on the budget deficit?

We should refer it to a bipartisan (or nonpartisan) panel, and then have an up-or-down vote on the compromise solution that the panel reaches.

What’s your position on immigration reform?

We should refer it to a bipartisan (or nonpartisan) panel, and then have an up-or-down vote on the compromise solution that the panel reaches.

It would be awfully easy to campaign that way — candidates wouldn’t have to memorize answers to endless questions about endless different issues — and it might actually result in Congress achieving something.

No?

# Foley & Lardner To Feel Wrath Of The Lincoln Project
## The firm distances itself from partner Cleta Mitchell.

Free advice for all Biglaw firms: you will be held accountable in the court of public opinion for the work you and your partners do. That’s a lesson[ Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/yesterday-was-the-day-america-learned-what-weve-known-about-jones-day-all-along/) is [well acquainted](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/oh-to-be-a-fly-on-the-wall-at-jones-day-as-dissension-at-the-firm-grows/) with. As is[ Porter Wright](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/another-biglaw-firm-withdraws-from-election-litigation-no-not-jones-day/). And[ King & Spalding](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/protests-and-boycotts-come-to-jones-days-doorstep/). And [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/is-biglaw-really-depraved/). You get the point. So if a partner at your firm plays a prominent role in one of the most shocking phone calls in American history, well, you’ve got some ‘splaining to do.

Of course I’m talking about Foley & Lardner partner [Cleta Mitchell’s participation i](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/donald-trump-drags-biglaw-firm-into-middle-of-election-interference-effort/)n Donald Trump’s harassing of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to just “[find 11,780 votes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html).” It seems that the [never-Trump PAC](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/jones-day-to-prepare-for-a-bad-pr-campaign-the-likes-of-which-theyve-never-seen-before/) [The Lincoln Project](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/lincoln-project/) has[ turned their attention](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/01/04/lincoln-project-takes-on-foley-lardner-over-partners-role-in-trumps-call-to-georgia/) to Biglaw over the incident.

Can you believe this law firm represents [@MLB](https://twitter.com/MLB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). America’s past time deserves representation that stands up for America, not tried to destroy it!

Office of MLB Commissioner: 212-931-7800

Oh, and they represent [#socialist](https://twitter.com/hashtag/socialist?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) dictator Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela.

— The Lincoln Project (@ProjectLincoln) [January 4, 2021](https://twitter.com/ProjectLincoln/status/1345904371163426817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

There are already murmurs of [Foley losing business](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/donald-trump-drags-biglaw-firm-into-middle-of-election-interference-effort/) over Mitchell’s  involvement in the debacle, and tweets like these from The Lincoln Project only ups the pressure.

And they aren’t the only PAC paying attention to Biglaw. MeidasTouch — remember they are the ones that actually [drew first blood in the campaign against Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/you-have-to-watch-the-opening-salvo-in-the-anti-jones-day-ad-campaign/) — has turned their attention to Foley & Lardner. One the the PAC’s founders, [Ben Meiselas](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/Ben-Meiselas/), partner at [Geragos & Geragos](https://www.geragos.com/attorney-profiles/ben-meiselas), has been very vocal about the firm’s involvement, specifically when Foley attorney [Jason Villalba ](https://www.foley.com/en/people/v/villalba-jason)tweeted ([though he’s since deleted it)](https://twitter.com/P210Mark/status/1346143766332248067?s=20) about the now infamous phone call without condemning Mitchell’s involvement.

Jason, I appreciate you are a member of GOP who has spoken out against Trump. But you are listed as a lawyer at [@FoleyandLardner](https://twitter.com/FoleyandLardner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and your law partner is the main lawyer advising Trump on the sedition you speak against. You need to take a stand against Foley’s support of this. [https://t.co/By7edP6C6F](https://t.co/By7edP6C6F)

For their part, the[ firm has made a statement](https://www.foley.com/en/insights/news/2021/01/firm-response-reports-partner-cleta-mitchells) about Mitchell’s involvement, saying they’re “concerned” by it:

Foley & Lardner LLP is not representing any parties seeking to contest the results of the presidential election. In November, the firm made a policy decision not to take on any representation of any party in connection with matters related to the presidential election results. Our policy did allow our attorneys to participate in observing election recounts and similar actions on a voluntary basis in their individual capacity as private citizens so long as they did not act as legal advisers. We are aware of, and are concerned by, Ms. Mitchell’s participation in the January 2 conference call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly.

But critics are not impressed by it:

As a lawyer, let me say, THIS is why people HATE lawyers. [@FoleyandLardner](https://twitter.com/FoleyandLardner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) just posted this word diarrhea of a statement on its Twitter and disabled comments. This is NOT how law should work! Which is why we will expose aiding and abetting sedition at every turn. [pic.twitter.com/3Spd0ICWIu](https://t.co/3Spd0ICWIu)

Listen — the firm has been on notice about Mitchell’s extremist political leanings for a long time. (She was famously part of an [anti-gay rights crusade](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/04/cleta-mitchell-of-foley-lardner-an-anti-gay-gay-icon/), attended the [Amy Covid Barrett](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/amy-covid-barrett-discovers-how-nicknames-actually-work/) nomination celebration — without[ wearing a mask](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cleta-michel-freedomworks-rose-garden-covid-trump_n_5f7b74f2c5b688b05a5954d7), natch — and worked to keep the Steve Bannon PAC [donor rolls secret](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/bannon-hires-mueller-skeptic-cleta-mitchell-to-represent-his-nonprofit.html).) And just this past November, she [went on Fox News to tell tall tales of voter fraud.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-partner-on-fox-news-peddling-tales-of-voter-fraud/) It’s past time they decided what they’re going to do about it.

# Stroock Staffers Were 'Ignored' By Partners, Left 'In The Dark' About Firm's Dire Straits
## Stroock staffers are now facing layoffs amid an uncertain employment market, and say they were left to fend for themselves during the firm's troubles.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Largely, everyone was in the dark. Partners were not coming into the office much over the summer, and when they did, they didn’t want to deal with questions.

— A former Stroock & Stroock & Lavan staffer, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/09/everyone-was-in-the-dark-for-stroock-staff-no-communication-no-jobs/) on the plight that staffers are currently facing ahead of Stroock’s dissolution. The staffer continued, noting that “they [Stroock partners] would ignore us,” and that while associates received information on the state of the firm, “it was bare minimum” and that the information came “only when pressured.” According to a WARN notice, nearly [140 staffers will face layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/stroock-to-lay-off-nearly-140-employees-before-it-officially-closes-its-doors/) prior to the New York office’s closure on January 30, 2024.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Even Deeper Austerity Cuts
## Bigger and longer salary cuts are on the horizon for these Biglaw associates.

A billion-dollar Biglaw firm has announced even more COVID-19 austerity measures. Reed Smith, which already announced salary cuts, told associates today that their salary cuts would be extended through the end of the year and that they’d be deeper than before.

[Back in March](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-cuts-back-partner-compensation-amid-covid-19-economic-upheaval/?rf=1), the firm announced that they were slowing partner cash distributions, emphasizing that business is good, but made the move as a “precaution” and “bracing for the short-term and potential long-term economic impacts of COVID-19” before [even more partner compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/reed-smith-partners-taking-another-covid-19-financial-hit/) cuts were announced. [Then in April](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/reed-smith-salary-cuts/), they announced associate pay will be cut by 15 percent for May through the end of August.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Now we hear that the salary cuts will continue through the end of the year, and they’re getting bigger. According to sources at the firm:

Reed Smith held an all associates call today. The previously announced 15% salary cuts for associates will continue until August, and from August to December it will increase to 20%. Associates are pissed, especially those who have remained extremely busy and are billing hours normally throughout this time.

Sandy Thomas, Reed Smith’s global managing partner, provided the following statement outlining the austerity measures, which contextualizes the pay cuts on an annualized basis (which reflects a smaller number than the 20 percent cuts to their paycheck that associates can expect from August to December):

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our priorities have always been to protect the health and wellbeing of our people, to safeguard jobs wherever possible, to provide the highest quality service to our clients, and to manage the firm prudently. As a result of the prolonged economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we have made the difficult decision to take further actions to ensure our business emerges from the pandemic in a position of strength.

Reed Smith’s owners, rightly, continue to bear the largest share of the financial burden of the firm’s actions. As we continue to manage the challenges created by the crisis, today we are taking further actions that affect the firm’s lawyers and professional staff across the United States, Europe and the Middle East. They include:

· The previously implemented lawyer compensation reductions will be extended through the end of the year. On an annualized basis, compensation reductions will be 14% for Fixed Share Partners, 12.5% for Counsel, and 12% for Associates.

· Most professional assistants and other select professional staff will move to a four-day week, with corresponding compensation reductions, and a small number of employees will be furloughed on a temporary basis.

· The salaries of professional staff annually earning more than $100,000 (or equivalent), who are not subject to other employment actions, will be reduced nearly 6% on an annualized basis.

· In London, the firm’s largest office, we are initiating a targeted redundancy process that will impact a small number of lawyers and staff.

The firm expects most of these measures to be temporary, and during this time, healthcare and other benefits will remain intact for all lawyers and staff.

In Asia, similar actions affecting a small percentage of lawyers and professional staff were already undertaken earlier this year.

Like all well-run businesses, during the normal course of managing the firm we continually evaluate the size and shape of our global organization to ensure that it matches the needs of our clients. This practice is as important as ever during the pandemic.

# The Latest In Biglaw Perks? Concierge Service. Oh Good, Now You Have More Time To Bill.
## The firm says they want their attorneys to be able 'to spend their very precious downtime on what they want to do.'

On its face, this seems like a really cool perk. Kirkland & Ellis has rolled out a new service — Kirkland Concierge —  as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2018/11/13/at-kirkland-concierge-service-aims-to-ease-personal-distractions-for-lawyers/) Law.com, which provides attorneys and senior staff with access to on-call concierge services to provide assistance with all manner of personal errands. So if you need a hand booking a last-minute getaway or securing the must-have toy of the holiday season, the firm is providing the resources to get it all done without sacrificing any of your free time — or any of those precious billable hours.

And that’s really the tightrope Kirkland is walking. While it might be nice to not have to track down a location that has large TV boxes as you plan a move, there’s a very real perception that the firm is happy to take busy work off of attorneys’ plates so they can spend that time billing. But Chiara Wrocinski, senior director of legal recruiting and development, whose frustration with her own stress of the holiday season last year was part of the motivation for the program, insists the service is really designed to help professionals at the firm live their best lives:

“It’s not to provide a service so people can work all the time,” said Chiara Wrocinski, the firm’s senior director of legal recruiting and development. “It’s to provide a service that will supplement and enhance the lives of our attorneys and give them an opportunity to spend their very precious downtime on what they want to do.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In the month that the program has been up and running, approximately 20 percent of eligible employees have used the service. So far, associates have taken advantage of the perk at a higher rate than partners, and the gender divide has been about equal amongst users of the concierge. One project the service recently tackled was assisting a lawyer who was closing on their house in two weeks. Amidst the craziness of moving, the attorney was asked to go to Europe for a work trip. Having concierge services available at during that incredibly trying time must have seemed like a godsend:

“The planning and organization kept everything on track and I appreciate your responsiveness during this very stressful period,” the lawyer wrote to the concierge firm, according to Wrocinski. “Thank you for everything. It was a pleasure working with you.”

This type of concierge service is not popular in the world of Biglaw, but Wrocinski sees it as essential to creating the kind of workplace that attracts the best talent. One interesting stat the firm discovered while researching the service is that while only 3 percent of companies offer a similar perk, 30 percent of employers on “best place to work” lists provide some version of concierge services to its employees.

“Our goal is to create an environment where they’re going to the best place to work,” Wrocinski said. “This isn’t a Band-Aid to a grueling bleed. This is because we want you to come here. We want you to have the best opportunities to learn; to be mentored; and to spend time with clients. And then we want you to go home and feel energized and want to come back here tomorrow.”

Given the firm’s [now public stance on mandatory arbitration agreements](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/harvard-law-school-students-organize-dumpkirkland-campaign-over-biglaw-employment-arbitration-agreements/), one has to wonder if you have a dispute with the concierge service if you’d be forced to arbitrate it…

Bitcoin, the preferred currency of both the nerd you cheated off in ninth grade and his crystal meth dealer, is one of those technologies that just won’t go away. The “cryptocurrency” discovered by computational “digging” brings goldbugs that one delicious step closer to a privatized monetary supply full of wild speculative bubbles and devastating crashes, just like Ayn Rand would have wanted. But beyond Bitcoin proper, the technology involved, known as “Blockchain,” could influence the way we do business in any number of ways (check out Big Law Business for an [informative interview](https://bol.bna.com/will-blockchain-affect-your-practice-or-firm-perspective/) with a group of lawyers who practice in this area, too).

And Steptoe & Johnson wants to lead on this evolving area of law, announcing that partner [Jason Weinstein](http://www.steptoe.com/professionals-Jason_Weinstein.html) and counsel [Alan Cohn](http://www.steptoe.com/professionals-Alan_Cohn.html) will head up a [Blockchain and Digital Currency practice](http://www.steptoe.com/practices-388.html).

As [Forbes reports](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/08/09/as-bitcoin-technology-makes-inroads-one-law-firm-launches-multidisciplinary-blockchain-practice/#4773d25a11fb):

“The blockchain, like the internet, is going to have an impact on just about every existing type of institution in the years ahead — both private sector and government,” says partner Jason Weinstein, who, as a deputy assistant attorney general at the United States Department of Justice, led DOJ’s cybercrime and organized crime efforts, and will co-lead the practice. “So having a multidisciplinary blockchain practice puts the firm in the best possible position to help a wide variety of clients in a wide variety of industries prepare for that transition.”

Even if you’re inclined to mock the idea of Bitcoin, other uses of Blockchain technology, such as “smart contracts” — contracts with terms that morph based on code — can revolutionize industry, while unmooring contract law from your casebook.

“There’s a whole range of issues that go into looking at the applications of a smart contract to existing businesses — how terms will be interpreted, the way terms are written, the recourse that’s available to parties that feel a contract was or was not executed consistent with its terms, how smart contracts intersect with established areas of law, like law governing insurance contracts or law governing releases,” says Cohn. “So in just something as simple as applying a smart contract to a research and insurance contract, you basically have to go back through the principles that underlie that area of the industry — how insurance contracts work, how they’re interpreted, what presumptions are used, and really examine them in the way that a smart contract on the blockchain would work.”

Congratulations to Steptoe on its new business unit. May Blockchain be more “World-Wide Web” and less “Betamax” for your fortunes.

# Another Litigation Boutique With Market-Beating Bonuses
## The top bonus was an eye-popping $430,000 (but there is a catch).

One of the big trends of the past decade or so in the world of top-tier private practice has been what I’d call “The Rise of the Boutiques.” Partners have left top-tier Biglaw firms to start their own elite small firms — and many of them have thrived.

These boutiques have been sharing their wealth with their associates, often meeting or beating the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/). Litigation boutiques offering market or above-market bonuses this year include [Kaplan & Company](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/elite-litigation-boutique-matches-cravath/), [Holwell Shuster & Goldberg](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/litigators-celebrate-their-cravath-scale-bonuses/?rf=1), [Wilkinson Walsh + Eskovitz](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associate-bonus-watch-firm-beats-cravath-scale-for-all-associates/?rf=1), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/california-litigation-boutique-crushes-market-bonuses/), and [Susman Godfrey](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/great-bonuses-at-a-great-trial-firm/?rf=1). (Check out our [associate compensation scorecard](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/associate-compensation-scorecard-2017-which-firms-have-announced-bonuses/) for a comprehensive list of bonus announcements.)

The newest addition to the club is a firm that should be familiar to devoted Above the Law readers: [Bursor & Fisher](http://www.bursor.com/). As many of you might recall, name partner Scott Bursor [successfully represented](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/alexandra-marchuk-v-faruqi-faruqi-the-end/) Faruqi & Faruqi and its founding partners, siblings Nadeem and Lubna Faruqi, in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed by former Faruqi associate Alexandra Marchuk. The case went to jury trial, and in the end, in the words of [one juror I interviewed](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/02/alexandra-marchuk-v-faruqi-faruqi-a-juror-speaks/), “We didn’t buy her story.”

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
One wonders how the case would have turned out had it gone to trial after the start of our current national reckoning with issues of sexual misconduct. Marchuk supporters would probably argue that she would have prevailed and that her case was “ahead of its time”; Faruqi supporters would respond that not all claims of sexual harassment are valid — and that invalid ones do a disservice to the many that are well-founded.

In any event, the Marchuk case does show how clients turn to Bursor & Fisher during times of crisis — and how Scott Bursor and his colleagues deliver great results. And for these victories, they are paid well. In terms of associate bonuses:

1. Associate bonuses at Bursor & Fisher ranged from $25,000 to $430,000. They were paid earlier this week.

2. Scott Bursor informed lawyers of their bonuses during the firm’s year-end reviews, which were held at the Fountainebleu Hotel in Miami Beach from December 6 to 10. (All lawyers and staff were flown to Miami and put up at the Fontainebleau for four nights.)

3. The bonus system is not lockstep. Instead, bonuses are based on criteria like business origination and revenue.

4. Every lawyer who has been with the firm for at least two years earned a bonus of $100,000 or more. The top bonus, $430,000, went to a fourth-year associate who brought in a big class action settlement this year. A first-year associate received a $50,000 bonus.

5. Bonuses at every level were well above the [“Cravath scale.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/)

A $430,000 bonus sounds pretty awesome, doesn’t it? But there’s a catch: base salaries are below the [Cravath scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1). Instead, Bursor & Fisher associates earn a base salary of $100,000, with the majority of their compensation coming from the year-end bonus. This compensation model is more like Wall Street than Biglaw, where people are paid for performance rather than seniority.

The risk-averse might not like it — but if you’re entrepreneurial and believe in yourself, a firm like Bursor & Fisher might be the place for you. And according to Scott Bursor, his associates tend to beat the market even in total compensation after they’ve been with the firm for a few years.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
“This year was pretty typical for us,” Bursor said. “Our bonuses have historically been well above the Cravath scale. By year three our associates are usually earning six-figure bonuses that put their total compensation way above their counterparts at big New York law firms.”

Remember also that practicing law [isn’t all about the benjamins](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/). It’s also about the types of matters you work on, and the people you work on them with — and on that score, it sounds like Bursor & Fisher lawyers are happy campers.

“I truly enjoy working here,” one associate told me. “The experience and assignments I’m getting are far more advanced than that of my peers in Biglaw. And to see that hands-on experience translate into courtroom success is really gratifying. This year we won three motions for class certification in federal courts. We also won summary judgment for the plaintiff in a class action against Hearst. We don’t lose much. And winning is a lot of fun.”

“Also, working alongside Scott Bursor is a great education,” this lawyer added. “Scott teaches by example, and it’s pretty special to watch how he develops the litigation strategies and then executes on them.”

Congratulations to Bursor & Fisher on another strong year, and congrats to its associates on the nice bonuses.

# Biglaw Firm Accuses Associate Of Downloading Sensitive Data Before Quitting
## The associate has been very vocal about her grievances against the firm on social media.

Littler Mendelson has been granted a [protective order](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/LITTLERMENDELSONPCvsULIANAKOZEYCHUKDocketNoDC2302509TexDistCtFeb2/2?doc_id=X4P0EMNTLT18ABRBD002QHIN9JN) against a former associate, Uliana Kozeychuk, to prevent her from utilizing the confidential firm and client information the firm says she downloaded. According to court filings, Littler maintains in February of this year Kozeychuk downloaded 7,900+ documents, including firm proprietary and client data, to an external Dropbox while she was on Family Medical Leave Act leave.

Kozeychuk has said the downloads were “exclusively personal in nature.” Additionally, as [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/littler-targets-ex-associate-accused-of-stealing-sensitive-info) Bloomberg Law, Kozeychuk has asserted Littler’s legal maneuvers are an effort to distract from other issues:

Kozeychuk has launched a blistering social media response, accusing her former firm of targeting her for complaining about “abuse” by Littler shareholders.

“They know that I didn’t take any documents and they did it as a smear campaign to silence me and make sure that nobody believes me when I finally get around to speaking about them,” Kozeychuk said in an interview.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Kozeychuk [has been posting](https://twitter.com/UKozeychuk) about the case to social media with the hashtag [#TimesUpLittler](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TimesUpLittler?src=hashtag_click).

Littler’s filings also say Kozeychuk refused to return the information she allegedly downloaded, as [reported by](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/littler-alleges-associate-uploaded-7900-documents-to-external-dropbox-before-quitting) ABA Journal:

Littler general counsel George Wood first confronted Kozeychuk about a download of more than 3,100 documents in a Feb. 19 email, the firm said in its petition. After receiving the email, Kozeychuk uploaded the 7,900-plus documents to the Dropbox, the firm said. Littler placed Kozeychuk on unpaid leave Feb. 21 and demanded return of the information.

She refused Feb. 23, according to the Littler petition.

According to Littler, she responded this way: “Let me make something clear. Absent a court order regarding the same, I will not be providing Littler IT department or anyone else with my private account login info and access to my private files stored there. I have years’ worth of private photos and documents in there, among other things, that I do not wish to have anyone to peruse and to violate my privacy rights based on some false and defamatory accusation. Go to court, prove that I did anything wrong, get a court order, and I’ll be happy to comply then. We both know this will never happen.”

Two days after being placed on unpaid leave, Kozechuk quit.

In a sure sign this litigation is already getting heated, the firm has responded to the allegations:

“Ms. Kozeychuk has also chosen to publicly discuss grievances against the firm, including allegations that were investigated during her time at Littler and found to have no factual support,” the firm said in a statement to Bloomberg Law.

“Her actions are unfortunate, but we continue to focus on her improper conduct and are taking all necessary steps to assure both client and firm documents are protected,” the firm said.

Two years of living and working under the umbrella of the pandemic has prompted many lawyers to reassess their priorities, their jobs, and even their choice of career. This phenomenon (which is not limited to attorneys, of course) has fueled talk of “[The Great Resignation](https://attorneyatlawmagazine.com/the-great-resignation-associate-shortage-cause-effect)” and “[The Age of Anti-Ambition](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/magazine/anti-ambition-age.html)”—not to mention an[ exceptionally hot lateral market](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/the-hottest-biglaw-practice-areas-for-lateral-moves-and-more/) and flurry of[ market-setting raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) as[ firms compete](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) for associate talent.

For those of you joining the mass migration, we want to know why — what makes for greener pastures in your eyes? For those who plan to remain where they are, what keeps you motivated? Has the nature of your work — or the nature of your feelings about work — changed? How do your current career goals compare to those you had prior to the onset of the pandemic?

Please tell us about your experiences in this [short, anonymous survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1HxeXA8IKoxeZNQ), conducted with our friends at[ Adam Smith, Esq](https://adamsmithesq.com/). And please pass the survey along to your colleagues and friends at other firms. We want to hear from as many associates as possible!

## Like most of you, Valerie Katz spends her free time trying to come up with a plot idea for Miss Congeniality 3. It is hard, however, to mess with perfection. Having reached the limits of her creativity, she decided to look to actual events (and, of course, small law firm news) to serve as the inspiration for her movie plot. And she found just what I was looking for, thanks to a real-life Miss Congeniality and Mr. Social Security. Intrigued? Check out photos of a certified hottie, after the break....

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  

The beautiful and congenial [Kia Hampton](http://www.reverbnation.com/kiahampton), Miss Congeniality USA 2011, recently [joined](http://www.sacbee.com/2012/01/10/4176215/kia-hampton-miss-congeniality.html) the [Eric C. Conn Law Firm](http://mrsocialsecurity.com/), a Social Security disability law firm, as the Public Information Director. In her new role, Hampton will provide the public with information regarding Social Security benefits and serve as the spokeswoman for the firm, “spreading awareness about the different events and services” provided by the firm.

[Eric Conn](http://mrsocialsecurity.com/?page_id=8) explained Hampton’s role as follows:

I know with Kia on our team, we will be able to expand the organization by hosting more events and increasing our public services, which will ultimately enable us to accomplish the important mission of reaching more people with the message about Social Security Disability.

While I am not sure what will go down at these “events,” Hampton will likely inform people of the following facts about the Eric C. Conn Law Firm.

1. [The Law Firm is A Law Firm.](http://mrsocialsecurity.com/?p=76)

Oh yeah, the Eric C. Conn Law Firm has lawyers! Why should this matter? Because these legal eagles took “the LSAT (Law School Admission Test), attend[ed] an ABA-accredited law school, and pass[ed] the bar exam. [And] . . . must abide by the rules of professional conduct.”

2. Eric Conn Went To [Harvard Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/harvard-law-school/).

I do not think he obtained his J.D. there, but he [did attend](http://mrsocialsecurity.com/?page_id=8) a “program of instruction for lawyers” there. And, I bet he visited there many times.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
[](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2012/01/Kia-Hampton-2.jpg)3. The Eric C. Conn’s Law Firm’s [Office](http://mrsocialsecurity.com/) has the Second Largest Seated Statute of Abraham Lincoln.

Why does this matter? I’m not sure, but that Kia Hampton sure is pretty!

4. The Eric C. Conn Law Firm Employs 40+ [Team Members](http://mrsocialsecurity.com/?page_id=106).

Why does this matter? Because, like Hampton, many of these “Team Members” are [sweet eye candy](http://mrsocialsecurity.com/?page_id=106). Be still my heart, Team Member Ken!

Not only does this sound like an awesome law firm, but it sounds like the perfect setting for Miss Congeniality 3: Armed And Billing Hours. Sandra Bullock will not be playing the part of Public Information Director, however; rather, Bullock will work along side the real Miss Congeniality, as a lawyer (a real one!) at the Eric C. Conn Law Firm.

Spoiler alert: Bullock is sitting at her desk — dressed in chinos and a sweater set, toiling away on a Social Security disability case — when the bad guy enters the firm. Instead of reaching for her gun, she reaches for her BlackBerry. Awesome!

The list has not changed."" You can see Trump's shortlist(s) [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/) and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/making-scotus-even-greater-trumps-supplemental-supreme-court-shortlist/).

We can’t afford for a president to fail."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor has spoken out about the results of the presidential election, and she thinks that we must guide President-elect Trump to make the right decisions for the country. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/11/16/justice-sotomayor-we-cant-afford-for-a-president-to-fail/)] * The American Bar Association's Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar has sanctioned not one, but two law schools for their lax admissions standards. Valparaiso Law has been publicly censured and Charlotte Law has been placed on probation. We'll have more on this later today. [[National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202772574398/ABA-Sanctions-Two-More-Law-Schools-for-Lax-Admissions?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL)] * Judge William Duffin of the Eastern District of Wisconsin has denied a request made by state prosecutors to delay ""Making a Murderer"" subject Brendan Dassey's release from prison.

The list has not changed.” You can see Trump’s shortlist(s) [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/donald-trumps-supreme-court-shortlist/) and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/making-scotus-even-greater-trumps-supplemental-supreme-court-shortlist/).

* “Every good person has an obligation to both to continue being heard and to continue doing the right thing. We can’t afford for a president to fail.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor has spoken out about the results of the presidential election, and she thinks that we must guide President-elect Trump to make the right decisions for the country. [[WSJ Law Blog](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/11/16/justice-sotomayor-we-cant-afford-for-a-president-to-fail/)]

* The American Bar Association’s Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar has sanctioned not one, but two law schools for their lax admissions standards. Valparaiso Law has been publicly censured and Charlotte Law has been placed on probation. We’ll have more on this later today. [[National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202772574398/ABA-Sanctions-Two-More-Law-Schools-for-Lax-Admissions?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL)]

* Judge William Duffin of the Eastern District of Wisconsin has denied a request made by state prosecutors to delay “Making a Murderer” subject Brendan Dassey’s release from prison. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel says he will appeal Duffin’s ruling to the Seventh Circuit. Dassey is scheduled to be released on Friday.

# Don't Vote For Chris Christie, But Give Him A Buck!

I’m able to hold two contradictory thoughts in my mind at once.

On the one hand, I despise Chris Christie.  When he was campaigning for president in 2016, he knew the trouble with Donald Trump. Christie played conventional politics at the time, saying only that Trump lacked the [temperament or experience](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/ct-aud-nw-nyt-chris-christie-donald-trump-20230607-vz3ujm4o65cafnwixgt7urgexi-story.html) to be president, but Christie knew full well that Trump would be a disaster. Indeed, Christie swore that he would [never endorse Trump](https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/union-leader-joe-mcquaid-christie-trump-endorsement-219874). The instant Christie dropped out of the race in 2016, however, he immediately endorsed Trump, hoping to become vice president or attorney general. For the next four years, Christie sucked up to Trump nauseatingly, placing politics and power ahead of principle. Only now, when Christie is again running for president against Trump, is Christie shocked — [shocked!](https://noagenda.fandom.com/wiki/I%27m_shocked,_shocked_to_find_that_gambling_is_going_on_in_here!) — to realize that Trump was unfit all along.

This is pure politics, and I hate it. We need people with principles, not spineless jerks, to run for office. I won’t vote for Chris Christie.

On the other hand, I have donated one dollar to Christie’s campaign. To [qualify for the first Republican primary debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/us/politics/republican-debate-criteria.html) in August, candidates must (1) garner 1% in multiple national polls recognized by the Republican National Committee and (2) have a minimum of 40,000 unique donors. Christie has been polling reasonably well, but he may have [trouble obtaining contributions](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/christie-trump-40000-donors_n_6479080de4b0047ed78019b8) from the necessary 40,000 donors.

I don’t want Christie to win the presidency — I just explained why I think he’s a scumbag — but I absolutely want Christie on the debate stage. Christie’s the only Republican candidate who’s been willing to criticize Trump directly and in plain English. Christie has acknowledged, for example, what any sentient being knows — that Trump “[incited](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/06/30/trump-mocks-chris-christie-again-after-christie-claims-trump-wishes-he-was-putin-in-america/?sh=7f6d7c055f73)” the riots on January 6. Christie has said that Trump’s conduct as alleged in the Mar-a-Lago indictment is “[awful](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4046667-christie-says-conduct-alleged-in-trump-indictment-awful-says-lot-more-information-to-come/),” and that there’s [more information to come](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4046667-christie-says-conduct-alleged-in-trump-indictment-awful-says-lot-more-information-to-come/). Christie has said that Trump “[knows that he’s in trouble](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-christie-trump-classified-documents-case-knows-hes-in-trouble-own-worst-enemy/)” and that “[none of this would have happened … if he had just returned the documents](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-christie-trump-classified-documents-case-knows-hes-in-trouble-own-worst-enemy/).” And I bet Christie is just getting warmed up. Christie’s willingness to attack Trump is what distinguishes him from the rest of the Republican field and draws media attention.

Just wait for the first debate: Whether or not Trump chooses to participate in that debate, Christie will unload both on Trump and the other candidates who are unwilling to criticize Trump’s conduct. Trump has been found liable for sexual assault. (Had you already forgotten about that?) An indictment (and a tape recording) suggest the Trump is oblivious to national security; he has disclosed classified government documents to people who lacked security clearance. It’s undisputed that Trump stood around for three hours on January 6 before doing anything when a mob ransacked the Capitol. Republicans need to hear this. I want Christie on the debate stage. So I’m doing my bit (actually, [eight bits](https://sunfarm.com/images/2bits.htm#:~:text=Spanish%20dollars%20were%20deemed%20equivalent,and%2015c%20a%20long%20bit.)) to get him there; I’ve donated a dollar to the Christie campaign.

Here’s my request: Join my campaign!

Above the Law is a powerful website. Please join me in contributing one dollar to Chris Christie’s campaign, and spread the word through Twitter, Facebook, and other social media. Explain why everyone should contribute a dollar to Christie — not because you necessarily support him, but because he’ll speak the truth about Trump to a Republican audience. We can single-handedly (well, my single hands with the assistance of your many hands, anyway) cause 40,000 people to donate to Christie’s campaign and get him on that debate stage.

Let’s do it: Here’s the Christie [website](https://secure.winred.com/chris-christie-for-president/donate-today/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwnf-kBhCnARIsAFlg490WShueWBhcxQ7tIIneJ2aZ6qXtgfkHecs_hfLDjAFAUQXuyLSp57UaAiXYEALw_wcB) where you can make your contribution. A few clicks and you’re done! I’m talking about only a buck. And you’ll get the pleasure of watching at least one Republican speak the truth about Trump during the first primary debate.

# Mandatory Retirement Policy Sends Skadden's First Female M&A Partner To Mayer Brown

Martha McGarry packed up her business and moved over to Mayer Brown this week. But this wasn’t just another move in a red hot corporate market. McGarry had to relocate in order to keep her practice going.

Skadden, like many Biglaw firms, has a mandatory retirement policy at 70. With McGarry facing an involuntary end to her career, she found that she just couldn’t leave her clients and struck out to find a new home.

McGarry has been a prolific M&A lawyer for decades and said in an interview with Bloomberg Law she wants to maintain that practice. She has spearheaded deals for American Express Co., The Coca-Cola Co., and The Hershey Co., among other household names. She said she wanted to continue working with her clients, which she will do as co-leader of Mayer Brown’s M&A practice.

“They are part of the daily fabric of my life,” McGarry said of her clients. “And the more I contemplated that all ending, I just decided: No. My energy level is incredibly high. There are lots of things that would be fun to be a part of and to accomplish, and I don’t want to stop.”

A lot of firms have mandatory retirement policies, but should they?

On the one hand, the human mortality rate remains locked at 100 percent, so firms must always plan with an eye to the future. Mandatory retirement sets a predictable timetable for partners to port business to younger attorneys to keep the firm’s revenue stream locked in. It’s also a valuable tool for retaining that young talent that may move themselves if they don’t see a clear path forward. Up and coming attorneys don’t just miracle themselves Coca-Cola as a client, they depend on rising in seniority on deal teams, generating trust, and eventually earning the baton as senior partners retire.

But none of that helps if the retirement policy encourages partners to take their books across the street. Who cares about securing long-term business when it costs the firm those clients entirely? Despite that mortality rate, lifespans are getting longer and a 70-year-old partner today is a lot friskier than a 70-year-old partner from 1985. On balance, senior attorneys likely have years (if not decades) more in the tank these days than partners of yesteryear when firms settled on this number out of a hat.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Unfortunately, that’s also an overarching problem with the whole economy. Boomers refusing to get out of the workforce has [created mass stagnation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/07/jobs-baby-boomers-older-workers-may-block-millennials-careers/4170836002/). While late stage capitalism forces older Americans to keep working well past the benchmark for retirement just to stay afloat, one presumes M&A partners with revenue numbers in the tens of millions wouldn’t be hurting to step aside.

And not for nothing, but generally speaking, partners at firms with mandatory retirement ages benefitted from those policies when they were younger when they collected business from their own mentors. To some extent, if a partner takes the front end benefit of the policy, they should give it back on the other side.

Though maybe that’s just outdated thinking! There may have been a day when clients stuck with firms through multiple generational handoffs, but that’s not how most in-house counsel operate today. If a partner they trust steps down, the next lawyer up at the firm may get a crack at the business, but the client is likely to open it all up to see what’s out there. In a world where business isn’t a rubberstamp transfer, succession planning is less important than keeping the attorney with the established relationship front and center and generating revenue.

So do firms waste potentially lucrative years from senior partners at the peak of their careers or waste (and potentially lose) younger talent waiting around for an opportunity to grow into a long-term business generator? Difficult question.

That’s probably why the divide on this question is roughly 50-50.

# Surprise! It's Completely Wasteful For Clients To Impose Bespoke Billing Requirements.
## The pursuit of efficiency isn't getting the job done.

Over the years, in-house counsel have gotten more persnickety about law firm billing. And while it’s true that the days of “further work” diary entries took advantage of the relationship between firms and clients, the modern era led to clients producing tomes of idiosyncratic billing guidelines to micromanage the process. Legal departments claim it’s about efficiency, but at the end of the day it’s just gumming up the whole process and creating unnecessary waste.

There are providers out there [helping law firms cope](https://abovethelaw.com/legal-innovation-center/2019/12/10/in-house-counsel-make-increasingly-arcane-billing-demands-and-its-costing-firms-money/) with these billing bibles. The [iTimeKeep](https://www.aderant.com/itimekeep/) system, for example, gives guidance at point of entry that something might violate a client’s specific billing rules. But for all the technological help out there, there’s reason to believe that it’s not going to be enough to stay ahead.

Because at a certain point these variations are going to be [too much for the technology to police](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2020/10/23/legal-departments-challenge-e-billing-cant-fully-automate-guideline-compliance/) and then firms and clients are going to have to bring on people to sort it out.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Human error may be one problem that e-billing technology never entirely trumps. Lisa Pizzo Maki, the director of legal administration at Fiserv, noted that some law firms “will always be sloppy.” And while LEDES may continue to roll out new billing codes as the need arises, there’s no guarantee that a firm will use them. “For example, if I told my law firm ‘I want you to use e-discovery codes.’ What if they don’t?” she said.

But to be sure, law firms may also be struggling with certain aspects of the e-billing process themselves. HBR Consulting’s Clem pointed out that a firm may be grappling with a large roster of clients, all with different variations on billing guidelines. How a legal department feels about paying for first-year associates, for example, could vary from company to company.

Yet it is the tragedy of dealing with lawyers that “our billing system has gotten so complex and time-consuming to manage” is met with “so let’s throw more resources at it” rather than “maybe we should reconsider the mess we’ve made.

[Nathan Wenzel of SimpleLegal] believes that the value in ALSP bill review is the ability to go a step beyond an analysis of whether a bill complies with a specific set of guidelines. “[ALSPs] are going to bring in legal knowledge to identify if that work should have been done at all. And that is very powerful,” he said.

So now we’re hiring ALSPs to look at the bills that the software already reviewed to see if there are other arcane mistaggings and — more incredibly — to second guess whether the work should have been done in the first place? Make no mistake, no one is questioning Skadden’s bills. This is where that gap between the law firm haves and have nots grows with clients nickel and diming the Am Law 51-200 firms to death while never daring to question the elite firms that they hired in bet-the-company matters just to avoid taking any heat from the board.

This isn’t to say that there aren’t bad actors out there in the billing game, but if clients want cheaper options to remain viable they need to start reevaluating this drive to micromanage the billing process. Firms are already investing in tech and wasting more of their days complying with varying policies. Adding a whole other layer of cost in order to catch a sliver of overbilling and to compromise the firm-client relationship by challenging whether or not a research project was even necessary seems like a wasteful pursuit.

Can we all just get back to building a service relationship based on mutual trust? Is that too much to ask?

# Fall Bonuses Are Great But Remember The Incoming Associates Struggling To Make It To Their Start Dates

We’ve been treated to a string of good news from the biggest law firms in the world lately. Many have reversed the salary cutbacks instituted at the beginning of the COVID recession and several have brought joy to their associates with new [Fall bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bonuses/) to [sweeten the pot](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/). Of course, not every firm is [in the giving mood right now](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/), but the clear momentum of the Biglaw universe is in favor of bonuses to reward attorneys who’ve managed to keep these firms profitable while the rest of society collapsed.

Lost in the autumn compensation news are the incoming first-year associates who have had their start dates put off as firms try to weather the storm. To some extent, this is a product of bar examiners continually pushing the exam farther into the future as [disastrous wrinkles keep cropping up](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/bar-exams-in-the-time-of-covid-crashes-hacks-and-a-few-masks/). But beyond the bar exam, firms just don’t want new associates joining up right now when they feel — rightly or wrongly — that they can’t properly train them remotely and worry that they don’t have enough work to get the recent grads engaged.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
From the perspective of the firms, it’s not an absurd position. I entered as a first year while my firm huddled in borrowed office space after Cleary Gottlieb lost access to its offices being based next door to the World Trade Center and I never really felt like a functioning associate until we moved back into the real offices and I did actually have some semblance of in-person training. So I get why they don’t think adding people right now is feasible.

For the future associates themselves though, this is brutal. Some law firms are paying these folks who expected to start working, but many more are just offering salary advances… or nothing at all. While no one is complaining about having walking around money at this point, advances really just amount to asking associates to further borrow against their future interests, something they’ve functionally been doing for three years — if not seven — already. Deferring the hit they’re taking right now over the next few years is better than nothing, but amounts to yet another roadblock to getting started as financially independent beings.

Worse, law school health coverage is coming to an end for a lot of these graduates and some law firms aren’t stepping up to at the very least add incoming associates to the plan during a pandemic. This obviously isn’t true of all firms — checking the ATL tracker, it looks like [Reed Smith and Troutman Pepper have enrollment options and Orrick is offering a health care stipend](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/biglaw-start-dates-whens-your-firm-welcoming-new-associates/) (perhaps others… this is a reminder for firms to let us know so we can highlight you) — but firms that haven’t offered this as a minimum have put grads in the position of trying to find health insurance, which can often [still leave people uncovered with arbitrary beginning and end dates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/delayed-bar-exams-leave-applicants-without-health-insurance/).

Imagine sitting at the end of September with no job until at least January, going further in debt, without health insurance, and with bar examiners saying this seems like a perfectly reasonable time to take a slapdash test.

And then imagine hearing that your firm is handing everyone already over there a big bonus. This isn’t meant to begrudge the associates who’ve busted their asses to keep billing from home, but we should take a second or two to consider the impossible circumstances we’re foisting upon the class of 2020.

# The Return Of The Dreaded Biglaw Deferral Is Now Being Praised By Industry Insiders
## Which firm will be the next to announce a deferral of its incoming first-years?

Business demand in Biglaw has slowed dramatically from its peak in 2021. Outright layoffs are happening across firms of all stripes, with lawyers and business professionals being “rightsized” out the door, and stealth layoffs are happening at the same time. Is it time for incoming associates, once so happy-go-lucky about starting their Biglaw jobs, to worry about their futures?

It just may be, because we now have industry experts promoting the case for deferring first-year associates.

If case you’re unfamiliar with deferrals, we’ll provide some background. [Back in 2009](https://abovethelaw.com/deferral-stipend/), when Biglaw firms were faced with the problem of too many employees and not enough work, they came up with a unique plan to deal with this issue: the deferral. (This was part of a larger plan to deal with The Great Recession and also included mass layoffs, stealth layoffs, hiring freezes, and pretty much whatever Biglaw firms could think of to save a few bucks.) Incoming first-year associates’ start dates were delayed for up to a year (or [sometimes longer](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/08/dla-piper-defers-half-the-class-of-2010-to-2012/)) and many received compensation for going away with the understanding that they would be able to come back to the firm and resume their Biglaw careers after the deferral. Unfortunately, even the best laid plans fall apart, and some associates weren’t welcomed back to their firms on time — or at all, ever.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Some Biglaw firms, like [Gunderson](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/) and [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/), pushed their first-years into deferrals more recently in the wake of announcing layoffs en masse. And now, with layoffs running apace, deferrals are being praised.

Hugh A. Simons, former senior partner at The Boston Consulting Group and chief operating officer at Ropes & Gray, predicts in a column published in the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/16/the-case-for-deferring-first-years/) that sometime in the next few weeks, Biglaw firms will approach their incoming associates with a year-long deferral offer — one that includes a stipend and insurance — explaining that due to current market conditions, they may not be able to work as much as necessary to grow and develop with the firm. “If such is to be expected,” he writes, “then it is to be fervently hoped that many 3Ls will give such deferral serious consideration.”

Based on some of the recent deferrals we’ve seen, would-be first-year associates will receive just a fraction of what they’d be making if they had started working on time, and to our knowledge, they will not receive health insurance. That sounds like a bit of a raw deal. But why not use those lemons to make lemonade, counters Simons.

Market demand for corporate transactional services is extraordinarily soft right now. This lowers the prospects of incoming associates having a strong, successful, start. A curious dynamic within Big Law firms is that a strong start is hugely predictive of having an enjoyable and rewarding career, with the reverse also being true. Thus, pushing off a start date for a year, by when market demand is expected to have rebounded, positions an incoming associate more robustly for success.

More broadly, a career can span 30 to 40 years. The loans will get paid off. Taking a year before you dive in and instead exploring something outside the mainstream is no bad thing. When firms offered deferral stipends in the wake of the global financial crisis, people went off and worked at non-profits, took lower-court clerkships, helped in political campaigns, did advocacy work for immigrants, took master’s degrees, or just traveled. Saliently, 10-15 percent didn’t come back to their firms. There was something more compelling out there.

So, what’ll it be for incoming first-years? Will their firms opt to defer them or accept them into their loving corporate arms, soft demand be damned? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see which firm is next to make a move.

# Law Firms With High Profits Per Partner Continue To Embarrass Themselves By Not Raising Compensation
## Associates, it may be time to consider a lateral move if your firm is unwilling to compensate you fairly.

We’ve been closely monitoring legal markets across the country ever since Cravath decided to raise associate salaries to the $180K scale. Some firms have fallen in line, and others have remained silent, causing their associates to wonder why they hadn’t considered moving to greener law firm pastures sooner.

Last week, we [wondered](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/elite-firms-need-to-increase-compensation-recruiters-smell-blood-in-the-water/), “[W]hat is the real cost for law firms of not moving to the market salary? [T]hey run the very real risk of losing some of their best talent to firms willing to play ball.”
This statement could not have been more realistic. Thus far, more than 60 firms have matched the Cravath scale, and associates at firms that have been hesitant to upgrade their salary scales have received emails like this from recruiters:

Well reality bites.

Dechert hasn’t stepped up to the new money reality across the board. While it may very well do so, what is it waiting for?

Dechert is supposed to be a market leader! (And, as the firm doesn’t appear on the latest salary wars scorecard being updated by Above the Law, the entire community can see that it really isn’t!)

This isn’t what you signed up for when you chose Dechert, was it?

Why not take advantage of a market that has real opportunities available at firms that HAVE stepped up and HAVE increased compensation across the board for ALL class years?

Aren’t you worth it?

Call me and we’ll talk about your options.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
That email was sent to Dechert associates last night, and early this morning, the firm finally announced its associate salary raises. But at the end of the day, it really doesn’t matter which firm’s associates received this email — its content is applicable to associates at all firms that have failed to take action on a nationwide movement that has shaken the legal industry — for large firms in particular — to its very core.

There are still many, many Am Law 100 firms with profits per partner that exceed $1 million that have not announced market salary raises. Those firms [include the following](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/profits-per-partner-at-am-law-100-firms-that-have-not-raised-salaries-for-associates/):

1. Wachtell Lipton: $6,600,000
19. King & Spalding: $2,515,000
35. Fragomen: $1,850,000
38. WilmerHale: $1,810,000
43. Alston & Bird: $1,745,000
51. Morgan Lewis: $1,530,000
52. Katten: $1,510,000
53. Fish & Richardson: $1,490,000
54. Greenberg Traurig: $1,475,000
55. Sheppard Mullin: $1,445,000
56. Kaye Scholer: $1,380,000
58. Holland & Knight: $1,250,000
61. Pillsbury: $1,185,000
63. Foley & Lardner: $1,130,000
64. Reed Smith: $1,105,000
65. Perkins Coie: $1,100,000
66. Mintz Levin: $1,065,000
67. Venable: $1,060,000
68. McGuire Woods: $1,045,000
70. Pepper Hamilton: $1,025,000
71. Seyfarth: $1,020,000
72. Jones Day: $1,010,000

With no indication that any of these firms will consider fairly compensating their associates with market salaries any time soon, we have a message for associates: “Why not take advantage of a market that has real opportunities available at firms that HAVE stepped up and HAVE increased compensation across the board for ALL class years?”

As even occasional readers know (and thank you for reading, even occasionally), I am not a fan of social media. There are far too many incidents of lawyers and judges behaving badly on various platforms and paying the prices in reputation, discipline, and public pointing of fingers, aka shaming. For whatever the reason or reasons, they lose all sense of proportion, propriety, and purpose when their fingers do the walking and talking and plain lose their minds. I won’t link to various articles because they are just too numerous to mention. If you haven’t read Dave Eggers’s book, “[The Circle](https://www.amazon.com/Circle-Dave-Eggers-2014-04-24/dp/B0182QFJMC/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3RPX4YZU81JOC&dchild=1&keywords=the+circle+dave+eggers&qid=1635384249&qsid=135-9469141-6552607&s=books&sprefix=the+ccircle%2Cstripbooks%2C573&sr=1-2&sres=0345807294%2CB0182QFJMC%2C0593315340%2C0375725784%2C0525656979%2C0593501349%2CB07TGFB1QR%2C0593323181%2CB07KB3SGWB%2C039335668X%2C0310327121%2C110197463X%2C1781256853%2C1682996670%2C0316556327%2C1595547924&srpt=ABIS_BOOK),” which came out a few years ago, do so. Any relation to Facebook? I will let you decide.

So, as I looked at various daily feeds I receive, I came across this; yes, it’s on Twitter, but it was a link on one of my feeds that I couldn’t resist sharing. (That’s my excuse, and I am sticking to it.) [John Della Volpe](https://iop.harvard.edu/about/staff/john-della-volpe) is the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy Institute of Politics and he shared (on Twitter) [the unsurprising results](https://twitter.com/dellavolpe/status/1448022068193333248?utm_source=join1440&utm_medium=email&utm_placement=newsletter) (at least to me) about social media.

According to Volpe, two-thirds of those who use social media think that life was better without them. It’s just the dinosaur lawyer in me, but I think that social discourse (and I am not sure that the word “social” can be used in this context, any more than the term “social media” can be used) has taken a direct hit over the past decade and certainly within the past five years. Not a shocker to me or to anyone else who thinks that social media platforms weaponize hate and division and preclude rational discussion on topics where people can disagree and not be crucified for different opinions.

I don’t know how scientific the polls truly are, but I have found one on a favorite topic: gender discrimination. As if women needed confirmation of the effects of mansplaining and male interruptus, a Gallup poll confirms that women in this country are dissatisfied with [the way they are treated](https://www.thelily.com/us-women-are-largely-dissatisfied-with-how-theyre-treated-most-men-dont-see-a-problem/?campaign_id=30&emc=edit_int_20211022&instance_id=43517&nl=the-interpreter&regi_id=78061995&segment_id=72390&te=1&user_id=0d22f8d038b2fef3184a5c3bba481c1c). No kidding. Men are oblivious. An understatement? Moreover, Black and Hispanic women are more dissatisfied than white women. No surprise there.

Given the havoc that the pandemic has wrought for women, it’s no surprise that the female workforce has lost more than 300,000 jobs, due to child and family care issues, layoffs, and other reasons for leaving the workforce. Women lawyers may be willing to stay in their jobs if they can [work remotely](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/working-remotely-where-lawyers-work-now/?ct=t(191-102221-Spannhake_COPY_01)&mc_cid=b3ead6213a&mc_eid=57d56f37f0), but that’s not the reality for frontline workers, who we owe our everlasting thanks.

The more women (and men) [can work remotely](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/journal/articles/2021/how-one-law-firm-plans-to-embrace-remote-workeven-after-reopenin/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=salesforce_451344&sc_sid=04744929&utm_campaign=MK20CNTT&promo=MKCONTENT1&utm_content=&additional4=&additional5=&sfmc_j=451344&sfmc_s=83087486&sfmc_l=2198&sfmc_jb=4009&sfmc_mid=100027443&sfmc_u=13220942), while managing the myriad of life’s other responsibilities, the better.   Being able to work remotely should not be a situation of “Mother, may I?” (Or is that too old [a game](http://www.toyassociation.org/genius/play-ideas-tips/play-ideas/mother-may-i-game.aspx#.YXhR857MJPY)) for the newbies to know about?)

Working remotely is and will continue to be a benefit for lawyers with disabilities, a topic that no one seems to talk about much, including me. My apologies. What remote work may do, among other things, is reduce the challenges that disabled attorneys encounter in practice. The stigma of working remotely is so 2019, and even those firms that want attorneys to be “front and center” may find it difficult to have attorneys agree to daily office presence. The issue will be how to balance the collegiality that an in-office experience can provide (though not always) with the benefits of working remotely. However, some remote workers feel isolated while others cherish the isolation. If diversity and inclusion are goals of the profession, then working from home is a way to meet those goals. Any movement forward in the hiring and retention of any underrepresented cohort is progress.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And about diversity and inclusion, an Ohio law school has devised a new way to prime the pipeline for a more diverse profession. The University of Dayton law school is working with two firms who are promising jobs for graduates even before law school entry. A creative way to make the profession [look more like](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firms-promise-jobs-before-law-school-new-diversity-push-2021-10-21/) the clients it serves.

The law school and the two firms, Thompson Hine and Taft Stettinius & Hollister, will select two students from a pool of underserved college graduates. The firms will provide full-ride scholarships to a J.D. degree, plus an annual stipend, plus summer jobs at the firms and a full-time job offer after graduation. This could be the start of something big. The Dayton dean describes the program as the “ ‘Moneyball’ for legal education,” figuring out where talent may be, even before an undergraduate has thought about lawyering as a career. (And if you haven’t either read the book “Moneyball” by Michael Lewis or seen the movie, do so.)

The program is not without risks: what if the student hates law school, can’t keep up, or drops out? Those are risks worth taking. It’s an idea that could spread across the country and make legal education not only more affordable but substantially less expensive. What a concept. As ATL and other publications make it clear, many firms are rolling in dough and wouldn’t it be nice if they would pay it forward, literally?

Jill Switzer has been an active member of the State Bar of California for over 40 years. She remembers practicing law in a kinder, gentler time. She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Kirkland & Ellis Offers Bonuses That Beat The Market... But Leave Associates Grumbling
## Why are people upset to be getting more?

K&E made its reputation with associates by offering above-market bonuses. The firm swims in cash and makes its largesse a key recruiting point, promising associates a healthier bank account at the end of the year. This year, Kirkland managed to beat the prevailing market bonuses again, but associates aren’t particularly happy about it.

Kirkland is among those firms that refuse to offer lockstep bonuses or even lockstep bonuses with a discretionary kicker. Instead of providing the market transparency that associates can rely upon, K&E hands out individualized bonuses leaving associates to wonder if they’re making more, less, or the same as their peers. More importantly, it leaves Above the Law wondering if any individual tipster is representative of the firm’s policy or not. That’s why tips from associates are even more essential at black box firms.

First, the good news. Based on what we’ve received, associates working in the 2200-2400 range are routinely getting between 1.2 and 1.3 times the standard Milbank scale bonuses. There’s a lot of variation in between those poles, but most tipsters seem convinced that they’re falling somewhere in that range.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Normally, a market-beating bonus would be enough to salve associates, but folks at Kirkland have a keen sense of history and are aware of a troubling trend when it comes to comp. A few years ago, the firm was handing out 1.4x bonuses and set a 1.05x “floor” that no associate could fall below. Last year, the floor was gone and associates reported receiving between 1.25-1.33x. Now the tips we’re getting hew mostly to the 1.24-1.27x range. Is the firm regressing on comp while it continues to surge in revenue? Associates seem to think so.

A 2016 in the meat of the range reports that “people are generally very unhappy about bonuses” and a 2017 points to the considerable hours billed and notes that Katten Muchin would have paid an extra $7K for the effort. There haven’t been any complaints about Timmy in the office down the hall getting more for doing less. Though that’s probably bad news for the firm that associates are more annoyed with the trend in bonuses generally to be troubled with a black box spitting out disparate bonuses for the same level of work.

Kirkland is still paying above market, and associates are still generally happier to make more than less. But when associates start to wonder if the good times are leveling off, they start to ask whether it’s worth it to push themselves at a firm like Kirkland when they could make almost as much somewhere else. And for a firm that’s spent years waving cash to win the talent wars, that’s not a positive development.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

## What Biglaw firm earned 15 minutes of fame on The West Wing?

In the TV show, The West Wing, Sam Seaborn worked at the fictional Gage Whitney Pace before he joined the Bartlett campaign, but what real-life Biglaw firm was the character said to work for prior to joining Gage Whitney?

Hint: In a sense, it’s an equally fictional law firm at this point.

See the answer on the next page.

# Biglaw Firm Announces 'Better Than Anticipated' Financial Performance, Rolls Back Austerity Measures
## These salary adjustments will be reflected in paychecks come September.

One by one, Biglaw firms are slowly but surely reversing their austerity measures. Back in April, Stoel Rives — a firm that came in 132nd place in the most recent Am Law 200 rankings, with $236,541,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — announced [across the board salary cuts and employee furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/associates-at-this-biglaw-firm-are-taking-a-20-percent-pay-cut/). Partner distributions were reduced by 20 percent; associates, staff attorneys, and of counsel attorneys had their salaries slashed by 20 percent; and staff saw hourly reductions with corresponding pay cuts (5 percent for those earning less than $75,000; 10 percent for those earning $75,000-$100,000; 15 percent for those earning $100,000-$150,000; and 20 percent for those earning over $150,000). On top of that, staff bonuses were deferred and hours-based associate bonuses were eliminated in favor of discretionary bonuses. Last but not least, 10 percent of the firm’s staff members were furloughed.

Now, thanks to the firm’s “better than anticipated” performance during the pandemic, come September 1, those cuts are being partially rolled back. Melissa Jones, the managing partner of Stoel Rives, released the details in a statement (available on the next page):

- The current compensation reduction for all associates, staff, and of counsel lawyers will change from 20% to 10%.
- Staff salaries and schedules will be modified as follows:
- Staff with a 20% reduction will change to 10%
- Staff with a 15% reduction will change to 7.5%
- Staff with a 10% reduction will change to 5%
- Staff with a 5% reduction will return to full salary and schedule
- Third quarter partner distributions will be reduced by 15% instead of the 20% reduction in Q2

Everyone at the firm must be pleased (and wondering if their salaries will be fully restored sometime in 2020). Hopefully bonuses will be reflect the firm’s better-than-expected financial performance as well.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Latham's Take On New Salaries Includes A Boost For Senior Associates
## Welcome to this summer's salary games!
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

Shares[](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/latham-raise-2021/&text=Latham’s%20Take%20On%20New%20Salaries%20Includes%20A%20Boost%20For%20Senior%20Associates)[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/latham-raise-2021/&display=popup&ref=plugin&src=share_button)[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/latham-raise-2021/)[](javascript:void(""#ea-share-count-email""))
What’s going on at Latham & Watkins, the second-best law firm in the country? Latham has, in a word, “Lathamed” the old salary scale in favor of the $205K starting salaries championed by Davis Polk and matched by almost every other firm at the top of the Am Law rankings. (Unfamiliar with that term? Click [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/06/how-did-latham-become-the-poster-child-for-layoffs/).)

Latham took home $4,333,763,000 gross revenue in 2020, and certainly has the cash to spare. Would the firm really have walked into on-campus interviews paying associates less than their peers? Oh, please.

Here’s what the Davis Polk match looks like at Latham (in the firm’s U.S., London, Middle East, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tokyo offices):

- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000
- 2012+: $375,000
Ooh, one of the most profitable firms in the country is showing the love to its eldest associates with a $10,000 boost. Latham joins the handful of firms that have been willing to make this small financial sacrifice for its most loyal associates.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Latham & Watkins.)

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# Nashville: The (Legal) 'It' City

2021 marks my seventh year in Nashville, the longest uninterrupted stretch I have lived in any one place since moving away from home to start college … last century. It is fair to say that I have changed since arriving in Music City.  There are the obvious changes, adding a spouse and four children in my first five years at the top of the list, but more subtle behavioral differences as well.  I have become a bit friendlier and more patient, though 98% of car horns that I hear are still my own. Southern slang has made its way into my vernacular to the point that my phone will now autocorrect to “y’all’s,” though I have never started a sentence “[Howdy from Nashville, y’all!](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/politico-ben-shapiro_n_60009e8dc5b6efae62f6f2f7)” because I’m not an absurd poser.

Yet for all my own changes, the transformation that Nashville has undergone during these seven years has been far greater. Not only do construction cranes seemingly blot out the sun downtown, but the building boom stretches through all parts of greater Metro Nashville. Just a few streets over from my home, well away from the downtown core, a block that previously housed a handful of single-story restaurants and businesses is being transformed into the “[finest music performance hall on any college campus in the world](https://belmont.edu/community/construction.html).”  Near Vanderbilt, there was a massive excavated lot that stretched nearly eight stories below ground and had laid vacant for so long that it was deemed [a lake](https://wpln.org/post/curious-nashville-the-construction-pit-that-became-known-as-a-lake-and-whats-happening-now/) by Google Maps due to it being regularly filled with stagnant rainwater. But in 2021, the “lake” is no more and a half-billion-dollar mixed-used development featuring [penthouse condominiums](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/development/residential-real-estate/article/21142917/broadwest-penthouse-units-to-start-at-21m) on the market for more than $2 million nears completion — this is a veritable steal in comparison to the [$25 million (not a typo) Grand Penthouse](https://www.wsmv.com/news/davidson_county/four-seasons-nashville-sells-80-million-of-private-residences-in-one-day/article_e04b08a8-b59f-11ea-a2b1-a7c54584d7ba.html) at the soon-to-be completed Four Seasons Nashville. Years ago, the neighborhood just outside of downtown known as “the Gulch” was nothing more than abandoned railroad tracks and [The Station Inn](https://www.stationinn.com). Today, the trendy area is home to [luxury boutique hotels](https://www.thompsonhotels.com/hotels/tennessee/nashville/thompson-nashville?_ga=2.236074182.691148264.1614923603-946820905.1614923603), the offices of [William Morris Endeavor](https://www.wmeagency.com/offices/), [excellent](https://www.the404nashville.com) [restaurants](https://www.otakuramen.com), and The Station Inn.

The city is currently home to more than [three dozen tower construction cranes](https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/maps/nashville-crane-watch), which is more than you will find in cities like Boston, Phoenix, and even my previous home of Washington, D.C. While I would like to say it was my arrival that sparked this construction boom, the unprecedented growth had started well before my relocation. There is no single moment that kickstarted Nashville’s rapid growth. Some point to the 2010 approval of the massive [Music City Center](https://www.nashvillemusiccitycenter.com), which opened three years later — and looks like a giant guitar from above. Others will cite the 2012 debut of NBC’s [Nashville](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2281375/) which beamed stunning images of the city to television sets across the world.  But regardless of when one thinks Nashville’s Big Bang took place, it is hard to overlook the importance of January 8, 2013. It was then that the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/us/nashville-takes-its-turn-in-the-spotlight.html) published a piece by reporter Kim Severson declaring Nashville the “‘it’ city.” Soon thereafter, more than [100 people](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2019/04/18/nashville-population-growth-slows-2018/3498194002/) were moving to Nashville every single day. The influx of new residents became so significant that local clothing merchant [Project 615](https://project615.com/collections/t-shirts/products/unicorn-tee) started selling [T-shirts of a unicorn](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0248/5551/1145/products/Unicorn-project-615_600x.png?v=1607730198) below the phrase “Nashville Native” (our family owns both a full-sized and onesie version).

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The appeal of Nashville was not merely limited to those looking for a new home. [Five million more people](https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/cover-story/article/21069569/rip-it-city) visited Nashville in 2018 than did just six years prior. Somehow, this seemingly innocuous place in the American South became the [bachelorette party capital of the world](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/bachelorette-party-nashville-tennessee/index.html) — while this CNN article is nearly 2 years old, a quick drive around town on an average weekend provides ample evidence that the appeal has not dwindled in the slightest, pandemic or no.

This massive influx of residents and visitors would not have been sustainable if there was not a thriving economy to meet them. For decades, Nashville was synonymous with one industry, music. This understanding transcended national boundaries as even Canadian indie rockers [sang](https://genius.com/Sunset-rubdown-nightingale-december-song-lyrics) over a decade ago of “mov[ing] to Nashville to master the guitar.” But no matter how many [documentaries](https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/) Ken Burns makes on the subject, country music is not enough to sustain a growing city.

Thankfully, Nashville is also home to one of the most vibrant healthcare economies not only in the country but likely in the world.  While again, there are numerous reasons how this came to be, any conversation on the topic should start with HCA Healthcare, the [largest for-profit health system](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/lists/100-of-the-largest-hospitals-and-health-systems-in-america-2020.html) in the United States and which was founded in Nashville over 50 years ago — the fifth- and seventh-largest systems are based in Nashville suburbs.  The sheer amount of money in Nashville health care is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that two of HCA’s founders, the father/son duo of Thomas F. Frist, Sr. and Jr., have their family surname name plastered on nearly [every](https://fristfoundation.org) [philanthropic](https://www.nashvillezoo.org/our-blog/posts/nashville-zoo-welcomes-new-board-members) [endeavor](https://fristartmuseum.org) in the city — not to mention a [U.S. Senate seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Frist) for a period of time.

While there are a number of additional native industries, Nashville has also become an attractive destination for entities looking to relocate. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic made working from home a reality to many, thus rendering expensive office space a relic primed for a savvy account to cut, a number of companies flocked to Nashville with its lower corporate, and residential, real estate costs. Global Asset management firm AllianceBernstein is in the [process of moving](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/finance/article/21137999/pandemic-pushes-back-ab-hq-move) its Manhattan headquarters to downtown Nashville. Even the mom-and-pop outfit know as Amazon (I think I’ve spelled that right) decided to place their slightly Orwellian named [Operations Center of Excellence](https://www.aboutamazon.com/workplace/corporate-offices) in the soon to be completed Nashville Yards.

And yet, despite all of this corporate growth in recent years, the legal industry was surprisingly absent. That’s not to say that Nashville is not home to a number of fantastic law firms. Indeed, without these firms I would not be gainfully employed — though the vast majority of Vanderbilt Law grads end up outside of Nashville, and Tennessee more generally, with Texas and New York serving as the top two destinations for the Class of 2020. But there has not been an AmLaw 50 behemoth which has set up shop in Music City. There have been recent fits and starts in that general direction. Pillsbury houses some of its back office staff in Nashville. In 2015, citing the large health care market, Polsinelli [opened a Nashville office](https://www.polsinelli.com/newsevents/press-release-nashville) with two attorneys, but six years later, the office is still relatively small with only 20 attorneys. This is not to say that Biglaw interest in Nashville expansion does not exist. I once had a conversation with the former office managing partner of an AmLaw 10 firm who was very committed to opening a Nashville outpost, but this partner said the firm did not think the billing rates could be high enough to support attorneys’ salaries. But I had long believed that was a mathematical equation that would eventually be solved. When Biglaw expansion came to Nashville, my thought was it would happen in one of two ways: a) the national firm would merge with (read: buy out) a local firm and be able to take their entire client roster; or b) the Biglaw firm would open their own office in Nashville and grow it gradually. To me, it was strictly a matter of when this expansion would happen, not if.

What I thought was an eventuality came to fruition last month when K&L Gates — for the record the firm I repeatedly predicted, to anyone who would listen, would be the first Biglaw behemoth to stake their claim here, due mostly to their massive geographic footprint — [announced the opening](https://www.klgates.com/KL-Gates-Launches-Nashville-Office-with-Hire-of-25-Lawyers-2-3-2021) of their Nashville office. Of the two scenarios set forth above, the firm struck a middle ground, establishing a new office staffed with more than 25 attorneys brought over from some of Nashville’s most established firms.

While I am keenly interested in the development of K&L Gates Nashville, especially whether they will get to the point of hiring summer associates, I am perhaps more curious as to how this impacts the Nashville legal market.  Again, I can see this playing out one of two ways: a) K&L’s opening is a one-off event that makes a temporary impact, only to fizzle out and not disrupt the established law firm pecking order; or b) much like my own relocation to Nashville, this is part of a much larger Biglaw influx. Perhaps not surprisingly, the latter scenario seems more likely. Nashville today seems quite similar to Dallas in the early part of the 2010s. What had been a legal market which boasted primarily Texas-based firms were in short order overrun with AmLaw powerhouses. [McGuireWoods](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/news/press-releases/2014/3/McGuireWoods-Opens-New-Office-in-Dallas), [Winston & Strawn](https://www.winston.com/en/thought-leadership/winston-strawn-expands-texas-presence-with-addition-of-23.html), [Kirkland & Ellis](https://www.kirkland.com/news/press-release/2018/07/kirkland--ellis-opens-dallas-office), and [Sherman & Sterling](https://www.shearman.com/news-and-events/news/2020/02/shearman-expands-in-texas-with-new-dallas-office) are just a sample of the firms that have opened Dallas offices since 2014. The same combination of an ample client base and a cost of living that would allow $190,000, to say nothing of BigLaw partner share, to buy a lot more than it does in New York or Los Angeles that helped fuel Dallas’ rise seems present in Nashville today.

If this rapid-growth scenario does come to pass, what does this mean for the future of Nashville? Not surprisingly, it depends on who you ask. Not surprisingly, local real estate agents would be ecstatic, but that is probably of limited import to Above the Law readers. For my Vanderbilt Law students, this would be a tremendous development, providing them with many more options if they want to practice law in Nashville. The arrival of K&L Gates alone was enough to prompt some current 3Ls who are all set to practice in other markets after graduation to reach out and see whether I thought there might be some new opportunities in Nashville before too long. And it is not just advantageous to Vanderbilt students, indeed, any law student or even working attorney who is looking for a great city in which to practice law would cheer a rapid rise in Nashville BigLaw offices. Furthermore, partners and even senior associates currently practicing in Nashville might well find themselves to be the proverbial belle of the ball as newly arriving firms are looking for rainmakers and attorneys who can bill a high number of hours to fill out their new offices.  As for native Nashville firms …

# Top-Ranked Biglaw Firm Announces Market Raises, But Only For Associates In Some Offices
## Oof. Associates who won't be receiving DPW matches are likely upset.

Biglaw firms are racing to match the new market salary scale for associates, and we’ve gotten to the point today where as each hour passes, another firm announces that it’s decided to increase salaries. Which is the latest firm to make it rain on associates?

It’s Norton Rose Fulbright, a firm that came in at No. 13 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, taking home $1,877,933,000 gross revenue in 2020. The firm is of course matching the prevailing Davis Polk salary scale — but only in some of its offices. If you recall, the firm did the same thing when it came to its [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/nrf-special-bonus-2021/) (and was one of the only firms to do so), offering payouts on a “regional scale” in some of its smaller markets. This is what associates in the firm’s California, New York, Texas, and D.C. offices will be earning come July 1:

- 2021: $202,500
- 2020: $205,000
- 2019: $215,000
- 2018: $240,000
- 2017: $275,000
- 2016: $305,000
- 2015: $330,000
- 2014: $350,000
- 2013: $365,000

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What will associates in the firm’s other offices — in Denver, St. Louis, and Minneapolis — be earning? We assume those payouts will also be made on a “regional scale,” just like Polsinelli announced earlier in this raise cycle.

Congratulations to (almost) everyone at the firm on their new market salaries. For those in smaller markets, just remember, any raise is better than no raise!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Norton Rose Fulbright.)

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Top California Law Firm Announces Salary Raises
## Which firm has announced raises now?

Biglaw is showing associates some more California love! We’ve seen salary raise news from a bevy of West Coast firms, including but not limited to [Irell & Manella](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/another-west-coast-firm-adopts-the-180k-salary-structure/)), [Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/quinn-emanuel-announces-pay-raises-for-associates/), [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-bumps-salary-to-attract-and-retain-the-best-and-brightest-attorneys/), and [Morrison & Foerster](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-firm-plays-ball-on-associate-salaries/), and now it’s time for another firm to give in to peer pressure and ante up.

Los Angeles-based Paul Hastings has just over 900 attorneys and the firm made more than $1.05 billion in gross revenue last year. With partners each earning about $2.5 million in profits, it’s no wonder that the firm is extending these raises across all of its U.S. offices in California, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Georgia, Illinois, New York, and Texas.

In an email sent by Melanie Rupert and Teri O’Brien, co-chairs of Global Talent Development at the firm, they announce that that Paul Hastings has adopted the Cravath salary scale “in recognition of the fact that our associates are among the very best.” We have to wonder: if Paul Hastings knew all along that its associates were “among the very best,” then why did it take one week for the firm to announce these pay raises? We suppose the firm felt as though continuing to hold out on announcing its raises was [unbecoming of a Vault Law Top 25 firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/which-vault-top-25-firms-have-not-yet-announced-raises/2/).

Congratulations to all associates at Paul Hastings! Your firm may have kept you waiting for a little too long, but knew you were worth it in the end. We hope you’re satisfied.

Remember, we are covering this trend extensively, so please drop us a line — text (646-820-8477) or [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”) — when you know of another firm making a compensation move. Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file. All sources are kept strictly confidential.

# Am Law 50 Firm Will Pay Bonuses Up To $25K Above Market For 'Extraordinary' Performance
## And that's on top of their regular year-end bonuses and special bonuses!

We’re getting closer and closer to the end of 2020, and more and more Biglaw firms are announcing bonuses left and right. Which top-ranked firm is it this time?

Akin Gump — a firm that came in at No. 34 on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, with $1,135,014,000 in gross revenue — surprised associates with a [special bonus match](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/akin-gump-surprises-associates-with-good-news-fall-bonuses/) earlier this fall, and now the firm has announced its year-end bonuses, with a promise to pay out even more on top for extraordinary performance.

The firm has matched the bonus scale originally announced by [Baker McKenzie](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/) and later adopted by [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/cravath-bonuses/), and there’s a 1,950 billable hours threshold (including pro bono hours, general counsel hours, business development hours, and up to 100 hours of time spent on recruiting, diversity & inclusion, and/or innovation activities) to receive a full bonus. The Akin Gump bonus scale can be seen below:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Class of 2020 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2019 – $15,000
Class of 2018 – $25,000
Class of 2017 – $50,000
Class of 2016 – $65,000
Class of 2015 – $80,000
Class of 2014 – $90,000
Class of 2013 – $100,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000

But that’s not all. Each year, Akin rewards associates and counsel who have put in a “truly outstanding” performance, and 2020 is no different. Those who have worked extra hard this year — people whose performance and productivity has been “extraordinary” — will receive additional bonuses ranging from $5,000 – $25,000 above the market level for their class. If you’ve been busting your ass at Akin Gump, you’re in for one heckuva payday.

Bonuses at Akin Gump will be paid no later than February 15, 2021. Congratulations!

# Is This Billion-Dollar Biglaw Firm Offering 'Special Bonuses' In Name Only?
## This can't be how the firm plans to repay associates for its salary cuts....

Last week, Baker McKenzie shocked the Biglaw world with its [early announcement of year-end bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/). It may be one of the highest-grossing firms in the country, but it’s not known as a compensation leader, so everyone was shocked by the move. Thus far, the firm’s announcement has been met with resounding silence; not a single other firm has matched. Associates at Baker McKenzie are pissed — and not just because the bonus scale is the same as it’s been for years across most large law firms.

Associates are angry about another set of bonuses that the firm has promised.

As you may recall, when Baker McKenzie first instituted its salary cuts in May due to the coronavirus crisis — 15 percent for all attorneys and business professionals making over $100,000 in the U.S. and 10 percent across the board in Canada — the firm promised it would hand out [special bonuses for “exemplary performance”](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/baker-mckenzie-salary-cuts/) during the pandemic. The firm later [conducted a round of layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/baker-mckenzie-layoffs/) in the U.S. and Canada, driving remaining associates to bill like crazy in fear of losing their jobs as well. When the firm announced its year-end bonuses, it also announced an end to those salary cuts on November 30, and once again reminded associates about those [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/). At that time, no mention was made of reimbursing anyone for the wages they lost as a result of the salary cuts they endured for seven months.

As it turns out, those bonuses may not be bonuses at all. Sources have told us that these bonuses may be used as a means to address lost compensation, and not everyone will get them. At this point, it’s worth noting that the vast majority of other firms that cut compensation due to the pandemic have already reinstated and reimbursed, or are working to reimburse, full salaries for all affected employees.

Here’s a memo that associates in the Toronto, Canada, office of Baker McKenzie received regarding their special bonuses, where associates are reportedly “furious”:

Please keep in mind that this plan may be limited to the firm’s Canada office. We’ve reached out to Baker McKenzie for comment on whether the firm intends to reimburse its U.S. associates through similar “special bonuses,” or whether it will do so via other means, like lump-sum payments, and received this statement:

The announced bonuses are our year-end bonuses, paid per our usual schedule in January. We also plan to recognize and additionally reward our top performers whose practices have been impacted by the recession, as well as to others demonstrating exemplary performance in the face of increasing demands on their time this year. We will make those determinations after the end of the year.

We have not yet made a final decision on the details of “special bonuses” to compensate for salary reductions in North America. As stated previously, these would be separate and distinct from annual associate bonuses.

Hmm. We suppose we’ll see what happens, but we remain hopeful the firm will repay associates and offer true special bonuses instead of offering bonuses in name only.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Am Law 100 Firm Cuts Associate Salaries And Expects Reduced Pay To Last Through The End Of The Year
## Salary and 401K cuts on the horizon.

Biglaw is still trying to figure out how to survive in a COVID-19 world. What we know so far, is that lots of very big law firms have determined it necessary to enact various austerity measures to maintain cash flow as the economic upheaval continues.

Now we know that yet another Am Law 100 firm has decided to make some cuts. Duane Morris, which took the 75th place in the Am Law ranking with $491,573,000 in gross revenue, is the latest firm with COVID-19 austerity measures.

Duane Morris has cut associate and special counsel salaries by 15 percent. The pay cut will be effective May 1, and the firm expects the cuts to last until the end of the year (though if that changes, the firm says they’ll “reassess the situation”). They’re also cutting 401K matching for the remainder of 2020.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As some tipsters noted, this appeared to be an about face from the hints associates were previously receiving:

Despite announcing earlier in the week that March’s number were “far better than expected,” Duane Morris cut associate and special counsel salaries

Perhaps the firm just expected March to be a dumpster fire? Either way, it sounds like (at least some of) the rank and file got the impression they’d avoid cuts, when maybe they merely meant to signal no layoffs were on the horizon? Whatever misimpressions previously circulated at Duane Morris, we now have a clear understanding of the firm’s austerity measures.

We reached out to Duane Morris for comment, but did not immediately hear back.

# Top Biglaw Firm Hops Aboard The Bonus Train -- With More Money For Associates Outside New York
## This sure is an interesting stop on the bonus tracks.

Choo-choo! Bonus season keeps chugging along, with match after match after match after match, and the only differentiation being that big billers are raking in bigger bucks at some firms. With the latest match, it looks like we’re finally seeing something interesting. What could it be? More money for associates outside of New York!

Mayer Brown — a top-ranked Chicago-based firm that took home $1,840,000,000 gross revenue in 2021 —  is offering a Baker/Cravath match for its associates in New York. Here’s what that looks like at the firm:



For associates outside of New York, however, there’s more money on the table. This is what the bonus grid looks like for associates in the firm’s other offices:



Why extend the extra cash to markets outside of New York? “With the tiered approach, the firm is a leader in associate compensation,” says one of our sources. That could certainly be a reason for doing something like this. But, as one recruiter recently suggested, supplemental bonuses are a [prize for just a few](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/after-a-tumultuous-year-biglaws-supplemental-bonuses-are-a-prize-for-just-a-few/), based on the fact that hours have been much lower across the board in 2022. Even still, we bet that hardworking associates in New York, even if just a handful of them, would have loved to receive the extra love from the firm in the form of more bonus money.

Congratulations on your bonuses, Mayer Brown associates — especially those in other markets who billed extra hard over the course of 2022!

(Flip to the next page to see both memos from Mayer Brown.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

Another elite Biglaw firm bites the dust when it comes to the COVID-19 bonus wars. After waiting a week to see how this would play out, Sullivan & Cromwell has entered the scene. Is another immediate match afoot, or is the prestigious firm going to [pull a Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/)?

Before we get to that, in case you need a little refresher on special fall bonuses, first came Cooley, which started the [COVID appreciation bonus](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) game in the first place.

And now the news you’ve been waiting for. SullCrom’s black bonus box has been smashed open, and it looks like the firm will be matching DPW’s generous scale:

- Class of 2019: $7,500

Several sources have pointed out that SullCrom hasn’t committed to announcing that its 2020 year-end bonuses will at least be as large as the firm’s 2019 year-end bonuses. We’ll have to wait and see on this one, but it’s likely that the firm will ante up when the time comes if they’re willing to hand out special bonuses now.

As noted above, SullCrom’s special bonuses will be paid out on October 15.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Am Law 100 Firm Offers Special Bonuses For Associates
## Some good news after the firm decided to cut salaries for the entire year.

The coronavirus crisis has ravaged the Biglaw scene, with salary cuts, furloughs, and layoffs abound. Some firms are delaying or reducing bonuses, and others are eliminating bonuses (and salary increases) entirely this year. Given the economic fallout of the pandemic, it seemed unlikely that any firm would be offering special bonus payouts — especially firms that had already slashed salaries across the board.

But that’s exactly what’s happening.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Sources tell us that Ogletree — a firm that [reduced pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/not-satisfied-with-unpaid-leave-am-law-100-firm-slashes-salaries-for-all/) for equity partners (by 20 percent), associates (by 15 percent), and highly compensated staff (by 10 percent) for the remainder of 2020 — is offering a special bonus of $10,000 for associates who bill 1,700 hours in 2020. Associates who bill 1,900 hours will receive an additional $10,000 on top of the special bonus, and those who are able to somehow exceed 2,000 hours during COVID times will qualify for a bonus based on a percentage of their salary (whether that’s their salary before or after the reduction is another question).

In a brief memo about these bonuses (available on the next page), [C. Matthew Keen](https://ogletree.com/people/c-matthew-keen/), Ogletree’s managing shareholder, said, “While it is difficult to know what the future will hold, I hope this step demonstrates the firm’s commitment to treat all of our lawyers fairly while recognizing the economic challenges of the current situation.”

What would’ve been really fair here would’ve been for Ogletree to offer this bonus without an hours requirement. Instead, the firm is essentially asking its associates to work even harder to bill hours that may not be available for the chance to see some extra cash — cash they were originally due anyway that’s now going to be taxed as a bonus instead of as regular salary. Don’t expect these bonuses to catch on at firms at the top of the Biglaw heap, because they never cut salaries in the first place.

We reached out to Ogletree for comment, but have year to hear back.

Best of luck to associates as they try to recoup some of the money they’re losing due to the salary cuts through these special bonuses.

# Lawyers Shouldn't Pretend They Are True Believers Of All Their Arguments
## Numerous lawyers in practice pretend that they are true believers of some silly arguments. Why use this tactic?

“Therefore, if Chewbacca lives on Endor, which I truly believe to be the case …”

Attorneys often need to present points that might seem silly or misguided. In certain instances, lawyers do not have any solid arguments so they just need to present any point that they can under the circumstances. Other times, lawyers need to argue points to [secure certain advantages](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/why-some-good-lawyers-make-bad-arguments/) and not give an inch during negotiations. Some lawyers think that good advocacy requires them to seem as if they wholeheartedly believe in the merit of their arguments. However, lawyers should not pretend to be true believers of their arguments in certain circumstances since showing that you are just doing your job by presenting the arguments you may not believe can improve a lawyer’s credibility.

I remember the first time in my career when I had to present a silly argument. I was representing two parties that had both signed releases. In the notice of motion about the release, my adversary put the word “defendant’s” rather than “defendants’” so an argument could be made that the motion only involved one of my clients and not both of them.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Of course, this was almost certainly just a typo on my adversary’s part, and I am sure that all lawyers have seen similar errors in papers that have crossed their desks over the years. However, to be a good advocate, I argued to the court that because of my adversary’s purportedly defective notice of motion, the motion should be denied against my clients. Nevertheless, I made sure to convey using body language and verbal cues that I knew the argument was kind of silly, but that I was just presenting it to be a good advocate. I could see that the judge understood my position, and I had other arguments that were also evaluated by the judge on that motion which might have been undermined if the judge thought I truly believed in a silly argument.

However, I see numerous lawyers in practice pretend that they are true believers in some silly arguments, and I do not really understand this tactic. Maybe lawyers think that their points will be more forceful if it looks like they are being expressed from a position of true belief rather than zealous advocacy. In some instances, presenting such arguments can backfire and cause a lawyer to lose more ground than the lawyer would have if he or she signaled that arguments were just being presented for the purpose of advocacy.

Earlier in my career, I represented a client who resided thousands of miles from the forum where a lawsuit was filed. Despite the distance to the forum and other circumstances, my adversary insisted that my client come to the forum to be deposed personally in the case. Of course, virtual depositions have been around for a long time, so there was no good reason why we could not just hold the deposition virtually. However, I suspect that the other lawyer just wanted to annoy my client, hoping that the threat of traveling all the way to the forum would impact my client’s decision to settle the case.

We ended up conferencing the issue with the court, and the lawyer went into a passionate, and somewhat obstinate, presentation of why the deposition should be held in person in the forum where the case was filed. This attorney did not really present any good reason against a virtual deposition other than it being more difficult to present exhibits during such depositions.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The court seemed kind of upset that this attorney would not just agree to a virtual deposition given how much easier this process was and ordered that depositions occur virtually. Then, the court denied pretty much all of the requests this attorney made. Had this lawyer just signaled that he was presenting the arguments about in-person depositions to be a zealous advocate and that he really did not believe that they were justified in the case, he might have saved his credibility and gotten better results for his client.

All of us know that everyone deserves a defense, and this concept requires us to separate attorneys representing clients from the clients themselves. However, many lawyers still feel the need to pretend to be true believers of their positions, even though there is an assumption that lawyers do not need to agree with their clients. Of course, how an attorney presents arguments varies greatly from circumstance to circumstance, and advocacy before a jury, judge, or other subject might require the attorney to change his or her behavior. However, it is usually best to use verbal or nonverbal cues to signal that an attorney is merely presenting an argument to be a good advocate and is not a true believer of a silly position. This helps preserve the lawyer’s credibility, which can assist the attorney in securing the most advantages for clients.

Earlier this week, a senior associate at Hogan Lovells was assaulted and robbed near her home in Washington, D.C. According to the police, she was walking around 9:40 p.m. this Tuesday, when an assailant approached her and demanded her purse. Though she gave the attacker her bag, she was repeatedly stabbed and the assailant fled.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/05/30/hogan-lovells-senior-associate-recovering-from-stabbing-in-dc/) Law.com, the attacker is wanted in connection with other incidents as well:

D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department issued a statement Wednesday indicating that the same assailant suspected in the attack is also sought in connection to two other armed robbery attempts in the same part of the city involving knife attacks: one in March and another last Saturday night.

Hogan Lovells offered the following statement on the incident:

“This is a tragic incident and we hope she recovers quickly,” a Hogan Lovells spokeswoman said. “Our thoughts are with her and her family at this time.”

They also asked the victim’s name be withheld, at the request of the associate.

The police are offering a $10,000 to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest and conviction of the attacker.

# 'Market Pressure' And Office Mandates Aren't Going To Work Long-Term
## Some Biglaw firms think the job market gives them leverage to mandate in-office work. The data says they're very wrong.

The most dangerous place in America is between a microphone and a Biglaw firm trying to mandate attorneys back to the office. Firms may not be reaching out directly, but there’s no shortage of consultants and background sources willing to tell certain outlets how law firms have “[leverage](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-firms-are-holding-leverage-over-associates-heads-with-their-in-office-work-mandates/)” again and how firms are [ready to ditch lawyers who aren’t eager to come back](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/associates-apparently-wont-have-jobs-for-long-if-they-dont-return-to-the-office/). No one is confused about the source of this “conventional wisdom.”

Yet… most firms aren’t embracing this wisdom. “[You didn’t see your kids before the pandemic, you shouldn’t expect to see them now](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/you-didnt-see-your-kids-before-the-pandemic-you-shouldnt-expect-to-see-them-now-says-elite-law-firm-partner/)” might be the message at Skadden and Davis Polk may be “[predominantly an in-office firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/davis-polk-attendance-in-office-firm/),” the truth is the rush to force lawyers back to the office is notably absent. Biglaw firms normally can’t play lemming fast enough. When one firm sets the bonus market, the rest of the field generally follows suit within weeks. It’s too risky and the talent pool too sparse to play non-conformist.

And a lot of firms just aren’t convinced that the “leverage” is really out there.

They might be right. A [recent Microsoft study](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work-is-just-work) concluded that, “While a less certain job market may motivate some employees to spend more time in the office, a more lasting, effective approach requires concerted efforts to rebuild social capital.” In other words, firms will be sorely mistaken if they’re hoping attorneys are so scared of getting laid off that they’ll swallow in-office mandates.

Where these firms keep getting it wrong is assuming that lawyers never want to go to the office. Very few attorneys expect to work from home all the time, nor do they want to. It’s not the fact of going to the office that they balk at, it’s arbitrarily forcing them to show up on a set day regardless of whether there’s any need for them to be in the office that day or not.

They just want flexibility.

And if the firm wants to manage flexibility, it needs to focus on culture and technology instead of blustering about everyone being at their desks every Thursday.

That same Microsoft survey revealed that what actually brings motivated employees back to the office is providing some reason for them to be there. According to respondents, 74 percent of employees are motivated to go into the office if they know their “work friends” are there. While a mandate might bring everyone under one roof — a fitting way to talk about the [crushing overhead of firms’ reckless commercial leasing](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/biglaw-lawyers-must-return-to-the-office-to-justify-managements-reckless-office-space-leases/) — a more effective method would be to enable those groups come together naturally.

We’ve [raved about Seward & Kissel’s efforts to make office days fun](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/seward-kissel-designs-worlds-longest-miniature-golf-hole/) — and building mini-golf holes seems like fun — but it’s not about the single day that the firm holds a big event, it’s about the connections that event builds that carry over.

And firms haven’t even really begun to utilize the tools out there to build an office community. Some 60 percent of firms have adopted no new technology to support hybrid work and the most popular “hybrid office” tool cited in a recent ILTA survey was… Microsoft Outlook? And even that was a mere 13 percent.

That’s a work tool that works everywhere, not a hybrid work tool!

The [Maptician 2023 Attorney Engagement Survey](https://www.maptician.com/maptician-2023-attorney-engagement-survey-results) found that “presence technology” more than doubles attorney time spent in the office as measured by utilization. If you’ve never heard of presence technology, it’s one of the rare instances where the buzzy tech term is actually self-explanatory. It’s tech designed to inform everyone who is in the office that day, where they are, and for how long. People show up when they need to be in the office and if they don’t need to be in the office… they might show up if they know their mid-level mentor buddy is there.

And with flexibility, firms can take advantage of hoteling office space or arranging the area with shared space that only gets shared in emergencies. Firms can cut back on space while still keeping the office “full” with a significant chunk of employees on any given day. Davis Polk is doubling down and leasing another 30K sq. ft. as part of their mandates and, I dunno, I hope that makes whatever commercial real estate client they’re working with happy. But law firm space utilization overall sits just below 50%, rendering $74,475,561.6 in real estate per month unused according to Maptician respondents.

The market might be down right now, but it’s not going to be stuck in neutral forever. Attorneys are already circulating resumes. The other top-tier firms steering clear of the mandate approach are going to have ripe pickings from talent itching to bill 2800/year, merely asking that they bill Tuesdays from the home office. That’s a small concession to make to get ahead in a talent war.

# Biglaw Firm's Great New Benefit For New Parents: Bill Less
## This program helps new parents get acclimated to their new responsibilities.

Balancing being a new parent with the demands of a Biglaw job is challenging. Rather than just shrugging and telling parents to suck it up if they intend on having an elite legal career, more and more Biglaw firms are actually providing benefits designed to ease the delicate balancing act of parenthood. Duane Morris is the latest firm making concrete policy changes to help the attorneys at their firm.

The firm’s program allows primary caregivers to have 16 weeks paid leave with the option of an additional 4 weeks of vacation time and another month of unpaid leave if they choose. When they return, they can opt into a 30 percent reduced schedule for a month, tapering to a 20 percent reduction in the second month back and a 10 percent dip at month three before returning to full strength at month four. All without seeing a reduction in their base salary.

As [reported](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/01/10/duane-morris-trims-billing-requirements-for-new-parents/) by Law.com, Duane Morris vice chairman Tom Servodidio said the program is an effort to become a “family-friendly law firm” and help new parents transition into their roles:

“This is all designed … to help balance those demands of home and work in a way that hopefully gives you a better transition in and out of the birth or adoption of a child,” Servodidio said.

And Servodidio is very aware of the unique pressures law firms present for new parents:

“A client service industry has its own unique pressures because we want to be delivering the absolute highest quality service for our clients,” Servodidio said. “Trying to figure out ways in which we can try to ease that tension I think helps us to continue to meet our primary objective of excellent client service, but at the same time do it in a way that’s perhaps less anxiety-producing, and helps us to retain talent long term at the firm.”

Kudos to the firm for trying to create an environment where employees can  be parents and attorneys at the same time.

# Top NY Prosecutors Find Biglaw Homes

All things must come to an end, and when it comes to government service, that end usually involves a return to private practice.

And for the two recently departed top prosecutors in Manhattan, both have new Biglaw homes. Former SDNY U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss [will rejoin Fried Frank](https://www.friedfrank.com/index.cfm?pageID=81&itemID=13460), while former New York County DA Cy Vance will be [heading to Baker McKenzie](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/newsroom/2022/01/cyrus-r-vance-jr-joins-as-a-bm-partner).

Strauss returns to the White Collar group at Fried Frank that she ran from 1995 to 2012, this time as Senior Counsel. It marks a reunion with current group leader Geoffrey Berman, who served as U.S. Attorney before Strauss, and whom Strauss also served as Deputy. Strauss is a legend in the area, and whatever the scope of her new role, she’s a tremendous asset to Fried Frank’s group.

Vance joins Baker McKenzie as a partner and will serve as Global Chair of Baker McKenzie’s Cybersecurity Practice based on his prosecutorial success in cyber crime. The firm took the occasion of Vance joining up to highlight its tech-forward team, name-checking white collar investigations lawyer [Jessica Nall](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/newsroom/2020/06/jessica-nall), AI and trade secrets litigator [Bradford Newman](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/newsroom/2020/04/newman-joins-baker-mckenzie), and former UK Information Commissioner [Elizabeth Denham](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/newsroom/2021/12/elizabeth-denham-joins-bm) in the press release.

Congrats to all.

# Circuit Court Nominee Worked For Hate Group -- Good Thing We're Not Going To Have A Real Hearing On This One!

Even Allison Rushing’s classmate can’t believe this.

If you were expecting the Senate Judiciary Committee to take up a string of dull, well-vetted Biglaw partners when it announced that it would push forward with hearings on judicial nominees [despite the fact that the Senate itself is in recess](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/gop-advancing-judicial-nominations-while-senate-in-recess-because-why-not/), you haven’t been paying attention. No, holding unprecedented hearings despite releasing all the minority party’s Senators is when the GOP will ramrod through its most jaw-droppingly crazy nominees — right when Mazie Hirono is 5000 miles away.

As judicial nominations expert Professor Carl Tobias put it, “the whole notion of regular order has been completely destroyed.” Which is unfortunate because, as Tobias points out, these hearings make it appear as if the GOP is trying to covertly slide controversial nominees through. As it turns out, that’s not just the optics — Republicans are actually trying to slide controversial nominees through. It doesn’t seem as though they’d need to upset norms when they enjoy a Senate majority and no filibuster mechanism, but as they learned with the Ryan Bounds nomination, a healthy hearing process can still [derail a conservative judicial nominee](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/law-school-students-just-saw-a-radical-shift-in-the-pathway-to-success/). The solution, obviously, is to functionally eliminate the hearing process!

Today, with nary a Democrat in sight, the Judiciary Committee will be rushing to judgment quite literally, as the committee will take up the Fourth Circuit nomination of Allison Rushing, the stumbling toddler of a judicial nominee who [only graduated law school in 2007](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/trumps-latest-circuit-nominee-graduated-law-school-in-2007/) and hasn’t even been a lawyer long enough to meet the ABA’s already lax 12-year practice minimum for judicial nominees. When you consider that a quarter of her career was spent clerking, you’re faced with the reality that the committee is about to fast-track a woman into a circuit court seat who’s only really practiced for a handful of years. The ABA hasn’t even issued a rating on her yet, and the Judiciary Committee is pushing up her confirmation process in a naked attempt to get it all sewn up before the ABA releases what’s almost assuredly going to be yet another scathing “Not Qualified” rating for the gang of [nitwits](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/senate_confirms_appeals_nominee_grasz_who_was_rated_not_qualified_by_aba_co) and [bloggers](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/07/20/senate_confirms_john_k_bush_anti_gay_blogger_to_the_6th_circuit.html) that Trump’s being installing on the appellate bench. Hey, at least the blogger got a passing ABA rating — what used to be a floor is now high praise. UPDATE: The ABA has actually given her the “Qualified” rating! I guess the curve has been broken that badly.

Hell, she’s not even practiced in North Carolina or passed the North Carolina bar, despite being nominated for a North Carolina vacancy. [Len Leo](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/america-has-always-been-a-colorblind-society-says-dolt-who-unfortunately-picks-all-our-federal-judges/) just pulled the name of the youngest right-wing activist out a hat and told her that she should start shopping for a new house.

When she was nominated in August, we focused on this troubling lack of experience. Somehow this whole affair has somehow managed to get even worse since then.

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, headed by former DOJ Civil Rights Division boss Vanita Gupta, [drafted a letter opposing the nomination](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/10/circuit-court-nominee-worked-for-hate-group-good-thing-were-not-going-to-have-a-real-hearing-on-this-one/2/) revealing that Rushing used to work for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is, you know, [a defined hate group](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom). Super!

Rushing only worked with the ADF for a summer during law school, but that’s actually a significant part of her whole legal career at this point. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADF “is a legal advocacy and training group that has supported the recriminalization of homosexuality in the U.S. and criminalization abroad; has defended state-sanctioned sterilization of trans people abroad; has linked homosexuality to pedophilia and claims that a ‘homosexual agenda’ will destroy Christianity and society.” As Gupta’s letter points out, even if one is inclined to discount law school experiences, the fact that Rushing sought out this group to work for is “deeply disturbing” in itself. It’s not like it’s easy to pick up a gig with bigotry groups at a law school career fair. OK, I guess you can find jobs with the current DOJ at a career fair, but you get what I mean.

UPDATE: And Rushing’s connections with ADF actually go deeper than one summer. Her [financial disclosure form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B65r4lFs2Wa1RXBOc1RRTzBIQ0k1SGJreDNOTHdEUTFLMG40/view) reveals that she accepted a $1750 honorarium from ADF just last year.

These serious concerns over Rushing’s nomination underscore the importance of a thorough hearing. Instead, we got…



Yes, a whopping two Republican Senators lobbing softballs. Rushing’s hearing was over in less than an hour.

# Writing Yourself Checks From A Firm Account And Lying About Gambling Addiction Isn't Okay, Even For Biglaw Partners
## Now he's been suspended from practicing law.

Last month, former Biglaw partner Kym Cushing was suspended from the practice of law by the Supreme Court of Nevada for nine months. The court’s suspension comes after serious concerns about Cushing’s addiction issues and honesty.

According to [the court’s opinion](https://aboutblaw.com/OAF), Cushing, who worked at Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker from 2005 to 2018, wrote three checks to himself from the firm’s operating account. When confronted about the checks, Cushing first told the firm they were to reimburse expert witness outlays, naming a friend (and pro bono client) as the expert. However, Cushing later told the firm the checks were to cover gambling losses. As a result, the firm asked him to resign.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
After being forced out at Wilson Elser, he rebounded with a position at Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith. However, during the lateral move, Cushing failed to disclose why he left his old firm. This was rectified by Wilson Elser, who reportedly shared with Lewis Brisbois the circumstances surrounding Cushing’s departure. Cushing no longer works at Lewis Brisbois.

Cushing later rescinded his gambling losses explanation for his behavior, [saying in a demand letter](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/ex_partner_who_said_blamed_drunken_stupor_for_attempted_deposit_of_firm_fun) to the law firm seeking $5 million in compensation for alleged age and disability discrimination and retaliation that he claimed a gambling problem to save his job. He now claims he actually wrote the checks in a “drunken stupor.” Additionally, he claimed he turned to alcohol to deal with the stress of the “go-to attorney” for difficult cases.

In 2018, Cushing’s behavior was first brought to the Supreme Court of Nevada. Then Cushing agreed to treatment with the Nevada Lawyers Assistance Program to avoid suspension. Unfortunately, Cushing did not follow through with the program and lied about his reasons for doing so.

All of which brings us to the instant case. As [reported by Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ex-wilson-elser-partner-who-took-funds-from-firm-suspended), the court felt this history was enough to warrant the nine-month suspension:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

“Substantial evidence” supports the disciplinary panel’s findings that Cushing’s mental state was “intentional and that his misconduct harmed the public and the legal profession and potentially harmed his pro bono client,” the court said in determining the sanction. It conceded, however, that there were mitigating factors including his emotional problems and lack of prior discipline.

Cushing, who says he is “extremely disappointed” with the decision, can apply for reinstatement, provided he completes the Nevada Lawyers Assistance Program, an anger management program, and an additional 10 hours of CLE credits, five hours of which must be on the subject of substance abuse.

# Biglaw Firm Joins Hotline For Victims Of Campus Antisemitic Harassment
## Some firms have decided to take concrete action against antisemitism.

Last week, a number of Biglaw firms signed onto a letter lamenting the rise in antisemitic harassment on law school campuses and [committing to doing absolutely nothing about it](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firms-tell-law-schools-to-pls-hndle-thx-antisemitism/). But they did go out of their way to point fingers at law school deans to do something about it, preferring to leave the hard work of separating controversial but fair political commentary about Israel from antisemitism masquerading under the headlines to the administrations already struggling with exactly that task.

There were firms signing this letter that advertise about their work with states that don’t even recognize Israel’s right to exist. Some of these firms have offices in countries that deny Israel’s legitimacy. Which is probably why they prefer low commitment PR stunts to taking any action that might hit them in the pocketbook.

Bottom line: firms should commit to doing something tangible with the massive financial and in-kind resources they can bring to bear and dig into the sometimes messy details if they want to make a difference.

And [some law firms are doing just that](https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/leading-jewish-organizations-and-law-firms-launch-legal-protection-helpline).

Gibson Dunn has partnered with Hillel International, ADL, and the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law to announce the Campus Antisemitism Legal Line (CALL), offering folks on campus a free legal helpline.

Any student, family, faculty, or staff member can go to the CALL website or text “CALLhelp” to 51555 to report incidents of antisemitic discrimination, intimidation, harassment, vandalism, or violence that may necessitate legal action. Lawyers will assess reports of antisemitic discrimination and hate, conduct in-depth information-gathering interviews, and provide pro bono representation for victims who choose to move forward with specific cases. CALL will also provide referrals to social services, mental health counseling services, and other relevant support services in their area.

In addition to Gibson Dunn’s partnership, the helpline will draw upon pro bono resources from Morgan Lewis and other firms not specifically identified in the press release.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Antisemitism is not limited to campus, but students and schools both have limited resources to deliver justice. “Poor student” is a stereotype for a reason and schools meting out punishments face due process challenges and ultimately can’t deliver much more than kicking someone out of school. Lawyers can certainly assist students in dealing with the school’s internal system… but torts and criminal law can accomplish a lot more if available under the circumstances.

“Since the brutal terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, there has been an alarming rise in antisemitism and hate directed toward Jewish college students,” said Adam Lehman, Hillel International President and CEO. “Alongside building flourishing Jewish campus communities and educating university presidents and leadership, this is an important tool for reducing campus antisemitism. Every student deserves to pursue their studies and live their full college experience in a safe and secure campus environment — and Jewish students are no exception.”

In addition to providing legal services to victims of harassment, involving trained attorneys in the process of “conduct[ing] in-depth information-gathering interviews” to assess incidents has the knock-on effect of resolving the above-referenced “messy” borderline cases in a way that leaving it to hamstrung administrations can’t.

For example, multiple tipsters reached out asking us why we hadn’t covered a story summarized as “Harvard Law student caught on camera assaulting Jewish student.” The key outlet hyping that story was the Washington Free Beacon, which is something of a red flag for anyone with basic media savvy. So it wasn’t much of a shock when [more video of the incident came out](https://twitter.com/Esqueer_/status/1719937077779845619) showing the “victim” stepping over protesters before setting up the picture-perfect video clip. Not exactly a clean hands scenario.

Bad faith opportunists only exacerbate campus harassment. Their stunts artificially heighten fear among Jewish students — which then becomes a secondary vector for feeling vulnerable and insecure — and condition anti-war protesters to discount or even ignore the legitimate harassment and intimidation happening around them. Biglaw investigations can suss these cases out in a way that the “rule of social media” can’t.

Gibson Dunn, Morgan Lewis, and all the other Biglaw pro bono attorneys lending talent to this effort lend gravitas and muscle to this cause, providing guidance for students seeking redress for attacks through whatever forum necessary.

It’s an encouraging postscript to last week’s letter. Hopefully every signatory to that document will direct resources to this effort. We’ll see.

# Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses And A New Pay Scale (For Some)
## Plus bonus news!

Good news for Pepper Hamilton associates, well, at least those in the Philadelphia, Berwyn, Princeton, and Wilmington offices. The firm announced there was a new pay scale for associates in those offices, and while it doesn’t match the $190,000 scale set by [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) earlier this year, given the[ lower cost of living](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/heres-why-you-dont-deserve-the-same-raise-in-pictures/) in these markets, it still seems like a pretty nice payday.

So what can associates expect to make? The firm’s new scale (for the above-mentioned offices) is as follows:

Class of 2018 – $175
Class of 2017 – $185
Class of 2016 – $200
Class of 2015 – $225
Class of 2014 – $240
Class of 2013 – $255
Class of 2012+ – custom

Not a bad way to start the new year.

The firm also unrolled its bonus structure (for all offices). They include bonus numbers at the 2,040 and 2,140 billable hour threshold in addition to non-lockstep discretionary bonuses:

Bonus (2,040 hours / 2,140 hours)
2017/2016 – $10,000 / $15,000
2015/2014 – $12,500 / $17,500
2013/2012 – $15,000 / $20,000
2011/2010 – $17,500 / $22,500
Plus a discretionary bonus (minimum of 1,940 hours).

Please help us help you when it comes to raise and bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477).

You know what associates like? Money. You know what else they like? When the powers that be at a Biglaw firm actually notice and appreciate all of the hard work they’re putting in. That’s why we are seeing a new trend emerge in year end bonuses, where firms give extra money — on top of the market scale bonuses — for big billers.

Today Winston & Strawn announced year end bonuses matching the market scale set last month by Milbank, and detailed below. But what is extra exciting is that associates who “substantially exceed” the firm’s 2,000 hour productivity benchmark will get extra money in recognition of all the hours they logged this year.

The bonus scale at Winston is:

UPDATE: According to a tipster, the extra money usually shakes out like this:

extra bonuses for high billers are typically $5k for 2200 hours and another $2.5k for 2400.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

# In-House Perk: Community
## Why go through it alone when you can have a community?

From time to time, I will get asked about what I love about being in-house counsel or how it is different from private practice. One of those things that instantly rises to the top is the sense of community and camaraderie.

I was reminded of this sense of community just last week after some colleagues and I messaged back and forth about a couple of recent Supreme Court rulings that affect or have the potential to affect employment law, and thus … potentially all employers, like the companies for which we work. Besides the fun in geeking out, there was a true sense of connection from exchanging ideas and brainstorming solutions and sharing practical takeaways.

One reason for the sense of community that feels distinct from private practice may lie in the fact that as in-house counsel, we are no longer directly or indirectly “competing” for work. So instead of guarding strategies, we are open to sharing them.

Of course, I have no idea if this sense of community is something that all in-house counsel experience. In case you don’t have it yet and are seeking it, here are a few places to get you started.

- Association of Corporate Counsel (“ACC”)
Before you give me the side-eye for trying to market the ACC, I promise you that I am not getting any proceeds or perks. I was given the advice to join the ACC when I first came in-house, and it has helped me immensely. Yes, they have excellent substantive programming and professional development opportunities — but I especially love the networking opportunities that make it easy for anyone, especially a newbie, to join. Whether you get involved nationally or at the local level, the community feel is real.

- Bar Associations

Besides the ACC, I recently got involved in the Equal Employment Opportunity Committee of the Labor and Employment Section of the American Bar Association and the community was also so welcoming. When this introvert attended my first conference earlier this year, I felt like the leadership intentionally made me and other newbies feel welcome.

Another organization I have to mention is the National Employment Law Council. This community has been the most enriching to me personally and professionally.

Of course, these are a few groups that I’m a part of. Consider exploring what may work best for you because there are national, state, and local bar associations, as well as associations that are based on affinity and practice areas.

- Informal Networks
If bar associations and similar organizations are too “formal” for you, consider reaching out to your outside counsel and asking them to connect you to other in-house counsel or, better yet, plan an event just for clients (in-house counsel like you) to connect. I also love the power of LinkedIn and the in-house community there.

Ed. note: Indulge your inner nerd! Welcome to our daily legal trivia question. Enjoy!

Which Biglaw firm did Justice Scalia start at after graduating Harvard Law School?

Hint: This may be an easy question for those that have spent the last few days poring over obituaries of Antonin Scalia, but today’s question are about the late justice’s legal roots. He began working at a large firm, though Scalia wasn’t #Biglaw4Life. He even cautioned young associates against working too many hours.

# Greg Craig Wasn't Guilty. The American Lobbying Industry On The Other Hand....
## Why are anti-corruption laws something so easily sidestepped?

Greg Craig

Put aside that Greg Craig’s whole prosecution felt a bit off. The SDNY took a pass on the case before the DOJ picked it up — seemingly just to make sure someone attached to the Obama administration managed to get tagged in the Russian profiteering kerfuffle. Regardless, [Craig is a free man](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/04/greg-craig-found-not-guilty-in-ukraine-lobbying-case-1481017) after the jury took all of four hours to acquit him of lying to the government about whether or not he acted as a foreign agent of the government of Ukraine when he wrote a report at the behest of the country’s then-pro-Russian government whitewashing the arrest of opposition party leaders.

According to a couple of jurors, Craig’s vindication may have had more to do with technicalities.

Because of the statute of limitations applicable in the case, the judge told jurors that they could only find Craig guilty if prosecutors showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Craig concealed a material fact about his Ukraine work after Oct. 3, 2013. At least some jurors believed Craig had lied before that date, but they found a lack of proof he did so after that point, the two jurors said.

Skadden and Craig were trying not to become “foreign agents” of the Ukrainian government, something that would require them to register as such per America’s lobbying laws. Basic agency theory would say that someone hired to write a report for another country is, indeed, an agent of that country and writing a report for the purpose of convincing government officials not to sanction that country would seem like lobbying. But that’s not how America’s anti-corruption rules work because that would make far too much sense. For Craig, the firm could avoid registering if they never put forward the report themselves for public relations purposes. It’s not “lobbying” if you give the lobbying material to someone else… even if that person is then going to use your name and reputation as the selling point for the argument.

Craig gave his work product to a reporter, but claims — at least as of the relevant date — he only did so when affirmatively asked for it meaning he wasn’t promoting the work and therefore not a foreign agent lobbying the government. Weak tea to be sure, but good enough.

Craig’s story though is indicative of a much more pervasive problem. There are firms with departments explicitly described as “Lobbying” shops that get very snippy if you call the people at the top of their promotional materials “lobbyists.” One law firm representative once scolded me for calling an employee a lobbyist, explaining that I could describe their job as lobbying as long as I never used the word “lobbying.” Orwell imagined that doublespeak would conceal big lies — in reality it conceals billions of dollars of small lies.

Washington operates on posting firm rules regulating the seedy world of lobbying and then everyone just consents to this collective delusion that lobbying isn’t lobbying if we don’t call it that. It’s the only way a former official can really make a living! An academic once estimated that the lobbying industry is [at least double what we see based on official registrations](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2013/11/25/how-much-lobbying-is-there-in-washington-its-double-what-you-think/).

I don’t know if Greg Craig and Skadden were ever foreign agents for Ukraine. The jury only decided that Craig never did anything after October 3, 2013 to suggest that he was and that’s the only “crime” he could have arguably committed. But even if we don’t have a solution readily at hand for the broader problem of unregistered lobbying, can this country at least come to the conclusion that we can use the word “lobbying” to describe “former government officials doing stuff on behalf of others to persuade current officials”? Can we say “small-L lobbying” or something? The first step to fixing anything is agreeing on how to describe the problem.

(courtesy of AbbVie)

In our recent conversation about [Black History Month](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/celebrating-black-history-month-an-interview-with-monique-burt-williams/), my colleague Monique Burt Williams — CEO of Cadence Counsel, which focuses exclusively on the placement of in-house counsel — identified corporate legal departments that are leaders in advancing diversity. One company she highlighted was [AbbVie](https://www.abbvie.com/), the Chicago-based, Fortune 100 biopharmaceutical company behind blockbuster drugs like Humira and Imbruvica. Under the leadership and vision of chief legal officer Laura Schumacher — who has led its legal department since AbbVie became independent from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, and who previously was General Counsel at Abbott — AbbVie has tirelessly promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion, in the legal profession and beyond.

What are some of the innovations that AbbVie has pioneered? And what can in-house legal departments and law firms learn from AbbVie’s example? I recently interviewed [Joy Lyu Monahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joy-monahan-15743616/), Associate Director, Legal Diversity and Outside Counsel Programs, to learn some of the secrets of AbbVie’s success.

Monahan graduated from Georgetown University, from which she earned her bachelor’s degree and then a master’s degree in public policy, and a J.D. from Louisiana State University’s Paul M. Hebert Law Center. After clerking for state and federal judges in Louisiana, she worked in private practice in New Orleans, and then after Hurricane Katrina, she moved to Chicago and worked at Kirkland & Ellis and Edwards Wildman (now part of Locke Lord). She then moved in-house, serving as general counsel of World Business Chicago (WBC) before joining AbbVie in June 2020.

What drew her to the AbbVie opportunity? Monahan and I are both graduates of Jesuit educational institutions (Georgetown for her and Regis High School for me), and we bonded over this at the start of our interview. A key concept in the Jesuit tradition is service, being “men and women for others.” Monahan has spent much of her career in public service — at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Senate before law school, in her two clerkships right after law school, and during her time at WBC, a public-private nonprofit organization that drives inclusive economic growth — and she viewed the opportunity to promote diversity and inclusion at AbbVie as another opportunity to serve.

“I was looking not just for ‘a job,’ but a chance to do something deeply meaningful,” Monahan told me. “And I found it here at AbbVie. I work for a big company, doing meaningful things, and with both leadership and resources behind my work. We have significant legal spend here at AbbVie — and we can deploy it to advance diversity.”

Monahan knows firsthand the challenges of being a minority woman in a profession still dominated by white men. She was one of just a handful of Asian Americans in her law school class at LSU, as well as one of a small number of women of color at her two law firms. And during the course of her legal career prior to AbbVie, she encountered various forms of bias — often insidious bias — that she does not want future generations to face.

When it comes to diversity in the legal profession, the statistics are stark. As AbbVie CLO Laura Schumacher noted in a November 2020 article for [Law360](https://www.law360.com/tax-authority/articles/1323260/a-gc-s-blueprint-for-improving-legal-industry-diversity), only 5 percent of active lawyers in the U.S. are Black, 5 percent are Hispanic, and 3 percent are Asian — numbers well short of these groups’ representation in the overall population. Despite representing a majority of the U.S. population, women make up only 38 percent of the U.S. legal profession — and less than 23 percent of U.S.-based law firm partners. So despite the progress of recent years, the legal industry has a long way to go.

AbbVie is doing more than its share when it comes to addressing this problem. Monahan is responsible for facilitating eight workstreams with more than 50 legal colleagues focused exclusively on expanding the company’s already robust diversity initiatives. One of AbbVie’s long-standing programs is its Outside Counsel Diversity Initiative, a carefully designed, metrics-based program to accelerate diversity at the company’s outside counsel. Launched in 2018 with over 25 of AbbVie’s top-spend law firms, the Initiative began by assessing baseline metrics and creating individualized goals for each firm, in terms of the diversity of the lawyers working on AbbVie’s matters. By 2023, AbbVie’s aggregate goals for law firm representation on its matters are equal female and male partners, double the minority partners, and 50 percent underrepresented attorneys.

Given her longstanding commitment to diversity and the strong relationships she forged with managing partners and other law firm leaders during her time as GC of WBC, Monahan was the perfect person to drive the Initiative. And she’s optimistic about its power to bring about change.

“Like other large companies, we have significant legal spending power at AbbVie,” Monahan said. “These are relationships that are meaningful to law firms. And when it comes to diversity, what’s different about our program compared to many others is that we really mean it. We sit down with law firms on a regular basis, we review their numbers, and if their numbers aren’t where they should be, we tell them they need to improve — or they’ll lose our business.”

The program is already showing results. In 2020, compared to baseline hours in 2017, underrepresented lawyer hours are up by 12 percent, female partner hours are up by 18 percent, and minority partner hours are up by a whopping 46 percent.

“We have so many success stories with our outside counsel,” Monahan said. “Sitting in these annual review meetings and seeing these numbers going up, seeing how change happens — that’s one of the best parts of my job.”

Of course, in order for law firms to be able to meet diversity goals like those of AbbVie, they need strong representation of women and minority lawyers, at both the associate and partner levels. This requires addressing the so-called “pipeline problem,” making sure that there’s a steady pipeline of diverse talent going into firms in the first place. This is an issue that AbbVie also appreciates — and addresses.

Monahan spoke proudly about AbbVie’s IP Group Intern Academy, a first-year law school internship program for students with an interest in diversity and intellectual property — an area of law that’s important to AbbVie as a pharma company, and one that historically has trailed other practice areas in diversity. The interns, who are often diverse law students with science backgrounds, work for AbbVie after their 1L summers, gaining valuable experience in IP law — and then AbbVie helps them find jobs with leading law firms for their 2L summers. The program has an excellent track record so far, with 100 percent of diverse interns from the program receiving offers for summer or full-time employment with top firms.

“Many of the interns come from law schools where it’s difficult to land a job with a major law firm,” Monahan explained (and noted that it’s a situation she can relate to, since not many LSU grads go straight to firms like Kirkland). “We pick people who normally wouldn’t have a chance, and we give them a chance. After working for a summer for us, they are ‘AbbVie-endorsed,’ which helps them get hired by top firms as 2Ls. And the firms love our interns — they come back to us and say, ‘She’s amazing, and can we get all of your other interns?’”

“We are now in our third year of the program, and our interns continue to get offers from great firms, all because they got a chance. That’s what the program is about: picking people who wouldn’t normally have a chance, and giving them a chance.”

AbbVie focuses on diversity in its own internal hiring as well. Women make up more than two-thirds of the company’s global legal department, and underrepresented minorities make up almost a third. Under Monahan’s leadership, the company has built strong relationships with a wide range of minority bar associations, whom it turns to when it has job openings to fill. In addition, AbbVie works with outside recruiting firms that prioritize diversity — such as [Cadence Counsel](https://cadencecounsel.com/), led by [Monique Burt Williams](https://laterallink.com/team/monique-burt-williams/), one of the few Black women CEOs in the recruiting industry.

Not surprisingly, AbbVie and its legal team have won numerous awards for their commitment to diversity and inclusion. In 2020, the Coalition on Women’s Initiatives in Law gave AbbVie its Benchmark Award, which goes to a law firm or corporate legal department that has demonstrated passion and commitment to leading the advancement of women’s issues. In 2019, Chambers and Partners recognized Laura Schumacher for her outstanding contributions to furthering diversity in the legal profession. AbbVie has also been recognized as a top employer or workplace for diversity by such authorities as Fortune, Forbes, Working Mother, DiversityInc., and the Human Rights Campaign.

The honors and awards are nice — but to Joy Lyu Monahan, what’s most meaningful about her work is the ability to bring about meaningful change. And if recognition and positive publicity can help AbbVie’s approach spread throughout the legal industry, that’s all to the good.

“We want to be a leader and to set an example,” she said. “This is why we want to get the word out. We want to propagate our model. We want other companies to say, ‘We want to do what AbbVie is doing.’”

“When filling my role, AbbVie chose me — but I also chose AbbVie, for its longstanding, outstanding commitment to diversity. I work with an amazing team of leaders and colleagues who share these values, and could not have made this progress without them. I’m so excited to be at a place where I can make real change in the legal profession.”

# Shedding The Workaholic Badge In-House
## There's a big difference between private practice and in-house life in terms of work-life balance.

Confession time:

- I didn’t take a bar trip — and started working the Monday after taking the Texas bar exam.
- While in Biglaw, I worked during holidays (a few hours here and there), even on Christmas.
- I only took a week off for my wedding and honeymoon combined (and worked some of the time). It was the longest vacation I had had in private practice.
- While in Biglaw, I worked a little during my maternity leave.
- The worst and most regrettable? I missed my grandmother’s funeral services and only made her burial because of trial.
While I’d normally say, “don’t judge,” you absolutely should.

I do.

Looking back, I wonder what was wrong with me. And I can’t place the blame on Biglaw or the “system” alone. Much of the responsibility is mine. For example, I didn’t dare tell the partner that I had my grandmother’s funeral because I didn’t want to lose the rare opportunity to argue in trial. That poor decision was all on me.

With that backdrop, my reason for sharing such shameful confessions is to punctuate a big difference between private practice and in-house life — at least from my personal experience.

When I was in private practice, my entire identity and self-worth was wrapped around how many hours I billed; how available and responsive I was to my clients, whether internal or external, whether actual or prospective; and how much I martyred my life to be a good firm citizen.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But when I moved in-house, the culture was refreshingly (and shockingly) different. While the workday can be long, there is an expectation that it stops, and the rest can be picked up tomorrow. Instead of weekend work being the norm, it became the exception. My clients respect that I am on vacation, seldom bothering me unless truly urgent — and I also have peace of mind knowing that my in-house colleagues have it covered and that the company business continues, even if I am not available.

In contrast to my prior fear that partners wondered why I wasn’t in the office and questioned my commitment to the firm, my general counsel openly talks about about preventing burnout, the importance of mental health, and she encourages us to use our vacation. My associate general counsel does the same, and takes the time to ask me about my workload when she sees more after-hours emails than usual and often emphasizes how irreplaceable this time with my kids is and how sleep is critical to health.

Part of why I love being in-house so much is that it gave me the space to be a whole person (and not just a lawyer) — and while I suspect that experiences may differ depending upon what company you work for, I would be remiss if I didn’t share this perspective in case a transformational opportunity similarly opens up for my firm friends.

When I decided to leave my Biglaw firm, I left practicing law because I felt like my soul was dying.

— Democratic presidential candidate Senator [Kirsten Gillibrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Gillibrand), opening up about how unhappy she was as an attorney, during [her CNN town hall](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-town-hall-takeaways/index.html) last night. Gillibrand, an alumnus of Davis Polk, used to defend Big Tobacco during her time at the firm, and said, “I really felt like I wasn’t doing the thing I was supposed to be built to do. I felt like god put be on this planet to help people, and I didn’t feel like I was making a difference.” She later worked as a partner at Boies Schiller before going into politics.

# Biglaw Firms Stood On Principle Against The Capitol Riot... They Were Totally Lying!
## In case you were wondering how much a Biglaw lawyer's promise is worth.

In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol Riot — and its lower key, but just as disturbing parliamentary corollary — major law firms fell all over themselves to pledge an end to supporting candidates with a demonstrated willingness to thwart democracy. Lawyers, in their own minds anyway, serve as the vanguards of the rule of law, so Biglaw spent early January bragging about putting their money where their well-compensated mouths were.

Some firms, like Holland & Knight, cut off funding and promised to stop supporting the “Sedition Caucus” — the 147 Republican legislators who voted against recognizing the results of the election. Others, like Akin Gump, said it, “will certainly consider the riotous events in Washington, D.C., and the false rhetoric questioning the legitimacy of the recent elections as part of a broad array of factors when determining our PAC giving priorities.”

To offer an edit to Akin Gump’s statement, the word “consider” needed to be followed by “and then ignore.” It turns out that firms making principled stands in January spent the rest of the year signing checks to the same people who voted to legitimize a coup.

Rolling Stone, Protect Democracy, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) [conducted a review of firm donations](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jan6-law-firms-insurrection-campaign-finance-1268962/) as we roll into the end of the year. Major law firms have contributed $190,500 to the campaigns and leadership PACs of the Sedition Caucus, and $294,000 to two GOP committees providing indirect aid according to the research. This includes both firms that made direct promises and those who tried to finesse their way around it.

The biggest law-firm donor to Republicans voted against Biden’s certification and to GOP party committees appears to be Holland and Knight, a firm with 1,600 employees across 40 countries. In response to the Jan. 6 insurrection and the attempt to overturn Biden’s election victory, the firm said it was freezing all federal donations. Federal campaign records show the firm has given $30,000 to the two leading Republican party committees, which offer an indirect avenue to support those same officeholders who opposed Biden’s certification. The firm has also directly donated $16,500 to multiple members who voted against certifying Biden’s election. (The firm did not respond to a request for comment.)

The article namechecks a number of other firms for making donations after claiming they wouldn’t. Holland & Knight and Baker Hostetler both made pledges to cut off donations, and yet those two firms provided the most money to the individual campaigns and PACs of the Sedition Caucus. One of the most puzzling direct donations came from Covington & Burling’s PAC, which gave $1,500 to Rep. Lloyd Smucker’s campaign while simultaneously collecting $2.4 million or so from the Biden campaign.

Those who donate to Republican committees as an indirect workaround have at least lived up to the very technical promise not to give to the specific GOP legislators who flogged a coup, though a better response would be to just give directly to Liz Cheney. But they won’t do that because Liz Cheney is an empty husk of an influencer right now.

The whole point of donating is to buy yourself a congressperson that can do whatever your clients want. In fact, in some of these cases, the law firm may be a passthrough — earning access to legislators for clients who stood by their own (higher visibility!) pledges not to give to these people. If the mob has more sway than Liz Cheney, then those “vanguards of the rule of law” will be first in line to shower money on the mob.

This is where we would squeeze in a flowery yet dire warning about the danger a society faces when even its lawyers opt for a “government of wingnuts, not of laws,” but cynicism overtakes us. Will clients stand up to this? Will associates? For that matter, will partners stand up to this?

The lesson of the past year, according to this research, is probably not.

# No, Your Office Doesn't Deserve The 'NY To 180' Raise
## Don't whine about NY lawyers making more.

As “NY to 180” has rapidly morphed into “Everyone to 180” — announced raises hitting D.C., Chicago, Houston, even Wilmington — more and more tipsters are up in arms that a few firms are skimping on their non-New York offices. The biggest uproar arose when Covington & Burling preemptively — and bizarrely — told its D.C. associates that even though it hadn’t yet decided whether or not to raise New York salaries, it was pretty sure the D.C. office [wasn’t going to see any bump](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/biglaw-salary-hike-not-all-offices-are-created-equal/). As trial balloons go, that was as popular as the Hindenburg.



This memo hit the eyeballs of young associates as anathema in a world where firms are inexplicably paying associates [New York money to practice in Richmond, Virginia](http://www.law360.com/articles/793622/hunton-williams-1st-years-see-pay-hike-to-160k). But to those taking the long view of the industry, Covington’s statement reflects historical trends.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So, I’ll be the jerk who says it: you don’t deserve New York salaries. Let’s be clear, I’m not saying hardworking associates in these offices don’t deserve raises. I’ll always balk at anyone using New York’s salary scale as a cudgel to depress salaries in other markets. I’m just saying there’s no logical reason for this fad of equalizing salaries across all U.S. offices. That’s some half-baked Thomas Friedman “The World Is Flat” s**t.

Salaries in non-New York markets should be raised… and then New York should get even bigger raises. And no one should feel slighted by that.

1. New York Really Is That Much More Expensive

Our friends from Lateral Link noted this [in a column last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/is-ny-to-180k-hurting-the-new-york-market/) about the impact fully equalized wages might have on the New York lateral market. The chart they provide showing the salary required in each market to match the NYC buying power of just $160K is damning. D.C. lawyers want a raise? It took a mere $103,290 for D.C. lawyers to match the $160K a New York lawyer got. To match a New York salary of $180K, D.C. lawyers only need [a shade over $116K](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/moving-cost-of-living-calculator.aspx), meaning they were already paid more than “NY to 180.” Houston is making some big moves — but they matched the buying power of $160K when they got to $69,095.

Obviously, young lawyers can plead that student debt knows no housing market, and that’s certainly why no one is advocating hard-capping associate salary based on New York buying power. But don’t overlook the fact that it’s a lot easier to get a Biglaw job in some of these markets with degrees from cheaper programs because there are respected public law schools in the area. You can take your in-state degree from LSU and secure a Biglaw gig in Houston. You can’t so much take a Penn State-Dickinson law degree and settle into a desk at, say, Milbank.

And, hey, some may argue that this has the upside of encouraging some students to take that scholarship and go to the less prestigious school and come out with less debt. I mean, if you’re going to get $180K wherever you go, why push yourself to gun for that federal clerkship after your tenure as editor of the T14 law review? But maybe the problem of out-of-control law school tuition shouldn’t be handled by sucking talent out of the top.

At the absolute least, firms should be announcing a modifying formula to adjust their new salaries to reflect partial cost of living.

2. New York Works Harder

No disrespect to the work ethic of non-New York lawyers, but, on average, the New York market is working almost criminally longer hours. Firms are dodgy about opening the kimono on billable hours, and that results in long-outdated, barely scientific charts like [this one](http://www.nalp.org/2006maybillablehours) that suggests D.C. associates are billing on par with New York lawyers, and that Chicago and Houston lawyers are working even harder. Balderdash. There are a lot of reasons those New York firms are by and large making so much more money. To some extent, the matters that end up in New York offices tend to be more complex and profitable matters owing to long-standing faith in the quality of New York lawyers and the concentrated hub of experienced partners in NY Biglaw offices. They’re also offices that are heavily leveraged and billing the hell out of those associates. (And even this bad chart reports that NY has more firms averaging 1950 hours than other markets and dollars to donuts those that aren’t hitting that “most reported” number are clocking higher, rather than lower, averages.)

If you’re a young lawyer in some non-NYC market, you may be billing like crazy and think that 2100 hours last year puts you on par with New York lawyers. And it might. But the salary bump is a decision made on balance. On balance, the New York market is billing more — it’s not uncommon to have associates start their annual billables number with a “3” — and moreover, the firms in NY hire people with the expectation that they will all bill these numbers as a rule rather than an exception because there simply are more billable hours to go around. If you’re a go-getter working at a blistering pace in Wilmington, then you may deserve a bonus, and you’ll probably secure that brass ring of partnership, but salary equalization with the most grueling legal market in the country is not where you should seek your remedy.

3. New York Lawyers Are Just Tougher

Need we remind everyone [of Buskergate](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/05/why-are-d-c-lawyers-such-frigging-babies/)? Get some gumption before asking to be paid what the grownups are making.

Again, I’m all for lifting associate salaries no matter where you live. And I love firm socialism (e.g., lockstep partner compensation for encouraging collaboration and cutting back on inefficient infighting). But paying New York lawyers nominally more than those beyond the Isle of Manhattan is a matter of basic fairness.

# Jones Day Finally Raises; Help Us Open Up Its 'Black Box' Of Compensation

We’ve been on the case of [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jones-day/) for quite some time now (about associate compensation; their [controversial](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/will-jones-day-drop-donald-trump-as-a-client/) representation [of Donald Trump](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/) is [pretty accepted at the firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/jones-day-doubles-down-on-donald-trump/) now, and so is its [lack of a sense of humor](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/jones-day-does-not-have-a-sense-of-humor/)).

We highlighted [complaints from JD associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/lets-hear-from-the-furious-associates-at-firms-that-havent-matched/) about the firm’s failure to raise salaries post-Cravath.

Heck, we even made JD’s failure to raise a [Trivia Question of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-biglaw-giant-that-has-not-yet-raised-associate-compensation/), noting that Jones Day was the only Vault 30 firm that [hadn’t joined the MoneyLaw club](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-biglaw-giant-that-has-not-yet-raised-associate-compensation/).

So let’s start by giving credit where credit is due: today Jones Day issued its annual compensation letters to associates, and at least for first-year associates in New York and Chicago, these letters seem to reflect a raise to $180,000. If you’re a first-year in another JD office and got bumped up to $180K, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jones%20Day) or text us (646-820-8477), and we’ll update this post to note that fact.

UPDATE (6/25/2016, 3:51 p.m.): See the long update at the very end of this post regarding the new first-year salaries at Jones Day offices around the country.

What about associates beyond the first year? This requires an explanation of Jones Day’s complicated compensation system.

After their first year, Jones Day associates receive individualized compensation. That compensation does not follow any sort of lockstep scale. As we’ve mentioned before, the JD compensation system is a [“closed comp”](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/) or [“black box”](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/inside-straight-analyzing-black-box-compensation/) system, meaning that nobody knows what anyone else makes (at both the associate and partner level).

Talking about your comp with colleagues is a violation of firm policy (again, both for partners and associates). Jones Day cites this salary secrecy [as a virtue](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/), saying that it promotes collegiality and teamwork by eliminating complaints over pay so lawyers can focus on their work and client service.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here’s how the Jones Day pay system works for associates in practice. The firm doesn’t pay year-end or midyear bonuses; you get just your base salary. Each June, you’re notified of what your base salary will be for the coming year (a base salary that should be above market to reflect the lack of bonuses). That salary goes into effect on July 1 and remains in effect through the following June, when you get your next pay raise letter, starting the cycle anew.

Today happens to be the day of the JD annual memos (form of memo posted on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/jones-day-finally-raises-help-us-open-up-its-black-box-of-compensation/2/)). According to one source:

I think you guys should seriously consider writing an article explaining to potential hires (1) how the comp system even works here (it seems almost designed to make it hard to compare your comp to market, because they do raises mid-year, and allegedly fold bonus into salary), and (2) explain that you might end up making slightly above base, but your salary — even with great reviews and 2200-2400 hours — will never be the equivalent of market base plus bonus.

A good explanation from another tipster:

The rough outline of Jones Day’s black-box compensation is an under-reported story. This Friday is when JD tells its associates their all-in comp for the next year.

Jones Day does not offer bonuses. They put it differently, of course. They say that they roll bonuses into salary and thus offer above-market salaries to offset not offering bonuses, much like [Williams & Connolly](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-who-pays-a-starting-salary-of-200000-williams-connolly/) — just on an individualized rather than lock-step scale. But the reality is that JD shortchanges associates in a few ways.

First–and ignoring the new Cravath scale for a minute–JD starts off its associates at the same salary they would get at the lockstep firms. The individualization doesn’t happen until the end of an attorney’s first year at the firm. Thus, in effect, JD spreads the first-year bonus over the second year, spreads the second-year bonus over the third year, etc. That is a substantial disadvantage, even if the bonuses were market size.

Second, the total comp tends to be substantially lower than the market salary plus bonus. I’ve heard from people who mostly like the firm but find it frustrating that peers at other firms consistently make tens of thousands more. The “above-market” salary at JD is only nominally above the Cravath salaries, and therefore way under the Cravath salaries plus bonuses.

The party line is that some people make above market in total comp and some people make below but that it roughly comes out to the same and how great is is that we have such a great culture by not talking about it. That JD puts so much emphasis on confidentiality ensures that no clear picture emerges. That JD makes individualized determinations ensures that the few data points that might emerge can be dismissed as unrepresentative.

I heard from a junior associate that salary variations–among the few peers who subversively compared notes–were very minor. He assumes the range widens in later class years.

There are a lot of great reasons to go to Jones Day. But people who choose Jones Day should understand the trade offs they are making.

That’s how the Jones Day system works overall. What are we hearing more specifically? We have no general memo — remember, everything at JD is individualized — so all we can do is pass along individual data points from various sources. Note that in a few cases we have made salaries or hours billed more vague, as indicated by brackets, to protect the anonymity of our tipsters.

I’m an associate in a major, non-NYC office…. [People] expect the bare minimum so that firm can say they matched, without truly bringing our comp up to market. It used to be true that total comp was on par with peers, and bonuses were baked in. Not so much anymore. From what I gather, this is an office by office issue, and our office culture and morale are struggling. Associates are frustrated and unhappy, more so than at other offices, and most folks blame the Partner in Charge…. Our summer recruiting is struggling, and we’re landing fewer kids from top schools. Lateral positions are going unfilled. More than this, what is killing people is the fact that our PIC seems completely unaware and uncaring. I expect things to continue this way for the foreseeable future. Everyone I know is looking to leave and I highly doubt that the management will see this as an opportunity to change course, more like a necessary cost they’d prefer to avoid.

Jones Day associates in Chicago got our pay bump letters today. The firm seems to think we can’t do math. We’ll know more later tonight when associates get together for “happy hour,” but right now it seems like (accounting for the fact that our regular raise kicks in in July vs. most other firms kicking in in December) of the handful of junior associates I’ve spoken with (who all got great reviews and are on track to bill at least 2K+), most are getting paid at Cravath scale for base, with no bonus. People are not happy, especially given an associate meeting in May where we were told Chicago office made killer revenue last year. Also, many of us are filling significant midlevel gaps, and taking on a lot of midlevel responsibilities (and have been billed as such) – would expect compensation to reflect that. This will hurt both lateral and entry level recruiting, which will only incentivize already overworked juniors to leave.

In Chicago we bumped, but not all the way to scale. Given the way we do things, it’s always a bit wonky. but here’s the gist from what I know:

Class of 2015: bumped to $180k uniformly, they may or may not bump to $190k in January.
Class of 2014: [most associates bumped to] $200k.
[At least one senior associate bumped to Cravath scale.]

Historically, associates at JD spend the first half of the year on the scale for their year, and the second half of the year at the next level.

I’m a third-year in Chicago, my class is all pretty underwhelmed. Bump before market changes would’ve been to $185k, got bumped to $200k. Stellar reviews and on pace for [more than 2300 hours]. They bumped first years to $180k, seems like everyone else is now officially below market — and if you factor in bonuses, the gap is huge.

[Midlevel to senior associates in Chicago] were notified regarding changes to the compensation structure today, and the 2009-2011 class years are now in excess of $50k in total compensation below the “new” market level. Bit of a torches and pitchforks sort of atmosphere….

D.C. office. Billed [more than 2300 hours] last year, with great reviews. My total comp for 2016 (six months at last year’s salary, six months at today’s new salary) will be [more than $40,000] below the total base and bonus (based on last year’s rate) if I worked somewhere else. There were major salary complaints already in a number of major cities last year about salary being below market rate (base + bonus), and the NY180 scale has just made it worse for everyone I’ve talked to in three different offices.

Jones Day D.C. comp usually comes out substantially below market, but recruits just don’t realize that going in. Performing the great service of correcting this type of information disparity is ATL’s bread and butter.

I work in a Texas office. Hearing mixed things. I am a midlevel and they matched to what the base salary would be for me the following year (because we don’t get bonuses). That still makes a lot of us come up short on total pay when you factor in bonuses. Unclear if they matched for everyone; some associates are probably making more than the grid.

So that’s a round-up of reactions. As you can see, it’s all quite individualized, but a general theme of discontent emerges.

In fairness to Jones Day, we should note that most of the complaints focus on pay. JD associates often have nice things to say about their firm culture, colleagues, and cases. And the firm is still very prestigious — [#18](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/jones-day/company-overview.aspx) in the [2017 Vault rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/), actually up a spot from the [2016 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-biglaw-giant-that-has-not-yet-raised-associate-compensation/2/?rf=1) — so exit opportunities are excellent.

On the subject of compensation, one Jones Day source asked us here at Above the Law to dig deeper:

No one anywhere (that I’m aware of) has tried to piece together what their compensation scale actually looks like. Although ATL is in the best position to do that, JD’s internal emphasis on not discussing comp (which you have previously reported on) has always made that difficult.

The confluence of #NYto180, JD’s glaring silence [until today], mounting frustration from associates, and the timing of the comp letters coming out this Friday, offers (I believe) your best opportunity to finally break into that black box and piece together a rough idea of the scale.

Point taken. Here at Above the Law, we will attempt to open up the “black box” of Jones Day compensation. If you work at JD, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Jones%20Day) (subject line: “Jones Day”) or text us (646-820-8477) with any and all information you have about your compensation or comp for other associates you know. You can provide a range for pay if you prefer doing that to giving an exact number, and you can give historical data (i.e., comp figures from prior years) if more comfortable doing so.

If we get enough information, we’ll attempt to do a follow-up post, perhaps including some sort of table shedding light on compensation at different JD offices. But whether this story or chart materializes, of course, depends on what we receive. If we don’t get enough tips, we won’t be able to do anything.

Thanks for any information you can share. You’re doing a service to your current and future colleagues at Jones Day.

UPDATE (6/25/2016, 3:51 p.m.): If you poke around the Jones Day website, you can see the new starting salary for each office (here, for example, is [Boston](http://www.jonesdaycareers.com/offices/office_detail.aspx?office=38&subsection=1)). A tipster went through all the JD offices and helpfully compiled this list of which offices are at which starting salary levels:

Atlanta – 180K
Boston – 180K
Cleveland – 160K
Chicago – 180K
Columbus – 160K
Dallas – 180K
Detroit – 160K
Houston – 180K
Irvine – 180K
Los Angeles – 180K
Miami – 160K
Minneapolis – 160K
New York – 180K
Pittsburgh – 160K
San Diego – 180K
San Francisco – 180K
Silicon Valley – 180K
Washington – 180K

Said this source, “The summer classes were not informed of any raises that occurred yesterday — but they happened. People noticed on Jones Day’s website they had changed first-year compensation for next year for each office, and that is how we all found out. By not telling their current summers I think it is obvious they do not intend to raise summer associates’ salaries. That part isn’t really that important; I’m just baffled they did not say a word to us that salaries had gone up.”

[Could artificial intelligence successfully argue a Supreme Court case?](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/1-million-on-the-table-to-let-ai-lawyer-bot-argue-supreme-court-case/) Most folks say no, but if you let it argue that states can stone women to death for having a miscarriage, it could snag at least 5 votes.

Can an AI handle civil suits without human oversight? Also probably not and… [it may not even be trying to](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/24/the-worlds-first-robot-lawyer-isnt-a-lawyer-and-im-not-sure-its-even-a-robot/).

But could a bot argue a traffic court case?

Probably, yeah.

DoNotPay has helped folks fight traffic tickets for years now. It’s a body of law that’s relatively straightforward and the company has a solid track record of helping people navigate it. The modest stakes involved in traffic citations make shelling out for an attorney more trouble than it’s worth. So people show up pro se and get steamrolled. DoNotPay’s algorithm has helped a lot of folks dispense with their tickets without having to go to court by pointing them to defenses they otherwise would never know they had.

DoNotPay literally [has awards for its access to justice contributions](https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2020/01/donotpay-honored-with-aba-brown-award-for-access-to-justice-effo/).

Whether or not DoNotPay was ready to handle more complex legal fights — and founder Josh Browder seems to have [come to the conclusion it was not](https://www.fastcompany.com/90840073/why-legal-services-chatbot-donotpay-is-abandoning-its-idea-of-putting-a-robot-in-court?partner=rss&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&utm_content=rss) — it seems to have traffic court pretty well handled. So when the company announced that the system would tackle a traffic court appearance next month, it seemed like a natural progression.

It turns out the company had not raised the prospect of a robot lawyer with the judge involved and had planned to surreptitiously run the hearing by communicating instructions to a human (possibly an attorney but almost certainly a pro se defendant).

Judges don’t like that. Transparency is good.

Beyond the problematic opacity, attorneys also lobbed threats about “unlicensed practice of law” charges. Now Browder has pulled the plug.

Good morning! Bad news: after receiving threats from State Bar prosecutors, it seems likely they will put me in jail for 6 months if I follow through with bringing a robot lawyer into a physical courtroom. DoNotPay is postponing our court case and sticking to consumer rights:

— Joshua Browder (@jbrowder1) [January 25, 2023](https://twitter.com/jbrowder1/status/1618265395986857984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Lawyers have taken to social media to dance on the robot’s grave, but I’m left wondering if any of these people have actually been to traffic court. I have once. I knew it would be a losing proposition, but I felt ethically compelled to put on the record that the cop was lying to the court if only to sow the slimmest possibility that the judge might doubt the particular officer if the guy pulled the same stunt on some future driver. Anyway, over the course of an hour, I saw probably 30 tickets handled. Maybe five involved an attorney, and the attorneys all asked some combination of the same three pro forma questions of whichever cop was up there and then the judge imposed the fine as issued the exact same way he did with the 25 poor schlubs without attorneys. Because, like the Supreme Court these days, the outcomes were never really in doubt.

Not only could a robot handle the defense… a robot could have replaced every participant in the farce.

Would the sanctity of the legal system really crumble if a pro se defendant used a tool to prompt them to ask those pro forma questions? More to the point, if the system gave the defendant those questions BEFORE the hearing would it be substantively different?

Putting aside DoNotPay’s traffic court misadventure, algorithms already run litigation indirectly all up and down the courts. Variations of AI funnel attorney research to the cases the algorithm decides you need. We have systems that advise attorneys on [the precise language a judge is likely to use](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2018/12/getting-inside-a-judges-head/)! We’re already talking about [Biglaw applications of ChatGPT](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/chatgpt-are-the-robots-finally-here/) to create first drafts of filings.  Lawyers exercise professional judgment, of course, but at what point is that judgment constrained by the inputs spit out by the algorithms?

There were plenty of issues with the way DoNotPay handled this affair. I’m certainly not defending the idea of trying to pull a fast one on a judge and if you have problems with a state’s unlicensed practice of law rules, go ahead and lobby to change them — or at least get clarity — before proposing to push ahead. But the way lawyers have talked about this situation concerns me. Because AI-driven legal aides are out there and they’re going to keep getting more sophisticated. Delivering sound legal assistance is also going to get cheaper. But a lot of the lawyerly pushback here skirted real concerns about DoNotPay’s proposed execution and dumped on the idea that a defendant might use an automated aide at all. The discourse read a lot as though lawyers only want technology that keeps them properly installed as the sole gatekeepers of justice.

Even in cases they would never deign to take on.

In an ideal world, everyone who finds themselves [before the law](https://www.kafka-online.info/before-the-law.html) would have access to an attorney. But since we seem committed to a legal services model that makes that a fantasy, we need to have serious discussions about what tools we let people use to pursue their own rights.

# Giving Up Biglaw Partnership To Represent Donald Trump Looks Like A Worse Decision Every Day
## But could it get worse? Absolutely!

Biglaw partnership is seen as a pinnacle of the legal profession, the brass ring that so many strive for. So, people generally don’t give that up — unless they’re about to be called “Your Honor.” But that’s exactly what former Foley & Lardner partner [Christopher Kise did](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/trump-hires-former-fl-solicitor-general-to-explain-why-keeping-classified-docs-in-the-pool-shed-is-very-cool-very-legal/) when he left the firm to go work for Donald Trump in his battle with the federal government over the Mar-a-Lago raid. The move has left folks[ wondering](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/newest-trump-lawyer-sees-risky-side-of-working-for-ex-president) whether this was a smart play.

There’re lots of reasons this representation could go awry, but chief among them is Trump’s penchant to just… not pay his attorneys. But in this Kise was clever, securing a $3 million payment ahead of time, [courtesy of Trump’s Save America PAC.](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/15/trumps-save-america-paid-3-million-to-cover-top-lawyers-legal-work-00056968)

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Despite getting paid, reports [emerged earlier this week](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/politics/chris-kise-trump-mar-a-lago/index.html) that Kise was “sidelined” in the Mar-a-Lago investigation. Though a spokesperson said Kise remains an “important member of President Trump’s legal team,” it’s not a great look. No one wants to have to defend their role on a team less than a month after signing on. Hell, NFL fans gave Ryan Leaf more of a grace period.

There was the… I don’t know what to call it… gaff? Misunderstanding of the Espionage Act?

Though maybe Kise shouldn’t feel too bad about that one — it’s only one of several instances [detailed by Just Security](https://www.justsecurity.org/83034/tracker-evidence-of-trumps-knowledge-and-involvement-in-retaining-mar-a-lago-documents/) of Team Trump admitting to the “former President Donald Trump’s knowledge and involvement in retaining government records.” Of course, Kise *is* an attorney and should have a much more keen grasp on the potential repercussions for his client based on what he admits in court.

Biglaw firms have seem to have a bit problem when it comes to recruiting women and people of color, and an even bigger problem when it comes to keeping them at the firm once they’re associates. The National Association of Law Placement’s latest [diversity survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/numbers-are-up-for-women-in-biglaw-but-certain-minorities-continue-to-fall-behind/) showed just how big of a problem this was, to the point of embarrassment where we’re yet again forced to celebrate fractional progress for diversity and inclusion within large law firms.

So, what’s being done to resolve the legal profession’s difficult diversity dilemma?

Two firms have been inspired to try their hardest to create meaningful and lasting connections with women and minorities to make them feel welcome within their hallowed halls from the day they first set foot inside their law schools. Karen Sloan of [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/01/23/skadden-proskauer-get-creative-to-recruit-women-and-minority-law-students/) has more information on the programs that Skadden and Proskauer are offering for first-year law students:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Proskauer’s new boot camp for women aims to help them develop the skills they need to succeed in law school before they ever set foot on campus, [Joanne Ollman, chief professional resources officer at the firm] said. The firm plans to bring 30 women who have committed to attending law school in the fall to New York for a week—the firm will put them up in a nearby hotel, pay for meals, and give them a $1,000 stipend—while partners and new associates who are fresh out of law school will cover how to approach their upcoming studies. …

Skadden is taking a different tack by bolstering its already successful 1L Scholars Program in hopes of bringing more participants back as summer associates. The 1L Scholars Program is an 11-week paid summer internship for diverse students who have just completed their first year of law school. About 25 participants spend seven weeks at the firm and another four weeks with a client. It debuted in 2012 and has proven to be popular. Skadden received about 950 applications last year, according to director of talent acquisition Carol Sprague, and participants are chosen through several rounds of interviews.

Each of Proskauer’s boot camp participants will be guaranteed a callback for a summer associate position. “We want to keep women at the firm for as long as we can,” Ollman said. Skadden is slightly tweaking its program to include rotations in international offices, more client introductions, and exposure to public interest work so it can increase the number of 1L scholars who join the firm as summer associates, which is usually between 60 and 70 percent each year. “I’m hoping we’re giving them enough variety to pique their interest, that they don’t feel they need to look elsewhere,” Sprague said.

Congratulations to both Proskauer and Skadden on their plans to diversify their summer classes. Hopefully this will pan out and both firms will be able to increase the number of women and people of color who eventually join them as associates.

In particular, many state-level courts fall into this category. I wanted to shed a little light on what is happening and when we may see all the courts electronically available. Is the “holy grail” of access to all docket sheets with fully searchable documents located in one database something that we can expect in our lifetime?

First, let’s get right down to the fact that many of your attorneys believe that all dockets and even documents are readily available online — and free! You are constantly working to educate your requestors on the nuances of the US Court system. They wonder why a complaint and docket sheet from the US District Court in Chicago is sent right away for almost no cost while a docket sheet and complaint from a county in southern Illinois takes over a day and costs more? Even worse, why might that southern IL docket sheet be handwritten?

The good news for our industry, regardless of your view on federalism, is that the federal courts are now all online and work mostly in the same fashion. The [PACER ](http://bit.ly/2f7l48G)system has made their information available and companies like [Westlaw](http://tmsnrt.rs/2evcvmi), [LexisNexis](http://bit.ly/2eGctph), and [Bloomberg ](http://bit.ly/2aWjrEP)have massaged the data to make it more searchable and more useful for you.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

However, the state courts are a completely different world. There is no standard, uniform process. Each state has its own rules and regulations, and in some states, each county has separate rules and regulations too. Counties within the same state are competing for funds, for power, and in some cases, the County Clerk is competing for re-election. In New York State, for example, while the New York County Clerk is appointed by a panel of appellate judges (a practice put in place to stop corruption in the days of Boss Tweed and Tammany Hall) in upstate New York, the County Clerk is an elected position. Many court clerks have their own agenda. How to make it easier for us to obtain docket and document access is not at the top of the list. In fact, sometimes counties that were once online go offline or otherwise limit coverage in system “upgrades.”  I am looking at you San Luis Obispo, CA, and Minnesota!

Westlaw and others like Lexis and Bloomberg have actually seen counties and states take away data as individual courts try to limit access to large aggregators. They want to be paid each time a file is accessed. These practices are getting us further away from our dream of being able to search all court cases in the country in just one place.

So what are we talking here? How many courts are there and how many are not online? The United States has 3,134 counties or county equivalents. Each one will have a trial court level for felonies, misdemeanors, and upper level civil cases. But often, they have many more courts. There may be a separate small claims court, traffic court, probate court, etc.  How this works varies from state to state, but if you counted all of the courts holding records, you are in the neighborhood of over 10,000 courts. At the end of the day, most requestors care mostly about the trial courts. Civil cases over $10,000 or felony and misdemeanor filings are what they are after. So how many of these courts are online? Unfortunately, that keeps changing (literally there are courts going offline), but it is a little over 2,241. If you want to look at cases ten years old (for a background check, for example), the number of available courts goes down to 1,781. And this is just to access a docket sheet. The documents are another matter entirely. The number of courts that provide access to underlying documents online is a far smaller number.

So, what is the answer to my question of whether all the courts will be online in one searchable database with dockets and documents in a fully searchable format in the next 15 years? It is… highly unlikely.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Why is this important? Because the cost of missing a case or filing that is not online can be billions of dollars. Many of you have heard me speak of the [Tom Petters case](http://bit.ly/2eaJv02). Tom ran a $3.5 billion company in Minnesota from 2000 to 2008. He owned Sun Country Airlines, Polaroid, and the Petters Group.  He was a “pillar of the community,” getting loans for $100M at a time from hedge funds and backers. Most people were happy to do business with him. However, one hedge fund did a background check where they actually went to the courts where Tom had lived to check records that were not available online. They found many civil lawsuits for non-payment and a number of cases of bad check writing. The hedge fund subsequently did not invest. Six months later when authorities arrested Tom, their money was safe. It turned out his whole empire was a $3.5B Ponzi scheme — the largest in American history until Bernie Madoff came along to take that dubious distinction.

So how do you reconcile the challenges I outlined with your business needs? How do you avoid surprises when not all documents are available online? Your company needs a system that checks online courts and courts that are offline as well. One of the first things you should do when making contact with a retrieval company is to question whether they only do an online search or do they also have an additional service that goes to the courts that are not online. Yes, some companies will say they will go to the courts that are not online, but does that mean they are just going to hire a local person who only goes to court as a side job. One of the most rewarding things I get to say to clients is that [Westlaw Court Express](http://tmsnrt.rs/2f7lcVM)™ has been to every county in this country.

When speaking with the retrieval companies, do not be shy about asking what their personal experience has been with a particular court. The person you are speaking with on the phone might not have that information, but if the company is not giving you a lot of faith they will find out more information, it might be time to move onto someone else. The last item of note — and one that I continue to make sure my staff always does better than anyone else — is making sure their client is continually updated. We all know the request for any document is usually last minute and the attorney will want an update five minutes after requesting, but it is the job of the retrieval company to keep the attorney off your back and get the document as quickly as can be.

Everything is not online, but there is a solution.

Succession planning. You may not *want* to think about it — what with aging practically verboten in our youth-obsessed culture — but you really have to do it. Building a lasting legacy requires it.

But how do you implement a succession plan that satisfies the needs of your practice and your clients? Industry-wide changes to the path to law firm partnership and Gen Z’s take-it-or-leave it to that brass ring of the legal profession only complicate the matter. These thorny questions and more will be tackled in an upcoming webinar, hosted by Leopard Solutions, on Wednesday, July 26 at 1:00 p.m. EST / 10:00 a.m. PST.

This webinar will share hiring and promotion trends that Leopard Solutions have been tracking while igniting strategies to what law firms should consider to ensure they have a robust succession plan that ensures firm growth and longevity.

Key takeaways:

- State of the legal industry trends on hiring and promotion
- New and lateral associates’ road to partnership changes
- Law firm’s consideration when approaching succession planning
Presenters:

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to Law360’s Social Impact Leaders 2022 ranking, which Biglaw firm got the best score for its responsible business practices?

Hint: The responsible business score looks at the ratio of charitable contributions to a firm’s revenue, whether the firm has a practice focusing on sustainability and environmental, social and governance concerns, and whether it advises clients on compliance with environmental regulations, and indictors of where the firm’s pro bono work is focused.

“Where do you see yourself in five years?”

It’s a question associates are often asked during interviews. And while many of you reflexively answer, “up for partner, of course,” the reality is almost always less clear. Between changes in personal circumstances, new career goals, and the evolving structure and practice of Biglaw, five years can seem like a lifetime and it’s difficult to predict where you might end up.

As a former associate at the once-thriving Dewey & LeBoeuf, I know this truth well. At the start of 2012, I was a third-year associate, relatively happy and focused on my growing litigation caseload. Buried in deposition prep, I was blissfully unaware of the early rumors circulating about widespread partner dissatisfaction. Of course, as we all now know, those early whispers exploded into revelations of firm mismanagement, an avalanche of partner defections, and rampant speculation about Dewey’s continued survival. In a matter of two short months, I found myself laid off as my firm collapsed into bankruptcy. And never could I have imagined then that five years later I would have left the practice of law for a career as a legal recruiter.

With the fifth anniversary of the Dewey bankruptcy now upon us, it’s hard to see the firm’s collapse as anything but inevitable. However, like so many of my then-colleagues, I was caught completely flat-footed by the rapidly changing events at Dewey. Partly blinded by naive optimism, I was slow to react. But even then, I was unprepared to act effectively or quickly, as I had never really considered my broader career plans — or even updated my résumé since OCI!

Of course, the Dewey story remains a spectacular outlier and most of you will never face something so drastic. However, the reality is that less explosive events can have an equally significant impact on your career, derailing even the best-laid plans. As a legal recruiter who speaks with associates every day, I’m surprised to see how many of you, at all levels, are repeating some of the mistakes I made: being ignorant of or unconcerned about events unfolding around you and throughout the larger legal industry; lacking strong relationships within the firm; and having given little thought to your career beyond your current billable matter.

So, with the hope that you all manage the likely twists and turns of your own legal careers better than I did, here are a few pieces of simple advice I wish I had heeded when I was an associate.

- Stay Informed
As an associate, your fortunes are largely tied to the decisions of partners and law firm management. Their decisions, in turn, are guided by broader developments in the legal industry and the markets. So, it’s important that you stay informed at many levels. Though the events at Dewey showed most developments will be out of your control, you may be able to anticipate some changes and plan accordingly.

- Your Practice Group: Naturally, the events most likely to affect you immediately are close to home — your own practice group. Most commonly, I speak with associates who are caught off-guard when a key partner in their group leaves the firm. They are unsure of how the departure will affect workflow and are often concerned that they have lost a valuable advocate within the firm — both legitimate concerns. Sometimes these partner departures are a surprise; other times the writing was on the wall. So, pay attention. In fact, take note of all partners and more senior associates leaving your group. Where are they going? Do you know why?
- Your Firm: Pay attention to what’s happening across the firm, not just your practice group. After all, you may be buried in billable hours, but others could be struggling. Have those other groups lost key partners? Not every departure is significant, but many are — particularly the rainmakers and smaller groups leaving at once — and they may warn of more trouble to come. On a larger scale, as firms seek greater efficiencies and stability, we are seeing more law firm mergers. While they may seem great on the surface, the professed compatibility of practices and cultures may not materialize. How will that affect your workflow and your working environment? Did an influx of peer associates just hurt your chances at partnership?
- Practice Trends: Your practice choice may have been wise years ago, but do you feel the same way now? A lot can change in just a short time, impacted by a range of factors, including: the cyclical nature of a practice (bankruptcy matters often flourish in a market downturn, while M&A and IPOs follow a bull market); unforeseen political events (think Brexit and the election of Donald Trump); and  legal developments themselves (e.g., the 2012 introduction of Inter Partes Review to challenge patents, which significantly curtailed the filing of more costly infringement litigation). Are there changes you can make to your practice? New skills you can acquire or focus on? Is there even a long future in your practice?
- Legal Industry Trends: Finally, have an understanding of some of the larger industry trends. It’s no secret Big Law has undergone a sea change. Largely gone are the days of making partner as a seventh-year associate and staying at your firm for decades. Partners move frequently, taking clients with them. Technology advances have cut into attorneys’ workloads, particularly discovery work for litigators. Clients are keeping more work in-house and are more aggressively pushing back on costs and the staffing of junior associates. Are you considering how these changes affect your long-term career prospects or plans?
- Build Relationships
Your legal career will be long and its backbone will be the people you meet and the relationships you build. As an associate, you’ll naturally spend the most time with your colleagues on billable matters. But as you embrace the ever-present pressure to network (with an eye towards client development, of course), consider making these particular connections:

- Find Mentors — Both Inside and Outside the Firm: Most firms will formally assign you a mentor. Additionally, you may simply develop a mentor-mentee relationship with an attorney in your group with whom you click. These relationships are worthwhile, providing guidance and support as you weather the ups and downs of life in your shared law firm. However, don’t stop there, since finding a mentor outside your firm may prove equally beneficial. This person can offer an outsider’s perspective on your career, unburdened by any subtle biases that come from sharing a firm and sharing colleagues.
- Find a Sponsor Within the Firm: Like a mentor, a sponsor can provide guidance and support. But a sponsor does more than that. They are in a position to influence and advance your career, from staffing you on that high profile case or marquee deal to nominating you for partnership if your time comes. They know you well and can vouch for your abilities and your value to the firm. Unlike a mentor, though, they largely know the ups of your careers and not so much the downs.
- Be a Good Firm Citizen: Get involved in your firm beyond your billable matters: join the Associates’ Committee; recruit at your alma mater; interview lateral candidates; join your firm’s sports team; go to Summer Associate events; join an affinity group; or just show up at that monthly happy hour or trivia night your firm or practice group might host. While easier said than done during a 200+-hour billable month, even just a few hours a month can pay dividends. Such participation will introduce you to a wider range of attorneys and non-attorneys who can provide valuable information about the firm and provide client and job leads if the time comes. And getting to know partners outside your own practice group never hurts when you’re up for partnership vote.
- Have a Plan — But Be Ready to (Re)Adjust It
In the years since Dewey went under, I’ve spoken with dozens of my former Dewey colleagues as they’ve charted new legal paths. Some were well prepared for the change, while others like me were admittedly not. But across both groups, numerous associates told me that despite the initial disruption brought on by Dewey’s collapse, they have become happier in their careers since. In fact, many admitted that they were forced to adapt and make the very changes — including new practice areas, smaller firms and clients, and different cities — that they had previously considered but had been unwilling to act on for various reasons.

One of the key takeaways from these conversations is that having a plan is still better than none — but you must revisit it periodically. As obvious as that sounds, many associates do not do that. Instead, they blindly follow an outdated career plan or simply let inertia guide their career decisions. Of course, things will continue on as you expect them to… until they don’t. So, as you revisit your career plan, consider the following:

- Self-Assessment: Do not wait until your annual performance review to assess your development and goals. Try to do it periodically, whether at the end of each quarter or the close of a big deal or case. You should be taking stock of your skills and experience: What are your strengths and weaknesses? What practice benchmarks have you not hit? What excites you about your practice? What’s lacking? Can changes me made? Can they be made now instead of waiting until a new year? And equally important is an honest assessment of your goals: Have they changed? Are your current practice and career plans still supporting those goals?
- Keep your Materials Updated: A simple task: update your résumé and deal sheet / representative matters list as you go. Trust me — you will be frustrated when you are not ready to submit quickly to that dream job or you want to beat out a flurry of similarly situated candidates (as was the case when a flood of Dewey résumés hit the market in Spring 2012!).
- Take that Recruiter Call: And finally, the shameless recruiter plug — take my phone call! Seriously, though, recruiters can provide valuable service as you assess your career plan and particular opportunities. Among other things, we can: provide insight into your market value and the steps you should take to better set yourself up for a particular move or job; provide Intel on the practices and cultures of companies and law firms you are interested in; help you draft and polish your resume; and assist you in preparing for interviews and negotiating offers if the time comes. As a recruiter, I often connect with junior associates well before they are ready or interested in moving, aiming instead to build a relationship with them as they grow more senior. Of course, I’ll take your call anytime, but the long-game approach has proved most productive for me and the many candidates I have assisted over the past few years. Frankly, it is an approach I wish I had taken myself when I was a junior associate — well before Dewey unraveled.
Undoubtedly, the demands of a Biglaw associate are many. But beyond your billable work, you must find the time to manage your career. No one else will do it for you, and you are the only one who has your back 100% of the time, no matter what. Ideally, your career will unfold smoothly as you planned; but given the uncertainties of today’s legal practice, that may not always happen. To help you anticipate and better respond to the unexpected wrinkles, consider following the advice discussed above.

Sad news from Sidley. Over the weekend a first year associate unexpectedly passed away just a few months after starting full time at the firm.

Ralph C. Catalano joined Sidley in September 2019, where he worked in the Real Estate group in the New York office after previously working as a summer associate. Catalano got his undergraduate degree from the College of William and Mary and his J.D. from the University of Virginia School of Law.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

According to an email sent to New York employees, Samir Gandhi, managing partner of the New York office, remembered Catalano as “a conscientious worker, valued member of the team and liked by everyone who knew him.”

The firm is making counselors available to employees, and they are encouraging folks to seek assistance in dealing with Catalano’s death.

Our thoughts go out to Catalano’s family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.

# Look Who Decided To Join The Elite Biglaw Associate Compensation Scale
## Associates will enjoy the extra money!

With so many [firms dragging their heels](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/by-any-metric-these-firms-really-should-have-raised-associate-compensation-by-now/) to raise associate compensation to the new market level, it’s always nice go see when a firm matches salaries. That’s what Baker Botts decided to do — they rank 42nd in profits per partner and 43rd in profitability — joining their peers at the top.

Interestingly, Baker Botts announced they were moving to compensation based solely on class year. Though that’s the market standard, the firm had been on a level system. This means the chance of large compensation adjustments are on the horizon, potentially as much as $45,000, for associates.

# More Shake-Ups At Reed Smith
## Lateral moves are afoot.

A lot has been happening at [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/reed-smith/) since we first reported on massive lawyer layoffs. Back in January, we reported that [45 attorneys were being laid off](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/nationwide-layoff-watch-biglaw-firm-cuts-headcount-attorneys-among-the-victims/) — and it seems that things haven’t gotten more stable since then.

Seems some partners are heading for “greener” pastures. The [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202752836602/McGuireWoods-Bags-Big-BofA-Book-Plus-More-Lateral-Moves?slreturn=20160228222118) reports that Reed Smith has lost a pair of partners to McGuireWoods:

The Richmond, Virginia-based Am Law 100 firm [McGuireWoods], which saw average partner profits break the $1 million mark in 2015, has scooped up longtime Reed Smith partner MARY HACKETT in the Steel City, where she once headed the firm’s financial services litigation group, and its current practice leader DAVID POWELL in San Francisco. Sources told sibling publication The Legal Intelligencer that the team oversaw a $60 million to $70 million book of business, including handling work for Bank of America Corp., a key McGuireWoods client.

And if that wasn’t bad enough, just today McGuireWoods announced that they’d scooped up yet another Reed Smith lawyer:

David S. Reidy, a leading financial services litigator with a cutting-edge practice advising financial technology companies, has joined McGuireWoods as a partner in the San Francisco office.

Reidy comes to McGuireWoods from Reed Smith, where he was a partner leading the FinTech practice. He represents financial services companies and other clients in consumer class action and individual privacy, debt collection and unfair business practices cases, and has extensive experience litigating Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and California Invasion of Privacy Act matters.

The [Legal Intelligencer](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202752716276/McGuireWoods-Takes-Team-of-Reed-Smith-Finance-Litigators) reports Reed Smith’s reaction to some of these lateral moves:

Tamara Box, chair of Reed Smith’s ­financial industry group, said in a statement that the legal landscape is very fluid, lawyers regularly move from firm to firm and Reed Smith is more frequently than not the beneficiary of those laterals.

“In this case, however, we wish this small handful of lawyers who are leaving our firm all the best at their new firm,” Box said in the statement. “Our financial industry group remains busy, very much in demand and, of course, growing: we had close to a dozen partners join our group last year, building out further our market-leading litigation, finance, regulatory, FinTech and restructuring capabilities.”

This reads as every bit the PR-appropriate non-statement as you’d expect. But you have to imagine after the firm conducted the largest layoff of 2016 to date, associates are nervous after McGuireWoods started eating their lunch.

Update 3/29/16 9:50 a.m.: McGuireWoods has just announced that three more partners have joined the firm from Reed Smith:

McGuireWoods has expanded its nationally recognized government investigations and financial services regulatory practice with the addition of William Goydan, John Lukanski and Kiran Somashekara as partners in New York.

Goydan, Lukanski and Somashekara represent clients in complex securities matters, focusing on internal investigations and regulatory enforcement matters before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and state securities and insurance regulators. They also advise companies on compliance with securities industry rules, reporting requirements, enhancements to policies and procedures, regulatory developments, and enforcement trends and best practices. Goydan and Somashekara join McGuireWoods from the New York office of Reed Smith while Lukanski comes from its Princeton, New Jersey, office. All three practiced in the financial industry group.

But those aren’t the only lateral moves going on at Reed Smith; American Lawyer has the details — some good and some bad:

Reed Smith, which earlier this year announced plans to let go of 45 lawyers and staff despite a successful financial year in 2015, saw litigation partner MILES COOLEY in Los Angeles join Kelley Drye & Warren. STUART SHANUS, a financial services litigator and former managing partner of Reed Smith’s office in Century City, California, has joined Wade & Co.

Reed Smith did hire BLAIR PETRILLO, a deputy chief counsel in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s office of the accountant, as counsel for its corporate and securities practice in Pittsburgh. Reed Smith also picked up Pinsent Masons international arbitration and commercial disputes partner BJORN GEHLE for its offices in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

# One Biglaw Firm's Embrace Of A Transgender Partner

DJ Healey

Has the president’s awful early morning tweeting about [banning transgender](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/trumps-transgender-ban-is-bait-its-not-a-law-yet/?rf=1) individuals from serving in the military — a move that is only likely to decrease [military readiness](https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/890225265728774145) and increase the [risk of suicide ](https://qz.com/1039110/donald-trumps-transgender-military-ban-wont-stop-soldiers-from-serving-but-it-will-up-suicide-risk/)— left you deeply upset about the state of the world? Well, there’s not much to be done about the president’s actions (at least not until Robert Mueller gets a swing at him), but maybe this tiny smidgen of good news will help dispel some of the dreariness.

[Danielle Joy “DJ” Healey](https://www.fr.com/dj-healey/), an IP litigator at Fish & Richardson, recently announced she was transgender and has transitioned to living as a woman. She’s been able to do this with the full support of the firm and her clients, as reported by [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/07/25/transgender-attorney-finds-strong-support-from-her-firm/):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“They ultimately worked with me and put together a plan on how to do this and how to notify people,” she said, noting that the firm, to its credit, let her have the ultimate call on timing.

“They put an enormous amount of effort and time and energy into it. It just shows that the Fish family is really a family,” she said.

In a statement, the firm affirmed their support of Healey and diversity practices generally:

“Diversity and inclusion are crucial to the positive culture and success of our firm, and we treat everyone with respect and dignity at all times. DJ is a valued colleague and an important part of the Fish family, and we will support her completely in the months ahead,” the firm wrote in the statement.

It is wonderful that Healey is getting such support from her firm — but let’s be clear — this is far from the standard reaction:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“We’re delighted that DJ was able to transition with the support of her firm. We would not say that is typical in any way, shape or form. Firms have a long way to go,” [executive director of the National LGBT Bar Association D’Arcy] Kemnitz said.

Given the change-averse nature of the legal industry, that seems more in line with what most people expect. There are also benefits to being a partner with an [impressive client list](http://texaslawyer.typepad.com/texas_lawyer_blog/2008/10/fish-richardson.html) when asking the firm to support your transition.

Healey reports generally positive experiences in her professional life to her transition. She recently spoke at the State Bar of Texas Advanced Patent Law Seminar, and she used humor to overcome some initial skittishness of her colleagues:

At the state bar seminar, Healey said, she introduced herself as DJ Healey, formerly known as David Healey, and tried to use humor to put everyone at ease. She said she told the crowd that she needed to figure a few things out in advance of her first time speaking as a woman, such as whether to leave her purse at her chair or bring it up to the podium. She told them that because patent lawyers are a “sketchy crowd,” she brought her purse with her.

Maybe — hopefully — one day such support of transgender lawyers won’t be newsworthy.

# Tax Law's Latest Victims: Our Clients
## Under the new tax law, clients may be paying taxes on thousands of dollars in income they'll never see.

The hastily thrown together tax law will generate casualties all over the country, but one victim that’s not gotten enough attention is the poor client. Not every client is going to take it in the shorts under this abomination of a tax plan. Most personal injury plaintiffs are still fine and most suits against employers aren’t affected. But for most clients out there, they’re about to pay taxes on their entire recovery… with no deductions for legal fees.

As Robert W. Wood [put it in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2018/03/12/new-tax-on-lawsuit-settlements-legal-fees-cant-be-deducted/#285a1ddb70d7):

Many plaintiffs will face higher taxes on lawsuit settlements under the recently passed tax reform law. Some will be taxed on their gross recoveries, with no deduction for attorney fees even if their lawyer takes 40% off the top. In a $100,000 case, that means paying tax on $100,000, even if $40,000 goes to the lawyer.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ooof. Republicans have railed against the tort system for decades, but maybe they’ve finally found their silver bullet by rendering the whole process unduly expensive. Just how bad is this? Defamation, financial fraud, divorce, malpractice, false imprisonment — clients will be paying taxes on 100 percent of their recovery on all of these. It’s unclear how badly this will chill the prosecution of valid claims, but there’s going to be some effect at the margins.

Up until now, even if you did not qualify to deduct your legal fees above the line, you could deduct them below the line. A below the line (miscellaneous itemized) deduction was more limited, but was still a deduction. Now, there is no below the line deduction for legal fees. Do two checks (one to lawyer, one to plaintiff) obviate the income to plaintiff? Not according to Banks. IRS Form 1099 regulations generally require defendants to issue a Form 1099 to the plaintiff for the full settlement, even if part of the money is paid to the plaintiff’s lawyer.

Is there any way around this for the enterprising client? That’s unclear, but it’s definitely clear that clients and attorneys need to consider this matter from the outset of litigation:

For example, court awarded fees, statutory fees, or a partnership between lawyer and client divide the proceeds are all worth discussing. But tax advice early–before the case settles and the settlement agreement is signed–are going to be essential. For many, no tax deduction for legal fees will come as a bizarre and unpleasant surprise after the fact. Plaintiffs who have some advance warning and advice may go to new lengths to try to avoid the lawyer’s share being income to them, or to somehow deduct it. Few plaintiffs receiving a $100,000 recovery will think it is fair to pay taxes on the full amount, when legal fees consumed a third or more.

Unfortunately, the tax law is a double-edged sword for tort reformers. While the prospect of paying taxes on thousands of dollars they’ll never see may dissuade some suits, the fact is that these taxes apply to settlements, but can potentially be avoided if the fees are court ordered. If that’s true, clients have a perverse incentive, where the amounts are large enough to matter, to litigate to the hilt rather than settle at a more efficient point in the process.

There’s a lot of uncertainty out there right now, but the one thing we know for sure is the client is getting a bum deal.

Kirkland & Ellis may not provide its associates with lockstep bonuses and a tidy memo laying it all out, but that doesn’t mean they’re taking the cheap way out. Indeed, the firm [has a history](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/kirkland-ellis-places-bonuses-in-stockings-we-need-your-help-to-break-open-this-black-box/?rf=1) of beating the prevailing market rate, even if it takes a [little prying](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/update-bunches-of-kirkland-and-ellis-above-market-bonus-news/) to get the information.

This year K&E continues their individualizes bonuses, but the baseline for each class year was set at 5 percent over the market rate. Not bad, especially when you consider that the average associate pulled down 30-40 percent over the top of the Cravath scale. As a tipster reports:

Kirkland baseline minimum across all years is set at 5% above NY bonuses. Then add the multiples on top. We were told average associate bonus is 30-40% higher than NY across all years.

That makes the base K&E scale look like this:

2011 – $94,500
2012 – $84,000
2013 – $68,250
2014 – $52,500
2015 – $26,250
2016 – $15,750
The general reaction seems to be pretty positive:

Kirkland bonuses are rolling out. As normal, somewhat individualized with no bonus memo…. I’m a senior associate with 2000-2200 hours and was comfortably above market.

And another tipster notes that the average first year bonus was $19,800. Well above the market standard.

But without the protection of lockstep bonuses, not everyone was able to secure even a market bonus:
Just found out the hard way that if you have a below class rating, your bonus is 0.5x Cravath.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Do you like to be in the know? Do you love gossiping with friends and co-workers over the latest bonus news? Then you simply must sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts. It’s easy, just scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything.

# Am Law 200 Firm Cuts Salaries To 'Weather A Downturn'

Let’s spin the Biglaw wheel and see which firm is enacting COVID-19 austerity measures. The latest firm making the tough cuts is Foley Hoag. The firm made $208,144,000 in 2018 gross revenue, making it 142 on the Am Law 200.

Over email ([available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/foley-hoag-cuts/2/)), firm leaders laid out the specific cuts to all of the stakeholders. Their plan involves a 15 percent pay cut for associates and business professionals making $190,000+, a 7.5 percent cut for staff making $150,000-190,000, and a 20-30 percent cut for non-equity partners. According to the email, equity partners have already taken compensation cuts of an undisclosed amount and will continue to do so.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and has caused far-reaching repercussions across the business community. As the economy slows, our goal is to ensure Foley Hoag is well-positioned to weather a downturn. Therefore, the firm is making temporary adjustments by reducing salaries for all attorneys and certain business services personnel.
