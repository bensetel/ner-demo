Welcome to my new column, “Power Niche Marketing.”

This column has a very simple purpose: to teach marketing to lawyers and other professional service providers.

Astonishingly, all of us lawyers need clients in order to survive, yet when we go to law school and start our careers and our careers move forward, there is simply no one teaching us how to get these clients!

And we are desperate to learn. We see the big rainmakers, with their (figurative) cigars having all the fun and making all the money, while we toil away in the trenches wondering “why?”  It doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t seem fair. But we have no idea what to do about it.

In our desperation, we may ask a successful rainmaker, “How do you do it?  What is the secret?”

The rainmaker is always 1000% confident in her answer, and you hear things like this:

- You get your clients from across the table.
- You get them on the golf course.
- You go to seminars.
- You work the room.
- You network relentlessly.
- You get them from your high school, if it is connected.
- You get them through just doing great work, and people hear about it.
- You get them at the synagogue/church, etc…

The list goes on and on and on, with the only theme being that there is no rhyme or reason to it. And yet the rainmaker who gives you this advice is super-confident in it for an empirically misleading reason: whatever she is telling you worked for her!

Some of us in our desperation go to marketing courses, or seminars, but, alas, just about all of them (and maybe all of them) are taught by people who didn’t actually go out and bring in clients. Perhaps they are non-lawyers or, worse yet, people who failed at being lawyers and then turned to teaching marketing, thereby validating the [old saying](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Those+who+can,+do%3B+those+who+can't,+teach) that those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.

There really is nowhere to turn. But meanwhile, our profession is becoming utterly relentless in the simple truth that:

Rain = great career.

No rain = bad career.

Your troubles are now over!  Just read my column for the next year, and you will be a great rainmaker. Simple!

Okay, it is not that simple; however, I will stick my neck out and say the following:

- I am not some guy who couldn’t succeed and so is now teaching. I am out there every single day marketing and trying to provide strong value propositions to prospective clients. I am in the trenches, and I know what clients respond to.
- I have gained my expertise by ruthlessly examining internally my own strengths and weaknesses and, with brutal honesty (to myself), I have analyzed what works in practice and what fails. At the same time, I have tried hard to understand what is really and truly important to my clients. After many fits and starts – and more outright failures than I like to think about – a lot has become clear to me. I will be sharing what I have learned in this column.
- Finally, of everything that I have learned in the marketing world, by far the most important lesson I have learned is the importance, and indeed the power, in the “Power Niche,” which is a term I have coined. Although there are numerous sub-parts to my marketing plan, at the heart of it is the Power Niche; accordingly, you will hear a lot about it throughout the articles.
Ultimately, virtually anyone can become a successful rainmaker by following a few simple teachings. This is really true. There are some tricks of the trade, but it is not a secret handshake – it is actually quite easy. Just keep an open mind, and I will be of great use to you.

I will get into the heart of the Power Niche in my next article, but so I don’t become one of those “annoying” serial writers who always puts the excitement in the “next” article to bring you back, I will let the cat out of the bag right now and tell you what I mean by a Power Niche:

In brief, a Power Niche is a small-sized niche within a bigger industry that no one else yet dominates or owns. The niche isn’t obvious, so you have to figure it out and “create” it. You step in and learn everything about it and everyone in it. You tell everyone about what you are doing – incessantly – and become the real “owner” of the niche merely by staking out your homestead in virgin territory. This then becomes a virtuous cycle as the more you know, the more you do, and the more you do, the more you know. Before long you are the world’s unquestioned expert in this (smaller) niche. All of this enhances your bargaining power within that niche. Instead of begging for business in the bigger industry, you now have eager clients paying you top dollar within this smaller Power Niche.

The goal of this new column is to teach you exactly how to build a Power Niche and become a rainmaker (or grow your book of business if you already are a rainmaker).

Everybody’s department is underfunded.

Everybody’s.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There’s always a guy in the information technology department who says that IT is underfunded. In fact, that guy has sent around a few emails complaining about how the department is underfunded.

So, when an IT problem arises — maybe the computer system gets hacked — there are, by definition, bad emails. Because one guy in the department was sending around emails complaining that IT was underfunded.

How’s the funding over there in the compliance department?

Funny you should ask.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
There’s someone in the compliance department who thinks that compliance is underfunded: “We always invest in the business, and we never invest in compliance. That’s why we’re so short on resources. Something bad is sure to happen, because compliance is so stretched.” Or some such thing.

So, when something bad happens — your company accidentally does business with a prohibited person or country — there are bad emails. Because there was one person in the compliance department who was complaining that compliance was underfunded.

How’s the funding over there in the finance department?

Funny you should ask.

Because there’s one person in the finance department who thinks finance is underfunded: “The finance department is critically important to this company. Why won’t we invest in it? We need a computer system that will let us monitor stuff intelligently. And the company always refuses to buy state-of-the-art financial management tools. This place sucks.” Or some such thing.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
So, when something bad happens in finance — the SEC unearths an accounting irregularity — there are always bad emails. Because there was one person in finance who was complaining that finance was underfunded.

How’s the funding over there in the law department?

Funny you should ask.

This is the way of the world. Corporations by definition have limited resources.  Corporations exist to make a profit. It’s not possible to fund every department to the maximum. So everyone thinks that the department in which they work is underfunded, and the company is thus neglecting a critical need.

When something bad happens anywhere in the company, there are always bad emails — because people in every department are constantly complaining that their department is underfunded.

Note that this entire preceding discussion has not included the truly stupid, case-specific emails: “My God! How could Summerson have made such a mistake? If the plaintiffs in a lawsuit ever see that evidence, we’re toast!” And the like. That happens, too, but for different reasons than the generic stuff.

The regulator, or judge, or jury, will see those bad emails. Your co-workers will hear about the emails and gasp: “How could Jarndyce have been so stupid?”

It wasn’t Jarndyce.

It was human nature.

Get used to the fact that there will always be bad emails. That’s the way of the world.

# Taking Ownership Starts At The Top
## At the very best Biglaw firms, good leaders don’t 'pass the buck' in order to make a buck.

Ed. note: Please welcome D.W. Randolph, author of [Biglaw Confidential](https://amzn.to/3Ky6OkT) (affiliate link), to our pages. They will be writing about Biglaw firms and life, all from a partner’s perspective.

Attorneys in Biglaw firms love to use phrases like “taking ownership.”  Taking ownership is generally understood to mean taking responsibility for an idea or problem.  In my extensive experience working in Biglaw firms, including as a partner and practice leader at an Am Law 100 law firm, “taking ownership” in the Biglaw context means that: you understand how a document or piece of a project fits into the bigger picture, and that once you’re involved, you do your best to understand that document or piece as well as the bigger picture, progress the work and see it through to successful completion (even if a colleague fails to do their part), and accept whatever consequences follow.

Recently, one Am Law top-20 law firm received some negative publicity for a senior associate’s presentation to junior associates on job performance expectations.  A copy of the presentation’s slide entitled “Non-Negotiable Expectations” went viral.  The list of expectations included, among others: “You are ‘online’ 24/7.  No exceptions, no excuses.”; “Timelines/Quality: clients expect everything to be done perfectly and delivered yesterday.”; and “Take ownership of everything you do.  Once you touch a documentation/work stream, you own every mistake in it–fair or not.”  After the presentation went viral, the firm [officially disavowed it](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-training-presentation-says-you-are-online-24-7-and-thats-not-even-the-worst-advice/), stating that it didn’t express the views of the firm or its partners.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Numerous current and former Biglaw attorneys have contacted me to say things like “Wow, have you seen the slide?  It’s really something!” And numerous attorneys outside of Biglaw have reached out to ask me, “Is Biglaw really like that?”  Yes and yes.  The majority of attorneys that I know who have worked at Am Law 100 Biglaw firms (including me) would confirm that the job performance expectations listed on that slide are pretty accurate and applicable to the majority of Biglaw practices, offices, and firms.  At some firms the expectations may be conveyed with a slightly softer tone, or the clients and/or partners that you work with may be more willing to grant exceptions and flexibility here and there, but by and large, the slide accurately depicts job performance expectations in many Biglaw practices, offices, and firms.

I’ve read a few recent articles on the incident, from articles blaming the senior associate for “lacking proper tone,” to articles saying that the list “really shouldn’t surprise anyone.”  I haven’t read any articles yet that criticize the partners or leaders of that firm for their roles with the incident.

This incident reflects a failure of leadership at one or more levels in that law firm.  Firm leadership should “take ownership,” rather than disavowing the presentation and blaming the senior associate for it.  As Jocko Willink, the famous leader of NAVY SEAL Team 3, and the author of an entire book on taking ownership has stated, “leaders must own everything in their world.  There is no one else to blame.”  The fact is that this presentation reflected the performance expectations as that senior associate understood them, for at least their practice group and office (and likely, the firm).  So it seems likely that either:

(a) the firm’s job performance expectations are materially different from those stated in the presentation, and the partners and leaders in that senior associate’s practice group, office, and/or the firm failed to correctly communicate the performance expectations to the senior associate (perhaps for years), or at a minimum, failed to review the training presentation for accuracy (or tone) before it was shared with junior associates; or

(b) the firm’s job performance expectations are accurately reflected in the presentation, but that the firm is disavowing it, perhaps because it presents an inconvenient and unattractive truth — truth that would make it more difficult to recruit talented law students and lateral attorneys to join the firm if they knew that’s what the firm expects from its attorneys and what the reality of their work lives would be like there.

In either case, at least some of the firm’s partners and leaders are failing to “take ownership,” and have failed as leaders in at least some respect.  It’s ironic that the firm’s partners and leaders have apparently relayed the importance of taking ownership to the senior associate (who made the presentation advising junior associates to take ownership of their work), while simultaneously failing to take ownership, themselves.

Good leaders don’t “pass the buck” in order to make a buck.  And great leaders give their team the credit when things go well, and take ownership when they don’t.

# Just How Ruthless Were These Reed Smith Firings?
## New report suggests associates who did not lose their jobs may have faced other penalties.

Yesterday, we reported that [Reed Smith fired multiple associates across multiple offices](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/biglaw-firm-fires-multiple-attorneys-without-warning-over-zoom/) over alleged “billing errors” on a months-long document review. According to reports, most if not all of the firings were conducted over teleconference and the impacted associates were offered no severance. When contacted, the firm said that it would not comment on the story.

Even giving the firm every benefit of the doubt, the response seemed inappropriate.

The project ran from August to October and by all accounts, attorneys were encouraged to pull out all stops. According to our tips, the associates were never approached by managers or given any indication that there was anything wrong with their billing until the moment they were fired almost three months after the project ended. One would think that over those three months, someone with authority would write off some time — ideally before blindly sending out the bills — and counsel the attorneys on what to do going forward before firing people “for cause.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Just how ruthless were these firings? After publishing yesterday’s story, we received a new tip that at least two of the terminated associates are currently pregnant and were denied maternity leave and had their health care discontinued.

We also now hear that some of the “lucky” attorneys on the project who did not get fired were told that they will not be advanced and their compensation has been reduced. What manner of toxic hell was this document review?

The more sweeping this story gets, the less defensible the response. A sole associate padding bills is one thing. As a boss, I probably wouldn’t fire them without intervening at least once and telling them how to properly bill, but there’s at least an argument for firing them outright.

But when multiple people in different offices get in trouble for the same thing, then the problem rests higher on the food chain. Given the scale of the punishments in this matter, potentially stretching to the attorneys who didn’t even get fired, this clearly isn’t a lone wolf operation. Whatever the associates did in the eyes of the firm — and the firm isn’t sharing its side of this story — is something the team was either instructed to do or thought they had been instructed to do. Either way, it’s a management problem before it’s a foot soldier problem.

And that’s the thing… firing associates for following faulty orders is one thing. Maybe a firm feels they should have known better than to follow. But the firm took this up a notch. Tell people they have to leave in six months and sign an NDA if you’re trying to cover up some systemic leadership mistake. Firing people “for cause” is a choice. Firing attorneys without severance is a choice. Firing pregnant lawyers and cutting off their health care is a choice.

And they’re all choices that get harder to justify if the fault appears to rest at a higher pay grade.

With salary news coming from the Biglaw world with fast and furious speed ever since late January, some firms have been content to remain silent and stand watching on the sidelines — until now.

Mayer Brown, a firm ranked at No. 22 on the Am Law 100, with $1,517,100,000 gross revenue in 2020, didn’t match Milbank back in January. The firm didn’t even match Davis Polk in February. But it’s better late than never at Mayer Brown, because now it’s March, and the firm is coming out in style with a big, fat Cravath match.

Here’s what the salary scale will soon look like at the firm:



Associates at Mayer Brown will see new salaries in their accounts on April 1, retroactive to January 1. Congratulations, everyone!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Mayer Brown.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”).

# Midlevel Biglaw Associates Can't Believe How Bad The Technology Is At Their Firms
## It's not like these firms can't afford to make the fixes needed....

The American Lawyer recently revealed its 2023 midlevel survey, which showed us that while [midlevels are frustrated](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/biglaw-midlevel-associates-arent-happy-about-firm-culture-office-attendance-mandates/) with the hit that firm culture has taken amid office attendance mandates, they’re absolutely infuriated by their firms’ technical prowess — or should we say, the lack thereof.

As part of Am Law’s annual midlevel survey, associates were asked to [rank their firms on all things tech](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/22/did-you-try-turning-it-off-and-back-on-again-midlevels-rank-their-firms-on-tech/), and boy oh boy, are they pissed. How mad are they? As noted by Am Law, lawyers are finding it “difficult to square their firms’ record profits of late with slow computers, outdated software and clunky document management systems.” Here’s more:

Only 62% of associates said their firms offered technology training, down from 67% in 2022. Associates’ perception of firm-provided technology and training also deteriorated slightly, and associates were less likely to endorse the firm’s efficient use of technology on behalf of clients. …

As usual, a majority of associates’ technology complaints came from a cluster of law firms, and some of the world’s richest firms continue to field the same complaints year after year.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Which firms are making midlevels gripe the most about their tech setups? That would be Skadden (“The firm desperately needs to upgrade its tech,” said one associate, while another said, “I cannot believe how outdated Skadden’s tech is.”); WilmerHale (where associates claim the firm’s laptops are not up to par — “It would be much appreciated to receive computers that do not crash weekly,” said one associate); Alston & Bird (midlevels here are not happy with their laptops); Dechert (another laptop loser, where one associate said, “We have too many (IT and technology) issues for a big firm and that impedes our efficiency.”); and Morrison & Foerster (no one is a fan of any aspect of the tech at this firm, where one associate said, “The technology is the worst thing about MoFo.”).

Enough about the firms with tech that’s making midlevel associates angry — let’s get to the rankings. Which firms landed on top when it comes to their technology? Here are the top 10, courtesy of [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/22/did-you-try-turning-it-off-and-back-on-again-midlevels-rank-their-firms-on-tech/):

In view of recent statements of the client, we are no longer representing him or his interests. A disappointing end to a very long relationship.

— [Ron Shechtman](https://www.pryorcashman.com/ronald-h-shechtman), managing partner of Pryor Cashman, in a [statement](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/10/27/more-big-law-firms-are-saying-bye-to-ye/) given on the firm’s decision to end its relationship with Kanye West. A slew of Biglaw firms (like [Brown Rudnick](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firm-passes-on-representing-kanye-west-after-rapper-refuses-to-back-away-from-antisemitic-remarks/) and [Cadwalader](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/second-biglaw-firms-dump-kanye-west-over-antisemitic-remarks/)) and companies (like [Adidas](https://fashionista.com/2022/10/adidas-kanye-west-partnership-ending) and Creative Artists Agency) have distanced themselves from the rapper in the wake of his antisemitic remarks made on social media that he refuses to back down from.

# Suspended Biglaw Associate Pleads Guilty To New Charges In Molotov Cocktail Attack
## A reduced sentence is likely, but with this plea comes the loss of his ability to practice law.

When we last checked in on suspended Pryor Cashman associate Colinford Mattis and housing attorney Urooj Rahman, both charged in May 2020 for their [involvement with a Molotov cocktail attack](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/furloughed-biglaw-associate-charged-in-new-york-molotov-cocktail-attack/) on a police vehicle in Brooklyn, New York, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, they’d reached new plea agreements with federal prosecutors — ones that carried with them sentences of 18 to 24 months. The pair originally faced up to 45 years in prison.

Last week, Mattis and Rahman went back to court for a hearing on their new charges of conspiracy to commit arson and possess an explosive device. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ny-lawyers-plead-guilty-molotov-cocktail-case-shorter-sentences-likely-2022-06-02/) has additional details:

[Mattis and Rahman] entered pleas to the new charges before U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn, and said they understood they would lose their law licenses as a result of their guilty pleas.

“I wish I had made different and better choices that night,” Mattis told Cogan. Rahman also said she regretted her actions.

In addition to their future sentences and the loss of the ability to practice law, Mattis and Rahman have agreed to pay $30,137 in restitution to New York City.

Last month, the defense team was poised to ask Cogan for a sentence of time served, as Mattis and Rahman have been in home detention for about two years now. We’ll check back in on their sentencing when the hearing occurs.

Reed Smith associate Nicole Langesfeld, 26, and her husband, Luis Sadovnic were killed in the[ June 24 collapse of Champlain Towers South](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/biglaw-associate-among-those-still-missing-in-florida-building-collapse/) in Surfside, Florida. Langesfeld was a summer associate at the firm and started full time in 2019. She and Sadovnic were married earlier this year and only moved into the doomed residence two months before the tragic collapse.

Reed Smith counsel Ana Barton [tells Law.com](https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2021/08/02/reed-smith-associate-killed-in-surfside-collapse-was-a-fearless-lawyer-with-a-good-sense-of-humor/) Langesfeld was a fearless attorney:

“She was fearless,” Barton said. “The way she spoke up with ideas when we were doing an internal brainstorming session on how to advance the case for a client and what arguments to make. She was the same talking to Noah [Goldberg] and I, as fellow associates, as she was talking to partners and speaking on calls with the client, which says volumes about the person she was.”

And insurance recovery associate Noah Goldberg remembered Langesfeld’s sense of humor:

“It’s hard to describe the person Nicky was because some of the words sound like generic superlatives or platitudes, but she was the very real embodiment of so many things that people aspire to be,” Goldberg said. “I’ve never laughed so much when writing a brief as I have when I’ve done it with Nicky.”

One of Langesfeld’s former professors, University of Miami School of Law’s Andrew Dawson said she stood out in the crowd:

“They’re bar courses, they’re big classes, there are a lot of students in each. I’m not able to get to know that many students in those large classes, but I remember Nicole very clearly,” Dawson said. “She actually had fun acting as a lawyer. She was very memorable in that way.”

One of Langesfeld’s co-workers, legal assistant Regla Barrios started a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/2faj22emko) to raise money for the couple’s family.

# Salary Rollbacks And Full Restoration Payments For Am Law 50 Firm
## This should make for some happy associates.

The prospects in Biglaw seem to be looking up. After the spring of 2020 was spent documenting the austerity measures firms were taking to survive the economic impact of COVID-19, it seems a corner has been turned. Now, we have happier news from Am Law 50 firm Perkins Coie.

So, what were the austerity measures at Perkins Coie?[ In April. the firm announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/) the partnership was deferring ~19 percent of their compensation. Then they came for everyone else’s salary. [Beginning with their June paychecks](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/am-law-50-firm-slashes-associate-salaries-indefinitely/), non-partner attorneys saw a 15 percent cut, staff making $200,000+ took a 15 percent cut, and staff making $125,000-$200,000 saw compensation cut by 10 percent.

But today, the firm announced they’ve weathered the COVID storm and they’re doing an about face on salary cuts. Not only are the cuts over, but the firm’s making full restitution payments to make their employees’ salaries whole. As a statement from the firm reveals:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Based upon the firm’s continued strong financial performance, and the positive impact of the business resilience measures we adopted in the spring of 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the firm will discontinue the salary reductions that were instituted in June and make full restoration payments to those who received reductions.

“The firm was able to quickly pivot to a virtual environment which allowed for uninterrupted service to clients,” according to Managing Partner Bill Malley. “Today’s announcement results from the firm’s strong client relationships and the collective efforts of lawyers and staff who worked tirelessly to continue providing outstanding service to our clients throughout this extraordinary year.”

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries or restoring previous cuts, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Sullivan & Cromwell Matches Salaries... We Think
## Even though salaries are announced by individualized memo, our army of tipsters is coming through for us.

In keeping with a certain old -fashioned worldview, Sullivan & Cromwell doesn’t issue compensation alerts with firm-wide, completely transparent proclamations like most firms do, opting instead for the individualized memo to each associate. Charitably, you could call it “genteel” or “a personal touch.” More cynically, you could call it annoyingly opaque.

Despite this opacity, S&C isn’t what we’d call a black box when it comes to compensation. While some firms eschew the firm-wide memo in order to quietly shortchange associates, hoping that the associates will be too embarrassed to tell the world, each assuming that they are the only ones making peanuts — *cough* [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) *cough* — S&C generally pays the prevailing market rate, they just make it an arduous reporting task to verify this fact.

So, here we go again. S&C has sent out individualized memos in the wake of what I’m calling “the [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/), as [amended with regard to bonus structure by Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/), as further modified [for senior associates in accordance with Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale” and, as we hear from tipsters in each class, we can confirm that we seem to be looking at a match.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
To remind everyone, this is the scale as Cravath left it:



So far, we’ve only heard about matches at multiple class levels (e.g., a third-year informing us that their memo provides for a $220,000 salary with $10,000 summer bonus), but we’ll update if anything comes in that deviates from the pattern. UPDATE: Seniors may even be beating the market in some places — a class of ’09 associate reported $360K. Senior associates confirm the $25K summer bonus structure too. UPDATE: Summers will be matched accordingly too.

The new salary will take effect July 1, with the bonuses distributed on July 15.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This news is certainly not surprising, as S&C is never one to buck the Cravath market. At least they followed the latter firm’s announcement quickly this time — some associates were peeved over the winter at the firm’s delayed bonus announcement.

One presumes this will salve those ancient wounds.

While S&C is a uniquely difficult case to report on, everyone should remember that we still depend on your tips to stay on top of raises. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Don’t assume someone else has already emailed us. We’ll gladly take redundant emails over no information at all.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Associates Should Avoid Taking Sides In Law Firm Partner Disputes
## Try your best to stay out of the fray and avoid the trash talking between the two sides.

As detailed on this website and other legal news outlets, law firms of all types and sizes often have internal disputes that put reality television drama to shame. Sometimes, partners defect from shops over financial or personal issues, and this can leave egos bruised and people stuck holding the bag for the departing attorneys. Sometimes law firms divorce altogether, like with the famous Cellino & Barnes breakup, which was so dramatic (and perhaps a little comedic), [that is spawned an off-Broadway play](https://www.cellino-v-barnes.com/). Although it might sound easier said than done, associates should try not to take sides during partner disputes at law firms so they can have the most options available to them later in their careers.

I learned this important lesson early in my legal career when I was working as a litigation associate in Biglaw. Our firm was experiencing significant financial pressure, and the partners in our office had different opinions about the direction of our office and the firm. One faction wanted to downsize headcount and supposedly move the office to a smaller, more suburban location. Another faction wanted the office to stay in an urban location and did not support reducing headcount. I tried my best to stay out of the fray and avoid the trash talking between the two sides. Being neutral did not really impact my fate at that firm, but it was good to get a firsthand lesson about the politics that sometimes abounds at law firms.

Later in my career, I worked at a firm at which all of the partners had a major dispute with one of the firm’s partners. As could be expected when lawyers have disputes, the matter eventually entered litigation, and it was difficult for people around the office to voice any kind of support for the solitary partner who was on the other side of the remaining partners’ ire. Even after I left that firm, it was difficult to remain neutral, since each time I encountered a partner from the one faction, they would invariably trash talk the partner in the other faction.

However, I knew it would be best to stay neutral and not pick sides in the dispute. Whenever anyone brought up the dispute, I tried to be as polite as possible, but I did not voice an opinion one way or the other about which faction was correct in the dispute. All of the firm’s partners were pretty well known in the legal community, and the partners could have an impact on future career opportunities and business development chances. By maintaining neutrality, I was able to avoid burning bridges and keep all of my connections in place to have the best chance at career advancement and generating business in my future endeavors.

At a further point in my career, I worked at a larger law firm that was having significant financial issues (these were discussed in detail in articles on this website). Some of the partners in my office decided that it would be best to leave the firm and form their own shop with pretty much everyone at the office that wanted to come along. After reading the writing on the wall, I decided to join the splinter law firm since it seemed like they had the best chance at thriving. This ended up being a solid decision since the other firm went out of business less than a year after partners splintered off.

In any event, not everyone wanted to join the new firm or were not invited to join the new shop. This made things a little uncomfortable around the office because, for a period, we all worked in the office for the old law firm while we waited to leave to join the new law firm. Many of the partners who were staying with the old law firm seemed bitter about the divorce that was happening in our office, and I don’t blame them. When they discussed the situation with me, I just nodded my head and smiled politely without taking a position one way or the other about whether it was wise to begin the new firm. This helped me preserve the best connections possible with people who were staying at the old firm even as I was out the door to work at the new shop.

Sometimes, it is really difficult, if not impossible, to stay out of the fray of partner disputes at a law firm. In certain instances, partners may take an us-versus-them mentality in disputes and force associates to take sides. However, associates should try as much as possible to stay neutral during partner disputes in order to preserve career opportunities and goodwill with the most people possible.

It’s hard to win a client pitch.

Heck — it’s hard even to obtain a client pitch. Most business goes to the law firm that the client has worked with in the past and is a known (and good) quantity. Why bother with a beauty contest?

But beauty contests happen: The usual counsel is conflicted out, or the case involves an unusual subject matter for the client, or the case is brought in a new geographic area, or the situation is somehow extraordinary. If you get to make a pitch, what works?

Let me talk today about what I’ve seen fail. Here are three things I personally have witnessed.

First, I saw one of my then-partners try to impress a new client by talking about the great work he was doing for another company:

“My current client is very impressed by the work I do for it. I won a trial for that client in Florida. The situation was impossible . . . . The jury was against us . . . . .You had to pitch a perfect game . . . . The client loved me for the result. Now I do a ton of other work for that client. In fact, the client let me use the corporate plane to fly here today, and the corporate plane will take me to New York tomorrow to meet with the most important people at that client.”

We didn’t land the business.

Why not?

“Your partner is certainly a great lawyer. He apparently does great work for a big company. But we were thinking: Where would we rate on that lawyer’s scale? Whose case will he concentrate on — ours, or the case that he’s doing for the client that’s so important to him? We just didn’t believe that a relatively small client like us will ever be on the radar screen for a person doing so much work for BigCo.”

Right.

If I’m a potential client, I want to feel like you’ll care about me.

Second, opposing counsel in a case had been sanctioned for serving burdensome discovery. Despite that, the lawyer’s firm was later asked to participate in a beauty contest to work for the company. And the firm chose to send over to make the pitch — the very guy who had been sanctioned!

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Big firms have many lawyers.

Those firms should spend at least a couple of seconds thinking about who a potential client will like and who a potential client will hate. The guy who served discovery so burdensome that the other side chose to seek sanctions — and then recovered them — is probably not the guy whose judgment the client will want to rely on in the future.

If the firm had sent over anyone but this person, the firm might have had a chance to win the business. But the firm chose to send over the only guy who was disqualified from the get-go.

Not smart.

Finally, consider what the other firms making pitches will do. The first firm sends over a team of three people, each with specialized skills. The firm has created a mock intranet, showing how the firm will interact with the client in real-time, sharing the firm’s work product, providing information about bills, and easing client communications. The presentation is impressive, revealing the time and effort that went into preparing the pitch.

The second firm sends over one guy with a pencil and a notepad: “We’ve done a couple of things like this in the past, and I’m pretty damn good, if I do say so myself.”

Look: If it’s a close call, clients will appreciate substance over form and might pick the firm that put less effort into its presentation.

But make sure it’s a close call.

You can’t let it be obvious that your competitor really cares about the new client and will put huge effort into landing the business, and you, in contrast, couldn’t care less.

Your lack of interest in the beauty contest doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll do bad work, but it could mean that other things are more important to you than this new client.

Winning new business is hard.

Don’t make silly mistakes and lose new business when opportunity knocks.

# Big Trouble For Biglaw Partners From 'Tax Reform'
## The proposed tax bill hurts partners and helps associates -- who'd have thunk it?

The other day, on my way into the office, I bumped into a friend who’s a Biglaw partner here in New York — and who’s very, very upset. The cause of his ire? So-called “tax reform.”

The conventional wisdom about the [Republican tax plan](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/15/politics/republican-tax-bill/index.html) that was [released tonight in final form](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/15/gop-releases-its-final-tax-plan--heres-whats-in-it.html) and likely to get passed by Congress next week is that it’s “regressive” — i.e., that it benefits the rich more than the less rich. And that’s generally true, but with some important caveats — especially for Biglaw partners.

On the whole, partners of large law firms are pretty rich. In 2016, the average profits per partner at an Am Law 100 firm hit almost [$1.7 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/), and average PPP for “Second Hundred” firms, those ranked #101-#200 by revenue, clocked in at almost [$750,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/the-2017-am-law-200-keep-calm-and-carry-on/2/). Reasonable minds can disagree over [what constitutes rich](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/09/earning-250000-does-not-make-you-rich-not-in-my-town/), but most folks — especially “ordinary Americans” — would view someone earning $750,000 or more as “rich.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Some provisions will benefit Biglaw partners as a group, such as the lowering of the top personal tax rate from 39.6 to 37 percent and the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent (which will benefit investors in corporations — and most partners have lots of money invested in companies, through retirement plans or otherwise). But two provisions are problematic for Biglaw partners.

The first problem is the capping of the state and local tax deduction (“SALT deduction”) at $10,000. Under current law, the SALT deduction allows taxpayers who itemize their taxes to deduct state and local taxes — including property and real estate taxes, state and local income taxes, and sales taxes — on their federal returns. For Biglaw partners who live in high-tax states or whose firms generate lots of income in high-tax states (remember that partners must file tax returns in every jurisdiction where their firm operates), the capping of the SALT deduction could lead to a much, much bigger tax bill.

Take a partner based in New York or California who earns $2 million or more and owns a nice house or apartment, a pretty typical situation. After losing generous deductions for (rather high) state income and property taxes, that partner could be looking at an increase in tax liability in the six figures. (And that’s just based on the capping of the SALT deduction; if this partner buys an expensive new home, her mortgage-interest deduction is capped at $750,000. (Current homeowners are not affected.))

The second problem is the tax treatment of “pass-through” businesses, i.e., businesses whose income “passes through” to the owners’ individual returns, where it then gets taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Because law firms are pass-through businesses, and because cutting taxes on income from pass-through businesses has long been a hallmark of the Republican tax plans, earlier in the year it looked like law firms would be [big winners under tax reform](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer_partnerships_would_benefit_from_trumps_new_tax_plan).

Alas, Congress ultimately decided to stick it to the lawyers. As explained by the [ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/aba_asks_congress_to_include_law_firms_in_pass_through_tax_relief), describing the House and Senate bills that gave rise to the bill unveiled this evening (emphases added):

The House bill lowers the tax rate to a maximum of 25 percent on qualified business income for many pass-through businesses, and a phased-in 9 percent rate for small pass-through entities. However, the pass-through rate reduction would generally not apply to law firms and many other types of professional service businesses.

The Senate bill applies to all types of pass-through businesses, including law firms and other professional service businesses. It continues to tax pass-throughs at ordinary rates, but it creates a 23 percent deduction for the nonwage portion of pass-through income. The deduction is not allowed, however, for professional service providers whose taxable income exceeds $500,000 for married individuals filing jointly or $250,000 for individuals.

The [final bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/politics/republican-tax-bill.html?_r=0) comes closer to the Senate version. It gives owners of pass-through businesses a 20 percent deduction on the profits they earn, but the deduction phases out starting at $315,000 of income for couples. It allows law firms and other professional-services firms to benefit from the deduction — following the Senate approach, rejecting the House approach — but still [subject to the $315,000 cap](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/15/the-final-gop-tax-bill-is-complete-heres-what-is-in-it/?utm_term=.de398aca579c). So Biglaw partners, who pretty much all earn more than $315,000, can’t join in the reindeer games.

Now, a Biglaw partner earning a few million who will have to pay a hundred grand or more in extra taxes might not be the most sympathetic figure. Will she have to buy a smaller boat, or postpone the renovations on the Hamptons house? But one can still see why they’d be upset: many of them are getting treated worse than both people who earn more and people who earn less.

Speaking of people who earn less… interestingly enough, because Biglaw associates generally earn under $315,000, they could wind up making out better than Biglaw partners under the new tax proposal. From a great paper by 13 leading tax-law professors, [The Games They Will Play: Tax Games, Roadblocks, and Glitches Under the New Legislation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3084187), which identifies numerous loopholes, perversities, and other problems in the proposed tax reform:

[T]axpayers may be able to game the pass-through provisions through the following strategies, each of which is described in greater detail in the Appendix:

• Law firm associates, LLC. Under the Senate bill, there is potentially a major problem as drafted: Employees may be able to benefit from the pass-through provision by forming a pass-through of which they are an owner. To achieve the tax savings, no longer be an employee (who cannot benefit from the provision); instead be an owner (who can benefit from the provision). For example, law firm associates (and other employees of the firm) should no longer be mere associates. They should instead be partners in Associates, LLC—a separate partnership paid to provide services to the original firm. Their “profit share”—in lieu of salary—from Associates, LLC would then be given the special low pass-through rate. There are restrictions on lawyers—since they provide a personal service, which is disfavored in the bill—from benefiting from the special pass-through rate, but those restrictions would not apply to these associates. So long as the associate (or really partner in Associates, LLC) makes less than $500,000 in taxable income (for a married couple) or $250,000 (for a single individual), they would be fully eligible. And that covers a lot of law firm associates, not to mention many other people who are now employees—but who may not be for long. [Ed. note: This discussion pertains to the Senate bill, but just change the $500,000 limit to $315,000 and it’s accurate as to the final bill.]

The appendix identifies one possible hitch, but a hitch that’s easily overcome:

The associates couldn’t be given a “guaranteed payment” — i.e. a guaranteed amount each year. Instead, compensation would have to depend in some way on the profits of Law Firm Associates LLC. But, associates shouldn’t be too worried. The partners in the original firm can simply contract with Associates LLC to provide a steady stream of income.

The prohibition on “guaranteed payment” is designed to block schemes to turn wage earners into business owners (schemes like, well, Associates, LLC). But there’s a good amount of wiggle room in associate compensation — think about how bonuses vary from year to year, depending on the law firm’s performance, and how many firms do individualized bonuses, depending on the associate’s performance — so it would be easy to come up with a system for distributing the profits from Associates, LLC in a way that both avoids the “guaranteed payment” problem but also gives associates compensation that reflects the factors currently used in setting associate pay, such as seniority and performance.

So, at least as of now, here’s the tax-reform scoreboard for Biglaw: associates 1, partners 0.

# New Study: GCs Have Brought The Majority Of Work In-House
## Clients have figured out they don't need lawyers. We're all doomed.

Clients are taking back that billable work.

More bad news for outside counsel.

Every quarter we report on the growing gap between the elite Biglaw firms and the rest of the Am Law 200. The outlook for law firms generally remains tepid, but the cream of the crop seem to keep chugging along while the rest increasingly stagnate. Well, if you’ve been looking to connect the dots, that [persistent slowing of demand for legal services](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/top-firms-build-bigger-gap-over-the-field-like-they-do-every-quarter/), here’s your culprit:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
51% of in-house legal teams report that more than half of their legal activities are now conducted internally. The biggest challenge in-house legal teams are trying to solve by bringing more legal services in-house is controlling costs, followed by completing tasks efficiently.

The [2017 In-House Legal Benchmarking Report](https://www.exterro.com/in-house-legal-benchmarking-report-2017/) from Exterro polled a number of in-house legal personnel about their business and found that everyone’s bringing more and more under the company tent as we’ve suspected for some time. And they’re doing it for the most obvious reason of all:

When asked why they brought more work in-house, they most frequently responded that it was because they could (they had built or expanded internal capacity and now were using it), to save money, or because better software had become available.

Because I can! Perhaps this could be phrased better than invoking the go to excuse of a toddlercaught reaching into a cookie jar, but this is a serious reason that spells trouble for Biglaw. While lawyers worry about AI building robot lawyers to displace attorneys — a fear that’s mostly overblown — the real technological threat to Biglaw is in easing once formidable legal processes to the point that in-house departments present a more cost-effective option than outsourcing. Legal holds and other document preservation tasks can be handled cheaper and more cost-effectively than ever by clients with the right tools. With clients reporting that they’ll be investing in more software solutions going forward, this inward flow of work shows no signs of stopping.

Where does that leave the outside counsel landscape?

And we suspect the likely outside winners will fit into two broad categories: those who can deliver standardized services efficiently, effectively, and at a very low cost, or at least lower than can be achieved internally; and those who deliver custom and specialized services — bespoke services — that only the rare corporation is likely to invest in developing itself.

Exactly what we’ve been seeing. The bigger, badder behemoths that can churn out work product and the elite brands that boast unique legal talent (or at least that clients believe to be unmatched) are winning the day. That obviously means that the top Am Law 200 firms see steady success, but it also presents a tremendous opportunity for small law firms, especially niche boutique firms, that can offer the bespoke services clients want without wasting money on the assembly line tasks that technology can move in-house. All the while, the rest of Biglaw starts to lose out on the grunt work that once covered the overhead.

At least there’s some good news for Biglaw:

Even though corporations seem to be bringing more work inside, they report moderate to strong satisfaction with the quality of outsourced legal work done for them. Twenty-one percent of respondents replied that they were “very satisfied” and another 48% said they were “somewhat satisfied.” Only 7% reporting being “somewhat dissatisfied,” and a slim 1% answered that they were “very dissatisfied.” When asked how providers of outsourced legal services could improve, corporations’ most frequent comments were that they could be less expensive and more responsive.

Well that’s nice. But somehow I think that 21 percent of satisfaction isn’t going to pay the bills for very long.

# Am Law 100 Firm Cuts Salaries, Eliminates Discretionary Bonuses

Just because it’s Friday doesn’t mean the Biglaw austerity measures have taken a break. After all, time is meaningless in a quarantine, so let’s just pile on with the COVID-19 cost-cutting measures, Friday (Zoom) happy hour be damned.

Anyway, the latest firm that’s looking to control their expenses as the coronavirus-inspired economic decline rages on is Mintz Levin. The firm — one that takes the [87th place](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=212&name=Mintz-Levin) in the latest Am Law 200 ranking — announced a series of reductions that all employees will face. Managing partner Robert Bodian said in the email ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/mintz-levin-cuts/2/)) that the firm’s priority is to maintain the health of the firm and keep everyone employed, but “[e]veryone will make some sacrifices.” The specific cuts vary on the employee’s position:

Associates, Of Counsel, Special Counsel and Practice Group Associates:
10% base pay cut.
No discretionary bonus (which would have been paid in June).
On-Track Associate and Of Counsel hours bonus will be paid in full.
Health insurance premium co-shares will not change.
No layoffs or furloughs (beyond ordinary course) are currently anticipated.

Patent Agents and Technical Specialists:
5% base pay cut.
No discretionary bonus (which would have been paid in June).
Health insurance premium co-shares will not change.
No layoffs or furloughs (beyond ordinary course) are currently anticipated.

Professional Staff:
5% base pay cut, subject to not falling below a $75k floor.
Base pay freeze – i.e., no merit or other increases this spring.
Overall discretionary bonus pool will be reduced by 50%.
Health insurance premium co-shares will not change.
The 401(k) match will be made for March but thereafter suspended.
No layoffs or furloughs (beyond ordinary course) are currently anticipated.

The partners are also shouldering their share of the financial burden. In a separate email ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/mintz-levin-cuts/2/)), Bodian shared that among the steps taken to reduce costs is increasing the equity partner holdback to 40 percent, and reducing partner draws by 5-10 percent.

Hopefully these measures mean no other cuts will be needed at Mintz Levin.

It’s a sign of the times… the omicron variant of COVID-19 is rearing its ugly head in pretty much every facet of life, and that includes Biglaw.

The uber-catchy variant of the coronavirus is making its way through, well, pretty much everyone, and ruining holiday plans in the process. And Biglaw firms are being forced to respond when their employees are stricken with the virus. At Fenwick, employees in not one, not two, but three different cities have tested positive for COVID. And in the New York office, some of the folks with the ‘Vid were in the office or in close contact with colleagues. As a result, the firm is closing the offices until at  least January 9th. You can read the firm’s email about the development below.

What has your firm announced as far as a revised reopening plan is concerned now that the omicron variant has arrived? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a new market standard for a return.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# This Top 30 Biglaw Firm Expects Lawyers To Work From The Office 'By Default'
## Lawyers really aren't happy about this.

With the unofficial start of summer now firmly in the rearview window, many Biglaw firms have already announced their return-to-office plans. While the majority of firms have leaned into the necessity of flexible work arrangements in a post-pandemic world, some are still hanging on to memories of the old days, where lawyers and staff members were expected to be at their desks, all day, every day, if possible. It seems like Paul Hastings — ranked at No. 27 on the most recent Am Law 100 with a 2020 gross revenue of $1,310,126,000 — is a firm that may fall into the latter category.

According to a memo sent late last week by chairman Seth Zachary and co-managing partners Greg Nitzkowski and Ronan O’Sullivan, the firm is encouraging all employees to find some time to voluntarily reacquaint themselves with office life this summer, because come September, it looks like office life will no longer be voluntary. Here’s an excerpt from that memo (emphasis added):

Beginning Tuesday, Sept. 7, all team members – both attorneys and staff – should be working from the office. We understand and respect the flexibility that individual circumstances will require. But, by default, we should work from the office when we are able. This return to office is as important for helping to nurture and strengthen our sense of culture, teamwork and collaboration as it is for serving clients at the highest levels.

While Paul Hastings isn’t specifically mandating a full-time return, how are people taking the news of being back in the office, “by default”? Not well. One of our sources had this to say about the firm’s plans: “I’m sure many of my colleagues will literally be giving notice with this as the stated reason.” Yikes.

Is the bark on this messaging worse than its bite? As noted by Zachary, Nitzkowski, and O’Sullivan, the firm “understand[s] and respect[s] the flexibility that individual circumstances will require.” If that’s the case, and some form of remote work is still on table at Paul Hastings, then perhaps there was a kinder, gentler way to communicate the firm’s back-to-office plans in a more effective way.

We’ve reached out to the firm for comment, but have yet to hear back.

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Paul Hastings.)

We are pleased to announce the release of our sixth annual ranking of the Top Outside Counsel in partnership with our friends at Lake Whillans. To compile this list of the nation’s top law firms, we turned to the folks who know best — the in-house lawyers who hire them.

ATL’s Outside Counsel Rankings are based not on deal volume, partner profits, or size of firm, but on the aspect most fundamental to a law firm’s business — what their clients think of them. This year, approximately 600 in-house lawyers shared their evaluations of their companies’ outside law firms.

The premise of our survey is simple and direct. We asked two questions: 1) “Which law firms does your company engage for legal services?” and 2) “Please indicate the highest level legal work for which your company will engage the particular firm(s).” The levels of work were defined along a four-point scale:

- Cost-efficient, bulk tasks
- Routine matters
- High-value, complex matters
- “Bet-the-company” matters
The ratings for each firm were averaged and the law firms with the highest average scores made it into our list of the Top Outside Counsel. Check out the results [here](https://abovethelaw.com/top-outside-counsel-rankings-2023/).

# DLA Piper Says Sexual Assault Accuser 'Orchestrated' Relationship With Former Partner
## The firm has a lot of thought about the allegations.

Vanina Guerrero

When a Biglaw firm is embroiled in a scandal involving sexual assault allegations, you kinda expect there to be a he said / she said tussle in public. But I’m not sure we expected the wild back and forth that’s gone down in the DLA Piper case that has been rocking the Biglaw world this month.

For those who may not be fluent in all the details, earlier this month, DLA Piper partner Vanina Guerrero released an open letter to the firm, and filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, [alleging that the co-managing partner of the Silicon Valley office, Louis Lehot, repeatedly sexually assaulted her after ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-fellow-partner/)she’d been recruited to the firm in 2018. She asked the firm to release her from their mandatory arbitration agreement so she can pursue her claims in court. The firm has been conspicuously silent on the forced arbitration agreement — despite the [attention their arbitration stance](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/kamala-harris-gets-dragged-into-dla-piper-sexual-assault-controversy/) in this case [has garnered](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/law-school-students-protest-outside-of-dla-piper-over-alleged-sexual-assault/), but, they did announce that Lehot had been [let go from the firm.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-out-amid-sexual-assault-allegations/) But the firm also put Guerrero on [administrative leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/now-the-dla-piper-accuser-has-been-put-on-leave/), saying they’d uncovered allegations against her unrelated to Lehot during their investigation of her claims. Lehot[ released a statement](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-speaks-out/) contesting the allegations against him and saying Guerrero was “exploiting” the #MeToo movement. Then a second woman, an anonymous HR manager, came forward with her own allegations against Lehot,[ saying he made her “physically afraid,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/second-woman-accuses-former-dla-piper-partner-of-inappropriate-behavior/?rf=1) and further alleging the firm let her go when she complained about Lehot. Then a third women, Leah Christensen, came forward with her own stories of [Lehot’s bullying and name calling.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/third-woman-with-allegations-against-former-dla-piper-partner-says-hes-a-bully-who-called-her-a-dumb-btch/)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now, in a newly filed 122-page response to the EEOC, DLA Piper alleges Guerrero “orchestrated” her relationship with Lehot to further her career:

Ms. Guerrero’s own emails show that she was not subject to abuse or assault by Mr. Lehot. In fact, dozens of emails and messages show that Ms. Guerrero was a willing participant in a lengthy emotional flirtation with Mr. Lehot that she orchestrated to advance her career.

As[ noted by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/10/29/dla-piper-says-partner-orchestrated-relationship-with-her-alleged-assaulter/), DLA Piper’s filing — penned by their attorneys at Gibson Dunn — included a stream of consciousness email Guerrero sent to herself using her DLA account. The email contains ruminations on her relationship with Lehot, containing thoughts like: “Louis: This man will help me / Control him: friendship w/o anything.” And: “Cannelize [sic] the energy – get me to where I need professionally,” and “Don’t open up to him / Leverage it for me…” The firm’s response also calls attention to what Guerrero didn’t say:

The Gibson Dunn attorneys note that the email, which is published in full, includes a number of other candid statements about her professional goals and references to her sexuality, and it does not describe Lehot as “abusive, bullying, or controlling”—in contrast to her EEOC claims.

As further evidence of what it characterizes as Guerrero’s duplicity, the Gibson Dunn team representing DLA Piper pointed to her omission of a March 2019 trip she took with Lehot to Machu Picchu from her EEOC charge and her other public statements.

The trip came after the fourth and final allegation of sexual assault, during which Guerrero claimed she made it clear to Lehot that she would never be in an “intimate relationship” with him, allegedly prompting Lehot to threaten her job, position at the firm and compensation, telling her “their working relationship would never be the same.”

The firm also counters the allegation Guerrero was retaliated against, saying Lehot and Guerrero disagreed over the optimal place to spend firm resources and the deal she was pulled off of was allegedly at the request of the client.

DLA Piper’s response also took aim at Leah Christensen, the ethics counsel who came forward in support of Guerrero’s claims. The firm says as Christensen was based in another office than Lehot, she wouldn’t know about Lehot’s alleged behavior. Additionally, given Christensen’s role at the firm, DLA Piper says her statements violated ethics rules:

“Christensen’s letter to this Commission, as well as her public statements, are in direct violation of her duty of confidentiality and her duty of loyalty, among other ethical and tortious transgressions,” the letter said.

Unsurprisingly, Guerrero’s attorney, Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor LLP, had something to say about the filing:

“DLA Piper, a global law firm, has managed to reach a new low in the how to smear women that speak out about sexual assault playbook—a low that even Harvey Weinstein, Bill O’Reilly and Matt Lauer did not reach.”

# Celebrating Champions Of Diversity And Inclusion In The Legal Profession

When it comes to diversity and inclusion in the legal profession, there’s good news and bad news. The bad news is that there’s [still so much work to be done](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/um-where-are-all-the-black-partners-at-these-biglaw-firms/). The good news is that the profession is now focused on that work — and leaders of the bar are taking it on.

Last Wednesday, I had the pleasure of attending the [Diversity and Inclusion Celebration Dinner](https://services.nycbar.org/EventDetail?EventKey=DIV062619) of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, where the organization bestowed its Diversity and Inclusion Champion Award upon two such leaders: [Juan Arteaga](https://www.crowell.com/Professionals/Juan-Arteaga), a partner at Crowell & Moring, and [Lisa Linsky](https://www.mwe.com/people/linsky-lisa-a/), a partner at McDermott Will & Emery (and, full disclosure, a longtime friend of mine). It was a beautiful and inspiring event — and it also served as a fundraiser for the [City Bar Fund](https://www.nycbar.org/serving-the-community/city-bar-fund), the Bar’s nonprofit arm that supports the legal profession in advancing social justice (including, but not limited to, diversity efforts).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
After welcoming remarks by [Deborah Martin Owens](https://www.nycbar.org/media-listing/media/detail/deborah-martin-owens-to-lead-diversity-efforts-at-city-bar), Executive Director of Diversity and Inclusion at the City Bar, and [Roger Juan Maldonado](https://www.sgrlaw.com/press-releases/sgr-partner-roger-juan-maldonado-elected-68th-president-of-new-york-city-bar-association/), President of the City Bar, the organization paid tribute to Justice [Rosalyn Richter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalyn_Richter) of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, First Department. Two members of the Committee to Enhance Diversity in the Profession, [Kathy Hirata Chin](https://www.crowell.com/Professionals/Kathy-Hirata-Chin) of Crowell & Moring and [Matthew Morningstar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-morningstar-5162084/) of Morgan Stanley, praised Justice Richter, outgoing co-chair of the Committee, for her tireless efforts to advance diversity in the profession. They noted that the past year has been a difficult one for Justice Richter — in September, she lost her wife, LGBTQ activist [Janet Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Weinberg) — but Justice Richter continued to work hard for the causes she cares about, including LGBTQ rights, diversifying the judiciary, and educating young people about law and the legal system.

Amid a standing ovation, Justice Richter took the stage. When she reached the podium, she joked about how long it took to make it up there in her walker — and thanked the City Bar for having a ramp leading up to the stage, without her even having to ask for it.

“I have the privilege of being an appellate judge, and so I now have the privilege of asking for things I was too scared to ask for as a young lawyer,” Justice Richter said. “We as a legal community need to stop having inaccessible events.”

Following presentations about the City Bar’s various [pipeline programs](https://www.nycbar.org/serving-the-community/diversity-and-inclusion/student-pipeline-programs) devoted to advancing diversity, the 2019 Diversity and Inclusion Champion Award was presented to — and enthusiastically accepted by — Juan Arteaga and Lisa Linsky. Both delivered heartfelt and eloquent remarks focused on different aspects of diversity and inclusion.

Arteaga focused on immigration. He has done extensive pro bono work in the field, representing immigrants, including battered women and their children, in immigration and deportation proceedings. He told the story of one such case.

In 2017, he was asked to help a family of undocumented immigrants from Colombia who are now living in the United States. The oldest son applied for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, while the family pursued asylum claims.

The son received notification that he needed to be fingerprinted as part of the DACA application process — and he was terrified, afraid that the fingerprinting could result in him being taken into custody and deported. After much discussion and deliberation with his family, the son decided to go in for the fingerprinting. Arteaga accompanied him on that day.

On the day of the appointment, the son hugged his father in a parking lot a few blocks away from the fingerprinting site (because his father was not joining his son for that appointment, and understandably so). The son was shaking with fear as he hugged his father and told him how much he loved him. Neither father nor son was certain that the son wouldn’t be taken into custody for eventual deportation when he went in for the fingerprinting.

In the end, the son, accompanied by Juan Arteaga, had his fingerprints taken without incident. But the more Arteaga reflected on the episode, the more sad and angry he became. Immigrants shouldn’t have to live in such fear — and they shouldn’t have to endure the deplorable conditions and treatment at the border that have dominated the headlines as of late.

When it comes to immigration, Arteaga said, “We need to advocate for the values and principles that brought us here this evening. Our resolution of the immigration debate will determine the kind of nation we become.”

In her acceptance speech, Lisa Linsky focused on LGBTQ rights — appropriately enough, given that the dinner took place just a few days before the 50th anniversary of the [Stonewall riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots) and the [WorldPride celebration](https://2019-worldpride-stonewall50.nycpride.org/history-news/a-global-celebration-arrives-in-new-york/) in New York. She talked about her work at McDermott as the first partner-in-charge of Firmwide Diversity and partner-in-charge of LGBT Diversity and Inclusion — which she viewed as of a piece with the work she did in the Westchester County District Attorney’s Office, as a prosecutor focused on sex crimes and child abuse. The common thread: advocating for people whose voices were not being heard.

Linsky did point out the progress made on LGBTQ equality in recent years. She noted that the dinner was taking place on a momentous date: June 26, the anniversary of both United States v. Windsor (2013), in which the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), in which the Court ruled in favor of nationwide marriage equality.

But she also urged everyone not to become complacent. Just as electing an African-American president didn’t mark the end of racism, the advent of marriage equality didn’t mark the end of discrimination against the LGBTQ community. Instead, Linsky said, “We must continuing naming — and resisting — the ways in which people continue to be excluded and oppressed.”

The evening concluded with remarks from [Letitia “Tish” James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James), the 67th Attorney General of the State of New York, as well as the first African-American and first woman to be elected to the position. She began by invoking the now-infamous AP [photograph](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/reader-center/rio-grande-migrants-photo.html) of two migrants, a father and his young daughter, who drowned in the Rio Grande while trying to enter the United States.

“Caging individuals and separating families is not an immigration policy,” she said. “It is man’s inhumanity to man.”

James then turned to the Census case, [Department of Commerce v. New York](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/department-of-commerce-v-new-york/) — which her office litigated, and which the Supreme Court was going to rule on the next day.

“Let’s hope the justices get it right,” she said. “Let’s hope they recognize the proposition that in this country, everyone should be counted.”

I billed well over the minimum for bonus (2400+) and got $10k over market.

[R]eceived full Cravath scale despite some extenuating circumstances that caused me to miss hours. Very happy.

The coronavirus crisis has wreaked havoc upon the legal profession, leading some firms to cut salaries, furlough employees, and even conduct layoffs. Several months have now passed, and many firms have started to partially or completely roll back their austerity measures. But what happens if things get worse?

What if things go the way they did during the last recession? Will incoming first-year associates suddenly find themselves without jobs? Will offers be rescinded like they were in 2009?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This is the question that’s on everyone’s minds, considering start dates have already been deferred. With worries abound, industry observers are here to offer some support and some calming words of comfort. They don’t think there’s anything for first-year associates to worry about; the chances of a 2009 repeat performance are “extremely remote.” From the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/25/what-are-the-chances-of-first-year-associate-cancellations/):

“Those were different times. I’m not seeing that firms are in that kind of financial distress,” said Joan Newman, an executive coach at Joan Newman & Associates, who works with big-firm partners and senior associates.

“Some areas are busier than others, but it’s not all gloom and doom like it was in 2009,” said Newman, who worked with laid-off Big Law associates in 2009 to find other positions. “M&A is down but litigation is starting back up again and labor and employment law is booming.”

A leader of a national law firm echoed these thoughts, saying “it’s highly unlikely that anyone will further push back deferrals or cut the class.”

Some incoming Biglaw associates may have reason to be concerned — they’ve heard nothing from their firms regarding their start dates. Is something like this going on at your firm? Please get in touch with us via email or text — [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or (646) 820-8477) — and we’ll try to get to the bottom of it for you.

Keep your fingers crossed that nothing changes. We’d hate to see yet another lost generation of lawyers left behind by Biglaw.

David Kramer

I hope they take his law license and throw him in jail.

— Stephen C. Sieber, president of Song Fi, [speaking with Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/875309/google-atty-s-shouting-match-prompts-removal-bid) about Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati partner [David Kramer](https://www.wsgr.com/WSGR/DBIndex.aspx?SectionName=attorneys/BIOS/2736.htm). Sieber’s company is suing Google, represented by Kramer and WSGR. Sieber alleges he had a verbal altercation with Kramer before a hearing in which Kramer called him a “scumbag” and was “highly arrogant and insulting” and refused to shake hands with him. Song Fi has asked the court to remove Kramer from the case. A Wilson Sonsini rep has said the motion for sanctions is baseless.

# Biglaw Circles The Wagons, Say One Of Their Own Doesn't Deserve Jail Time Despite Felony Conviction
## His lawyers argue he's been punished enough.

Evan Greebel and Martin Shkreli

If you’re the type of person who keeps up with Biglaw gossip, then you’ve surely heard the name [Evan Greebel](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/evan-greebel/) before. He’s the former partner at both Katten Muchin — where he worked for more than a decade — and Kaye Scholer who was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The conviction stems from his work with infamous pharma bro, Martin Shkreli. Greebel was outside counsel for pharmaceutical company Retrophin from 2012 to 2014. During that time, prosecutors alleged Greebel assisted Shkreli in using Retrophin’s assets to pay investors in unrelated hedge funds run by Shkreli through the use of phony settlement and consulting agreements and fraudulently backdating agreements.

Now sentencing time is rolling around — scheduled for August 9th — and Greebel faces [up to 20 years in prison](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/former-biglaw-partner-faces-up-to-20-years-in-prison-for-fraudulent-scheme/?rf=1). But his lawyers — he’s repped by Gibson Dunn — have submitted a sentencing memo asking Judge Kiyo Matsumoto for no jail time. Attached to the memo are some 180 letters asking for leniency, and quite a few from Greebel’s former Biglaw partners.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
One such former partner, Murray Schwartz, now a partner at Warshaw Burstein and a former village justice in New York, [as reported by Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/07/17/evan-greebel-shouldnt-go-to-jail-his-former-law-partners-say/) laid the blame for Greebel’s legal woes at Shkreli’s feet, not an [unfamiliar strategy for the defense](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/ex-biglaw-partner-and-former-client-go-at-it-in-criminal-case/):

“Evan Greebel had a terrible encounter with the devil incarnate and sadly the devil often wins,” Schwartz wrote, apparently referring to Greebel’s ties to Shkreli. “As a sitting judge, I used to divide mentally those defendants who would hurt someone from those that would not. Evan will not hurt a soul.”

Troy Foster, partner at Perkins Coie and former colleague of Greebel’s, agrees the pharma bro should shoulder the responsibility:

“I know well the pressures to perform in the setting of a large private law firm,” said Foster, who was a summer associate with Greebel at Fried Frank. “We have to trust that our partners in specialized practice areas are giving sound guidance. … And, most importantly we need to trust our clients to give us accurate information and conduct themselves in accordance with the standards of basic decency. Evan’s client apparently failed on every count, and the resulting fiasco swept Evan up into this case.”

While Elan Keller, a former partner of Greebel who is now at Reed Smith,  pointed to past instances of Greebel’s legal ethics to argue he shouldn’t serve any time in jail:

Keller, in his own letter, explained that Greebel turned down a prospective client proposing a tax structure that wouldn’t pass muster. “Evan showed professional responsibility and integrity (and a lack of disappointment) even when faced with losing out on getting credit and attribution for substantial fees from a prospective client,” Keller said.

His lawyers pointed to Greebel’s “shattered” career and life — he’s been disbarred and is unlikely to be able to practice law again — as well as his “dire” financial straights to contend that he’s been adequately punished and should not serve jail time:

But unemployed since 2016 and tasked with mounting a defense in a criminal trial, “his financial situation is—and will likely remain—dire,” his attorneys said, noting a presentencing report that said he has “a contingent liability of several million dollars to the insurance company which paid for his legal defense.”

If only all non-violent offenders were able to mount such compelling arguments against their incarceration.

# NY To $180K: Another Big New York Firm Matches Cravath
## When it rains cash in Biglaw, it pours! Another large New York firm has matched the Cravath scale.

When cash begins to rain down from the heavens above Biglaw firms, it always pours. More firms are falling in line with the new Cravath salary scale. Earlier today, we saw our first [major match from Milbank Tweed](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-first-major-match/), and now another New York powerhouse has anted up beaucoup bucks for its associates.

Paul Weiss, a firm with almost one thousand lawyers and more than $1 billion in annual revenue, has matched the [Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1).

This isn’t surprising news. During Biglaw’s last bonus season, Paul Weiss matched Cravath [within three hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-second-firm-falls-in-line/). In fact, according to a source, Brad Karp, the firm’s managing partner, said Paul Weiss [will always match market](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-second-firm-falls-in-line/), but never set it. In his [memo to associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-another-big-new-york-firm-matches-cravath/2/), Karp said the move was “in keeping with our commitment that the compensation of our attorneys be at the top of the market.”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Here’s something worth noting: incoming members of the Paul Weiss class of 2016 are also being bumped up to the $180K salary scale. That’s great news for recent law school graduates with loads of debt that needs to be paid off. How exciting!

Congrats to all Paul Weiss associates on your brand new salaries!

UPDATE (3:00 p.m.): A tipster points out that Paul Weiss is technically beating the market, at least for the classes of 2007 and beyond. Note that in the memo provided on the next page that Paul Weiss provides an extra $10,000 to lawyers in years 2007 and senior, for a salary of $325,000. We acknowledge that compensation for the classes of 2007 and senior is discretionary at most firms, but we can’t help but wonder if other firms will state a salary figure for these classes as well in future Cravath matches.

# Biglaw's Starting A Talent War In Miami
## The lateral market is heating up in the Magic City.

“We’re starting to see a flight to quality. We have a new breed of firms in Miami, and you always want to play for the Yankees. If you have an opportunity to move up the food chain, a lot of people want to take that.”

— Florida legal recruiter Josh Dull [spoke to Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/miamis-new-breed-of-law-firms-spurs-fresh-recruiting-battle) about the booming Miami legal market. A number of Biglaw firms — Quinn Emanuel, Kirkland, Sidley, King & Spalding, Winston & Strawn — have all recently decided to expand their footprints in the city. These mega players in the market are luring talent away from local firms and a talent war is afoot. He continued, “I don’t think Miami will ever replace Wall Street. That’s ludicrous for anyone to think. But companies are moving here; talent’s moving here. It’s going to be fun to watch.”

# Am Law 50 Firm Lays Off 4 Percent Of Its Global Workforce
## That's more than 100 lawyers and staff.

As with all things in Biglaw as of late, with good news tends to come some pretty godawful news. As firms work to become leaner through these tough times, lawyers and staff members may unexpectedly find themselves on the unemployment line. Hot on the heels of announcing the [reversal of its COVID-19 austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/am-law-50-firm-completely-reverses-its-pay-cuts-announces-some-bonus-news/), news of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner’s global layoffs has come to light.

As part of a business review called “Project Advance,” Bryan Cave has not only reorganized and combined some of its practice groups and appointed leaders for its three new primary global businesses (corporate and finance transactions; real estate; litigation and investigations), but the firm has also conducted a swath of layoffs. As reported by Law.com International, BCLP has laid off about 4 percent of its global workforce — which means that an estimated 118 lawyers and staff have been let go.

BCLP co-chairs Lisa Mayhew and Steve Baumer said in the statement: “Project Advance will further transform and elevate how we serve our clients, laying the foundation for our next phase of growth internationally. This is a multi-year strategy to further extend BCLP’s leadership around real estate as an asset class, corporate and finance transactions, and litigation and investigations, where we see significant growth opportunities for BCLP.”

Biglaw firms continue to roll out worthy initiatives when it comes to showing just how important diversity and inclusion are to the future of the legal profession. We’ve previously acknowledged [Dorsey & Whitney](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/biglaw-firm-introduces-diversity-hours-that-count-toward-associate-billable-requirements/), [Hogan Lovells](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/care-about-biglaw-diversity-well-now-you-can-bill-for-it/), and [Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/01/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-offer-billable-diversity-hours-for-all-timekeepers/) as firms where approved diversity and inclusion-related work will be billable for attorneys and will count toward bonus thresholds. We’ve just received word that another leading law firm has had a successful program like this that’s been operating quietly under the radar for almost a year, but now it’s time time to show them some praise.

Cooley — the firm that introduced [special appreciation bonuses for associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/) and sits at #23 in the latest Am Law 100 rankings — rolled out its diversity and inclusion billable hours credit program on February 21, 2020 in a memo to all associates, technical advisors, and patent agents. Anyone working in one of those roles at the firm will receive up to 50 hours of billable credit for qualified activities that will count toward their productivity and bonus eligibility.

Here are the broad categories that are eligible for D&I billable credit at Cooley:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
• Diversity committee and women’s initiative leadership – time spent carrying out responsibilities of committee leaders

• Affinity group leadership – time spent carrying out responsibilities of affinity group leadership, including drafting communications, planning events, leading calls and running initiatives

• Internal diversity mentoring and sponsorship – participation in formal Cooley diversity mentorship programs, including affinity group pairings, reverse mentoring, leave liaisons and sponsorship programs

• Law school relationships – representing the firm at law school diversity events and job fairs, participating in minority student organization panels and events and mentoring underrepresented law students

• Pipeline and closing efforts – outreach before or after a diverse candidate interview in an effort to attract them to Cooley, time spent managing the 1L Diversity Fellowship pipeline, and establishing recruiting relationships with candidates of diverse backgrounds

• Client partnerships – participation in client diversity programs, including Google’s diversity mentor program

• Other activities approved in advance by the director of diversity & inclusion

Congratulations to Cooley on its commitment to diversity, and for offering its attorneys and other timekeepers a way to create a more inclusive workplace.

# That Special Time Of Year Where We All Remember How To Spell 'Bockius'
## Third name on the letterhead blues...

When I had my campus interview with Morgan Lewis, the interviewer asked me to spell “Bockius.” Didn’t see that one coming.

There’s a certain tragedy in being too far down the letterhead. After a career working your way all the the way to seeing your name on the door, you’re usually doomed by marketing to become the answer to a trivia question. For the record, Morris Rex Bockius joined the firm as a first-year associate in 1883 and ultimately ran the joint until 1939. So let’s put the appropriate respect on that.

Anyway, Morgan Lewis… and Bockius announced bonuses on Friday. The number 10 ranked Am Law firm with $2,577,700,000 in gross revenue last year delivers the news via voicemail as opposed to memo, but we’ve been informed that it is matching the market as defined by peer firms. So…

 

Class	Bonus
Class of 2022	$15K (pro-rated)
Class of 2021	$20K
Class of 2020	$30K
Class of 2019	$57.5K
Class of 2018	$75K
Class of 2017	$90K
Class of 2016	$105K
Given the lack of a memo, it’s not clear if the firm is joining the clutch of firms offering $115K to the class of 2015 and senior or if those folks will be getting individualized bonuses. We’ll update as we get that nailed down.

The firm requires associates post 1900+ billable hours with an additional caveat that 20 of which had to be pro bono hours. Bonuses will be paid on January 31, 2023.

Congrats on making Morris Bockius proud.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Am Law 50 Firm Offers Voluntary Deferral To Incoming Associates Until Fall 2021
## Will this become a trend among Biglaw firms?

Thanks to the coronavirus crisis, the legal landscape for Biglaw firms seemed a little rocky for a few months, leading incoming associates to grow worried about their future careers — and rightly so. Amid salary cuts, furloughs, and stealth or outright layoffs, first-year start dates were delayed at many firms until January 2021 and beyond. Were we witnessing a repeat of what happened during the Great Recession? Would another year of law school graduates become a lost generation due to the economic turmoil that rocked the legal world? Outcomes are looking a little rosier now, with salary cuts being walked back and furloughed staff and associates returning to work, but perhaps incoming associates shouldn’t get too comfortable just yet.

Why’s that? The deferral year is making a comeback.

Back in 2009, when Biglaw firms were faced with the problem of too many employees and not enough work, they came up with a unique plan to deal with this issue: the deferral. Incoming first-year associates were offered the chance to voluntarily take a year off and receive compensation for going away with the understanding that they would be able to come back to the firm and resume their Biglaw careers after the deferral. While many sought refuge in the public sector, others focused on having fun and taking trips around the world. Unfortunately, even the best laid plans fall apart, and some associates weren’t welcomed back to their firms on time — or at all, ever.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Ropes & Gray — a firm that landed at No. 13 in the 2020 Am Law 100 rankings, having brought in $1,903,616,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — announced two new deferral programs for first-years earlier this week. Ropes is the first major firm that we know of to offer a voluntary deferral year to its incoming associates.

A memo (available in full on the next page) sent on behalf of [Peter Erichsen](https://www.ropesgray.com/en/biographies/e/peter-c-erichsen), the firm’s hiring partner, explains the reasoning behind why these programs are being offered:

This year has truly been one like no other, and we certainly would understand if its developments has prompted a temporary rethinking of your professional priorities. Perhaps you are looking for ways to contribute your knowledge, talent and time to public service work in a variety of areas—fighting racial injustice, addressing housing crises and other needs arising out of the COVID pandemic, or supporting political causes important to you, to name just a few. Alternatively, some of you may have been personally affected by the pandemic in ways you did not anticipate, and could benefit from taking some time off before launching your career.

Incoming Ropes associates have the option of taking either a fellowship year or a sabbatical year, with the promise of joining the class of 2021 when those associates start at the firm. The firm emphasizes repeatedly that these programs are voluntary.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
For those who choose a fellowship year, they’ll have to find another job — during a pandemic — at a public interest organization or at an approved government entity, and will receive a stipend of $80,000 (pre-tax). For those who choose a sabbatical year, they can do anything they want (except work at another law firm), and will receive a stipend of 20 percent of their starting base pay, or $38,800 (pre-tax). Like all of the firm’s associates whose start dates have been delayed, first-years who opt for a deferral will also be eligible for health insurance through the firm starting on October 20, 2020. Those who take a deferral year will still receive a $10,000 October stipend and will remain eligible for a $10,000 loan from the firm.

This all sounds great, but there’s just one catch: incoming associates need to make a decision by October 1. We reached out to Ropes & Gray for comment and received this statement from a firm spokesman, who again reiterated that those who choose not to participate in the voluntary deferral will start as planned in January 2021:

The firm is healthy and the business is strong. Our lawyer activity levels are on pace with 2019, which was an outstanding year. As an example, our asset management and capital markets groups have remained busy throughout the year, and the health care and life sciences groups have been going gangbusters. We’ve also seen M&A activity pick up meaningfully in the third quarter.

We have no plans for any actions like furloughs or layoffs. Associates were reassured of this just today in a Town Hall meeting.

The fellowship is completely voluntary. We recognized that in the current climate, some people might want to switch gears and focus on public service, and the program is designed to help them do that. We have heard from some associates that this is something they have been wanting to do; and we have heard from public service organizations that they need help.  We know there is a need for help in our communities, and this is one way our lawyers can contribute.

We got positive feedback from our current associates who appreciate the opportunity, and we wanted to make the same option available to incoming associates.  (To clarify, the fellowship program is offered to current associates, too.)

Good luck to incoming associates at Ropes & Gray who choose to embark upon a voluntary year-long deferral. Let’s hope it all works out for the best.

If your law firm planning to offer deferrals to incoming associates? Please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Deferrals) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Deferrals”) and let us know.

* If you’re interested in learning what junior partners are making at Williams and Connolly, look no further than Fourth Circuit nominee Allison Jones Rushing’s financial disclosure form. The [2007 Duke Law graduate](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/08/trumps-latest-circuit-nominee-graduated-law-school-in-2007/?rf=1) pulled in more than $650K during her first year as a partner at the firm.

* This ex-Foley & Lardner partner “should have known better” than to backdate documents, paste his clients’ signatures onto them, and mislead the IRS during an audit, so he’s been suspended from practicing law for two years.

Mid-August is almost upon us, and from what we hear, many, many students will be going back to law school in a few weeks with images of crisp hundred dollar bills dancing around in their heads and fantasies of quickly paying off their student loans running rampant through their minds. Despite worries that Biglaw’s new salary scale may be keeping some firms from making offers to 100 percent of their summer classes, offer rates seem to be sky high.

How many incoming associates at your firm will soon be cashing in on those extravagant $180K paychecks? We’ve got some information that’ll help you answer that question.

Following up on yesterday’s post on [Biglaw offer rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/summer-associate-offer-rates-2016-which-firms-had-100-percent-offer-rates/), here are more firms that have given offers to all of their summer associates (grouped by city and in alphabetical order):

If you have corrections to the list — i.e., an office listed above that does NOT belong on the 100 percent list — email us at [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rate%20Correction), or text us at 646-820-8477.

If you have additions to this list, please note them in an [email to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Summer%20Associate%20Offer%20Rates). Right now, it’s more newsworthy if a firm does NOT have a 100 percent offer rate than if it does.

On that note, please let us hear about firms that are NOT issuing offers to all their summer associates. If you know of a firm or an office with an unusually low offer rate — which we will arbitrarily define here as something under 66 percent, or two-thirds — please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Offer%20Rate) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Offer Rate”). For example, we’ve heard some rumblings about a low offer rate at a certain firm’s Chicago office (a firm with a 100 percent offer rate in another city), as well as a low offer rate paired with cold offers at another firm’s Washington, D.C. office. If we hear more on this firm, or any others with low offer rates, we will investigate and perhaps write a story.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Basic economic uncertainties that are causing the anxiety in leaders of law firms are still there. It seems to me that this is kind of a continuation of what we’ve seen for the last several weeks. There hasn’t been anything dramatic that’s turned it around, so I think we’re still kind of in a wait-and-see environment. Obviously some sectors are doing better than others, but I don’t think we’ve had anything like an across-the-board recovery at this point.

— Jim Jones, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Center for the Study of the Legal Profession, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/03/kirklands-latest-cuts-targeted-even-busy-associates/) on the latest round of [stealth layoffs at Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/stealth-layoffs-strike-once-again-at-worlds-wealthiest-biglaw-firm/). Jones said he’s “not surprised” that layoffs have continued into the second quarter of 2023, especially in California’s tech sector (a state where some of Kirkland’s cuts took place).

# Kirkland's NOT Giving Special Bonuses (And Associates Are Salty About It)

Yikes. I can understand a firm’s inclination to be transparent with associates, but you have to wonder if it would be better to say nothing at all. And for those associates who thought working for — far and away — the richest Biglaw firm meant of course you’d get market bonuses? Lolololol. COVID makes fools of us all.

So what exactly happened?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Last night, Kirkland & Ellis sent around a message indicating that yes, they are aware that fall bonuses are making their way through Biglaw, but no, you should not expect them. The firm acknowledged the discrepancy between top of the market and what they’re doing and said they’d take the market into account during year-end bonus time, but made no clear commitment.

Read the memo for yourself:

Disappointing, since hours did not slow down for Covid, but apparently comp did.

Associates are livid. Despite the general lack of transparency, we were told that our office was up 20% year on year. What a slap in the face to everyone who’s been grinding all year under difficult conditions.

The email doesn’t contain a commitment to true us up, it’s just an anodyne statement that they’ll take them “into account.” What garbage. These cheapskates have been talking for months about how the firm is having a banner year (for instance, the funds group is apparently on track to have a billion dollars of revenue on its own), but they can’t share it with associates.

I’m a senior associate at K&E. I think that what they’re going to do here is roll it into the year-end bonus, then use it as an opportunity to scrimp. So where in years past the average bonus was 1.25x (I snuck a pic of the powerpoint last year and I’m pretty sure that’s what the average was, but I can’t find it now), now they’ll be able to lower it to 1.15x but make it look ok because they’re aggregating it with the year-end bonus. And of course people with below-class ratings are going to get the shaft and they won’t compute them into the statistics about what’s “average”. This is a complete money grab, but exactly what I’d expect from the partnership here.

If you forward the email on your phone, you can see that they were tweaking the “and we intend to be so again this year” phrasing. Like, these guys were definitely on a Zoom call together trying to figure out how to polish this turd without making any true commitments.

Morale is NOT GREAT.

Another K&E person chiming in to describe the mood among my friends as FUCKING IRATE. I like the firm and generally drink the koolaid, but the fact that they call themselves compensation leaders twice in the “sry no bonus” email is ridiculous. Please vote us down in Vault.”

KE associate checking in — they said they would consider fall bonuses when determining December bonuses. But still. Bullshit. Lots of people will just get screwed given the individualized system we have. This is also a fuck you move because it’s pretty clearly a signal to other firms that the KE partners don’t want them to match. Just like Covington’s lame attempt to stop the salary raises a few years ago. Shame.

I am not in restructuring, but I can only imagine how pissed those guys have got to be during this insane year.

This is a slap in the face for associates at the world’s #1 grossing law firm.

So there you go, associates are deeply upset with this development. And remember, traditionally, the firm prides itself on above market — albeit individualized — bonuses. So, whatever numbers (which will be difficult to compare since you know, individualized) the firm comes up with at the end of the year, there’s a pretty good chance that, overall, they won’t be as generous as last year. At least that’s what insiders think; we’ll see what happens come December.

So what do you think? Is this a sign to other firms not to match? Will Kirkland competitors shower their associates with special bonuses? Is there blood in the water? Will Kirkland be able to keep its perch as the richest Biglaw firm? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Kirkland), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)).

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Mainspring Legal. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

At Mainspring Legal — as a friendly reminder, consisting of three divisions: Lateral Link (law firm), Cadence Counsel (in-house), and Bridgeline Solutions (compliance and staffing) — we certainly stay up-to-speed on hiring trends, and in fact, maneuver our fair share of the market moves.

Here is a list of the significant attorneys moves made just over the prior two-week period:

How many did you name?  I think even spotting a dozen places you above the curve.

Over the past 10 years, the Mainspring Legal team of experienced attorney recruiters has successfully placed thousands of attorneys with law firm and in-house clients ranging from Am Law 200 firms and Fortune 500 companies to specialty and boutique firms worldwide.

We leverage our deep market knowledge and relationships with decision makers to make value-added placements in major markets across the United States and Asia, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C., Shanghai, Hong Kong, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, and Miami, just to name a few.

And because we are graduates of top law schools and former practicing attorneys ourselves, we understand what it takes to land your dream job.

Our process is simple.  By having more information about you, we can direct the right opportunities your way. So instead of receiving cold calls from recruiters about jobs you may not want, we will only approach you with opportunities that match your preferences.

Although we maintain a database of thousands of jobs, the majority of which are not public, we’re not a job board. Our recruiters work hard to source the best opportunities tailored for your unique interests. That means, the more we know about you and your preferences, the better equipped we are to meet your expectations. Rest assured that we would NEVER share your information with a third party. We’re excited to start working with you.

Start now by creating a profile with us here:

[https://my.mainspringlegal.com/register](https://my.mainspringlegal.com/register)

After registering, we’ll match your profile with our database of 3,000 jobs — 50% of which are not public — and you can always update your profile so we will keep track of your interest level, preferences, and requirements. Your information is always kept confidential, and will never submit your resume for a position without your express consent.

If you are working on your own, or even with another legal recruiting firm, to find your next job, a good question to ask is why not consult our team at Mainspring Legal to makes sure you are covering all bases?

[Lateral Link](http://laterallink.com/) is one of the top-rated international legal recruiting firms.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# When 'That’s the Way We’ve Always Done It' Doesn’t Cut It Any More
## Ever been in a situation like that?

We have all encountered the situation where colleagues are hired in or promoted, more money, more title, whatever, and there’s dismay about the hire or promotion, given that those promoted seem to lack the necessary skills to justify it. The reaction is often, “Wait, what? Why him and not me or someone else equally qualified?”

The “[escalation of commitment](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/commitment-bias/)” theory explains that people cling to ideas, things, even people, that didn’t work in the past, and yet, they refuse to let go. Ever been in a situation like that? I thought so.

Why are people so reluctant to admit that a choice was not the right one? Having worked in a corporate environment for many years, I think that management didn’t want to admit that the choice was wrong from the get-go; it was akin to throwing good money after bad. It was the “sunk costs fallacy,” that by spending more money, it’ll all work out. Not.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Management wanted its choice or choices to work out, to succeed, and so they continued down the path of bad decisions. Blinders were on while trying to save face, rather than (gasp) admit that a mistake was made. It was a bad hire, a bad promotion, whatever. (As an aside, as the employment lawyer, it was then my job to clean up after it all. Other employment lawyers will nod in agreement.)

The belief that it’ll all work out is belief in the tooth fairy. The escalation of commitment only leads to more grief and aggravation for all and potential liability. Duke University professor and author of several books, including “[Predictably Irrational](https://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions-ebook/dp/B002C949KE/ref=sr_1_1?crid=DFTDUGSZ2LJM&dchild=1&keywords=dan+ariely+predictably+irrational&qid=1622681105&s=books&sprefix=dan+ariel%2Caps%2C238&sr=1-1),” [Dan Ariely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ariely), has a good analogy: Do you rip the Band-Aid off in one fell swoop (more painful but faster) or more slowly (less pain but longer)?

Lawyers tell clients that they have a slam-dunk winner and if they can just hold on a little longer victory will be theirs. So, what the lawyer has done is to overpromise and underdeliver, a variation of the escalation of commitment theory. Just make sure your [malpractice insurance premium](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/professional-liability/legal-malpractice-claims-on-the-rise--study-222992.aspx) is paid up.

Years ago, I had a two-session mediation in which a single plaintiff alleged various forms of discrimination. The defendant offered resolution in the low six figures, which I thought was a fair offer given the facts and circumstances. The case didn’t settle; it went to trial and the plaintiff was defensed on all theories in less than an hour. Escalation of commitment to the losing case? Greed? You tell me.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I just started reading [Adam Grant’s latest book](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Again-Power-Knowing-What-ebook/dp/B08H177WQP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=think+again&qid=1622568129&s=books&sr=1-1), “Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know.” We rush to judgment in so many ways. I saw this again and again as an advocate, and I see it now as a mediator. And we see it today in everything and everyone around us.

Grant says we get stuck in the mud of repetitive thinking and can’t extricate ourselves to think again, about how we might do things differently. He provides one example of the CEO who created the BlackBerry (late lamented, at least to me) and was so stubborn that he was unable to see the value in restyling the BlackBerry to compete with the iPhone. The CEO dismissed the idea that people wanted more than a wireless device for work; he didn’t see that people could want handheld entertainment as well. Grant says this is Exhibit A for the refusal to change one’s mind to consider possibilities beyond the present. As Grant says, “If you lack the motivation to change your mind, you miss many occasions to think again.”

Two kinds of biases are at play here, Grant says. The first is the confirmation bias, the expectation that things are true as we see them. The other is the desirability bias, that we see things as we want them to be. Most, if not all, clients have one or both biases, which can make it difficult to persuade them to see other points of view.

Thinking again can be applied to the dinosaur-newbie lawyer dynamic. There are four phrases to this dynamic: anathema to the dinosaur and change killers to the newbie. How many times has a newer lawyer suggested a different approach, a different way of thinking about a case or a client only to be shot down by a senior lawyer. He spouts one or more of the following:

- “That will never work here.”
- “It’s not what my experience has shown.”
- “That’s too complicated, let’s not overthink it.”
- And my personal favorite: “That’s the way we’ve always done it.”

Sound familiar to the frustrated newer lawyer who is trying to persuade the dinosaur to think differently or to implement changes that will make the practice run more efficiently and economically?

There’s a lesson here for all of us: our knowledge blinds us to what we don’t know. Our judgments often close our minds instead of opening them. Overconfidence is always fatal. Take a risk, understand the limits of your knowledge (hard for lawyers to do), and think again.

# More Departures From The K&L Gates; Do They Matter?
## Departures at K&L Gates are nothing new, but this time around they include members of firm leadership.

A new year, a new set of partner departures from [K&L Gates](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/kl-gates/). Hand-wringing over partners leaving the firm has been going on for years — since [at least 2012](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/partners-streaming-out-of-the-kl-gates/), by our count — and the firm keeps on trucking. So some might dismiss this as a non-story, perhaps fueled by disgruntled ex-lawyers.

But maybe this time is different? The latest defections include prominent rainmakers and members of K&L Gates leadership, as Casey Sullivan of Bloomberg BNA [reports](https://bol.bna.com/at-kl-gates-partners-exit-and-the-king-is-silent/):

Last year it looked like K&L Gates had sustained what could be a significant and potentially course-altering round of departures, but the firm’s outspoken chair Peter Kalis was quick to note that the turnover was ordinary business as non-equity partners departed after some targeted performance evaluations….

During the past five days, however – from Friday to Tuesday – a new round of exits have hit, and this time, the departures include practice leaders and executive committee members.

On Friday, [five partners announced](https://bol.bna.com/a-rough-day-for-kl-gates-separate-groups-in-chicago-and-d-c-jump-to-rivals/) they would join Mayer Brown’s financial services, regulatory and enforcement group in Washington, D.C., while [four partners said](https://bol.bna.com/a-rough-day-for-kl-gates-separate-groups-in-chicago-and-d-c-jump-to-rivals/) they would join Morgan Lewis & Bockius’ intellectual property group in Chicago.

The five partners making their way to Mayer are Steven Kaplan, Laurence Platt, Phillip Schulman, Melanie Brody, and Jonathan Jaffe. Kaplan and Platt served as leaders of the financial services practice group and members of the management committee while at K&L Gates. An ATL tipster told us that the group’s book of business goes well into the eight figures and was “one of the premier practices in the firm.”

The four partners moseying to Morgan Lewis are Michael Abernathy, Sanjay Murthy, Amanda Williamson, and Christopher Betti. Abernathy was global co-practice leader of K&L Gates’s IP group and a management committee member. One ATL source estimated his book of business at around $10 million (and added that he “was one of the IP partners who forced the [merger between Bell Boyd and K&L](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/01/law-firm-merger-mania-kl-gates-and-bell-boyd-merge/) in 2008 by threatening to leave Bell Boyd just as the Great Recession was taking its fiercest toll”).

UPDATE (3/3/2016, 1:00 p.m.): A source claims that Abernathy’s book of business is much larger than $10 million, more like in the tens (yes that’s plural) of millions.

These Friday defections were followed by additional losses [this week](https://bol.bna.com/at-kl-gates-partners-exit-and-the-king-is-silent/):

And on Monday, news spread throughout the legal community that more departures were in store. Susan Hollander, the Palo Alto-based head of the firm’s trademark practice, [has joined Venable](https://bol.bna.com/kl-gates-trademark-leader-joins-venable/) with two colleagues: counsel Jocelyn Belloni and associate Sharoni Finkelstein, while other possible departures in the firm’s Chicago and Washington, D.C. offices have been rumored but not yet confirmed.

Where might we see more defections? We’ve heard rumblings about the financial institution group and “heavy hitters in investment management,” with a focus on the Chicago, D.C., and Boston offices.

The Chicago offices, which experienced the big departures last week, could lose more lawyers before this is all over. As one tipster told us:

K&L Chicago has been a hot mess since it was Bell Boyd & Lloyd. There are a handful of boomer partners with big books, and the other partners are basically service partners. This office is [in serious trouble], though they don’t seem to have run out of Kool-Aid yet.

Kalis and K&L Gates declined to comment to Bloomberg BNA; we reached out to them too and received the same response. I wouldn’t be surprised, however, to see a feisty firm-wide memo from Kalis sometime this week or next. That’s just how he rolls (and [rolls over the haters](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/everything-is-great-kl-states-peter-kalis-comes-out-swinging/)).

Look, it’s Biglaw; partners come and partners go. Even the thriving firm of Kirkland & Ellis has seen a lot of defections lately (and just [extended the notice period for departing partners](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202751047346/Amid-Defections-Kirkland-Extends-Notice-Period-for-Departing-Partners) in apparent response).

But still, these latest lawyer losses at K&L Gates do seem more significant than usual. If you have information or insight to share, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=K%20and%20L%20Gates) or text us (646-820-8477).

UPDATE (3/3/2016, 1:00 p.m.): Two points. First, from a K&L Gates client: “I can confirm that at least two of our primary attorney contacts at K&L have left. Based on the response we received from another associate, the departure was swift, with little backup planning for their caseload and lingering client questions.”

Second, the Legal Intelligencer [just reported](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202751162101/KL-Gates-Sees-Revenue-Fall-7-Percent-PPP-Rise-53-Percent?back=TAL08&kw=The%20Am%20Law%20100:%20K%26L%20Gates%27%20Revenue%20Falls%2C%20Partner%20Profits%20Rise&cn=20160303&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&slreturn=20160203125521) on the financial results of K&L Gates for 2015. In a nutshell, revenue fell and but profit per partner rose (partly due to a dip in the number of equity partners):

K&L Gates saw gross revenue dip 7 percent in 2015, a year in which the firm’s head count dropped a net of 100 lawyers, or 5 percent.

In a prepared statement, K&L Gates said revenue fell from about $1.15 billion in 2014 to $1.06 billion in 2015. The firm declined to comment beyond the statement, which also noted that profits per “fully participating” equity partners rose 5.3 percent from about $830,000 to more than $873,000.

K&L Gates saw a much higher reduction in equity partners in 2015 than in the nonequity partner rank. The number of fully participating equity partners dipped from 252 in 2014 to 210 in 2015, or by 16.6 percent. The number of nonequity partners dropped from 244 in 2014 to 229 last year, or a decline of 6.1 percent. Total head count fell 5 percent, from 1,952 in 2014 to 1,852 last year. The average compensation for all partners rose 2 percent to about $604,000.

We’re working on a possible follow-up story. Please reach out if you have info to share.

# Lateral Partner Moves To Secondary Markets: An Unprecedented Opportunity
## Although secondary market expansion may have been the defining story of 2022, we expect this trend to continue in 2023. The window remains open to partners making a lateral move to a secondary city.

Growth in Biglaw partnerships follows a cyclical pattern. Firms expand their partner ranks rapidly in some years and not at all in others. 2022 was a year for lateral expansion — hardly a surprise considering that client demand remained strong in most practices. The unique feature of this recent expansion wave is where firms grew: 2022 will be remembered for unprecedented hiring of lateral partners outside of the largest cities.

COVID and remote working have upended traditional assumptions about where a partner must be based in order to maintain a Biglaw book of business. The pandemic shuffled the location preferences of many professionals, including both lawyers and their clients. Partners who would rather live outside of the traditional business centers now feel emboldened to voice that preference, and many firms are prepared to accommodate.

Firms see new opportunities for business development in cities that traditionally wouldn’t have supported top Biglaw billing rates: the recent growth of the finance sector in Miami (at the expense of New York and Chicago) offers a case in point. Additionally, clients today are more tolerant of their lawyers being based in a different state: a partner who moves from the Bay Area to Austin will likely have no problem continuing to serve California clients. Another factor firms are considering is the many associates and counsels who are eager to move to secondary markets: where partners are prepared to anchor a new office (or expand an existing one), it typically helps a firm’s non-partner recruiting efforts.

Perhaps no secondary market has drawn as much attention in this period as Miami. The city has not been shy about branding itself as the hot new tech and finance hub. Distinguishing between [hype and reality](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/miami-as-the-next-biglaw-hotspot/) hasn’t always been easy, but with important Biglaw clients like Citadel moving their headquarters to South Florida, firms are rightfully taking notice. Among the firms that have opened Miami offices since COVID are Kirkland & Ellis, Winston & Strawn, King & Spalding, Sidley Austin, and Quinn Emanuel.

Salt Lake City is another market worth highlighting. Though it maintains a lower profile than Miami, Salt Lake has enjoyed a fast-growing, tech-driven economy, attracting both larger companies (Adobe, Ebay, Overstock, Qualtrics) and many startups. Kirkland & Ellis, Wilson Sonsini, and Foley & Lardner have all opened Utah offices since the pandemic.

Although secondary market expansion may have been the defining story of 2022, we expect this trend to continue in 2023. The window remains open to partners making a lateral move to a secondary city.

If you’re a partner considering such a move, should you take the plunge? Obviously, circumstances vary depending on your practice and your proposed destination. A recruiter who specializes in partner moves and knows the specific markets in question will be best placed to advise you. But speaking generally, here are a few reasons you may wish to jump to a secondary market:

Better lifestyle! Many secondary cities are attractive places to live. Interested in a warmer climate? Easy access to skiing? A lower cost of living? Chances are there’s a secondary market that would suit your lifestyle preferences.

Big fish, smaller office! Partners entering from larger cities often enjoy the best of both worlds. They can establish themselves immediately as a top expert in their new, smaller market by virtue of the high-profile matters they handled in the prior market. At the same time, they can bring their current clients with them. For more junior partners, a move to a less crowded market can also be a fast-track to internal leadership opportunities.

Billing rate flexibility! In some cases, it is increasingly possible to charge national billing rates in smaller cities as companies used to paying those rates move in. But as a general matter, smaller markets usually require firms to adopt a more flexible approach. The ability to offer more flexibility on rates can be of great help to partners looking to expand their client base outside the big cities.

Talent retention! Many associates and counsels want to be based in lower-cost cities with more affordable real estate. For partners, the ability to accommodate that desire means they can retain their talent group for longer. Instead of leaving to join a smaller firm in a secondary market, associates and counsels can achieve the same cost-of-living benefit while staying in Biglaw.

Strategy, strategy, and more strategy! In the current market, lateral partners moving to secondary locations are a key part of many firms’ strategic growth model. If you join a new firm under these circumstances, firm leadership will be especially invested in your success. As a lateral partner, you want to ensure your new firm is committed to integrating you into the firm’s platform, and it is always advantageous to lateral into a situation where the firm feels some extra pressure to make the move work. Coming in as an anchor partner for an office that is a focus of firm growth should set you up nicely.

This brings us to the fifth of the [Five Ws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws): why?

We’ve had hints in our prior coverage, and they get expanded on in this latest report from [Law360](https://www.law360.com/legalindustry/articles/768581/k-l-gates-losses-fueled-by-clashes-with-firm-management):

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
K&L Gates LLP’s stream of partner departures is being driven by concerns that the firm’s management structure creates an autocracy that is unable to address partners’ anxieties about the firm’s financial future, former partners say, a contention the head of the firm slammed in an interview with Law360 on Tuesday, saying the firm takes great pains to give partners a voice.

Oooh, exciting — Peter [“The King”](https://bol.bna.com/at-kl-gates-partners-exit-and-the-king-is-silent/) Kalis breaks his silence! This is going to be good.

But first, let’s hear from the (not so loyal) opposition — a partner who left the firm, who opened up to Law360:

“I think there is a sense that the present management does not have a long-term vision for the firm. I think there is a sense that it is not responsive to the partners and frankly just doesn’t listen to the partners. And I think there is a sense that without some serious restructuring, the long-term health of the firm is not good,” an ex-partner told Law360, echoing sentiments shared by others.

The firm’s [latest financials](http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202751162101/KL-Gates-Sees-Revenue-Fall-7-Percent-PPP-Rise-53-Percent?back=TAL08&kw=The%20Am%20Law%20100:%20K%26L%20Gates%27%20Revenue%20Falls%2C%20Partner%20Profits%20Rise&cn=20160303&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer&slreturn=20160209161142) weren’t terrible (although note that big drop in equity partners). There are, however, issues relating to the firm’s path forward. As [Dan Binstock](http://g-s.com/dc-legal-recruiters/dan-binstock.php) told [Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/at-kl-gates-partners-exit-and-the-king-is-silent/), “K&L Gates is a (middle market) firm that is trying to be international with flexible billing rates — does it support globalization? Is there enough demand for that?”

Peter Kalis pushed back against his critics:

[Kalis] called the critiques unfair. He contended that some of the complaints are the result of the firm culture not being a good fit for some, and that he and other firm leaders are focused on leading K&L Gates down the path most partners think is best for the firm.

“With 900 partners and 450 of them being owners of the business, achieving unanimity of viewpoints is not only impossible, but it’s undesirable. It’s a recipe for stagnation. It empowers your weakest link, not the thought leaders,” said Kalis.

Who are the weakest links at K&L Gates? You may recall in one of our prior stories a complaint about [“extremely bloated” management ranks](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/the-latest-departures-through-the-kl-gates/) at the firm, featuring 70-plus lawyers who don’t bill that much. This concern got reiterated to Law360:

Several sources said that the firm’s “bloated” 75-member management committee is ineffective at taking concerns about the firm’s turnover or financial stability to the executive committee, which includes Kalis and 10 other top leaders. This, in turn, has bred unhappiness among the rank and file, according to sources.

“It’s run like a dictatorship. There is no management response. Any response is coming from the tippy top. There is no conduit to get questions and concerns addressed,” one source said.

The source also alleged that the managing committee is mostly made up of attorneys who don’t have big books of business and who essentially give the green light to Kalis and the executive committee.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Kalis vigorously disputed these allegations: “That’s a mischaracterization. And it’s an insult to 75 people. They are there for a reason. These are people who are producers and hard workers,” with some of them billing 2,000 to 3,000 hours per year.

He also disputed the claims of [major trouble in the Chicago office](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/the-latest-departures-through-the-kl-gates/): “Despite the headlines, Chicago is doing extremely well. It’s [slimmed] down to the folks that really want to be here.”

This brings us to one area where Kalis and his critics actually agree: the firm’s infamously high buy-in, described by one source a few years ago as [“astronomical,”](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/partners-streaming-out-of-the-kl-gates/) is not for everyone. The big capital contributions from partners, which can run as high as 60 percent of a partner’s annual compensation, help the firm avoid debt and maintain strong books, which is why Kalis supports them. But some partners prefer different approaches:

[Some critics say] that for most average-billing partners, it can be very difficult to reap any significant upside when the buy-in is so high. “Accepting the equity partner deal was the worst deal I’ve ever done in my life,” an ex-partner said.

While Kalis stood strong on the firm’s buy-in position, he said he understands why some of the equity partners who have left have gone to firms with either lower buy-ins or guaranteed compensation. “I totally get it. They have other choices out there.”

And he said that he wishes well to those who have decided to leave. “They are all fine lawyers and all fine people. I hope they find the alignment with the new firm that they did not find us.”

That’s very… tame. What have you done with the [real Peter Kalis?](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/everything-is-great-kl-states-peter-kalis-comes-out-swinging/)

P.S. Just kidding! We get that Peter Kalis [is large, he contains multitudes](http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/whitman/song.htm), and we have previously discussed the complexity of Kalis in these pages.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

There are not many firms out there who are advancing African Americans into leadership positions within their firm or with their clients. That’s something the industry still has to grapple with: How are we going to do that and how are we going to be more effective in equity and inclusion?

— [Anthony White](https://www.thompsonhine.com/professionals/tony-white/), who was recently named as the next managing partner of Thompson Hine, in comments given to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/thompson-hine-elects-litigator-as-first-black-managing-partner) on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and his ascent to leadership within the firm. On May 1, White will succeed Deborah Read, who has led the firm since 2012, to become one of the handful of Black lawyers to lead an Am Law 200 firm. “It’s not about some artificial process you’re trying to force onto your organization. It’s about your people,” White continued. “And here at Thompson Hine, our people are our most important strength. So we focus on them in a lot of ways, and equity and inclusion is just one of those ways.”

# New Year’s Resolutions For Legal Tech
## Learning from mistakes and moving forward.

Turning toward a new year presents a great opportunity to reflect on the past year and make plans for the months ahead. Many of us are busy making resolutions for personal and professional growth, I’d like to offer New Year’s resolutions — as nerdy as it sounds — for legal tech.

I resolve to listen to my clients

We all have clients (in one fashion or another) — and most trouble in business starts when we lose track of what matters (and correspondingly what doesn’t matter) to those clients. Take for example an M&A attorney who bills at $800+/hour and who’s flush with business. Odds are that greater efficiency is not at the top of the list for that client. On the other hand, if you talk to an oversubscribed attorney working as corporate counsel, efficiency is probably high on the list of must-haves.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The good news is that most people are more than willing to tell you exactly what matters to them; you just need to ask. What are the issues impacting your organization’s growth and profitability? What’s the strategy of the business, and how does your department (or your client’s) department fit into that strategy? If you seek out and understand the answer to these questions, you’ll find that making the case for innovation and investment can be a lot easier.

I resolve to avoid solutions that are in search of a problem.

I’ve fallen prey to this particular issue over the past year, but I am resolute that I will avoid the same in the upcoming year. We’ve all been there — you see something really, really cool and say to yourself, “Well I’m sure I can use that in some way!” I’ll pause for a second to let the painful memory sink back in, because that point is when the hurting begins.

To extend the example above, what’s the expected outcome if you were to purchase workflow automation software that cut in half the time required to perform a task, and then tried to convince that M&A attorney to add the software to her practice? Since efficiency is not a priority for that attorney, you would likely have a variety of undesirable outcomes:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Resistance from the business stakeholder, followed by lack of adoption;
- Political fallout for wasting either time or money (or both); and
- More difficulty moving forward with the next idea you have.
We avoid all the above by defining the use case and then getting buy-in and validation on the value of the use case prior to finding the solution. Take for example the following use case:

Problem: Clients wish to cap fees for due diligence of target contracts as part of an M&A deal

Approach: Leverage document review software to reduce the time required for attorneys to identify key terms/patterns in contracts

Metrics: Time required to review contract, accuracy

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
We would refer to this as a tight, well-defined use case in that i) the scope is narrow and ii) success criteria are clearly defined and measurable. If you’re able to find these types of use cases that matter to your business, you’re more likely to get buy-in from stakeholders and a higher adoption and success rate for new solutions.

I resolve to try, and if I fail, fail fast.

This philosophy, popular in Silicon Valley, asserts that if you’re not failing in anything that you do, then you’re probably not trying very hard. This is true for adopters of legal technology as well. Finding the right solution or system to optimize your business may not happen on the first try, but it’s necessary to try different tools in order to learn what does and does not work. It’s ok to fail — as long as you do so as quickly as possible. Understanding when it’s time to stop the experiment and seek a different solution is critical to the process of finding the right solution. If a solution isn’t working, don’t allow it to become a two-year, several hundred-thousand-dollar failure. Instead, plan for a timeline or a threshold when you can decide whether the solution is worth keeping or not, determine what you’ve learned from the failure, and use those lessons to look for a better alternative.

We’ve covered several different use cases for AI in this column — and while the technology holds tremendous potential, we know that there’s no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution for everyone and every challenge. As we continue to see new offerings enter the market, the professionals who have a clear understanding of their business will ultimately be successful in unlocking the value of these tools and driving innovation within their organizations.

# Peter Kalis Won't Run For Re-Election As Chair Of K&L Gates
## What will Peter Kalis's legacy at the firm look like?

Peter Kalis

Peter Kalis — the longtime chair of K&L Gates, which he has run with such a strong grip that some have nicknamed him [“The King”](https://bol.bna.com/at-kl-gates-partners-exit-and-the-king-is-silent/) — is relinquishing his crown and scepter. As Julie Triedman reports over at [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/09/06/peter-kalis-to-transition-out-of-role-as-kl-gates-chairman/?cn=20160906&pt=Newswire&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=Law.com&slreturn=20160806104116):

Peter Kalis will not seek re-election to the top post at the firm he has steered for 19 years, K&L Gates [announced](http://klgates.com/kl-gates-prepares-for-first-change-in-chairmanship-in-two-decades-09-06-2016/) Tuesday.

“In early July, I informed our management committee that I would not be a candidate for another term as head of the firm,” Kalis said in a statement. “It has been an honor to serve the only law firm I have called home, and I look forward not only to concluding a strong 2016 but also to seeing my successors take the firm to greater heights in the years to come.” Kalis’s term ends next February.

At 66, Kalis is perhaps the last among a generation of firm builders that, until recently, included Dechert’s Bart Winokur, Latham & Watkins’ Robert Dell, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe’s Ralph Baxter and Reed Smith’s Gregory Jordan. He was appointed chair at 47 in 1997.

Distinguished company, but Kalis certainly deserves to be mentioned among their ranks. The former Rhodes Scholar and Supreme Court clerk is one of Biglaw’s most colorful characters and visionary leaders, and he worked wonders at K&L Gates:

During Kalis’s five consecutive terms as the firm’s leader, he steered the firm from a relatively sleepy Pittsburgh-based regional player into a global powerhouse in five continents. With 46 offices around the world, K&L Gates has for the past two years ranked among legal market research company Acritas’ 10 best-known in the United States, though it hasn’t yet cracked the top 20 global brand rankings. Clients give it top marks for tech savviness, according to surveys by legal research firm BTI Consulting Group.

The 1,852-lawyer firm, known best for its securities regulation, investment fund, IP litigation, energy and middle-market transactional work, among other areas, has engineered this expansion without the benefit of bank loans.

Indeed. Longtime readers of ATL may recall how Kalis [laid the smackdown](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/everything-is-great-kl-states-peter-kalis-comes-out-swinging/) on critics who questioned the state of the firm back in 2012 (and how he [lashed out at Law360](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/deja-vu-all-over-again-peter-kalis-of-kl-gates-strikes-back-at-law360/) last year). His defenses of the firm rely heavily upon detailed data; Kalis is, as Triedman notes, a major advocate of transparency within the world of large law firms, even going so far as to release audited financial information for K&L Gates in recent years.

Kalis successfully transformed K&L Gates over the long term, but the firm has hit some rough spots lately, as Law.com points out:

[I]n recent years, Kalis has been unable to stem declines in the firm’s profitability and productivity. Since 2008, revenue per lawyer has drifted from $620,000 to $575,000 in 2015, 92nd among Am Law 100 firms. During the same time, according to Am Law 100 data, average profits per partner haven’t budged, varying little from 2008′s $855,000. (In 2015 PPP was $870,000, up 4.8 percent from the previous year, but a 16.6 percent drop in equity partner head count was largely responsible.) The firm grossed $1.065 billion last year, according to the Am Law 100.

This year, the firm also saw a large number of partners, including some practice leaders and management members, depart for other firms. So far this year, 57 partners have left, and 35 have joined, according to ALM RivalEdge lateral moves data.

We’ve chronicled those partner defections extensively in these pages (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/why-are-so-many-partners-walking-out-the-kl-gates/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/the-latest-departures-through-the-kl-gates/), and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/more-departures-from-the-kl-gates-do-they-matter/)). On the bright side, the departures seem to have slowed in recent months — perhaps because this year will bring a [big payday to partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/good-news-out-of-the-kl-gates/), thanks to a $210 million contingency fee award.

Who will replace Kalis as the leader of K&L Gates? That’s not clear — although expect “The King” to have a major hand in picking his successor.

We might do a longer piece on Peter Kalis and his tenure atop K&L Gates. Please feel free to [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Peter%20Kalis%20and%20KL%20Gates) or text us (646-820-8477) with any thoughts you might be willing to share. Thanks.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# 7 Cybersecurity Tips For Lawyers
## In the wake of the big hack of Biglaw, it's time to focus on what you can do to make yourself more cyber-secure.

This past week, the world learned about the [big hack of Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/beware-of-big-hacking-in-biglaw/?rf=1). If your employer was one of the [almost 50 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/beware-of-big-hacking-in-biglaw/2/) prestigious enough to be targeted by Russian hackers… congrats?

The targeted firms tended to be transactionally oriented; the apparent plan of the hackers was to obtain confidential, market-moving information and trade on it. But litigators should be concerned as well. As noted by [Logikcull](http://logikcull.com/), the discovery automation platform, ediscovery is the [next frontier for hackers](http://logikcull.com/blog/ediscovery-next-frontier-hackers-major-law-firms-now-know/).

It’s not clear that any information was actually taken or used for insider trading in the big Biglaw hack, but it might still generate headaches for the firms — in the form of litigation. Noted class-action lawyer [Jay Edelson](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/the-atl-interrogatories-10-questions-with-jay-edelson-from-edelson-llc/) — known to the general public for [suing tech giants](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/technology/unpopular-in-silicon-valley.html?_r=0), and known to Above the Law readers for [suing ExamSoft](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/08/examsoft-sued-in-illinois/) (and [winning a hefty settlement](http://www.law360.com/articles/652561/examsoft-to-pay-2-1m-to-settle-bar-exam-disaster-claims)) — has [announced plans](https://bol.bna.com/threats-of-litigation-after-data-breaches-at-major-law-firms/https://bol.bna.com/threats-of-litigation-after-data-breaches-at-major-law-firms/) to file [class-action malpractice cases](http://www.law360.com/articles/778540/biglaw-in-crosshairs-as-firm-plans-data-breach-litigation) against various firms, alleging inadequate cybersecurity.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
That’s at the institutional level. What about the individual level? What can you as a lawyer do to prevent yourself (and your confidential client data) from getting hacked?

Here are some tips derived from two panels at the recent [ABA TECHSHOW](http://www.techshow.com/) conference: a panel called [Security Awareness and Phishing](http://www.techshow.com/schedule/security-awareness-and-phishing/), featuring tech consultants Sherri Davidoff and Adriana Linares, and a plenary session called [Can They Hear Me Now? Practicing Law in an Age of Mass Surveillance](https://abatechshow2016.sched.org/event/6Efd/plenary-1-can-they-hear-me-now-practicing-law-in-an-age-of-mass-surveillance-non-cle), featuring technologist Christopher Soghoian and lawyers Marcia Hofmann and Ben Wizner. (I attended the first panel and I moderated the second.)

1. Don’t be lax; make cybersecurity a priority.

That you’re reading this article is a good sign. “Lawyers get complacent,” Linares said. “They think, ‘Nobody’s going to come after me.’ But that’s not how things work.” Linares and Davidoff gave numerous examples of law firms — many of them small firms, not Biglaw behemoths — that fell victim to hackers. As Linares put it, “Eighty percent of law firms have been hacked, and the other twenty percent are either lying or don’t know about it.”

2. Backup, backup, backup — early and often.

You need to have your data backed up in case you suffer some misfortune, such as a fire or flood in your office or a massive hack of your computer system. Backing up to the cloud is a increasingly popular option, but be careful when selecting a service. As Linares pointed out, some cloud-based services (such as the widely used [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)) simply replicate everything on your desktop or laptop computer — which means that if you have a virus on your laptop, the problem can spread to your backup files.

3. Use two-factor authentication.

[Two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication) is an increasingly popular and effective way to protect the security of online accounts — so start using it.

“Yes, it can be a pain,” acknowledged Linares, since it’s slower and more cumbersome than simply entering a single password. “But you will get used to it.”

4. Consider using a password manager.

Speaking of passwords, there are solutions out there for handling your plethora of passwords. Chris Soghoian of the ACLU recommended password managers like [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) or [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/).

5. Look into encryption to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your (and your clients’) data.

Chris Soghoian and Ben Wizner of the ACLU spoke about how having NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden as a client forced them to up their game on the encryption front. Because of his high profile and the attention focused on him by multiple international intelligence agencies, Snowden insists on encrypted communications. But you don’t need to have a client like Snowden to benefit from the security and privacy that encryption can afford.

For a while, [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) was the leading encryption technology (and you’ll still see many journalist and techie bios on Twitter with PGP key information; see, e.g., former ATL editor [Kashmir Hill](https://twitter.com/kashhill)). But because it’s cumbersome, PGP is losing market share to other encryption technologies, according to Soghoian (who revealed that he’s currently on a PGP hiatus).

For example, Marcia Hofmann uses [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_%28software%29) from [Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org/), a free and open-source app that allows for encrypted voice calling and instant messaging. It’s easy to download and to learn how to use.

If you’re too lazy for that but at least own an iPhone, you can actually use FaceTime for your phone calls and iMessage for your messages to other iPhone users, as Soghoian pointed out. Both FaceTime and iMessage offer so-called [end-to-end encryption](http://bgr.com/2015/09/09/iphone-encryption-imessage-facetime-wiretapping/) — which means, in a nutshell, that neither the government nor hackers can intercept your communications midstream and read them.

As for encrypted file storage and backup, Soghoian gave a shout-out to [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/) as a more secure alternative to Dropbox.

6. Educate your colleagues about cybersecurity.

You might be savvy about cybersecurity, but all it takes is one weak link in your organization to throw your computer system into chaos. Linares and Davidoff shared the story of how one Florida firm got hacked after a secretary clicked on an email attachment that was labeled “résumé for your review” but was actually malware. (One tip from Linares: learn how to [hover over links](http://ask-leo.com/what_does_it_mean_to_hover_over_a_link_to_check_its_validity.html) to check their validity — is it a link to a website that you know and trust, or is it a link to an [executable file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable) (.exe) that might contain malware?)

7. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

As Davidoff pointed out, you can never be 100 percent secure. The best you can do is “just put one foot in front of the other,” she said, and try to protect yourself against major or obvious threats.

A good starting point: an assessment of your computer systems to figure out what your potential issues and biggest risk points are. This is what a number of law firms are now doing in the wake of the hacking reported last week, often with the help of outside consultants or technology firms.

You should also do your best to keep up with developments in the tech space, in terms of both new threats and new tools. You can do so with the help of Above the Law’s extensive and ever-increasing [legal technology coverage](https://abovethelaw.com/technology/), an area we’ve expanded dramatically in the past few years.

“Security is never perfect,” Hofmann said, so don’t stress yourself out by aspiring to perfection. But you can, and should, try to do better over time. You — and your clients — will be very glad you did.

This is top of mind for clients across the board. From what we are seeing, this is not a short-term issue. It’s still unfolding, and we’re still learning about it.

— [Alejandro Mayorkas](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/people/alejandro-mayorkas), the leader of WilmerHale’s coronavirus crisis task force, commenting on the fact that clients have s[ought legal guidance across a variety of practice areas](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/03/04/big-firms-build-lawyer-task-forces-as-coronavirus-spreads/) as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The firm is fielding legal questions from global clients that are concerned about topics ranging from employee safety to supply chain disruption.

[It’s somewhat surprising] how long some of these firms have been able to keep their associates despite them billing significantly low hours over the past six-plus months.

This was probably driven a little bit by the extraordinary revenues of 2021 but also the hope that the economy would rebound, but this just hasn’t happened in a meaningful way.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# Joint Chiefs To Trump: That's Not How Any Of This Works

Yesterday, I pointed out that Donald Trump’s transgender ban was something Trump can do, but hasn’t actually done yet. [Because a tweet is not an “order.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/trumps-transgender-ban-is-bait-its-not-a-law-yet/)

Today, Joe Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — and future dictator-for-life, if things keep going like this — gave President Trump some “guidance” in how to actually command the most lethal military on Earth. [From Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/27/trump-transgender-military-ban-no-modification-241029):

“I know there are questions about yesterday’s announcement on the transgender policy by the President,” Dunford wrote in the internal communication, a copy of which was provided to POLITICO. “There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President’s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance.”

“In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect. As importantly, given the current fight and the challenges we face, we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions,” he continued.

You can’t just sit on your toilet and blast out tweets that count as “orders” that men and women at arms will respect. That’s just not how it works. There is a process for issuing commands, and until Trump follows that process, this transgender ban is nothing.

Having troops respect your orders is, you know, a thing that has vexed civilian commanders for all of human history. Our system of civilian oversight over the men with guns is rare and valuable and yet another deeply important norm that Donald Trump seems eager to piss away. Do we want Joe Dunford ignoring orders from civilian commanders? Probably NOT, ultimately. But it’s the president’s responsibility to issue orders that are clear, which the military can follow and respect.

His failure to do so here is just another thing that moves us down the road to the ultimate destruction of our republic. Telling the military to take their orders from Twitter humiliates them. It’s disrespectful to a group of people who are really into the concept of “respect.” If Trump thinks he can treat the armed services like one of his staffer lackeys, he’s going to be in for a surprise. If he thinks the military is as afraid of him as, say, the U.S. House of Representatives, he’s in for a surprise that is potentially dangerous to all of us.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Joe Dunford’s statement subtly asks the president to do two things:

1. Follow the goddamn chain of command, and don’t put the military in the position of divining directives from Twitter.

2. “Continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.”

Failure to do either of those things could damage the always fragile balance between civilians leading people and generals leading armies.

We are stumbling towards a fight that is much bigger than transgender rights. I don’t think Trump wants to force people to choose a side between himself and the generals. This is how republics die.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Boies Schiller's Bounty
## One shouldn't paint the BSF bonuses with too broad a brush, but overall, people seem pleased.

In [years past](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k-again/), we have [heaped praise](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k/) upon the generous bonuses of Boies Schiller & Flexner, the celebrated, litigaton-focused firm founded by the renowned David Boies (recently named the [most famous practicing lawyer in America](https://bol.bna.com/big-laws-most-famous-practicing-lawyer-is/)).

The 2016 BSF bonuses came out today, and the amounts were generous — which is not surprising, because the firm’s compensation scheme hasn’t changed. People seem happy (as we’ll discuss more below).

But here at Above the Law, we welcome opposing viewpoints and seek to publish all sides of a story (to the extent that they exist). So before turning to this year’s bonuses, let’s hear some dissenters from our prior coverage. For example:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Based largely on somewhat misleading articles from this site, the firm has a reputation for being compensation leaders. If you are a crazy high biller, you beat market here, but otherwise we’re about at market. (Others who get the high bonuses work on contingency, with all the risk that entails, plus the several years of building up your lodestar with no annual bonuses.) The thing is, we work on a “formula,” so to give us a [base salary] raise they’ll have to change the formula. The hope is that the complications of doing this is delaying the raise. But if the silence continues, I’m out of here.

It should surprise no one to hear that big billers at Boies fare the best. As we’ve [explained in the past](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/associate-bonus-watch-a-300k-bonus-at-boies-schiller/), BSF employs a comp system in which an individual associate shares directly in the revenue her work produces for the firm. So if she bills insane hours or works on a lucrative contingency-fee case, she can [get a bonus as high as $350,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-boies-schiller-pays-up-to-350k-again/). But if not, it’s possible she might end up getting market-level comp (which is really not that bad, if it means working better hours).

A second source echoed these concerns, noting that Boies Schiller typically quotes average bonus figures to ATL as opposed to median bonus figures for each class. According to this tipster, the average bonus amounts are skewed upward by “extreme outliers” with high hours, contingency-fee participation, or business-generation credit, and median bonus figures are much closer to market rates.

As for the issue of base salaries, Boies Schiller did [raise salaries post-Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/will-these-above-market-salary-hikes-hurt-this-firms-bonuses/), to a new scale starting at $180,000, going up to $300,000, and beating the Cravath scale by a little bit for certain years in between. But because of the BSF comp system, in which a base salary is functionally an advance on the revenue an associate generates for the firm, bigger base salaries should in theory result in smaller bonuses (unless the formula gets changed to raise the rev share for associates; we understand it hasn’t been changed).

(An aside on base salaries: we understand that the raises applied to certain offices — including, but not limited to, New York City, Armonk, D.C., Oakland, and Los Angeles — but not to all Boies Schiller offices. We heard from one angry associate in Fort Lauderdale who complained that this office did not get raises: “People here are really upset. It is upsetting they promised us New York pay scales, we took the job, and now they’re reneging…. BSF used to be the best legal job in Florida. It no longer is. Weil, Baker, Hughes, McDermott, and Kaye are all paying NY salaries in Florida. Couple that with BSF Florida not really receiving the massive New York-style bonuses, and BSF Florida is no longer the most attractive job in Florida. If BSF wants to treat Florida different, they should do so openly. Not try to keep their reputation as a compensation leader by quietly cheating their associates.”)

Now, on to the 2016 bonuses. Our sources might not be representative — if you work at Boies Schiller and want to make your voice heard, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Boies%20Schiller%20bonuses) or text us (646-820-8477) — but here’s what we’re hearing (we’ve made hours and bonuses a little vague to protect anonymity):

- “Junior associate. We got bonuses this morning. I’m on pace to bill more than 2400 hours. My bonus was more than $100,000. No memo or announcement yet, just money in my bank account.”
- “Midlevel associate. My bonus was roughly 25 percent higher than the Cravath scale for fairly light hours, no trials, and no all-nighters. Others who went to trial or simply had heavy hours blew away the Cravath scale.”
- “Senior associate. Bonus more than $150K.”
For comparison purposes, the [Cravath bonus scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) starts at $15,000 and tops out at $100,000. So it seems that Boies bonuses are way higher as a general matter. But as noted earlier, [your mileage may vary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ymmv), depending on your hours, involvement in contingency cases, and business-generation credit (if any). Working at BSF is no guarantee of market-destroying compensation each and every year.

Now that we’ve given you the necessary caveats, let’s hear reactions from our Boies Schiller tipsters. The bottom line is that they’re quite pleased:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
- “Very happy. More than I expected. Don’t want to speak for others.”
- “While I would love more transparency around the comp system, I feel very fortunate to work here.”
- “Unlike the system at other firms, our formula compensation system means there is a direct relationship between salary and bonus. After the salary bump, there was some [trepidation about reduced bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/will-these-above-market-salary-hikes-hurt-this-firms-bonuses/). It’s hard to see behind the curtain, either in individual cases or in the aggregate, but the associates with whom I’ve spoken are relieved that bonuses remain ‘above market,’ even though salaries are basically ‘at market’ for the first time in years. (Salaries used to be well above market for all class years.) You can’t really paint our bonuses with a broad brush, but it is still possible for junior associates to get a $100k bonus at BSF. It does seem to even out a bit after a few years; senior associates can handily beat Cravath, too, but it’s difficult for them to break above $150k or so based solely on billing hours. Possible, but very difficult. Bonuses above that often reflect business generation credit or a big contingency win.”
UPDATE (3:38 p.m.): Another reaction: “Midlevel associate at BSF – I would have gotten significantly more of a bonus on the Cravath scale for fewer hours at other firms. But, nonetheless, I agree with another tipster who wrote, ‘while I would love more transparency around the comp system, I feel very fortunate to work here.'”

Congratulations to the associates of Boies Schiller & Flexner on the nice bonuses — to the extent that they find them “nice,” that is. Compensation will vary greatly from associate to associate. As reflected in BSF’s high use of contingency fees compared to other Biglaw firms, its clients often prefer to pay for performance — and when it comes to associate pay, the firm apparently feels the same way.

# Government Attorneys: Now Is The Time To Launch Your Move To Private Practice
## Year three of an administration is actually a great time to launch a lateral move to private practice.

As a recruiter who focuses on helping government attorneys make the move from government to law firms, I regularly receive questions about the ideal time for government attorneys to make a lateral transition. The cloud of economic uncertainty in 2023 has fed rumors that some firms are now less likely to hire government attorneys than in years past. Potential candidates for a transition to private practice may be hearing that this is the wrong time for a government attorney to start a lateral search. But that is not at all in keeping with my experience—either in 2023, or in the third year of previous administrations.

Year three of an administration is actually a great time to launch a lateral move to private practice. Here’s why:

You have real—and scarce—value to offer

Historically, the third year of a presidential term is a particularly strategic time to make the jump to private practice. Why? Year three is a sweet spot between depth of insight gained and opportunity to apply that insight for immediate client impact. Plus, leaving before most of your colleagues do will place you in the strongest competitive position.

Attorneys who have worked with the current administration—both political appointees and career officials—have helped shape recent policy changes. Their government service has given them a nuanced understanding of agency priorities and the application of evolving regulations. Clients are eager for guidance from attorneys with this profile because they face a moment of exceptional uncertainty and, perhaps, jeopardy. New rules have been adopted, but there remains a paucity of cases applying them. 

As a recent government attorney with insight into what to expect, you have a unique opportunity to help companies chart the right course. This is especially true in the most innovative sectors of the economy, where there is little regulatory track record from which to draw inferences. You are exceptionally well positioned to help companies develop effective compliance programs, evaluate the need for internal investigations, and successfully navigate a new regulatory landscape.

Note that if you wait until closer to the potential end of an administration, this value may decline. By then, companies will have more of a track record to consider, and although they will still wish to consult recent insiders, the sense of urgency may have diminished. Moreover, a large number of attorneys start lateral searches in year four of an administration, creating more competition. Given those dynamics, it should come as no surprise that candidates who have moved in year three have attained better outcomes (more prestigious firms, higher guaranteed compensation), relative to their peers who waited longer.

Don’t preemptively count yourself out

Candidates who entered government early in a presidential term might fear that they won’t be marketable this soon. Such concerns may be particularly acute in this administration, where a sizable number of Senate-confirmed appointees faced delays in the process. Many appointees have not yet been in their roles for a full two years.

Even if you find yourself in that situation, don’t let it dissuade you from starting a search. The dynamics described above still apply. Sure, it would be ideal if you had been confirmed on day one and brought two full years to the table. But in a market with limited supply, firms are not going to exclude candidates with shorter tenures. What matters most is the insight you bring, not the number of years you’ve logged.

Some government attorneys also have concerns that their lack of experience in private practice may prevent them from moving to a firm. It’s true that the transition from government attorney to law firm partner is often easier for those who already have experience as a law firm partner. But it should be noted that not every successful candidate has that background. Firms frequently interview government officials who, despite their lack of law firm experience, can present a credible business plan. As you might imagine, candidates in this category tend to benefit greatly from working with an experienced recruiter who has the judgment to help sharpen their business case.

Know what to expect

Even though the market dynamics are currently favorable, preparation remains essential. A strong recruiter will help you develop answers to the most common questions that firms ask candidates seeking to transition from government. For example, firms may probe the sincerity of your interest in private practice, your comfort with “switching sides,” your aptitude for business development, and the substance of the practice you expect to build.

# Another New York Firm Matches -- This Is What Momentum Looks Like
## Another firm raises salaries, but where are the top revenue firms?

With today’s earlier raise announcement from [Willkie](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/todays-a-great-day-for-some-biglaw-associate-raises/), Weil Gotshal must have decided that today was “W” day and jumped at the opportunity to match this Milbank/Simpson/Cravath raise.

In a memo distributed to associates moments ago, Weil’s management committee sent around the good news:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Raises are effective as of July 1 and will be reflected in the July 13 paycheck. And, of course, summer associates will receive the appropriate match as well.

Now we’ve finally got the ball rolling. Maybe people really do still just wait for Cravath to move. On the other hand, of the top 15 firms in gross revenue, [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-days-notorious-black-box-now-starts-at-190k/) — in their [somewhat cynical way](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/jones-day-cant-even-raise-salaries-without-screwing-someone-over/) — and [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/sullivan-cromwell-matches-salaries-we-think/) are the only ones to match so far.

Weil, coincidentally, is number 16 in revenue.

[Where the hell is Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/todays-a-great-day-for-some-biglaw-associate-raises/)? That’s the burning question that will reveal, definitively, the new contour of the legal landscape.

# Don’t Swipe Right On Every Recruiter
## The lateral market is predicated on trust and accountability. Your recruiter must prioritize offering professional service to attorney candidates and law firm clients.

Michael Allen

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://bit.ly/2b4rW3j) team of expert contributors. [Michael Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelallen/) is the CEO of Lateral Link. He is based in the Los Angeles office and focuses exclusively on Partner and General Counsel placements for top firms and companies. Prior to founding Lateral Link in 2006, he worked as an attorney at both Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Irell & Manella LLP. Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, San Diego before earning his JD, cum laude, from Harvard Law School.

From the “Tinder of Lateral Moves” to back-alley brokers promising unattainable results, the legal recruiting market has become flooded with shops working new angles. In the long run, integrity and competence win out, but in the short run, firms and attorneys can hurt their lateral prospects and hiring by indiscriminately talking to anyone and everyone.

We unfortunately hear horror stories about some shops floating bios of attorneys without their consent or playing games with both sides, promising lateral opportunities that don’t exist.  Recruiters ultimately live and die by their reputation. Some new players come into the market touting non-existent, loose connections and candidates in their pipeline — essentially the vaporware of recruiting. They enter with a bang and try to cash out as quickly as they came. That’s not to say that there are not legitimate and solid shops — they enter the market all the time — but the ease of entry often attracts those looking to make a quick buck. In my opinion, there are fewer than 20 legal recruiting firms stateside worth engaging. Most of these are small mom-and-pop shops and boutiques. There are fewer than a handful that actually control the market.

How about from a recruiter’s perspective? When we know that candidates or law firms are engaging multiple shops, we’re less inclined to work with them because the partnership is broken. It’s a two-way street. We do not overpromise and underdeliver. You do not want your employment and livelihood resting on your résumé maybe finding its way into a law firm decision maker’s hand.

Similar to how law firms may prioritize their best attorneys and the quickest mobilization to service their best clients, typically those with institutionalized business, the firms that engage us meaningfully are the ones to whom we allot a substantial amount of resources.

Exclusive listings and retainers are one way to build a meaningful relationship with a reputable firm. We only take exclusive retainers when we know we can meet expectations. Many small shops push for them knowing they won’t deliver results. These shops pop up and catch the intrigue of the market and are gone as quickly as they came.

With the right agent, retainers can be invaluable for crafting a cohesive message. A law firm’s image is largely crafted by our conversations in the market. Searching on an exclusive or retained basis allows you to approach the search from a concerted angle while also avoiding the inefficiencies that result from multiple shops fishing in the same stream.

The lateral market is predicated on trust and accountability. As essentially agents and brokers, we work best with clients who operate transparently and who engage us in a meaningful way. As we approach our fifteenth year in business, we’ve seen countless shops come and go, dragging down with them great attorneys and firms with their less-than-perfect practices. I pride myself on building a company that is predicated on recruiters who can actually service the needs of our attorney candidates and law firm clients. Our recruiters are not only former Biglaw associates and partners, but more importantly, excellent recruiters who leverage their experience to make meaningful connections between law firms and attorneys.

# That Interview
## That interview is different from other interviews because the real task is pulling off one big trick: proving you can lie about essentially everything.

You are really, really sick of law.  In fact, you want out.  At a minimum, you need to get out of your current job, or you might die.  That much is not in dispute.

But you still have the loans.  Therefore, common sense says you should “give law one more try.”

As H. L. Mencken once observed:  “For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.”

You sense this quotation might apply to your current situation, because it seems clear and simple you should go find another job in Biglaw, at least for a year.  Here are some screamingly clear and simple reasons why:

- You need money to pay off loans — one more shot at Biglaw money.
- It’s not life or death — you can always quit the new job if it doesn’t work out.
- According to the headhunters who call you twice a day, there are loads of “lifestyle” shops that would love to snap you up from your hotshot firm, despite the fact that you loath that place with every cell in your body.

The list of “cons” includes:

- imagining starting a law job at another firm makes you physically ill;
- the thought of interviewing at a law firm makes you physically ill; and
- the thought of walking into another law firm makes you physically ill.
A lot of lawyers find themselves in this situation, stuck (in the metaphorical sense) between a rock (school loans) and a hard place (the thought of continuing to practice law).

However, the final decision tends to be along the lines of — well, no harm in going for an interview.  Which is why you’ll probably wind up going in for that interview.

“So, should I go on this interview?” One client asked me recently.  I knew he was talking about that interview.

The fourth quarter has been filled with [“robust” merger activity](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/law-firm-merger-activity-expected-to-increase-thanks-to-recession-fears/) among Biglaw firms. Global giant Dentons announced a [historic combination](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/worlds-biggest-law-firm-gobbles-up-indian-firm-gets-even-bigger-in-historic-move/) with Indian firm Link Legal, Morrison & Foerster [announced a merger](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/top-50-biglaw-firm-to-merge-with-prominent-litigation-boutique/) with litigation boutique Durie Tangri, and now Am Law top 50 firm Perkins Coie is getting in on the action by announcing a combination with Kluk Farber Law.

Here are some details from the firm’s [press release](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/perkins-coie-acquires-new-york-startup-and-emerging-companies-boutique-kluk-farber-law.html):

Kluk Farber counts iconic venture-backed brands among its clients, many of them with diverse founders at the helm. The Kluk Farber team is known for deep dedication to clients and a solution-oriented approach to legal advice—a blueprint that has resulted in high growth year-over-year since its inception—as well as a reputation for excellence in the New York startup community.

“The addition of Kluk Farber’s highly regarded and talented lawyers further cements Perkins Coie’s position as a leading technology firm in New York and across the nation,” said [Brian Eiting](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/brian-j-eiting.html), co-chair of the firm’s Corporate Law Practice. “Agatha, Sonia, Eitan, and the entire team are a perfect fit for Perkins Coie’s culture, client base, and strategic vision, bringing a keystone emerging companies practice to our New York office. We look forward to their integration and collaboration with the firm’s leading lawyers around the country, and we know they will serve as trusted advisors to innovative and market-leading companies in New York and beyond.”

“We are delighted to be combining forces with Perkins Coie and its deep bench of talent,” said Agatha Kluk. “As our emerging company clients scale, they increasingly need the kind of expert advice and sophisticated execution that Perkins Coie brings to the table. Our team has been privileged to gain our clients’ trust on their most important and sensitive matters, and we are excited to continue doing so under Perkins Coie’s established brand.”

As luck would have it, the firms started chatting this past summer, and their legal romance quickly blossomed. “As we continued those conversations, we got to meet their team and came to the conclusion they share the same values and culture that we do and found them to be the perfect fit to join us,” Eiting said in an interview with the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/11/01/perkins-coies-snags-12-lawyer-venture-capital-boutique/). “Our growth, success, and diverse culture aligns so ideally with Perkins Coie,” Sonia Farber said in a statement. Aww, law firms that love each other make sweet merger partners.

Perkins Coie will officially welcome Kluk Farber’s lawyers to the firm sometime in early December. Congratulations and well wishes on a successful tie-up!

# Biglaw Associate Salary Cuts Come To The Am Law 50
## Top firms aren't immune from COVID-19 austerity.

Up until now, the Biglaw COVID-19 austerity measures, specifically the [layoffs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-announces-associate-layoffs-and-other-cost-cutting-measures/), [furloughs, ](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/biglaw-firm-furloughs-associates-firm-hopeful-they-can-return-to-work-soon/)and [associate salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/another-am-law-100-firm-turns-to-furloughs-and-salary-cuts-amid-covid-19-crisis/), have stayed away from the very top of Biglaw. Before the economic upheaval of the coronavirus, [the Am Law 50 was financially pulling away from the second 50](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/biglaw-celebrates-solid-revenue-before-the-bottom-falls-out/), and the biggest in Biglaw have mostly been[ reassuring folks about their economic stability](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/?rf=1) during these tough times. But now we’ve learned that even top firms are not immune to the COVID-19 the pay cuts.

Today, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner ([ranked 44 by Am Law](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=166165&name=Bryan-Cave-Leighton-Paisner-LLP)) co-chairs Steve Baumer and Lisa Mayhew sent a firm-wide email letting everyone know that all employees making over $40,000 will be taking a 15 percent pay cut. Folks are also encouraged to volunteer for a sabbatical:

The actions we are taking are:
• A proposed 15% salary reduction for all our employees (lawyers and business services staff) across all our offices for a 13 week period starting in May. To protect those on lower incomes, the reduction will not apply to employees whose full-time salary is the equivalent of $40,000/£32,000 or below (and we will ensure that any reduction would not result in a full time salary going below this level).
• We understand that some colleagues will remain exceedingly busy in this period and, therefore, we intend to establish a bonus pool for the benefit of those whose performance during the year merits additional compensation.
• As an alternative to the salary reduction, you are invited to volunteer to:
– take a sabbatical of a minimum of six weeks and maximum of six months, during which time you would receive 30% of your normal
salary; or
– reduce your working hours to work on a part-time basis for a minimum
period of 6 months, working either 4, 3 or 2.5 days per week. Such reduced working hours would be matched with a corresponding reduction in pay.

Yes, this announcement comes[ after tipsters at the firm reported being assured by partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-biglaw-firms-rolling-out-good-news-for-now/?rf=1) that the firm was poised to weather the coronavirus storm. You can read the firm’s full email [on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-50-bclp-salary-cuts/2/).

Good luck to all those at BCLP, and hopefully these cuts means the firm can avoid layoffs or furloughs.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# It's Usually Fine For Lawyers To Be Friends With Their Clients
## Yes, you can meet up with clients in social settings that are completely outside of the attorney-client relationship.

Some professionals need to establish barriers in how they interact with their clients. For instance, certain medical professionals might need to keep their distance from their patients and not be too friendly with patients so that the care provided by the professional is not impacted by becoming friends with a patient. However, lawyers do not have any ethical rules that prohibit attorneys from becoming friends with their clients outside of ensuring that lawyers do not have a conflict which might impair their ability to provide solid representation. In many instances, lawyers can and should become friends with their clients since this can have a solid impact on the services provided by the lawyer.

In my own career, I have performed work for many people who were already friends of mine from childhood and beyond. It is usually very fulfilling to take care of a friend and to know that a friend respects me enough that they would give me legal work. However, I have also had situations in which clients of mine, who I did not know before the attorney-client relationship was established, became friends of mine. I’ll admit, no client has been a particularly close friend of mine, likely because I have only known them more recently in my life. However, I have met up with clients in social settings that are completely outside of the attorney-client relationship.

For instance, I have a client that I have become close with over years while representing a company with which this client is associated. We definitely get along, and many of our work calls include the back and forth that is usually associated with friends catching up. A couple of years ago, I was running a race, and the course took the runners right past this client’s office. I took a video of myself running the race, sent it to the client, and jokingly asked the client if I should stop by his office since he was so close.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The client was happy to receive the video, and the next year, the client decided to run the race with me. That client had never considered running before, but the video showed him it was possible for him to complete this race, and he signed up for it. It was a lot of fun to run the race with the client, but as it turns out, the client was much, much faster than I was! I basically only saw him while we were standing in line before the race and at the very beginning of the race itself, but it was still fun to participate in this event with a client. This has also fortified the attorney-client connection since we have this shared experience that we can talk about with each other and different people.

From time to time, I also invite clients to social events that I have in my personal life. I do not think this is particularly out of the ordinary. If I remember correctly, my family invited a number of business associates to my bar mitzvah. They gave some of the most generous gifts my triplet brothers and I received from the event! Inviting clients to social events can deepen business connections and also can help you expand your social network in some highly enriching ways.

For instance, I threw a party several years ago and invited some business associates. Those folks invited some additional people with whom I was not familiar, but I was happy to have more people at the event. I stayed in touch with the people that my guests had invited, and they came to a few other social events I held over the past few years. I have also attended social events held by business associates and clients, and it has definitely added to my social network.

Of course, some people might not want to mix their personal and professional lives. I completely understand. The work-life balance has been under assault in recent years. Moreover, some people are more private than others and do not wish to associate with anyone from work or connect with them on a more personal level.

However, if you are not too rigid about keeping your work and personal lives separate, making friends with clients can be an enriching experience. Not only can this have a positive impact on your professional life, it can also expand your social network and lead to opportunities to connect with even more people.

# The COVID-19 Crisis And The Perils It Poses

At the end of June, we’ll be roughly four months into the COVID-19 crisis. The novel coronavirus and the measures taken to contain it have had profound effects on our society, our economy, and our nation. I’m hard-pressed to identify a four-month period as consequential for the country as the one we now find ourselves in, from March through June 2020.

The news hasn’t been all bad. Back in April, for example, I identified [four silver linings to the coronavirus cloud](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/what-good-might-come-out-of-the-coronavirus-crisis/?rf=1) for Biglaw. Looking beyond Biglaw, response to COVID-19 has had other benefits for the legal profession. Take the [judicial system](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/judges-and-court-employees-are-heroes-of-the-pandemic/). As Chief Justice Bridget McCormack recently observed in her (virtual) [testimony before Congress](https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2020/06/technology-brought-much-needed-change-to-judicial-system-michigan-supreme-court-chief-justice-tells-congress.html), the pandemic has given rise to more (positive) change in the past three months than in the past three decades, in terms of using technology to make the judicial system more accessible, transparent, and efficient.

But make no mistake: the COVID-19 crisis has harmed the legal world in a number of ways, and now is an opportune time to assess the damage. Here are three ways in which the pandemic has harmed the profession.

1. Economic Dislocation.

The most obvious negative effect of the crisis on the legal industry is the economic harm to lawyers and law firms. Since the start of the crisis, numerous law firms have announced various austerity measures to help them ride out the tough times — around 100 firms, according to Above the Law’s [COVID Crisis Tracker](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/?rf=1). These measures have included pay freezes, pay cuts, furloughs, and layoffs — which all have very real economic impacts upon lawyers, staff, and their families.

And Biglaw, of course, is just a microcosm of the legal industry writ large. In April alone, the legal sector [lost 64,000 jobs](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/legal-services-sector-shed-a-whopping-64000-jobs-last-month), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Is the end in sight? Maybe; there are signs that we are [starting to turn the corner](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-legal-profession-turns-the-corner/). But my own guess is that we still have more suffering in store before recovery.

2. Mental Health Effects.

To their credit, even before the pandemic, law firms were starting to pay more attention to the [mental health](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/mental-health/) of their lawyers and staff (with nudging from several sources, including Above the Law). This wasn’t a moment too soon, since the COVID-19 crisis has only [exacerbated the challenges on this front](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/biglaw-firms-must-attend-to-lawyers-mental-health-during-the-covid-19-crisis/).

Fears of the disease, worries over financial problems, and loneliness from isolation have caused anxiety and depression to spike within the legal profession. The Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC) recently [polled its members](https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2020/06/12/how-stressed-are-in-house-lawyers-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/) and reported these findings:

Nearly 50% reported “feeling tired or having little energy” while also having trouble sleeping. More than 43% were experiencing anxiety; 40% had trouble concentrating; nearly 22% reported an “increased use of substances,” such as alcohol and tobacco; and nearly 19% said they’d been depressed. Nearly 44% had anxiety. Unsurprisingly, nearly 50% of respondents reported having trouble switching off from work and nearly 75% were experiencing moderate to very high levels of burnout.

Of course, many of us don’t need a survey to tell us this; we’ve been experiencing it firsthand. And anxiety and depression have ripple effects, harming lawyers’ ability to serve their clients, to be good colleagues, and to be there for their families and communities.

3. The Disadvantages Of Remote Learning.

This past spring, law schools abruptly went virtual, consistent with efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and government stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders. Looking ahead to the fall, some schools have already announced plans for virtual or online-only semesters, including [Harvard Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/harvard-law-school-to-hold-all-fall-2020-classes-online-due-to-coronavirus/) and [Berkeley Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/t14-law-school-to-hold-all-fall-2020-classes-online-due-to-coronavirus/).

Law school deans, professors, and staff should be commended for their noble efforts to make this work. But there’s pretty much universal agreement that online learning is suboptimal — a poor substitute for classroom education. It’s simply much harder for students to pay attention and to participate in virtual classes.

And not all students have the resources or technology to take full advantage of online classes. It’s worth noting that when HLS announced its move to remote learning for the fall, it also [announced](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/registrar/hls-fall-term-2020-frequently-asked-questions/#hlsnav-academics-and-learning-experience) that it was setting aside $1 million to assist students with challenges relating to internet access and other essential technology.

To sum up: law firms, law schools, and the courts are doing a superb job of responding to the terrible crisis created by COVID-19. But there’s no denying that it is, in fact, a terrible crisis. And we’re all looking forward to its end.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Hint: Frank Aquila, partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, said, “M&A transactions will nevertheless have to contend with inflation, Fed interest rate increases and a slowdown in economic growth. These could make for another challenging year for dealmakers.”

See the answer on the next page.

# Biglaw Firm Tells Associates Exactly How Many Times They Need To Check Their Emails Over The Weekend
## Nice effort but there are some caveats.

Magic Circle firm Slaughter and May [has reportedly](https://www.ft.com/content/7889ac74-e90f-4602-ab3f-232814dd1807) issued a “Working Practices Code” designed to provide standards — and improve work/life balance — for associates’ responsiveness.

Specifically, the code makes it clear it is not necessary to turn your camera on on a video call between the hours of 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. Additionally, the expectation is that associates will check their email once on a Friday night and twice a day over the weekend and not at all between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. Of course, the firm did issue this caveat: “unless you are working on a matter/s where you consider that to be necessary.”

Oh, and there’s another big stipulation — the firm’s code makes it clear “for this to work, you need to be reachable by phone.”

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As a firm partner noted, while the firm needs “to empower people to behave like normal human beings and have their own expectations of a life,” the client is still #1. “Ultimately, the client comes first. We’re a bit like a five-star hotel. We’re very expensive… [clients know] that if you call room service at 2 a.m. for a sundae, you’ll get one.”

Legal Cheek[ reports](https://www.legalcheek.com/2022/10/ditch-cameras-on-night-time-video-calls-and-no-need-to-check-emails-more-than-twice-a-day-at-weekends-slaughters-tells-lawyers-in-wellbeing-push/) partner Steve Cooke’s take:

“The need for the Code became clear during the conversations we had as part of the Associate Review earlier this year where, after a period of intense home working, the unnecessary incursions people were experiencing into their downtime periods were more pronounced. The Code attempts to rectify that with some simple principles”.

It’s nice to see a firm taking a proactive approach to balance the demands of Biglaw with a real life.

# Absolutely Insane Law Firm Recruiting Pamphlet
## You have to feel bad for these lawyers.

The early 2000s were a magical time in the legal industry. Biglaw was booming and jobs were so plentiful you could, say, [jump half-naked into the Hudson River at a firm event](https://abovethelaw.com/2006/11/an-update-on-aquagirl-things-are-going-swimmingly/) and still get an offer. Lawyers were as gods back then.

The flipside of the plentiful job market was the intense competition among Biglaw firms to land law students positively stacked with options. Summer program events became more and more outlandish, every day brought another five-star meal, and partners promised the moon to anyone willing to join up. Every callback was like a new Tinder hookup, except you knew when it all settled down and you found your perfect match, you’d have something far worse than gonorrhea to deal with for the next eight years or so.

It also brought us some particularly ridiculous recruiting materials. For example, this cheesetastic Skadden pamphlet distributed to law students in, by our best guess, around the summer of 2000. If you judge how “cool” your potential employer is based on how many ridiculous costumes and what kind of dumb wordplay they can shove in your face, then Skadden was your place back then.

For example:



That’s [Thomas Pak](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/thomas-pak), a counsel in the Antitrust and Competition Group. And he’s the “Leader of the Pak.” Get it? That’s why he’s on a motorcycle, like [in that song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Pack) from 60s that wasn’t more cool back in 2000 than it is today. Except he’s on a moped, transforming an already campy joke — probably featuring Pak dressed up like Brando, another woefully out-of-touch cultural reference to that audience — and making it a nonsensical one as well.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Not since Larry David played [Frank Costanza’s divorce attorney](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/30/62/7f/30627f3ea19ca8375c565d1ce5a3131c.jpg) has there been less need to put a lawyer in a cape. That’s [Eric Manne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-manne-91635558), now Deputy General Counsel at AIG, but back then he was at the mercy of the Skadden public relations folks who forced him to play “Super-Manne,” and holy hell, where was anyone with a groan detector when this thing was still in proofs?



This is Elizabeth Devine, then an associate in Skadden’s Chicago office, and it appears that she made Counsel at some point before leaving the firm altogether. Perhaps someday we’ll find her in the mountains of Tibet training a new generation of lawyers and/or Kung Fu monks.



I can’t quite make out Ms. Payne’s first name, but apparently smiling and lifting a five-pound weight is Skadden’s interpretation of “No Pain, No Gain,” which seems to miss the mark even worse than putting the leader of a rebel biker gang on a moped.

# Top Transactional Firms By Law School Pedigree

[](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-rankings-top-transactional-law-firms-by-pedigree)The law remains the only profession in which, even decades after graduation, your peers actually care about where you went to school. Part of that is because lawyers have few objective measures of competence: you can’t point to a won-lost record, and bragging about your billing rates is not something clients really want to hear.

Part of it is because the risk averse people attracted to the law use prestige as a proxy for safety and success.

With that in mind, we present the second installment of the ATL Pedigree rankings: [ Top Transactional Firms By Pedigree](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-rankings-top-transactional-law-firms-by-pedigree). (Last year, we published the [Litigation](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/top-litigation-firms-by-law-school-pedigree-2015/) version of this ranking. Based on your clicks, your derision of the concept of “prestige” is matched only by your desire to see it ranked.)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This ranking continues our Kafkaesque look at the interplay between law school and law firm rankings, focusing on transactional practice. Do firms confer prestige on schools? Do prestigious law students self-select the most prestigious firms? How much prestige do you need before clients will pay for it?

Our [Top Transactional Firms By Pedigree](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2016-rankings-top-transactional-law-firms-by-pedigree) ranking is the fulfillment of its own prophecy. Are you not entertained?

# If You Have The Chance To Work In Biglaw, Take It!
## Got debt? Take a job right out of law school that pays the most money.

I am sure that everyone knows people who obtained a legal education in order to serve the greater good.  When I was in law school, I had classmates who wanted to be prosecutors, public defenders, and other types of lawyers that promote the public welfare.  Many of my friends who were “public interested” did not even bother interviewing for jobs in Biglaw, since they were content with forgoing the opportunity to earn a higher paycheck in order to pursue their dreams of entering public service.

Although I respect anyone who enters the public sector, it is undeniable that law school is extremely expensive.  As a result, it might be very difficult for someone to pay off the massive amount of student debt usually incurred during law school while working a public service job.  It is true that income-based repayment programs exist, and some law schools, like my alma mater Georgetown Law, have loan repayment assistance programs that help individuals in public interest fields pay off their debt.  However, not everyone can take advantage of loan assistance programs, and many individuals do not have enough debt to justify an income-based repayment plan or do not intend to stay in a public interest job long enough to obtain debt forgiveness.

For anyone who is considering a career in public service, but has the chance to work in Biglaw, I have a suggestion:  Take the job right out of law school that pays the most money.  It may sound like I am suggesting that public interest folks “sell out,” but let me explain my perspective.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It is undeniable that a person has the biggest ability to influence their student loan fate right after graduating from law school than at any other point in one’s career.  This is because of the effect of [capitalizing interest](https://www.salliemae.com/student-loans/manage-your-private-student-loan/understand-student-loan-payments/learn-about-interest-and-capitalization/), that same concept your elders have probably pointed to when arguing that you should save for retirement as soon as you can.  In the case of student loans, capitalizing interest is your worst nightmare, and the more debt you pay off today, the less interest upon interest you will have to pay in the future.  This is why it is advisable to take a high-paying job right after law school so the most money can be devoted toward paying down student debt as soon as possible.

In addition, your first job out of law school is not going to massively determine the fate of your entire legal career.  In the past, attorneys stayed at one firm for decades and made entire careers under one roof.  In the “new economy,” however, it is not uncommon for young attorneys to change jobs frequently and even enter completely different parts of the legal profession.  This means that it is easier than ever for an individual to cool their heels in a high-paying gig for a few years before entering a part of the legal profession that brings more fulfillment.  Also, it is worth mentioning that many large law firms have robust pro bono programs and donate money to charities.  Therefore, anyone interested in public service can still make fulfilling contributions to worthy causes while working in Biglaw.

Furthermore, you are best able to work the longer hours that many higher-paying jobs require when you are at the beginning of your career.  People naturally have fewer personal commitments right after they graduate from law school than they might have later in life, which makes working more demanding jobs easier when you are younger.  Also, younger individuals usually have fewer expenses, so any extra income can be devoted to paying down student loans.  In addition, high-paying positions in Biglaw are notoriously difficult to obtain later in one’s career, so one should strike while the iron’s hot, and take such an opportunity should the chance arise.

Taking a high-paying job right out of law school will also allow you to pay down debt without making sacrifices in other parts of your life.  After I left Biglaw, I personally had to work several side-hustles and live frugally in order to expedite student loan payments.  If you have a higher paycheck from your primary job, however, you do not need to make other sacrifices to pay off debt.  Ultimately, delaying your aspirations for a few years to assume a higher-paying gig will ensure you do not have to incur other life sacrifices, and this trade-off makes taking a higher-paying job right out of law school even more worthwhile.

Of course, this approach is not for everyone, and there are some individuals that really cannot see themselves doing anything but public service work.  I completely understand this mentality.  It is also true that only a fraction of law students will even have the opportunity to work in Biglaw right after graduating from law school.  However, you can best control how much money you devote to student loans through where you decide to work.  And if you can bear deferring your dreams for a few years, the reward of financial freedom might just be worth it.

# Conversation: Is Legal Even Ready For Tech?
## Perspectives on the state of technology and disruption in the legal industry.

In an [interview earlier this year](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/how-the-legal-industry-will-become-industrial-a-conversation-with-axiom-ceo-mark-harris/), Axiom’s founder and then CEO Mark Harris fired a shot at the state of technology in the legal industry:

By contrast, selling tech-only solutions into the legal industry today would be like selling a conveyer belt to a blacksmith in the late 1800s.  You cannot sell the instruments of industrialization to artisans!  They aren’t ready for them and have no idea what to do with them!

Shortly after our conversation went live, I started getting all kinds of reactions from folks across the legal industry — technologists and forward-thinking lawyers. Some agreed with Harris’ assessment and some disagreed, but no two responses were the same.

So today, less than a week before lawyers and tech companies from around the world converge on New York for the annual [Legaltech Show](http://legalweekshow.com/legaltech/), I’ve invited a number of prominent legal tech executives and lawyers, both in-house counsel and decision makers inside law firms, to react to the quote and offer their perspective on the state of technology and disruption in the legal industry. New replies will continue rolling in over the course of the day and beyond, so click FOLLOW to follow along like a fly-on-the-wall as the conversation unfolds.

I would also like to thank [kCura, developers of Relativity](https://www.kcura.com/relativity/ediscovery-products/overview/) for sponsoring this conversation and helping advance the broader conversation on law and technology.

# Biglaw's Throwing Around $500,000 Signing Bonuses In Red Hot Lateral Market
## The eye-popping signing bonuses for lateral associates.

We know the Biglaw lateral market is [super hot right](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/the-biglaw-lateral-market-is-fire-right-now/) now. And it’s a job applicant’s market, so firms that want to keep their associates are throwing money at ’em (in the form of special bonuses and raises), and even retention bonuses on top of all that other money — if you’re lucky enough to work in a [super valuable practice area](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/is-skadden-arps-handing-out-retention-bonuses-to-only-some-associates/).

So attracting new associates has become a priority for Biglaw. And, as [reported by ](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/The-latest-shortage-in-Texas-lawyers-16557414.php)the Houston Chronicle, the value of a lateral associate has reached the $500,000 signing bonus level. And still, the shortage of Biglaw lawyers continues:

“We have hired a dozen lawyers the past few months and we have a dozen new lawyers starting this next week and we need several more right away,” said Kevin Lewis, co-managing partner of the Houston office of Sidley Austin. “Between 1998 and 2000, tech was going crazy keeping us all busy. Now, it is every practice group. I have never seen anything like this.”

“We are injecting a couple trillion dollars into the economy and interest rates remain near to nothing,” Lewis said. “It is a recipe for everyone (staying) busy all the time,” he said.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Texas, in particular, has seen an associate crunch as non-Texas firms are [expanding](https://www.omm.com/our-firm/media-center/press-releases/omelveny-expands-into-texas/) into the state or [growing](https://www.kirkland.com/news/press-release/2021/04/kirkland-opens-austin-office) the firm’s footprint. That, plus the influx of deals, has had a profound impact on the market:

Travis Wofford, who is vice chair of the global corporate legal practice at crosstown rival Baker Botts, said the Houston-headquartered firm saw a 24 percent increase in new clients between January and the end of July.
“There is an economic transition taking place in Texas, and law firms are front and center and are going to have to meet the demand,” Wofford said. “It has been insane. We are doing deals at a near record pace.”

All of which means there are just not enough qualified attorneys to go around:

“For the past several months, nearly all our clients have approached us with multiple needs within multiple practice areas,” said Amanda Pickering, a legal recruiter at Amicus Search Group. “There are not enough lawyers to fill the open spots. The talent pool is not growing fast enough.”

# Biglaw Partner Leaves Firm After Being Reprimanded For DWI, Battery Charges
## The firm wasn't very happy with his ethical transgressions.

State supreme courts that oversee lawyers’ ethical transgressions generally don’t take kindly to members of the bar who rack up criminal charges. A Biglaw partner recently received a public reprimand for his allegedly drunken escapes, and now he’s left the firm because of them.

Jeffrey McIntyre, 58, a partner at Husch Blackwell who practiced in the firm’s IP and business litigation group, was publicly reprimanded by the Wisconsin Supreme Court after committing two criminal acts that called into question his “honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The first incident occurred in December 2017, when McIntyre punched a bar manager in the face on Christmas Day. The [Wisconsin State Journal](https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime-and-courts/madison-attorney-gets-public-reprimand-from-state-supreme-court/article_25e6e5ee-f241-50ca-8a89-03b0d30f0e98.html#anchor_item_2) has the details:

The altercation occurred after McIntyre and two women were not happy the bar they were at was closing for the night. After one of the women urinated on the bar’s floor, the bar manager called police and followed the three to the apartment building, and ended up getting punched by McIntyre.

McIntyre pleaded guilty in May 2018 to a charge of misdemeanor battery, which formed the basis for the first violation of the Supreme Court rules.

In February 2018, three months before McIntyre pleaded guilty to battery, he was pulled over for speeding and received a DWI for having a blood alcohol level of 0.143. In October 2018, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and was sentenced to 60 days in jail (but received privileges that allowed him to leave jail for work). McIntyre had two prior convictions for DWI from March 2003 and in August 2014. The third time was not the charm for his career.

McIntyre’s bio appeared on the Husch Blackwell website until yesterday morning, but was promptly removed by yesterday afternoon. It’s available [here](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:nXgP_g3VX2AJ:https://www.huschblackwell.com/professionals/jeffrey-mcintyre+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) via Google cache.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Husch Blackwell was obviously none too pleased with McIntyre’s behavior, releasing this statement announcing that McIntyre had left the firm:

We were surprised and disappointed to learn of Jeff’s misconduct and the resulting Supreme Court reprimand. Obviously, our firm does not condone or tolerate his behavior. Jeff has withdrawn from the firm, and as of today, he is no longer affiliated with Husch Blackwell.

As a friendly reminder, don’t drink and drive. It’s a danger to yourself, others, and your legal career. If you believe you have a drinking problem, please call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at 1-800-662-HELP, or reach out to a [lawyer assistance program](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/lawyer_assistance/resources/lap_programs_by_state.html) in your state (don’t be fooled by the name; these programs also provide services to law students).

Back in 2021, Britney Spears hired Greenberg Traurig partner [Mathew Rosengart](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/professionals/r/rosengart-mathew-s) to [free her](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/its-greenberg-traurig-bitch-britney-spears-hires-a-biglaw-partner/) from more than a decade of conservatorship. The [“tough as nails” litigator](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/15/who-is-britney-spears-new-lawyer) (per Sean Penn) did, in fact, free the legendary pop star from her conservatorship, but as could be expected, his legal fees cost a pretty penny. And now, those legal fees are plastered in an all-caps headline on TMZ:

[BRITNEY SPEARS PAID LAWYER MATHEW ROSENGART LAW FIRM $4.2M IN LEGAL FEES](https://www.tmz.com/2023/05/12/britney-spears-paid-lawyer-mathew-rosengart-legal-fees-conservatorship-termination/)

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ, Britney has paid Rosengart’s firm $4,201,856 for the period November 2021 through March 2023. That represents the legal work Rosengart performed mostly after the conservatorship ended.

OH MY GOD. Can you believe it? Well… yeah.

Over the course of about a two-year period, Spears, a celebrity client in legal turmoil, was allegedly charged more than $4 million in fees for zealous representation to resolve a unique issue and all of the attendant matters that arose thereafter — like the seemingly never-ending case against her father as well as a book deal, to name just a few things.

When you hire a Biglaw firm, you’re going to pay Biglaw prices. Greenberg Traurig is an elite firm that brought in $2,171,720,000 in gross revenue in 2022. Fees like these are not at all out of the ordinary. Spears paid top dollar for her attorney’s talent. This should not be shocking.

In fact, the fees that TMZ cites here — if true — for Rosengart’s representation actually compare favorably to what Ms. Spears had to pay to Holland & Knight, including more than half a million for “media matters,” over the course of just eight months’ time (approximately $1.4 million) when nothing of note was accomplished. Rosengart, on the other hand, not only successfully defeated motions to have his client’s deposition taken but also filed numerous motions regarding her father, Jamie Spears, whose Willkie Farr lawyer was [bullying and harassing](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/leave-britney-alone-biglaw-partner-says-britney-spears-is-being-bullied-and-harassed-by-her-fathers-new-lawyer/) the musical superstar through legal process.

If anything, the legal fees here were reasonable and fair. No wonder Britney [“simply adore[s]”](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/britney-spears-simply-adores-this-biglaw-partner/) Mathew Rosengart.

# With Bonus Season Around The Corner, More Associates Are Sticking Around At Their Firms
## 'We’re no longer in that war-for-talent phase,' said a leader of a top Biglaw firm.

Times sure have changed, and lawyers are now sticking around at their firms.

We’re in a technical recession here in the US, and lawyers at the largest of law firms have been staring down a slowdown in work. What does that mean for the lateral market? Compared to the frenzied hiring cycle we saw back in 2021 and even at the start of this year, things have significantly cooled down, and associates and partners alike are staying put at their firms.

How is this return to relative stability in terms of personnel affecting Biglaw firms? For that, we turn to a new report from [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2022/09/14/people-arent-leaving-law-firms-are-seeing-stickier-lawyers/):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Lawyers are becoming “stickier,” especially as the fourth quarter approaches, both due to individual prospects and because of more deliberate hiring from law firms.

Julie Jones, chair of Ropes & Gray, said while there is still some pressure on the lateral market, her firm’s attrition has been at pre-pandemic levels and lower since the end of the first quarter.

“Now that things have cooled and people have their heads about them, people aren’t leaving. I know it reflects a shift in the market. We’re no longer in that war-for-talent phase,” she said in an interview. “You always need to keep and invest in your talent, but we don’t have that frenzy, and we see that in our attrition rates.”

It’s not just the slowdown in work that could be keeping people around at their firms. David Foltyn, CEO of Honigman, acknowledged that right now, folks at his firm “are a little stickier than they were last year,” but noted that it could be seasonal in nature. “The way most firms are structured, partners are not advantaged by leaving in the fourth quarter,” Foltyn told Law.com. “They need to be there to get their proper year-end, and my guess is the associates are waiting to see what kinds of bonuses they get.”

(On that note, of course associates are waiting for bonus season to roll around, and we can’t wait to start our annual coverage. Stay tuned.)

Beyond these compensation issues, law firm leaders are saying they’re seeing less attrition and it’s making it easier to rightsize their firms and manage the lateral activity that they do have.

The slowdown on the lateral market has also allowed law firms to return to strategic hiring. They can now be a little more selective in trying to expand their practices, rather than just trying to find as many bodies as they can to keep up with them and eating the costs later.

“They’re asking themselves a few more questions related to hires,” said Tony Williams, a London-based principal at Jomati Consultants and former managing partner of Clifford Chance. “Particularly in the States, where salaries have gone up so much in the last couple years, you have to think, ‘Do I really want to add another quarter million of costs if I think things are going to slow down a bit? Or do I want to wait and see what happens?’”

At this point, barring a major downturn in the economy, law firm financials for 2022 are significantly “baked in,” Williams said. But 2023 is still a major question mark. Most firm leaders he’s speaking with are strategizing based on a simple rule of thumb. “Hope for the best and plan for the worst,” he said.

Jennifer Bard

You’d think that raising a law school’s U.S. News and World Report ranking by 22 spots would result in some measure of job security for a law dean. At the University of Cincinnati College of Law, that assumption does not seem to be true.

(Update: The language above regarding raising the school’s ranking 22 spots was taken from [reports](http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2017/03/19/university-of-cincinnati-law-dean-under-fire-from.html) of Provost Landgren’s statement regarding Dean Bard. The law school did increase its ranking 22 spots from 2016 to 2017, however, in the most recent 2018 rankings [released earlier this month](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/leaked-are-these-the-2018-u-s-news-law-school-rankings/2/), Cincinnati Law took a tumble, down 12 spots. Cincinnati Law is currently ranked 72nd in the USNWR rankings, up a net of 10 spots since before Dean Bard took over.)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Cincinnati Business Courier [reports](http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2017/03/19/university-of-cincinnati-law-dean-under-fire-from.html) that a group of faculty at Cincinnati Law are quite upset with dean Jennifer Bard. Bard was hired in 2015 and has said she was hired, in part, to shepherd the law school through a financial shortfall. But her efforts were, apparently, not well received. The Courier obtained documents that reflect the desire of a group of faculty to call a no-confidence vote. Though the docs don’t reveal specific allegations against the law school’s first female dean, they do shed light on an environment of discontent:

In a Nov. 22, 2016 email, law professor Emily Houh stated “it will be very important for [interim university provost] Peter (Landgren) to understand we are prepared to take a vote of no confidence so that he understands the gravity of the situation.”

….

“It has come to my attention that some faculty members have approached the interim provost at the University of Cincinnati to request the removal of Dean Bard,” law professor Betsy Malloy wrote in an email to a group of 29 law faculty. “This news came as a bit of a shock because it appears to have been a request by only a portion of the faculty and a request for an outsider to solve what is clearly an important problem to many of the law faculty.”

In order to regain the trust of the faculty, interim provost Landgren created a six-month plan to improve the situation at the school. The plan is guided by the following principles:

* Coaching, with Bard working with a coach to identify and understand faculty’s concerns and develop effective ways to address them.
* Mediated communication to see if there’s a possibility of finding common ground. The document suggests Bard meet directly with the faculty and other constituencies with the assistance of a mediator.
* Periodic evaluation and objective metrics to assess the effectiveness of the plan and get feedback to make adjustments.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
[Bard said in a statement](http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2017/03/21/exclusive-uc-law-dean-responds-to-call-for-her.html) that the tension between her and faculty arose because she was making moves to improve the financial future of the school. The law school, under her direction, has moved to integrate the law library with the university library, changed faculty travel procedures, and made other changes to decrease the deficit, and Bard believes these changes are at the heart of the conflict:

“Because UC operated for some time with interim leaders in both the president’s and provost’s office, the disaffected group of tenured law professors worked to exploit this leadership vacuum to preserve the status quo, derail the progress I have achieved and try to push me out of the dean’s position,” Bard wrote.

And Landgren has acknowledged Bard’s accomplishments in increasing the ranking of the school, addressing donor concerns, and working on diversity initiatives. But…

“Dean Bard’s accomplishments may have been achieved at the cost of other ideals (which are at the heart of this conflict).”

Landgren also wrote in December that a change on the part of Bard alone will not be enough. He wrote that success over the next six months requires two-way communication, mutual understanding of all of the perspectives involved and a willingness to work cooperatively with mutual respect and responsibility.

Despite the complaints from both sides, Bard seems to recognize the need for more communication between herself and the faculty, ending her response with a call to dialogue. But it was also revealed, through the media’s public records request, that Bard reads the faculty emails complaining about her… awkward.

# Ex-Law Student Pleads Guilty To Terrorizing Admissions Interviewer After Rejection From T14 Law School
## He's looking at up to five years in prison.

Say you’re applying to law school and you’ve got your heart dead set on attending Georgetown Law. You manage to secure an admissions interview with a local alumnus from the school, but you “performed poorly” during the interview — so poorly, in fact, that the law school rejects your application a week later. You wind up enrolling at UT Law, just a step below the T14, but you’re still so enraged that this alumnus stripped you of the opportunity to attend a more prestigious law school that you decide to embark upon 18-month cyberstalking campaign to make this person’s life as hellish as yours has seemingly become. Things didn’t go as planned, and now you’re looking at up to five years in prison. Oopsie…

Meet [Ho Ka Terence Yung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terence-yung-286a9a29/), who was arrested last year when he was a third-year student at UT Law. He’s been in custody since February 2017, and earlier this week, Yung pleaded guilty to one count of cyberstalking. His efforts to intimidate the Georgetown alumnus were referred to by a [federal judge](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2018/10/24/cyberstalker-wilmington-georgetown-harassment-law-school-rejection/1753940002/) as “a disturbing mix of violence and sexual degradation that actually resulted in complete strangers approaching the victim’s home.” Wow. This is not a good look for a law student.

According to David Weiss, U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware, Yung “pursued a sustained, sadistic course of conduct designed to terrorize his victim and the victim’s family—all because the defendant was denied admission to the law school of his choice.” Here’s an excerpt from the Justice Department’s announcement of Yung’s plea that describes just some of his twisted cyberstalking schemes:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Ho Ka Terence Yung (Photo via LinkedIn)

Yung repeatedly published violent and sadistic statements about Victim 1 on the Internet – including descriptions of rape, lynching, sexual molestation, and graphic violence. As just one example, the defendant posted a false story about Victim 1 on a public website, which involved the abduction of an eight-year old girl from an elementary school. In this story, the defendant described kidnapping the little girl at gunpoint, cutting off her clothes with a knife, and raping her.

Yung also repeatedly posted personal ads on Craigslist and other websites with the intent that individuals interested in violent and sadistic sexual activity would go to Victim 1’s residence in the middle of the night. For example, on October 29, 2015, the defendant posed as a “cute blonde hottie” and posted an ad on Craigslist stating, among other things:

i need a big strong man to dominate me tonight . . . i like it when a man puts his hand around my throat and threatens me with a knife . . . then you pull my hair and take out your gun and threaten me . . . i’m a bad girl, and I need to be punished by a big strong man. send me a picture with you holding your gun. all others will be ignored.

Notably, the above ad was published a day after local police stopped a man outside of Victim 1’s residence in the middle of the night, who was looking for Victim 1’s wife. He was responding to a similar Craigslist ad and the defendant directed him to Victim 1’s residence.

According to one federal judge, Yung’s conduct “points to a psychopathic mind.” He will remain in custody pending his sentencing, which is scheduled for February 27.

As an FYI for prospective law students, just in case it wasn’t inherently obvious, this is not the way to deal with a law school rejection. It looks like Ho Ka Terence Yung learned this lesson the hard way — and soon he’ll be doing hard time for it.

# Even A Billion Dollars In Revenue Can't Stop COVID-19 Layoffs
## Am Law 50 firm lays off staff amid coronavirus upheaval.

By all accounts, Goodwin Procter is a pretty successful law firm. In 2018, the most recent year for which full financials are available, they joined the [Billion Dollar Club](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/biglaws-billion-dollar-club-keeps-growing). With gross revenue of $1,198,625,000 that year, [the firm takes the 26th spot](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=123&name=Goodwin-Procter) in the 2019 Am Law 200 ranking. But even those impressive financials can’t stop the economical upheaval caused by the novel coronavirus.

According to Above the Law tipsters, ~50 staff members were laid off by the Biglaw firm. A Goodwin Procter spokesperson confirmed the cuts and provided the following statement:

We recently reviewed the performance and size of our global operations team given the current and anticipated effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy. As a result of our analysis, we made the difficult decision to ask a limited number of our global operations team members to leave the firm. We are providing severance packages, based on tenure, to impacted employees. In addition, we will make continued contribution to healthcare benefits through September 30, 2020 for all affected personnel. Our global operations team continues to play a key role in supporting the firm’s operations, lawyers and clients across the business of law.

And while the firm certainly seems to be doing the best they can by these now former employees, from the tips we’ve received, folks aren’t impressed. One tipster reported being “shocked” and these are a sampling of the more choice comments ATL has received:

Gave blood and sweat to this firm for [XX} years and this is how we get treated.

They made one billion last year and they just laid off 50 people in the middle of this virus. Corporate greed.

We here at Above the Law wish the best to all those who find themselves without work during this global health crisis.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Want Our Business? Don’t Forget Your Discount
## While discounts may not make or break every engagement, you can be sure they will help start each new engagement on the right foot.

Recently I got a call from our CFO’s office informing me they were declining to authorize our contract for outside counsel.

I was a bit stunned.

Sure the CFO’s office routinely gives my legal colleagues and I a hard time about our outside counsel spend, but to flat out decline to authorize a contact, this was a new one.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I immediately set out in search of our CFO both out of a bit of anger she had the gall to hold up one of my contracts, and a bit out of the angst over what might happen if she really doubled down and refused to approve it. After all, the outside counsel was already accruing some billable hours as they agreed to jump in on a time-sensitive matter before their contract had made the official rounds.

Failure to approve this contract in particular would not only cause me to have to eat crow, but it could hamper my ability to engage with future outside firms if word spread our hospital does honor its verbal agreements.

Almost as soon as I burst into our CFO’s office, she immediately disarmed me by stating that she had no problem with the contract, but she had held on approving the contract as the billable hourly rates listed did not reflect a discount.

After letting out a sigh of relief my outside counsel would indeed be paid for their work, I kicked myself for not having caught the omission earlier and was a bit miffed at the outside counsel, whom I had used on several occasions before, for not automatically including a discount in the first place.

It’s well known in the in-house counsel world that Biglaw hourly rates are not based on science and are open to negotiation. This is not meant to be a political statement on the merit of such rates, but rather a statement that it is known such rates are not set in stone.

In fact, it has become such common knowledge, our CFO — who holds a CPA, not a JD — even knows to look for discounts in all outside counsel contracts.

Especially on large engagements for sizable firms, the discount is usually a drop in the bucket compared to your total take. Likewise for us in-house: we know to expect a big invoice at the end of your engagement, so any discount generally does not do much to move the needle toward meaningful savings.

But it is a matter of principle.

Whether it is a new client or a long-standing one; a big company or a small one; a church or a corporation, any discount offered is noticed and appreciated.

# What To Expect At ILTACON 2023
## Here’s a sneak peek at what’s adding to the excitement.

Propelled by intense interest in emerging legal technology, the International Legal Technology Association’s (ILTA) largest event venue, an unprecedented demand for business partner sponsorships and potentially the largest number of full-week participants in history, the anticipation surrounding this August’s ILTACON23 conference is palpable.     

What’s driving all the interest? Certainly, the demand for education and training related to artificial intelligence, legal process automation and cyber-security related to legal technology is important. As is the desire for human interaction and live experiences not unlike that fueling the intensive summer travel season. And, of course, anything and everything related to knowledge management, large language models (LLMs), legal standards, integrations and the like perks up most technologists’ ears as well.   

But over and above general industry buzz and interest, ILTACON 2023 strives to deliver innovative content and unique experiences to the membership and sponsors. Here’s a sneak peek at what’s adding to the excitement – the highly impressive set of programs and services ILTA is delivering in Orlando.

Engagement

ILTA has gone above and beyond building connectivity opportunities between participants. Klik wearable technology will allow one-touch connectivity to foster lead generation. On the human side, the Buddy program, fueled by ILTA volunteer veterans, is designed to quickly acclimate first time attendees.

Many other groups and programs, such as the Woman Who Lead, Volunteer Committee and Strategic Partner Liaison Group, conduct efforts to help connect attendees and business partners. There are opportunities to volunteer for those looking for a hands-on way to help and meet people. 

And loads of fun things – like block parties, golf events, running groups, yoga meetups and lots of others – add to the collaboration opportunities.

Education

It is well documented that ILTACON is the premier educational and networking event for the legal sector.

The gathering features over 80 educational sessions curated by the ILTACON Planning Committee. Daily keynotes offer perspective on technology and the industry, and distinctive programs such as the application of DISC profiles to raise team effectiveness are offered.

Attendees can absorb a diverse set of topics, ranging from staffing/salary, using the cloud, results of technology surveys, security elements, AI/LLM, process improvement, legal services pricing, industry standards, the list is close to endless. Interestingly, it is important to note programs are developed by ILTA volunteers, so they are highly topical.

And finally, sessions are supported by a robust exhibit hall providing learning opportunities about products powering improvement in the legal profession, allowing participants to quickly shift from theory to practice and back again.

Product Information

Speaking of the Exhibit Hall, almost 200 of the leading technology software, hardware and service providers will be in Orlando. They’ll offer booth displays, demo rooms, product update sessions and small group sessions with various law firm groups. 

Importantly, leading business partners are not only conducting sessions with large firms, but also with midsize and small firms during the conference. We also expect the usual tsunami of product announcements, which one can only assume will be heavily weighted towards how AI is increasingly a factor in the profession.

There are a close to endless set of opportunities for the curious to satisfy their thirst for legal technology knowledge in the Exhibit Hall and via various information sessions offered by ILTA’s sponsors and business partners. 

Networking and Entertainment

Last, but certainly not least, a bevy of opportunity exists for growing one’s professional network. 

Informal connections are easy to make during ILTA lunches, vendor sponsored breakfasts or at the many parties offered during the week. ILTA themselves offer a unique performance by a legal technology-oriented band, and multiple comedy shows. 

And there is no shortage of delicious business partner dinners or cocktails to be had during the various happy hours. But perhaps the best connections are made during the numerous coffee meetups and hallway conversations at the event. 

In Closing

I can’t complete a preview of the conference without complimenting the International Legal Technology Association staff for everything they do to plan this event. It’s hard to imagine a more pleasant, appreciative, caring, and hardworking group of people. 

They often tell me and all the volunteers how much they appreciate our efforts, now it’s my turn to do the same. Thank you ILTA for putting this together, and I hope all attendees have a fruitful, fun time at ILTACON 2023.

# Biglaw Firms Push Back Their Reopening Dates Due To Latest COVID Variant, Some 'Indefinitely'
## Will your law firm be adjusting its course due to the new viral variant?

The end of 2021 is nearly upon us, and Biglaw firms across the country are being forced to reevalute their reopening plans thanks to the latest COVID-19 variant to rear its ugly head. The omicron variant is surging across the country, and it’s even more transmissible than the delta variant. Remember when law firms were so hopeful that they’d be able to get their workforces back to the office come January 2022? Not anymore.

Magic Circle firms in the UK have already told their personnel to [start working from home](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/uk-magic-circle-firms-bring-back-covid-19-remote-work-requirements-thanks-to-omicron-variant/), and quite a few US firms have already revised their return-to-office plans (see [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/litigation-boutique-revises-its-hybrid-return-to-office-plan-due-to-omicron-variant/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/goodwin-rto-march-2022/), [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/sidley-bans-the-unvaccinated-from-the-office/), and [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/biglaw-firms-delay-reopenings-due-to-omicron-variant-setting-returns-for-april-and-beyond/)). The latest firms to announce changes to their office return plans are just going with the viral flow, and will reconsider their efforts if and when they can.

While Morrison & Foerster has made in-office work voluntary until at least February 14, Loeb & Loeb is going one step further. [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/12/28/calif-law-firms-again-delay-their-office-returns-some-indefinitely/) has the details:

Loeb & Loeb has indefinitely pushed back its previous return date of Jan. 10, a firm spokesperson confirmed to Law.com on Tuesday. A new return date was not set, given “continued uncertainty” over omicron concerns, the firm said.

What has your firm announced as far as a revised reopening plan due to the omicron variant? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a new market standard for a return.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

What I was not expecting and really surprised me is the reaction I’ve received from other women who have said that my journey to making partner has been inspiring to them. Unlike many of my colleagues and peers, I worked in different practices at the firm, left to go in-house, and then returned. I also worked off-site and part time, and moved geographically. Given that I have such an unusual background, a number of women I work with who are shaping their careers have said it’s been motivating to see my path to success.

—Melissa Bender, Ropes & Gray partner, in an [interview with Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/04/10/how-i-made-partner-ropes-grays-melissa-bender/) on how she became partner, reveals that you don’t need to take a super traditional career path in order to make it to partner. Indeed, it can be quite inspiring to others still trying to make it to the top of the Biglaw heap.

# How Much Does Your Biglaw Firm Contributes To Climate Change?
## Biglaw firms tend to gravitate to the wrong kind of green.

Everyone is entitled to an attorney and lawyers are free to take on unpopular positions in pursuit of zealous advocacy. Now that we’ve got the platitudes out of the way, in reality, major law firms don’t pick up multiple millions from hard luck clients walking in off the street, they actively seek out the sort of legal work they take on. Indeed, firms build expertise in specific practice areas that they want to be in.

A new report from [Law Students for Climate Accountability](https://www.ls4ca.org/) set out to answer a simple question: how much do the Vault 100 firms contribute to anthropogenic climate change? The answer is, as you might imagine, a lot.

- Worked on ten times as many cases exacerbating climate change as addressing climate change: 286 cases compared to 27 cases.
- Were legal advisers on five times more transactional work for the fossil fuel industry than the renewable energy industry: $1.3 trillion of transactions compared to $271 billion of transactions.
- Lobbied five times more for fossil fuel companies than renewable energy companies: for $36.5 million in compensation compared to $6.8 million in compensation.

It’s not surprising that the deep pockets in the energy sector would reflect its dirtiest technologies. Decades on top leaves these technologies with more financial wherewithal that alternatives and unfortunately Biglaw operates as the shadow of the the most powerful global business entities. It might be nice to see more firms cross into the other lane:

“The fossil fuel industry does everything it can to avoid responsibility for the massive damage it’s done to our planet. One of the strongest weapons in that fight is litigation carried out by some of the most established law firms in the legal world,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. “It’s past time these firms reconsidered how they represent one of the most destructive industries in history, and there’s no reason law students should not consider this representation in deciding how to direct their careers. I applaud this important effort.”

Convincing some high-powered firms to lend their services to technologies of the future would offer a tangible benefit to the planet and having the pool of law students educated on what individual firms choose to do to make money can hit firms in the only place they care about almost as much as the bottom line: recruitment.

The website allows you to search individual firms for their climate report card, which looks like this:

# Biglaw Partners: Are You Capturing A Fair Share Of Your Revenue?

If you are a Biglaw partner, you may have heard this compensation rule of thumb: you should be taking home a third of the revenue you generate for the firm. The 33% rule has the advantage of being simple, and it makes for a reasonable starting point. But to really know whether you are capturing a fair share of the value you create, it’s important to consider some other factors.

Your hours vs. your team’s hours

The first distinction you’ll want to make is between the hours you bill and those billed by the people working for you, such as associates and service partners. The 33% rule is supposed to apply to all revenue for which you are responsible. But we can make things more precise by breaking that revenue into two segments.

As a general rule, you should make about 40% of revenue from hours you billed personally. As for the hours billed by members of your team, it depends how profitable those lawyers are for the firm. Associates at some firms are substantially more profitable than others. The more profitable your associates, and the more leverage your book has, the greater the share of your team’s revenue you can expect to take home.

RPL and leverage are the key metrics

To understand what share of team revenue should accrue to you, consider how your firm stacks up on two key metrics: revenue per lawyer (RPL) and leverage.

RPL is critical because it is so poorly correlated with associate salaries. You could imagine a different compensation model in which firms paid associates a standard share of the revenue they generated, either individually or on average across the firm. But as we know, that isn’t how this industry works. Instead, all top-tier firms pay associates more or less the same salaries based on class year. As a result, partners at firms with relatively high RPL get to divide a much larger profit pool than partners at “top” firms with low RPL.

Within the Am Law 100, the spread between high and low RPL is striking. Firms at the low end have RPL of around $500,000. For example, Lewis Brisbois is the lowest of the Am Law 100, at $434,000. Firms at the high end have RPL close to 4X that of the low-end firms. Sullivan & Cromwell, for example, clocks in above $1.9 million. (Wachtell is in a league of its own, with RPL in excess of $3.6 million.) Granted, a Sullivan & Cromwell associate earns higher total compensation than a Lewis Brisbois lawyer in the same class year, but that multiple is nowhere near 4X.

Now, RPL isn’t everything. We also have to consider leverage. If a partner’s book can feed a relatively large number of associates, the proportion of the team’s revenue that should accrue to the rainmaking partner will be higher. And to be fair to Lewis Brisbois, their partnership is doing well on that dimension, with leverage of 9.99 (second-highest among the Am Law 100).

How does your practice compare to the firm average?

Your firm’s overall RPL and leverage are important considerations, but unless the partnership has a pure lockstep compensation model, the performance of your practice relative to the firm average is also critical. A good starting point for thinking about this dimension is to compare the firm’s profit margin to the share of your revenue that you are taking home. For example, let’s say your firm’s profit margin is 45%. Are you being paid 45% of the revenue you are generating?

If not, consider how your practice may differ from others in the firm. Does it have lower leverage than the firm average? Are you personally billing fewer hours than your peers in the partnership? If the answer to both of these questions is no, then your compensation should reflect the firm profit margin. If it doesn’t, you are likely underpaid, and you may want to consider your options.

A rift might even be developing between Gorsuch and Chief Justice Roberts. [[CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/08/politics/neil-gorsuch-john-roberts-rivalry/index.html)] * Because Gorsuch is the Supreme Court's newest justice, he has to share his office with Leroy. He's being hazed by Scalia from beyond the grave. [[Associated Press](https://www.apnews.com/713aac20a6dd4144b7af75a6be354407)] * As part of its new legal strategy in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russian election interference investigation, the Trump administration has decided to -- gasp! -- be cooperative. Trump's lawyers think that maybe if they play nice, Mueller will publicly clear the president's name a little more quickly, or at all. [[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/us/politics/trump-russia-legal.html)] * In other news, President Trump took to Twitter this weekend to invoke the Federal Communications Commission's equal time rules because he's sick and tired of ""unfunny"" late-night TV hosts making fun of him without an opportunity to respond in kind. Perhaps you ought to stick with Twitter, Mr. President.

Even her own mother, Gloria Allred, [objected](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/mother-knows-best-gloria-allred-disses-daughters-decision-to-rep-harvey-weinstein/).

The child involved in this case is an 8-year-old boy, and the fellow who sexually assaulted his mother also happens to be a convicted sex offender. According to the victim's attorney, ""[t]his is insane""; she's not wrong.

# Another Firm Raises Its Clerkship Bonus; Is This A Trend In The Making?
## Are clerkship bonuses heading higher? Here's one new data point.

Your editors here at Above the Law [sometimes feel](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/10/ny-to-190k-not-so-fast-because-160k-salaries-are-no-longer-the-norm/) a bit like [Gretchen from Mean Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0): “ATL, stop trying to make [NY to 190](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-190/) happen. It’s not going to happen.”

While we wait for Biglaw base salaries to budge, we’ll have to settle for smaller bits of compensation news. In recent months, we’ve reported on specific Biglaw firms [moving (closer) to market rates](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-a-biglaw-firm-moves-closer-to-market/), as well as [certain](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-philadelphia-to-160k-this-time-for-real/) [other](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/delaware-moves-to-160k-new-york-should-be-embarrassed/) [cities](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/another-market-bumps-up-associate-salaries/) moving (closer) to the [Simpson Thacher scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/01/breaking-simpson-thacher-raises-associate-base-salaries/) (now more than nine years old).

And, of course, we cover clerkship bonuses. Back in January, leading litigation firm [Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/quinn-emanuel-urquhart-sullivan-llp/) announced that it was [raising its clerkship bonus to $75,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/clerkship-bonus-watch-will-75k-become-the-new-standard/?rf=1). We wondered: could $75K become the new standard?

That hasn’t yet happened, but we are seeing some signs of movement. For example, here’s good news we received from [Theresa R. Wardon](http://www.wtotrial.com/theresa-r-wardon-1), a partner at the Denver-based litigation boutique of [Wheeler Trigg O’Donnell LLP](http://www.wtotrial.com/About.aspx):

We just announced an increase in our federal clerkship bonuses. For federal circuit court clerks, that bonus is $60,000, exceeding the national bonus of $50,000. (Federal district court clerks will receive a bonus of $40,000.)

Wheeler Trigg is a Denver-based trial boutique. Although we are Denver-based, we do work nationwide. We do not hire first-year associates, so the bulk of our associates come from clerkships. We have clerks from nearly all of the federal circuits and many federal district courts.

Personally, I came to Denver to clerk for Judge Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit. Rather than return to Chicago to work for a large law firm, I decided to join Wheeler Trigg. We provide early on-your-feet experience (depositions, trials, oral arguments) for associates.

If Wheeler Trigg’s name rings a bell, perhaps you remember it from Vault’s list of the [Best Midsize Law Firms to Work For](http://www.vault.com/company-rankings/law/best-midsize-law-firms-to-work-for?sRankID=443&utm_source=&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=89485).

Why is Wheeler Trigg paying a premium for clerkly talent? Theresa Wardon explains:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Overall, we think that clerkships equip our lawyers with skills and knowledge that help them to step into cases and contribute meaningfully for clients from day one. Clerks spend a year (or two) focused on high-level research and writing, which is valuable in itself, but particularly so because, as a clerk, you’re working directly for the judge. There’s no senior associate or junior partner above you to whom you could pass the buck. The same is true here. We staff leanly, so our associates are generally working directly with a partner.

This model allows us to provide us the early experience that I mentioned previously. For instance, nearly 80 percent of our associates took depositions last year, 30 percent argued in court, and 100 percent had direct client contact. I personally had a jury trial where I crossed a witness in my first year of practice. As an associate, I had five jury trials, four in which I took witnesses and argued motions and jury instructions. I also argued three appeals as an associate. I know that for me my clerkship experience has been invaluable in my own practice, both on the trial and appellate level.

Some 80 percent of Wheeler Trigg’s associates have had state or federal clerkships. Firm-wide, it boasts 24 lawyers with federal circuit court clerkships and 15 with federal district court clerkships.

But Wheeler Trigg, as an elite boutique, isn’t big enough to move the market. Are any Biglaw firms upping the clerkship bonus ante? We’ve heard a rumor of one major player paying six-figure clerkship bonuses — and no, we’re not talking about [Kellogg Huber](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/associate-bonus-watch-a-tale-of-two-litigation-powerhouses/) ($175,000) or [SCOTUS clerkship bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/supreme-court-clerkship-bonuses/) ($300,000 or more) — but we have not yet confirmed it. If you can shed some light on this subject, please contact us [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Clerkship%20Bonus) (subject line: “Clerkship Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477). Thanks.

In the world of Biglaw, the most sought-after firms reside within the top tier of the Am Law 100. What does bonus compensation look like at these prominent firms? (We already maintain our comprehensive scorecard of all the bonus information we receive from our sources [here](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2022/).)

Today, we are compiling a table of the Am Law Top 50 firms (in alphabetical order) that have already matched the 2022 year-end bonus scale, the minimum hours required to receive those bonuses (if disclosed to ATL), and the date those bonuses were or will be paid. We will update this table on a regular basis as bonuses are announced. You’ll note there are some blanks — these firms either haven’t moved yet or we don’t have enough information to confirm all the details. If you see any information here that is missing, incorrect, or needs clarification, please tell us. We rely on our readers to get these things right. Help us provide the best information in our ongoing bonus coverage.

# Quinn Emanuel Will Allow Lawyers To Work Remotely, Indefinitely, From Anywhere In The Country
## Is this the first of many Am Law 100 firms to make such a move?

Our lawyers should work from wherever they do their best work. We want to invite the best litigators to join our firm, wherever their desks are. Over the past 18 months, our lawyers have mastered the art of collaborating remotely and at the highest levels—without sacrificing camaraderie or the free sharing of ideas.

We are reimagining how we use our office spaces to emphasize the benefits of in-person meetings, team building, and trial preparation when we do get together. We recognize there are valuable aspects of the in-office experience that are hard to replicate remotely. We intend to create an even more vibrant in-office experience.

— [John Quinn](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/quinn-john-b/), chair and founder of [Quinn Emanuel](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/), commenting on the firm’s decision to allow all of its U.S. attorneys to work remotely on a permanent basis, from wherever they like. Associates new to the firm must be hired by and affiliated with an existing office, regardless of where they ultimately plan to live. As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/12/20/quinn-emanuel-to-let-us-lawyers-work-remotely-on-permanent-basis/), Quinn Emanuel is the first Am Law 100 firm to “delink its personnel from their offices.”

# Biglaw Firms Tell Law Schools To 'Pls Hndle Thx' Antisemitism
## Law firms could've publicly informed law students where they draw the line. They decided to fire off a superficial letter blaming law school deans instead.

This morning, [24 major law firms sent a letter to an unspecified set of law school deans](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firms-tell-law-schools-to-pls-hndle-thx-antisemitism/2/) — and, perhaps more importantly, to the press — expressing their concern over reports of antisemitic harassment on campuses. Also Islamophobia and racism, but those are only mentioned in passing. As opposed to offering the support that top revenue-producing private law firms could bring to bear either financially or in kind to combat the problem, the firms chastised the deans with characteristic passive-aggressiveness:

We trust you will take the same unequivocal stance against such activities as we do, and we look forward to a respectful dialogue with you to understand how you are addressing with urgency this serious situation at your law schools.

[Antisemitic hate crimes in 2022 hit the highest level since 1979](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/audit-antisemitic-incidents-2022). That’s not a law school problem, that’s an everyone problem. That same report noted that bomb threats targeting Jewish people went up from 8 to 91 in 2022. All of which is to say that this is a problem that pre-dates the events of this month and yet law firms haven’t felt the need to comment until now.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As educators at institutions of higher learning, it is imperative that you provide your students with the tools and guidance to engage in the free exchange of ideas, even on emotionally charged issues, in a manner that affirms the values we all hold dear and rejects unreservedly that which is antithetical to those values. There is no room for anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism or any other form of violence, hatred or bigotry on your campuses, in our workplaces or our communities.

How are the schools not doing this?

To date, the highest profile law school incidents involve [an SBA President writing a column refusing to condemn Hamas](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/nyu-student-bar-president-israel-palestine/) on the grounds that the attacks were a response to Netanyahu government policies and a group of students who [signed a lengthy letter](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/davis-polk-rescinds-offers-to-t14-law-school-students-for-their-controversial-statements-on-israel/) that denounced the loss of life, but argued that the attacks fit into a larger context of Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israeli forces. Without taking a normative stance on either claim, those are both paradigmatic examples of “the free exchange of ideas, even on emotionally charged issues.”

The law firms involved — Winston and Davis Polk — took away those students’ jobs, which seems like precisely the appropriate method for a private employer to prepare students “to be an active part of workplace communities that have zero tolerance policies for any form of discrimination or harassment,” as the letter explains.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So, other than trying to score a cheap public relations boost from jumping on the “blame campuses” train, what is this even hoping to accomplish?

Not for nothing, but the firms COULD have written an open letter to law students clearly articulating the actions or comments that will result in losing job offers. Delineating exactly when commentary on geopolitics crosses the line into harassment in the mind of these firms would send an unambiguous message that the firms would exercise their role to address the antisemitism they see coming from law school graduates.

But they didn’t do that, and it’s worth asking why.

I don’t know if firms sensed unwanted blowback over the Winston and Davis Polk firings or if they’re just concerned that some future firing may land in a [gray area](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/18/after-davis-polk-rescinds-offers-pressure-grows-on-firms-to-act-despite-grey-areas-in-controversy/) earning them negative publicity, but this letter — in addressing the deans and NOT the students — seeks to foist the unique responsibility of a private employer to police discrimination under its own roof onto the law schools just so the law firms don’t have to end up making anyone mad. Or facing costly and messy (even if ultimately winnable) wrongful termination suits.

Let the law schools deal with all that rather than accept any responsibility ourselves!

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Sadly, no law school dean is going to earnestly respond to this letter given the existential need to maintain good relations with law firms, so here’s a response channeling their inner thoughts:

Dear Law Firms,

Thanks for your concern. As you know, we deal with these issues every day of our lives as professional educators so we always appreciate when multimillionaires who haven’t set foot on a campus in three decades parachute in to inform us that we’re failing.

As it happens, we are aware of the rise in antisemitism and hate throughout the country. Did you know we had neo-Nazis with Tiki torches marching by UVA Law School a mere six years ago? It’s true! Maybe that didn’t hit your radar since it didn’t present an opportunity to castigate law schools in the press. Penn has a law professor who [brings a white nationalist to campus every year](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/amy-wax-white-supremacist-speaker-again/) and none of you said a damn thing about it while the administration struggled to figure out how to deal with the situation.

[Yale Law School](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/yale-law-school-free-speech/) — among [others](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/law-school-civilty-hate-groups/) — are out here hosting representatives of a recognized hate group on campus and while federal judges and the media lambast students for protesting, law firms sat silently by and kept hiring the FedSoc students extending those invitations.

Perhaps you might want to stop doing that? Just a thought.

Meanwhile, your letter invites us to “a respectful dialogue with you to understand how you are addressing with urgency this serious situation at your law schools.” Putting aside that what this actually calls for is a “monologue,” we’re very interested in anything that can stamp out discrimination on campus.

So what, exactly, do you propose we do? What would YOU do in our position?

Are you familiar with the Constitution? Because NYU tried to launch an investigation into [the student who wrote that the Hamas attacks were “necessary”](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/nyu-student-bar-president-israel-palestine/) and [FIRE jumped right in to remind the school of the successful lawsuit that would follow](https://www.thefire.org/news/victory-day-after-fires-intervention-new-york-rescinds-letter-demanding-social-media-platform) unless the school dropped it. The [ACLU already informed undergraduate institutions](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/israel-palestine-aclu-campus-free-speech-letter) that it stands ready to sue over free speech clampdowns on those campuses. Has the collected brainpower of some of the most elite lawyers in the world figured out a solution that we could implement doesn’t run afoul of that document?

Because the only thing we appreciate more than someone parachuting in to inform us that we’re failing is someone who takes the time to craft a public letter excoriating us without even making an attempt to offer any solutions.

Sincerely,

Law School Deans

Law firms need to get honest and serious about what they want to do… or not do. Getting the mainstream media to point fingers at law school deans ain’t cutting it.

UPDATE: A number of firms have informed me that they’ve now signed onto the letter. A new copy is on the next page.
