Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

According to data collected in [Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/)‘ State of the Legal Industry 2020 report, of the 200 largest law firms, how many had flat or declining attorney head count?

Hint: Leopard reports that, while hiring was down, the primary driver of this was firms not replacing attorneys — across all levels — who left their firms.

See the answer on [the next page>>](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/biglaw-attorneys-are-not-being-replaced-when-they-leave-firms/2/).

# Cravath Bonuses For Everyone And A Little Something Extra For High Billers
## If you've had an extra busy 2017 you'll get an even bigger payday.

Guess who’s joined the bonus party? Winston & Strawn has joined the bonus party! Yesterday the Biglaw firm announced their bonus scale for all associates, and unsurprisingly, they have followed the compensation leader Cravath. They’ll be offering market bonuses, which for those that haven’t been following are as follows:

Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009+ — Case by case

In addition to the standard bonuses, Winston notes that attorneys that have “substantially exceeded the Firm’s 2,000 hour productivity goal” are eligible for additional bonuses. While “substantially exceed” is not defined, it’s still not a bad reward for associates who really worked their butts off in 2017.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
So, Winston attorneys, how do you feel about the bonuses? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

What about the bonuses everywhere else? Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

Do you like to be in the know? Do you love gossiping with friends and co-workers over the latest bonus news? Then you simply must sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts. It’s easy, just scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

# Another Biglaw Firm Flocks To Match Industry Bonus Rates
## Remember, we need your help to stay on top of all the bonus news that's fit to print (or post on the internet).

Matching the prevailing industry standard for year-end bonuses, set early in November by Milbank, is the mark of a top-tier firm. It’s a nice little bit of PR that your firm can be counted among the elite. And the folks at Willkie, Farr & Gallagher are likely welcoming the positive spin — the firm spent chunks of 2019 in the news, but it wasn’t good. If you recall, the now former co-chair of the firm, Gordon Caplan,[ got snared by the college admissions](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/) scandal, and though the firm [quickly distanced themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/willkie-farr-ditches-gordon-caplan-nabbed-in-varsity-blues-scandal/) from Caplan, a change in their PR fortunes is welcomed.

That’s good news for Willkie associates, as they issued a match of the Milbank scale. That grid is as follows:

Class of 2019 – $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2018 – $15,000
Class of 2017 – $25,000
Class of 2016 – $50,000
Class of 2015 – $65,000
Class of 2014 – $80,000
Class of 2013 – $90,000
Class of 2012 – $100,000

Willkie actually made the match way back in mid-November, but a tipster just alerted us to the news. Which brings me to my next point — we can’t do this without you, dear readers! We depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for all salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post.

# David Boies's Fall From Grace

David Boies

We live in trying times, when even those we once held in high regard continue, again and again, to disappoint us. Consider, for example, David Boies. Many aspiring litigators, myself included, were once fans, following his high-profile cases with a keen interest and holding him up as a paragon of ethics and savvy. But, as has been revealed over the course of a single, skinny year, that favorable view of Boies was woefully, almost tragically, misplaced.

When news first trickled out about his work on behalf of Harvey Weinstein, his supporters winced and his legacy began to creak and yawn. As further evidence established that this representation included an attempt at silencing, and undermining the statements of, possible sexual assault victims, and doing so in an underhanded attempt to stymie The New York Times, which also happened to be his client, that legacy tottered over and came crashing down.

When it was later revealed that Boies was complicit in the great Theranos tragedy, people were less surprised. He had already been exposed as one whose successes resulted, at least in part, not from thorough preparation and oratory skills, but from a willingness to intimidate and bend the rules. Theranos, which claimed to possess game-changing blood test technology, was eventually exposed as a gigantic fraud. Boies was a Theranos board member and stockholder. He was also, somehow, the company’s lawyer. This conflict of interest may have been the impetus for Boies’s aggressive and distasteful defense of the company. He worked to intimidate whistleblowers, running up their legal bills and threatening litigation, and acted in a manner that Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, who exposed both Theranos and Boies, described as thuggish.

While engaging in this campaign to silence the Theranos whistleblowers, he privately wrote to the company that his work was putting him at “risk [of] being at the scene of a serious accident.” Yet, he remained on the company’s board until just before the Securities and Exchange Commission made public its allegations that Theranos perpetrated a $700 million fraud and endangered the health of its clients.

While enabling the Weinstein and Theranos disasters, Boies also somehow found time to assist in the intimidation of a young woman with the temerity to be caught up in a copyright dispute with his client. The case, which is now known as Cline et al v. Reetz-Laiolo, involved claims by Boies’s client disputing the authorship of Emma Cline’s successful book, “The Girls.” Not content to litigate the case on the merits, apparently, Boies’s team took the shameless step of threatening to exploit and publicize the sexual history of the young woman on the other side of the case for leverage. Remarkably, his firm asserted that Cline’s “sexual conduct” was central to the case, which was, to an objective observer, a simple copyright matter involving a book. And, in a telling reveal, it was reported that Cline’s attorney had to explain the concept of “slut-shaming” to a befuddled Boies.

What had become of the noble attorney who had triumphed over intimidation and retrograde sexual politics to prevail in the Hollingsworth v. Perry case, which struck down the law banning gay marriage? Gone, and, if last week’s unctuous [New York Times profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/business/david-boies-pleads-not-guilty.html) is any indication, Boies doesn’t seem much to care.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The interview, most likely orchestrated by Boies’s publicity team in an attempt to head off the pooling flood waters of public distaste, comes off as tone-deaf and incredible. But, perhaps he had no choice but to take one final swing in the press given that, as the NYT noted, “[t]he last 12 months have been an unprecedented public relations disaster for the most prominent lawyer in America.”

While he has long had a deft touch with the press, and a strong ability to connect with others, whether they be clients, judges, juries, or adversaries, this profile reveals a defensive, dissembling, grasping attorney. One who is nevertheless far too intelligent to even half-believe half of the statements he makes in the profile, yet there they are.

He is steadfast in asserting that it was not a conflict of interest to represent the New York Times while also attempting to silence a New York Times journalist at the behest of another client, Weinstein. (With whom, the article notes with some glee, Boies had invested $10,000,000 dollars in film projects that “flopped.”) Boies notes that his attempt to “completely stop,” as his contract with a covert investigator put it, a NYT article was completely appropriate because “reporters do not have a monopoly on investigating facts.”

He goes on about one’s duty of loyalty to clients like Weinstein and Theranos, but fails to acknowledge that, while his duty to his clients is strong, his paramount duty is to the rule of law, to justice. In illustrating the importance of providing counsel to those in need, he indulges his inner Kanye and expresses a desire to represent President Trump (the article further notes that Boies tried to bring Trump in to his old firm as a client but was rebuffed).

The Boies brand of justice, apparently, is reserved for the very rich (he bills close to $2,000 per hour) and well-connected. The writer behind the profile certainly paints a picture of a man who is not necessarily in touch with the people, slipping in low-key burns about Boies espousing the virtues of “liberty, equality, and inclusiveness” while sipping on a 20-year-old Château Mouton Rothschild and being “visibly relieved that he could again indulge his craving for the Four Seasons version of pigs in blankets.”

“I spend a lot of money,” Mr. Boies is also quoted as saying, and his assets are noted as vast and inclusive of a vineyard. That these assets were paid for by clients like Weinstein and Theranos, who sought out Boies in an attempt to silence the truth and subdue and delay, if not impede, justice, is not lost on the reader.

Some of that money was spent by Boies’s firm to obtain the Los Angeles firm of Caldwell, Leslie & Proctor in April of 2017. Well-regarded for its entertainment and intellectual property practice, Boies and the firm’s principals trumpeted the amazing synergy that would surely result from the union. Mere months later, the Weinstein affair became public and one can only assume a large number of face-palms echoed over west Los Angeles.

Despite its travails, Boies’s firm soldiers on and continues to rake in money by the barrel-load. Yet cracks in its once-burnished veneer are now visible to the naked eye. Just this month, for example, it lost one of its top copyright litigators to a tech company. And, due to the widespread attention given to the Weinstein, Theranos, and Cline disputes, and the emphasis on how Boies apparently exacerbated the problems and dangers involved in each, no potential client will consider his firm without also contemplating whether this recent work was in pursuit of justice. And, to a small percentage at least, this will matter.

# Biglaw Firm Apologizes After Offering Associates Lower Bonuses Than Announced
## Yikes....

‘Where’s my bonus?’

At many Biglaw firms, after bonuses are announced with much fanfare, individualized figures are presented to associates on an internal platform and sometimes they’re even confirmed by partners with a call. Those numbers are generally correct, and when the money hits bank accounts, associates are pleased as punch.

But what would happen if those numbers were wrong? What if those bonus figures were “significantly less” than what they were hyped up to be? How do you think associates would react?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Something like this happened earlier this summer at global firm Stephenson Harwood, which has more than 1,000 lawyers spread across the United Kingdom, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to [RollOnFriday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-stephenson-harwood-sorry-after-lawyers-accidentally-promised-big-bonuses), lawyers working in the firm’s Singapore office received far smaller bonuses than what they’d been promised by partners — with some lawyers reportedly receiving “less than half as much” than the numbers they were told.

While partners were mum on the financial miscommunication, the affected associates are said to have received a verbal apology from the firm’s HR department. Martin Green, the managing partner of Stephenson Harwood’s Singapore office, offered this statement to RollOnFriday:

“We regret that a number of associates from our Singapore office were initially given incorrect information about bonus payments, which suggested that the bonus they would receive was higher than was actually awarded, and we appreciate the impact it has had on them”.

He said the mistakes were the result of human error, “for which the affected associates have received a full and unreserved apology; it shouldn’t have happened”.

“We are carrying out a thorough review of our processes and will be implementing changes to our approach, to ensure that nothing similar happens in the future”, said Green.

This is perhaps the ultimate embarrassment for a law firm of this size.

The best way to apologize to associates in this financially fraught situation would be to offer them the full amount of the bonuses they were originally told they’d receive — and then some. If anything less was offered to affected associates, then we imagine the lateral movement at Stephenson Harwood may be just as shocking as the disappointingly low bonuses associates received.

A London-based lawyer, Faliq Mohamed Ismail, was arrested on child pornography charges. At the time of his arrest, Ismail reportedly worked in-house at Coutts, a private bank and wealth management firm. He previously worked at a series of Biglaw firms: Clifford Chance, K&L Gates, Latham & Watkins, and Goodwin Proctor.

As [reported by](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-coutts-solicitor-out-after-admitting-possession-child-porn) RollOnFriday, Ismail “admitted possessing 1,076 videos and 2,173 images of child sex abuse which fell into the most serious category A.” He also “admitted possessing 221 videos and 2,476 images which fell into category B.” All told, Ismail reportedly had a collection of over 14,000 images, which he also admitted to sharing online.

Ismail is described as follows:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The in-house solicitor lives in a flat in Chelsea and was described as “extremely brash and flamboyant” by a source. Ismail maintained an “extremely showy-offy” Instagram account, said a source, where he posted “hundreds of pictures of himself with expensive (ladies) handbags and at fine dining places”. The account, which has now been made private, was called ‘gildedyouths’.

A spokesperson for NatWest, which owns Coutts, said this about Ismail: “We can confirm that the individual is no longer employed by the bank.”

The Solicitors Regulation Authority said this about Ismail’s arrest: “We are aware of the issue, and await conclusion of proceedings before gathering all relevant information and deciding on appropriate action.”

# Biglaw Firm Increases Salaries And Goes Up To $395K For Senior Associates
## Congratulations on the exciting news!
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

Back in 1999, one daring law firm laid the groundwork for associate salaries to soar. This firm made huge waves when it offered new associates a starting salary of $125,000 — significantly higher than the $100,000 that was standard at the time. The pay raise soon spread to firms across the country, and nothing has ever been the same since.

The firm we’re speaking about is Silicon Valley powerhouse Gunderson Dettmer, and last night, managing partner [David T. Young](https://www.gunder.com/david-t-young/), notified associates that they would be matching new Milbank salary scale. Here’s a nice little note from the firm:

[W]e thank you for your extraordinary efforts to provide clients with outstanding service, recruit talented new colleagues and contribute to the firm’s growth.

This is what the new $215K salary scale looks like at Gunderson:



It looks like the firm has taken note of [what Choate did](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/choate-match-22/) and its offering even higher salaries to its senior associates instead of sticking with $385K across the board for its most experienced attorneys.

Salary increases at the firm will be retroactive to January 1, and associates will receive catch-up payments at the end of the month.

Congratulations to all U.S. associates at Gunderson!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Gunderson Dettmer.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

Today, plaintiffs suing Biglaw giant Jones Day will ask a key discovery question — just how much pay and performance evaluation data will they have access to to make their case?

For those who need a refresher, [the purported class-action](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/plaintiffs-in-jones-day-gender-discrimination-case-want-it-to-be-a-class-action/?rf=1) gender discrimination [case](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) alleges a “fraternity culture” at the firm and unequal pay behind the firm’s notorious “[black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/)” compensation system. There are currently six named plaintiffs in the case (there had been seven, but [one anonymous plaintiff dropped out](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/plaintiff-backs-out-of-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-against-jones-day-rather-than-reveal-her-name/?rf=1) rather than reveal her name). The plaintiffs are spread throughout the country — Nilab Rahyar Tolton, Andrea Mazingo, Meredith Williams, and Jaclyn Stahl worked in California offices of the firm, while Saira Draper was an associate in Atlanta, and Katrina Henderson was in the firm’s New York office — and a core allegation is that the same black box compensation systems kept their pay below that of men working at the firm.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Plaintiffs are seeking all the data for approximately 2,000 associates, while the firm seeks to limit the discovery to employees in seven of their offices, about 600 people.

As [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/jones-day-female-lawyers-want-nationwide-pay-performance-data) Bloomberg Law, the firm is arguing plaintiff’s request is overbroad and burdensome and should be limited to the offices plaintiffs worked in — not the firm’s other 11 offices — and should be limited by the statute of limitations to three years of data. Predictably, plaintiffs take a broader view:

Nationwide disclosure of Jones Day’s pay, evaluation, and personnel data is necessary for them to determine whether those systems, policies, and practices have a common discriminatory effect on female associates, the plaintiffs say in a letter brief filed July 3 with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

It is also needed to conduct a valid statistical analysis of how the firm pays and otherwise treats its female lawyers compared to their male counterparts, the letter filed in advance of today’s status conference says.

The firm also says that discovery should be limited to “numeric” evaluations not the “narrative” performance data. Plaintiffs allege managing partner Stephen J. Brogan has a “totalitarian grip” on the firm’s black box compensation and enforces a “no whining policy” that prevents women from complaining about the compensation practice.

Jones Day [previously lost its motion](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/jones-day-loses-sanctions-push-against-women-in-sex-bias-suit) to impose Rule 11 sanctions. Judge Randolph D. Moss said, “Rule 11 is intended to deter and to punish litigation abuses. It is not a means of obtaining an early resolution of the merits of a dispute.” And he noted the pay discrimination claims “are not so frivolous or beyond-the-pale to warrant sanctions,” and discovery is necessary to determine Jones Day’s assertions.

We’ll have to see how the discovery dispute shakes out.

NOT! (Click to enlarge.)

Last Tuesday, Biglaw was rocked by reports of supposed [merger talks between Quinn Emanuel and Williams & Connolly](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/major-biglaw-merger-news-quinn-emanuel-and-williams-connolly-are-in-talks/). The news spread rapidly, perhaps because it was so surprising.

Other than being two of the nation’s finest litigation firms with a shared reputation for zealous representation of their clients, QE and W&C share little in common. Quinn Emanuel is obscenely profitable ($5 million in [2016 profits per partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/2/)), rather large ([700+](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/about-us/) lawyers), and rapidly expanding, with offices in eight U.S. cities and more than a dozen cities overseas.

In cultural terms, Quinn reflects its founder, legendary litigator [John Quinn](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/quinn-john-b). The firm is entrepreneurial and risk-taking, doing a fair amount of contingency work, and it’s brash and publicity-seeking. How many Am Law 100 firms have ever [advertised in airports?](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/07/law-firm-mascot-of-the-day-lady-j/)

(Not surprisingly for the staid precincts of Biglaw, the Quinn approach has its detractors. QE’s critics — or [player haters](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=player%20hater) — question the accuracy of its profitability, the sustainability of its expansion, and the tastefulness of its self-promotion.)

Compared to Quinn Emanuel, Williams & Connolly is [less profitable](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202794430659/Williams--Connolly-Denies-Plans-to-Pursue-Merger-with-Quinn-Emanuel?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL) ($1.6 million in PPP) and smaller (under 300 lawyers). And this is intentional. Given the tremendous talent under its roof and its worldwide reputation, W&C could be much larger and more lucrative than it currently is. But the firm has made a [deliberate decision](http://www.litigationdaily.com/id=1202794545684/Why-Its-a-Good-Thing-That-Williams--Connolly-Isnt-Merging-With-Quinn-Emanuel?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL) to focus on quality and collegiality, refusing to expand beyond its one D.C. office or even hire many laterals. As Jenna Greene noted in an interesting post-mortem, [Why It’s a Good Thing That Williams & Connolly Isn’t Merging With Quinn Emanuel](http://www.litigationdaily.com/id=1202794545684/Why-Its-a-Good-Thing-That-Williams--Connolly-Isnt-Merging-With-Quinn-Emanuel?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

As big law firms fell over themselves to jack up their PPPs and lure top laterals, Williams & Connolly has been like the last samurai, refusing to go with the flow. In the firm’s 50-year history, the partnership has only hired two laterals — U.S. Supreme Court advocate Kannon Shanmugam [in 2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2008/09/musical-chairs-kannon-shanmugam-to-williams-connollywcs-first-lateral-partner-in-22-years/) and tax expert Gerald Feffer in 1986. The rest are homegrown.

This approach instills lawyers with the Williams & Connolly culture, which is in many ways the opposite of Quinn’s. Despite its overall political liberalism — it’s zealously pro-criminal-defendant, for example, and it’s more likely to hire [a former criminal defendant](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/dewey-know-whos-not-going-to-trial-defendant-no-4-zachary-warren/) than a former federal prosecutor — W&C is culturally (and fiscally) conservative. It does most of its work based on hourly rates, eschewing exotic alternative-fee arrangements, and it pays [above-market base salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/nationwide-pay-raise-watch-which-firm-pays-a-starting-salary-of-200000/) but no bonuses to its associates (who [have been wondering](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/associate-bonus-watch-which-firm-now-offers-up-to-125000-in-associate-starting-bonuses/), ever since last summer’s [Cravath pay hike](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1), about when they’ll get a raise). And you definitely won’t see W&C advertisements in airports — heck, it took years for the firm to even [put up a website](https://www.wc.com/).

Given the big differences between the two firms, I reacted with surprise — and skepticism — to last week’s rumored merger talks. After Williams & Connolly issued its unequivocal denial, I tweeted:

I'm not surprised; this didn't sound right to me. But I am curious as to how this misunderstanding happened…. [https://t.co/ZgDLJ5oMHg](https://t.co/ZgDLJ5oMHg)

— David Lat (@DavidLat) [August 1, 2017](https://twitter.com/DavidLat/status/892496388168314883)

So I decided to do a little digging. I reached out to both firms; both declined to comment. But I also spoke to individual lawyers at both places, and here is what I managed to piece together.

The meeting that gave rise to the rumors took place not last week, but a while ago — several weeks or even a month ago. It took place over breakfast, at a Marriott in downtown D.C.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Okay, hold on right there — a power breakfast to discuss the merger of two leading law firms… at a Marriott? I have great respect for Marriott as a business and stay often at its hotels (Gold Elite, baby), but Marriott is a solid rather than glamorous brand. If the firms wanted to support Marriott International — maybe it’s a client? — they could at least have met at the [D.C. Ritz-Carlton](http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/washington-dc/dc), Marriott’s top-of-the-line property in the nation’s capital.

UPDATE (6:51 p.m.): In defense of the Marriott pick, a source points out that it was probably the [Washington Marriott at Metro Center](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/wasmc-washington-marriott-at-metro-center/) (775 12th Street NW), conveniently located down the block from Williams & Connolly (725 12th Street NW).

The breakfast involved a small number of Quinn Emanuel and Williams & Connolly lawyers. The W&C representatives were people that John Quinn knows personally at the firm, through personal friendship or prior work together as co-counsel. Some folks you might have expected at a merger-related meeting were not present; for example, W&C chairman [Dane Butswinkas](https://www.wc.com/Profiles/Dane-H-Butswinkas) did not attend, nor did all members of the Executive Committee.

What was discussed at the breakfast? The two sides disagree. The QE sources say that business matters were discussed, including referrals of work between the two firms. The W&C sources say that most of the discussion centered on families and summer plans — and that to characterize it as an official business meeting would be quite erroneous.

Near the end of the breakfast, John Quinn tossed out — somewhat spontaneously, and in very general terms — the idea of stronger ties, such as a strategic partnership or maybe even a merger. The W&C lawyers were taken by surprise, since nobody went to the breakfast anticipating such a discussion.

How did the Williams & Connolly lawyers respond? Again, there’s some divergence.

The QE sources say that the Williams & Connolly folks did not say no, at least not in a way that would satisfy a “clear statement rule.” And they claim that John Quinn followed up with W&C lawyers after the breakfast as well, which led to talk of a follow-up meeting sometime in September for further discussion.

The W&C sources disagree. Although the Williams & Connolly lawyers at the breakfast might not have been as blunt as they could have been — they were taken by surprise, and didn’t want to be rude — they made quite clear that the firm was not interested.

According to the W&C camp, when John Quinn raised the subject of a merger, he prefaced it by saying something like, “Here’s a crazy idea.” The W&C lawyers responded along these lines: “Haha, that sure IS a crazy idea! Merging with a giant international law firm more than twice our size? We haven’t opened a second office in our half-century of existence! Heck, we don’t even hire laterals!”

And that’s where things were left — until Legal Business, a U.K.-based publication, [reported](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/10568-quinn-emanuel-breaks-tradition-as-merger-talks-with-dc-disputes-leader-williams-connolly-begin) on the supposed merger talks last Tuesday. Their article included comment from John Quinn: “It is true that we had a meeting on this subject but it was very preliminary and we don’t know what, if anything, will come of this.”

This news quickly jumped the pond — given credibility by Quinn’s confirmation, and picked up promptly by the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202794430659/Williams--Connolly-Denies-Plans-to-Pursue-Merger-with-Quinn-Emanuel?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL), [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/950079/quinn-williams-connolly-downplay-reports-of-merger-talk), and [Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/major-biglaw-merger-news-quinn-emanuel-and-williams-connolly-are-in-talks/) — and it caused a lot of tsuris over at Williams & Connolly. Senior partners and Executive Committee members were besieged by calls and emails from anxious clients, colleagues, and recruits, expressing concern that the firm they know and love was about to get transformed through absorption into the Quinn Emanuel borg. (As a litigation partner at another Biglaw firm told me, the merger rumors “created some serious consternation among W&C clients, associates, etc.  — and gave me an endless source of amusement.”)

As noted earlier, Williams & Connolly can be somewhat press-shy, even secretive. This makes sense; in many of their cases, the best result involves their client never being in the newspaper. But given all the drama, here W&C had no choice but to speak. Firm chairman Dane Butswinkas issued a [statement](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/biglaw-mega-merger-between-quinn-emanuel-and-williams-connolly-not-to-be/): “While Quinn Emanuel is an excellent law firm, we are happy just the way we are. We have no plans to merge with them or any other law firm.”

What went down here, from the point of view of each firm?

From the perspective of Quinn Emanuel, there was enough there to justify John Quinn’s confirmation of something when contacted by Legal Business. Remember that Legal Business contacted John Quinn — i.e., Quinn Emanuel didn’t make an announcement of its own — and remember his caveat that the talks were “very preliminary.” (Side note: the U.K. legal-media outlets tend to be more aggressive in their coverage of the industry than we are in the States, and they will often report out stories that we might hold pending further confirmation.)

From the perspective of Williams & Connolly, this was something spun out of nothing, and there was no way anyone could have thought that even “preliminary” discussions were underway. This was an informal breakfast meeting, not attended by W&C top brass, focused on personal rather than business matters. Yes, John Quinn randomly tossed out his “crazy idea” at the end — but that idea was not discussed further back at W&C, and certainly not discussed in the Executive Committee that runs the firm. To the contrary, many Executive Committee members and other firm leaders learned of the supposed “merger talks” the way everyone else did — from news reports.

Whose version of events am I inclined to credit? Speaking for myself, I view the W&C account as more credible. Here’s why (in addition to the fact that the talks took place over breakfast — not dinner, breakfast — at a Marriott.)

John Quinn’s incredible success, as both a lawyer and businessman, rests upon his energy, enthusiasm, and view that almost nothing is truly impossible. When he gets an idea in his head, he runs with it — over [mountains](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/07/dear-summer-associates-read-the-fine-print-before-signing-up-for-the-mountain-hiking-so-the-firm-doesnt-have-to-send-a-helicopter-for-you/), through walls, and past any obstacle standing in his way.

In many cases over his long and distinguished career, many of Quinn’s ideas — including the idea for Quinn Emanuel itself, which he launched after leaving Cravath — have turned into huge wins. But sometimes Quinn’s vision can get ahead of reality, which I suspect is what happened in this case. When he raised the idea of a “merger” with a few Williams & Connolly partners over breakfast, the fact that they didn’t explicitly say “hell to the N-O” — even if they gave many other strong indications that anyone else might have viewed as dispositive — gave him just enough of an opening to think that “preliminary discussions” were underway.

(An alternative hypothesis: John Quinn knew full well that this breakfast chat didn’t amount to “merger discussions,” but decided to confirm to Legal Business anyway. I’m not sure, however, what his motivation would be for such a move. Did he want to burnish QE’s brand by touting talks with another top firm? Did he want to make mischief for W&C? It’s all too speculative.)

If law firm consultants were to use this episode as a case study for how to conduct merger talks, what lessons would they draw from it? Here are three that come to my mind:

1. Communicate clearly. This sounds obvious, but it’s easier said than done. Despite its reputation for ruthlessness, Biglaw can actually be quite genteel — and passive-aggressive. Many lawyers like to think of themselves as learned professionals who are above money-grubbing pursuits, so they can turn skittish when talk turns to dollars and cents.

But a merger is a business deal in which money matters, so don’t be afraid to be blunt — polite, certainly, but honest. And [don’t defer difficult issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/6-things-managing-partners-need-to-know-about-law-firm-mergers/) to the post-merger integration, especially issues surrounding compensation and internal leadership, just because it’s too awkward to talk about them in advance.

2. Get leadership involved early. This is usually not a problem in most law firm mergers, where the deals originate at the top and then get sold to — or foisted upon — rank-and-file partners later. But in the rare situation where this is not the case, bring the people with actual decision-making authority into the loop as soon as possible. Otherwise you’re just wasting everyone’s time.

3. Prevent leaks. This apparent misunderstanding would never have seen the light of day if someone hadn’t leaked the news to [Legal Business](http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/10568-quinn-emanuel-breaks-tradition-as-merger-talks-with-dc-disputes-leader-williams-connolly-begin). Again, plugging leaks is easier than said than done — just ask [Jeff Sessions](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/jeff-sessions-vows-to-make-journalists-famous-by-jailing-them-for-protecting-sources/) — but it can be done, especially if the talks take place between firm leaders and are kept inside a small group.

So that’s the skinny of how the supposed QE/W&C “merger talks” came into existence, along with lessons learned. Best of luck to Quinn Emanuel and Williams & Connolly in their — very independent — respective futures.

# The 2023 Litigation Finance Survey Report
## Once a little-known option, litigation funding has become an 'increasingly standard practice,' according to our annual survey.

Together with our friends at Lake Whillans, Above the Law has been tracking the development of litigation finance over the years, as it has evolved into an integral part of the legal ecosystem, offering benefits to organizations of all sizes. “It is now part of most case discussions,” one law firm partner told us.

Our annual survey of in-house counsel and law firm attorneys shows an uptick in the number of large law firms and big-name corporations who work with funders. This year, more than half of the in-house counsel who reported having firsthand experience with litigation finance work in large companies or Fortune 1000 corporations.

One element that has remained consistent across surveys is satisfaction with the experience. Among the survey respondents who have worked directly with litigation funders, the proportion who said they would do so again has remained above 80 percent for the last five years.

For more on this year’s results, including the kinds of cases that have been funded, the reasons for obtaining financing, and what lawyers consider the most important factors in choosing a financier, [check out the full report on our survey findings](https://lakewhillans.com/research/2023-litigation-finance-survey-report/).

# Am Law 100 Biglaw Firm Delights Associates With Raises

Yay, money!

That’s the sentiment making its way through Biglaw as raises have become the order of the day. And the latest firm to announce their own raises is none other than Schulte Roth & Zabel, which took in $444,700,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 90th in the Am Law 100.

For those who have not yet memorized the scale, this is the new compensation grid at Schulte:

Class of 2021	$215,000
Class of 2020	$225,000
Class of 2019	$250,000
Class of 2018	$293,500
Class of 2017	$335,000
Class of 2016	$360,500
Class of 2015	$381,000
Class of 2014	$396,500
Class of 2013	$406,500
Tipsters at the firm report:

For what it’s worth, firm leadership sent out the memo first thing this morning and associates are very excited that SRZ matched so quickly. I was on several calls this morning and morale is definitely boosted with this announcement.

And like many of their peer firms, the raises will be retroactive to January 1 and paid on March 18th. Folks in the class of 2012 and more senior will have their compensation communicated individually. Read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/schulte-raises-22/2/)

# Associates Disappointed With Bonuses At This Biglaw Firm
## Bonuses at this firm disappoint. Again.

Pepper Hamilton[ isn’t a stranger](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/small-bonus-pool-makes-for-sad-associates/) to disappointing bonuses. But the bonus scale released by the firm last week continues the trend. The firm announced their bonus grid, keyed to hours associates have billed, and it is noticeably smaller than the market bonuses going around Biglaw.

Here’s the scale the firm released:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If the limited number of bands, as opposed to class years, is confusing, a tipster has provided an easy guide — as well as some commentary:

Level 1: 1&2+ years
Level 2: 3+4+
Level 3: 5+6+
Level 4: 7-8+ years
People may spend more than one year in the same class year or band

So essentially, even on the fastest track of leveling up (class year = level), 8th years are still making the same bonus as a first year at other firms with market bonuses

As a reminder, market bonuses as set by Milbank in November, are giving second year associates (class of 2017) $25,000. So… yeah. Though the firm also announced associates may be eligible for additional discretionary bonuses based on merit, which could bring their total bonus in line with market levels.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Comes Out Swinging With Year-End And Special Bonuses To Delight Hardworking Associates
## Another firm made associates happy with their bonus numbers.

This morning when Davis Polk [announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/) their year-end bonuses that matched the Cravath scale — at a ~15 percent increase over last year’s bonus numbers — plus an added special bonus, well, we knew that Biglaw would respond. Since then, we’ve seen a steady stream of firms matching this scale. And after what has been a relatively quiet bonus season so far, it’s nice to see.

The latest firm to get in on that sweet, sweet bonus action is Willkie Farr & Gallagher. The firm, which took in $986,000,000 in gross revenue in 2020, making it 44th on the Am Law 100, announced bonuses, of both the year-end and special variety.

Unsurprisingly, they matched the prevailing scale:

As a tipster told Above the Law:

Willkie matches. Big year for the firm with two new offices opening. This isn’t surprising, but it’s still a nice way to start the week.

Congrats to associates taking home a pretty penny this bonus season. The full memo is [available on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/willkie-bonuses-21/2/).

It’s been almost two weeks since Hamas launched a deadly terror attack in Israel, and since that time, members of the Biglaw community have come together to support relief efforts. We already know that Kirkland & Ellis is [leading the pack when it comes to donations](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/10/biglaw-partners-make-generous-donations-to-support-israel-following-terror-attacks/), with its partners having pledged more than $1.5 million to the cause (and that amount has very likely increased by now).

Kirkland is incredibly committed to offering assistance, and the firm was on top of the situation when it came to helping one of its partners and his family flee the war-torn country in the days that followed the attack.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

Kirkland partner [Daniel Wolf](https://www.kirkland.com/lawyers/w/wolf-daniel-e-pc) is based in New York City, but his parents and brother live in Israel and he has an apartment in Jerusalem. On October 7, Wolf was on his way to a synagogue when air defense sirens rang out. He ran back home to find his family gathered in a safe room, and for the next three days, they stuck it out amid missile strike after missile strike. “It was like a slow-motion horror movie,” Wolf told [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/kirkland-deals-lawyer-family-flee-israel-with-help-from-firm) of the experience. Fortunately, his story has a happy ending:

Kirkland eventually was able to help about 20 people—including other firm lawyers and their families—get on flights out of the country, after the attorneys reached out to the firm, according to Wolf.

“From the moment they found out about it, they literally mobilized unlimited resources and were in touch with us nonstop coming up with alternatives, providing escort and travel help,” said Wolf, adding that the firm’s staff stayed up all night to make sure flights took off.

Wolf may be back home in New York with his immediate family, but his heart is still in Israel as his parents, his brother, and other family members and friends remain there. While work hasn’t been easy for him considering the circumstances, he says it’s been a “welcome distraction.”

Best wishes to Daniel Wolf and his family. We’re so thankful that he was able to return home safe and sound with the help of Kirkland & Ellis.

Today is the second-to-last day of 2020, and what a year it’s been. It’s had a few highs, but it’s had oh so very many lows. On the first day of 2020, I was on maternity leave, and by the time I returned to work, I was only able to venture to the Above the Law office in Manhattan a few times before the city was shut down. Working parents, I’ve felt your pain, because like many of you, I’ve been working full-time while homeschooling and taking care of a baby at the same time. Thankfully, I’ve had Joe Patrice and Kathryn Rubino on my “quaranteam” (plus all of our wonderful columnists), and I’m happy to say we made it out of this cursed year happy, healthy, and able to bring our readers the latest and greatest in legal news.

Since I started working for ATL in 2010, we’ve wrapped up the year that was with a list of our top 10 stories. Because this year was so different, we’re doing things differently — each of the editors will be making their own top 10 lists. You’ve seen [Joe’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/favorite-stories-of-2020-corruption-courts-and-ahem-jeffrey-toobin/), you’ve seen [Kathryn’s](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/associate-layoffs-a-new-court-and-racial-unrest-2020-in-review/), and now it’s my turn. Get ready for some of our best human interest stories, law school rankings, and your favorite thing of all: CHARTS.

The legal profession was tied to the pandemic from the moment it started in New York. Often referred to as [“patient zero” for community spread](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/new-york-lawyer-who-was-patient-zero-for-covid-19-community-spread-speaks-out-on-his-unlikely-recovery/) of COVID-19, Lawrence Garbuz went from being in [critical condition](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/new-york-lawyer-with-coronavirus-in-critical-condition/) to making a full recovery. To this day, he still doesn’t know how he caught the coronavirus.

Thanks to the pandemic, law students and recent law school graduates across the world were faced with a difficult decision: take exams online with stringent rules or sit the year out and delay starting their careers. Those who opted to take virtual tests were subjected to offensively embarrassing and demeaning situations. Take, for example, the would-be lawyer who had to urinate into a bottle without breaking eye contact with his screen — all while being watched by a proctor. Un-pee-lievable!

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

How far would you go to help one of your clients during a pandemic? If you’d throw on a hazmat suit to represent one of them during a sentencing hearing, then you just might be a hero of the coronavirus crisis. Unprecedented times like these call for unprecedented measures — and this was one of the most unprecedented fashion choices for a court appearance we’ve ever seen.

7. [Pregnant Woman Takes Bar Exam While In Labor, Finishes Test From Hospital After Giving Birth](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/pregnant-woman-takes-bar-exam-while-in-labor-finishes-test-from-hospital-after-giving-birth/)

Speaking of the extreme lengths that recent law school graduates went through to take online exams, Brianna Hill finished the first day of the bar exam while in active labor, gave birth to healthy baby, and then finished the second day of the test from the hospital. Not only did our original story go viral and spread across mainstream media and television outlets like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/10/us/mom-has-baby-while-taking-bar-exam-trnd/index.html), the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/us/bar-exam-labor.html), the [TODAY Show](https://www.today.com/parents/brianna-hill-woman-who-took-bar-exam-while-labor-reveals-t202882), and [Good Morning America](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/woman-finishes-illinois-bar-exam-labor-giving-birth-73518929), but it has a happy ending — [she passed the bar exam](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/woman-who-took-bar-exam-while-in-labor-gave-birth-then-finished-from-hospital-passes-test/). Congrats!

6. [All Rise: Hundreds Of Lawyers Protest On Steps Of Supreme Court To Demand ‘Impartial Justice’ In Trump’s Impeachment](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/01/all-rise-hundreds-of-lawyers-protest-on-steps-of-supreme-court-to-demand-impartial-justice-in-trumps-impeachment/)

In case you somehow forgot, Donald Trump was impeached by the House for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in late December 2019. His impeachment trial started in the Senate in January 2020, and lawyers gathered to protest when it seemed as though things were about to go sideways. Trump was ultimately acquitted by the Senate, but nonetheless, lawyers still did their best to stand up for justice.

4. [The 2021 U.S. News Law School Rankings Are Here](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/2021-u-s-news-law-school-rankings/)

There’s nothing like a little rankings insanity to break up the regular insanity of a pandemic. Lawyers and law students alike love comparing their law school’s prestige to that of the competition, and in a year with little else to do while social distancing and living online, everyone truly relished the opportunity to do something normal again. (On a personal note, when the rankings were released, I wrote this story with one hand while rocking a baby … and now I’m writing this blurb with one hand while balancing a 1-year-old on my knee. Law moms: we get the job done!)

3. [Associate Compensation Scorecard: Biglaw’s 2020 Bonus Bonanza](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-chart-2020/)

Considering the horrible year the legal sector has had, it’s a wonder that bonus season has been so bountiful. With regular year-end bonuses ranging from $15,000 to $100,000 combined with special bonuses ranging from $7,500 to $40,000, lawyers at many firms were able to rake in obscene amounts of cash, despite the ongoing pandemic. How does your firm measure up? Based on the number of times people have looked at this chart, that’s what every lawyer wants to know.

2. [Law School To Permanently Close Its Doors](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/law-school-to-permanently-close-its-doors/)

From closing their campuses to holding classes and exams online, law schools across the country have gone through an incredible amount of change in 2020 thanks to the pandemic. Unfortunately, one law school faced the greatest change of all, a permanent closure as it struggled under the weight of “financial distress,” stranding unsuspecting law students in the process. This story had a happy ending after all, when another law school swooped in to rescue all the students who’d been left without an alma mater.

1. [The COVID Crisis Law Firm Layoff Tracker: What’s Your Firm Doing To Survive?](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/)

The coronavirus really took the legal world by surprise, and as the economy tumbled downhill at breakneck speed, law firms quickly attempted to manage their expenses by taking major cost-cutting measures ranging from salary cuts to furloughs to layoffs. Legal staff often took the biggest hit when firms decided to trim their headcounts, but lawyers suffered too, with some seeing salary cuts of up to 50 percent. This big chart was the big information hub that everyone in Biglaw needed to see in 2020, making it Above the Law’s most-read story of the year. (Don’t forget to take a look at its sister chart, the [salary cut rollback tracker](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/the-great-salary-cut-rollback-tracker-where-does-your-law-firm-stand/). After their initial cuts, many law firms not only survived, but went on to thrive as 2020 unfolded.)

# DOJ Threatens Immigration Rights Lawyers, Demands They Drop Their Clients
## The Trump administration tries a scary new tactic to keep lawyers from aiding immigrants.

If you can’t beat ’em, bully them with “cease and desist” letters and trumped-up disciplinary accusations. That’s apparently the new motto down at the Department of Justice, where the government is lashing out at the immigration rights attorneys who stymied the administration’s efforts to implement their travel ban. And it’s not just non-profit groups (though those are the first lawyers getting hit); the clever, if diabolical, argument the DOJ has cooked up could be launched to shut down Biglaw attorneys working pro bono matters next. They may have stumbled out of the gate, but this Justice Department came to play hardball, folks.

In a piece [posted this morning](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-airport-lawyers-who-stood-up-to-trump-are-under-attack/) over at The Nation, Rachel Tiven discusses the plight of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP), a non-profit group that offers assistance to people facing deportation hearings. After volunteering their services to fight the Muslim travel ban, NWIRP received a stern cease-and-desist letter from DOJ directing them to close up their asylum advisory services. As one might imagine, this is not something the government can usually order attorneys to do, but the government found a loophole to exploit:

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The reason [for the DOJ letter]: a technicality, perversely applied. NWIRP is accused of breaking a rule that was put in place to protect people from lawyers or “notarios” who take their money and then drop their case…. The accusation is that because NWIRP provides advice and assistance to people in immigration proceedings without committing to full representation, it is violating the rules.

It’s a Kafkaesque system: The government won’t provide immigrant defendants with legal representation, and they are allowed to get help for free only if they find a lawyer who will commit up-front to a case that will stretch on for years. Otherwise, they’re not allowed to have any help at all, are required to submit complex legal documents with no assistance, and lawyers who try to help them will be sanctioned.

You’ve got to hand it to them, this is a pretty novel idea. Because too many unscrupulous immigration attorneys robbed their clients blind and then abandoned them, the government imposed regulations to keep the field honest. Unfortunately, those regulations can be twisted to shut out providers of free legal services.

NWIRP took the DOJ to court and [won a reprieve on Wednesday](http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/05/17/25150335/federal-judge-rules-that-jeff-sessions-cant-block-northwest-immigrant-rights-project-from-doing-its-work-for-now), when Judge [Richard A. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._Jones) — for the record, yet another George W. Bush appointee who has sided against this administration on its immigration shenanigans — [granted the TRO](https://ecf.wawd.uscourts.gov/doc1/19717465280) they requested to enjoin the DOJ. But as Tiven’s piece notes, if Sessions manages to ultimately prevail, the non-profits are just the beginning of the crackdown that would ensue:

The DoJ’s suspiciously timed cease and desist letter sends a chilling message to exactly these groups, and to volunteer attorneys. This attack by the government on a legal services-provider for immigrants could dissuade law firms from letting their lawyers volunteer for these cases, scaring those firms away by convincing them that immigration-related projects are too risky pro-bono projects.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Gotta hand it to Sessions on this one. He may have hit a snag, but on paper this was a sound strategy — go after a single non-profit, hoping to keep it under the radar, and get a good result before pushing back against deep-pocketed Biglaw firms. While this administration is getting beaten in the courts like so many rented mules, it’s not for lack of trying.

And what everyone should take away from this episode is that they’re willing to play dirty to keep lawyers from ever making it to the courthouse steps.

Ask an individual law firm partner to list the things they value in their fellow attorneys, and you’ll generally hear a few basic themes repeated. Legal skill, obviously. A pleasant demeanor. Willingness to pitch in as a teammate.

One topic will generally go undiscussed, which is odd given the central role it plays in a law firm: the size of their book. Law firms live and die on the books of business their partners generate. If there’s no work to be done, there’s no law firm. Attorneys with large, profitable books of business command the biggest salaries, the heaviest political clout, and the corner-iest offices. Talking about money may be gauche, but dollars generated per dollar spent remains the single most important statistic governing any private law firm lawyer.

Books of business don’t just happen overnight. Even the biggest rainmakers started out with nothing in their pockets but a Juris Doctorate and a dream. Scaling the mountain between first-year associate and business-generating dynamo has long been a process shrouded in mystery. Today, however, I’m ready to pull back the curtain. I’ve learned through years of hard work and observation the single most important thing you can do to develop your book. An attorney who pulls this off is practically guaranteed to find herself drowning in paying clients.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
While I’m obviously kidding around with that impossible piece of advice, there’s a kernel of truth in it. To get to it, though, it helps to step back and think about how business tends to be generated for most lawyers.

For all the advances our industry has seen in artificial intelligence and technology-based solutions, it remains intensely based on personal relationships. Clients generally remain more loyal to their attorneys than to their law firms. Very few of us generate most of our business from strangers who stumble upon us.

So how do you foster personal relationships with the kinds of people who generate paying legal work? The simplest way is just to be friends with them. Be the person they think of when they realize they have a problem that needs solving.

There’s a formulation of friendship someone once shared with me that I find illuminating. [Friendship = Proximity + Frequency + Duration + Intensity](https://www.lifehack.org/643258/the-friendship-formula). Some combination of these four features defines every friendship, and it’s by feeding and balancing these factors that we maintain our relationships.

The factors themselves are fairly self-explanatory. Proximity is simply a matter of being near someone. If you never spend time communicating, how can a friendship form? Frequency is how often you see one another, since you’re more likely to form a friendship with someone you see weekly than you are someone you only say hey to during Olympic Opening Ceremonies. Duration is spending time together in big chunks. Even if you spend time with someone every week, you’re more likely to befriend the person you spend three hours with than the store clerk you spend 30 seconds with. Intensity is how deep and meaningful the interactions you have are; one long night of soul-baring can bond people more than months of casual hellos.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Many adults report [having difficulty making new friendships](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&&mtrref=undefined&gwh=66ED113C2D69A3DA1AF9D1B5DBEE7488&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL) once they leave school for the real world. When you think about friendships through the lens above, it’s easy to see why. From pre-school to post-doc, schools force disparate people to be near each other (proximity), five days a week (frequency), for hours at a time (duration), going through the difficult process of acquiring knowledge (intensity). Education is tailor-made for generating long-lived friendships, whereas many people struggle to find similar opportunities to develop relationships once they’ve left school. In fact, it’s likely that the majority of the friends most of us have made since leaving school were through work, which has the similar effect of forcing people together for long periods of time. Without school or work to facilitate those interactions, making friends as an adult requires a big investment of time and effort, one that overworked attorneys rarely have the desire to make.

Networking For The 99.9%

Let’s return to the original problem we set out to address: how does one befriend the wealthy and well-connected people who typically make up Biglaw’s clientele?

Being born rich, going to elite schools, and playing lacrosse and field hockey with tomorrow’s corporate class is a great gig if you can get it, but not a game plan most of us can adopt. If we want to make friends with potential clients, we’re going to have to work at it. The only way to do it is to put in the time to be around the people you hope will generate that business down the line. It means getting out of your home, and your comfort zone, and finding reasons to spend time with new people.

How you go about that may be different for each person. For some, it means reaching out into the community and making a positive impact. By putting their face out there and making a name for themselves as a community servant they get face time with like-minded donors and corporate representatives who might spin off future work.

Others will find their marketing success in purely social avenues. I’ve known attorneys who have generated business by joining a more expensive gym. Some lawyers golf every weekend so they can see and be seen around the country club. Name a hobby, some lawyer has probably generated business off of it simply by hanging around long enough with fellow enthusiasts.

One attorney I know has had major success with their “three-a-day” rule. Every day, without fail, they make contact with three prospects, either people they want to bring on as clients or existing clients they want to develop more work from. It can be as simple as sending an email or text, or as involved as coffee, lunch, drinks, or setting up time to hang out. By consciously maintaining and cultivating their relationships, they grew a modest book of business into a multi-million dollar monster.

I would offer one important caveat: be sincere about any activity you decide to commit to. Doing something purely for the sake of networking rarely breeds success. People can smell an insincere opportunist. Be there first and foremost because you want to be there, whether it’s saving the whales, pumping iron, swinging clubs, or playing Dungeons & Dragons. You’ll enjoy it more, you’ll forge better relationships, and you’ll generate more business when you truly care about how you’re investing your time.

We can’t all be born rich, but we can all make friends, enjoy our free time, and build our networks organically.

# Biglaw's Big Problem With Mental Health And Substance Abuse
## Try as they might, Biglaw firms can no longer ignore these problems.

Attorneys are struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues, and it continues to be an unspoken reality in Biglaw firms across the globe. What are the leaders of these firms doing about these problems? Do they even care, so long as productivity expectations are met?

To find the answers to these questions, ALM Intelligence teamed up with Well Counseled columnist Patrick Krill and sent confidential surveys with subjects ranging from stigma to culture to policies and education to managing partners, practice group leaders, general counsel, and benefits and HR directors at every single Am Law 200 firm. Considering the importance of this survey, the response rate was shockingly low — only 30 firms responded, with 24 coming from Am Law 100 firms, and six coming from Am Law 200 firms. These issues don’t just occur at certain firms, they occur at every firm, and it’s time for Biglaw to embrace this fact and do something about it.

Despite the disappointing response rate, they revealed several major findings:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The overwhelming majority of law firms report that alcohol abuse, depression and anxiety are occurring at their firms; half said the same about drug abuse. The stigma surrounding substance abuse, addiction and mental health problems is pervasive in Big Law. Firms are providing at least some training and resources around these issues, but they appear to be insufficient, underutilized, or both. In addition, firms worry most about addiction and mental health problems in the context of potential harm to clients, and see stress and workload as the No. 1 driver of the problems.

Let’s get a little more specific about the responses from these 30 firms:

- 90 percent of the firms that responded either agree or strongly agree that alcohol abuse occurs in the firm;
- 48 percent agree or strongly agree that drug abuse occurs in the firm; 86 percent agree or strongly agree that depression occurs in the firm; and
- 93 percent agree or strongly agree that anxiety occurs in the firm.
With the percentages this high among the 30 firms that did respond, it’s simply maddening that 170 other Biglaw firms couldn’t even be bothered to provide this relevant information. These are truths that must be exposed in the legal profession.

When it comes to attorneys with mental health issues or substance abuse issues, Biglaw leaders are most concerned about the threat to clients and their firms’ reputation, with damage to attorney productivity and their work environment viewed as secondary worries. After all, who cares if lawyers are drunk and depressed, so long as they’re productive and keeping their problems at home… right? Wrong. “It is completely unreasonable to believe that law firms are somehow exempt from those national trends, despite the historic lack of emphasis they have placed on behavioral health as a key factor in profitability,” Krill says. “While I can certainly understand—and agree with—firms perceiving the most negative impact of substance abuse and mental health problems as being a threat or damage to clients, I remain more convinced than ever that large law firms under-appreciate the profound economic inefficiencies that substance abuse and mental health problems introduce into their operations.”

Although quite a few Biglaw firms have already pledged to help lawyers struggling with these issues, it’s obvious that the rest really need to get with the program — they need to seriously rehab their prejudices and actually assist their attorneys.

Your pitches make in-house counsel want to close their heads inside their laptops.

It is the time of the year when state legislatures across the country generally shake off the slumber of winter and reconvene for the year.

Which means for a many a Biglaw Government Relations team, even though the holidays may be in the rearview mirror, their Christmas is just beginning.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Being the sizable health care provider that we are, we regularly engage the services of Biglaw for their lobbying work. Generally, we work with firms with both a Washington D.C. and a local office, since most everything that we do is stringently governed by some sort of federal and/or state law or regulation.

Unsurprisingly, firms with both federal and state lobbying practices under one roof tend to be expensive — very expensive. This has caused us to annually shop around our engagement to ensure we are getting the best value for our account.

I have been in many traditional Biglaw pitch sessions and generally the winner is easy to pick for a particular engagement. Which firm has the most experienced lawyers on the subject matter in question? What is their pedigree? How much do they cost? How successful have they been for similarly positioned clients in the past? And best of all, their track record of litigation success is public record so you can quickly verify they are not overstating their success rate.

A quick evaluation of all of these factors helps the proverbial cream rise to the top rather quickly. Finding the right firm to service your government relations needs, however, is an entirely different beast.

An all Harvard law pedigreed team will matter little if one of them has a bad reputation with a random state senator or representative. Similarly, since we are a Midwestern state, we have a large rural population which is represented by, shall we say, rural legislators. And our experience has shown those particular rural legislators do not take kindly to them “big-city” lawyers telling them how to represent their constituents.

With the traditional calculus for selecting a Biglaw firm out the window, the annual pitches we receive tend to take on the feeling of a used car and a snake oil salesman all rolled into one.

We have had pitches where the firm promises they can pass any piece of legislation we could conjure up. Right, because in today’s day and age where we are facing a federal government shutdown this Friday (even though the House, Senate, and White House are controlled by the same party), your firm miraculously can shepherd through a piece of legislation which only benefits us as a single client.

We have had firms who guarantee us access to any elected official at any point in time from the governor on down. Sure, I am sure some of those elected officials who are scheduled months in advance down to the minute will gladly cancel for us, one of a hundred health care providers in the state.

And my personal favorite, those who claim to have some “dirt” on a politician which they know they can exchange for a favor for us as their client. Yes, please tell me more about the morally/legally dubious way in which you plan to advance our cause with elected officials.

At the end of the day, our hospital is still looking for a Biglaw partner who will serve as our partner for a venture beyond the resources of our sparsely populated in-house office. Shoot us straight, tell us when we are being unreasonable, and deliver us tangible wins.

Promise the moon which I know you can’t deliver, and you can bet you will be lumped in with all the other car/snake oil salesmen I have sadly grown accustomed to.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

It’s like wading through treacle to get to the promised land and finding that in the promised land there is just more treacle. In advance, I didn’t seriously think this by the time I got there, but when I was much younger, when I was first [employed], I was expecting a huge change but actually when you get there, it’s much of a muchness and I’m paid more money, but nothing has changed.

— an anonymous Biglaw partner, in comments given to the authors of a recent study by the University of Bath and noted by [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/12/18/from-rose-coloured-glasses-to-disillusionment-the-emotions-lawyers-experience-on-the-partner-track-405-133742/), in which the emotions of those on the partnership track were assessed and evaluated. The researchers determined that there are four emotions those on the partnership track experience: aspiration/excitement, anxiety/uncertainty, pride/joy, and finally, disillusionment/disappointment.

# Cravath Already Kicked Off Bonus Season, But Where Are All The Bonuses?!?

Cravath started the 2021 bonus season on Monday, November 22, announcing a [brand new $15K to $115K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) (up 15% over the scale that had been in use since 2014). Thus far, Cravath’s bonuses have gotten [less than a handful of matches](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/), and it’s been more than a week since the announcement was made.

Associates are starting to get a little nervous. What is going on here? Cravath has obviously already given its seal of approval. What could be the hold up? Where are all the bonuses?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Could it be that the rest of the firms that have yet to announce their own bonus scales are waiting on a certain law firm — hmm, let’s say Davis Polk, for example — to announce a bigger, better bonus scale? Is that what’s causing this bonus backlog?

If that’s the case (and we’re almost certain that it is), then why not just announce bonuses on the current Cravath scale now, and match the new scale later? These Biglaw firms know very well that they’re likely going to match whatever Davis Polk puts out anyway, if Davis Polk does, in fact, one-up the Cravath bonus scale.

Why keep your incredibly hard-working associates waiting? Boohoo, you’ll have to write a second bonus memo with a second match. You can do it. We believe in you!

Get this show on the road for the sake of your attorneys who have been billing their butts off during a pandemic and leading to record profits. Announce your bonuses.

As for Davis Polk, the entire Biglaw market is waiting for the firm to make its move. Right now, associates know what the bottom of the 2021 bonus market looks like. Will DPW ante up even more cash for lawyers during these unprecedented times, on top of its special bonuses? We suppose we’ll have to impatiently wait and see.

# More Layoffs, More STFU, And Yes, More Tom Girardi
## It is left as an exercise for the student to imagine what Tom Girardi's yearly performance review would look like.

Most of you don’t remember Jack Welch, who ran GE years ago. He was known as “Neutron Jack,” because he would lay off employees but leave the buildings standing. Welch believed in the concept of “rank and yank,” that is, poor performers would lose their jobs on an annual basis. It was Welch’s very own bell curve. One issue with “[rank and yank](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-01-27/companies-cant-quit-jack-welchs-employee-ranking-system)” aka “forced rankings” was that it could depend upon whom the employee was being compared to.  If he was in a group of high-performing colleagues, he lost. If he was in a group of mediocre to lower performing cohorts, his job would be saved.

Yearly performance evaluations are a waste. Employees go merrily along, thinking everything is okay, and then the equivalent of a neutron bomb (see above) is dropped upon them at review time. Not a peep had been said during the evaluation period, no counselings, no feedback, nada, zip, zilch, and then poof! Suddenly, the employee receives a “below expectations” review and faces termination. Sandbagged? Did any supervisor or manager meet with the employee to discuss concerns sufficiently in advance of the evaluation, so that the employee could take corrective action? What do you think?

Here’s [a warning call to all firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/industry-expert-cant-believe-there-havent-been-more-outright-layoffs-in-biglaw-yet/) involved in laying off attorneys, staff, or both.   Alternative Legal Service Providers (ALSPs) are drooling at [the opportunities these layoffs will give them](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/as-law-firms-start-layoffs-alternative-legal-services-providers-grow-like-gangbusters/). ALSPs now represent about $20 billion of the legal market, not exactly chump change. It may well be that they will take on even more work as lawyers leave their current gigs for a variety of reasons.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
While reasons for quitting during the pandemic and even after do vary, toxic workplaces prompt employees to leave. They are fed up with incompetence, mismanagement, and a lack of leadership. Perhaps [Peter Finch in this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WINDtlPXmmE) from the 1976 movie “Network” said it best.

One reason that Gen X and Gen Y peeps are less worried about security at work than the dinosaurs: health insurance availability. We stayed at jobs we hated because we needed to maintain health insurance and so we were handcuffed to the jobs. That’s no longer the case. I know too many peeps who stayed while wanting desperately to leave, but their families needed the health coverage, especially if there were illnesses.  Like it or not, “Obamacare” has sprung many people from health insurance jail.

A recent Time magazine cover featured a pair of [lips with a zipper](https://time.com/6248092/talking-less-will-get-you-more/) on them. The premise of the story and you can probably guess what it was: often it’s better to zip it and say nothing. In a world of oversharing and overtalking — and social media seems to take the prize for oversharing — being discreet or circumspect seems to be a relic of a bygone era. How many of us have been in situations where oversharing was the rule and not the exception?

Too many times have I thought “Ew!” to a colleague’s sharing more than I could possibly want to know. TMI. [Too many times](https://time.com/94555/10-times-youre-better-off-saying-nothing-at-all/), it’s been the men overtalking (no surprise there) while interrupting anyone else who had the audacity to wade into the conversation.

Here are some rules about when to zip it, taken from “[STFU: The Power of Keeping Your Mouth Shut in an Endlessly Noisy World](https://bookshop.org/a/4973/9781250850348)“: 

- When you are asked a question (remember the advice that you always give a witness: don’t volunteer, just answer the question asked);
- When you are blithering, aka you are clueless as to what you are talking about;
- When you want someone else to get the credit (yes, that does actually happen);
- When you are bragging, not sharing (and there is a difference);
- When it’s all about you (so what else is new?);
- When you want someone else to grow (how about letting a junior associate argue the motion?);
- When you are boring people (the fork stuck in you says that you are done).
Do you think there should be an “Oversharers/Overtalkers Anonymous?” recovery group, where lawyers might learn how not to overshare/overtalk? To learn how to zip it? To learn how to listen? It’s not that hard to STFU, to stifle yourself.

And last, but not least, I had thought I would be able to write for a while without mentioning [Tom Girardi](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-01/tom-girardi-indictment-la-lawyer). (Sorry, ATL editors.) However, Girardi has now been indicted in separate federal cases in both Los Angeles and Chicago. In the LA case, Girardi is accused, along with his CFO, of ripping off $15 million from clients. In Chicago, Girardi stands accused, along with his law partner and son-in-law David Lira, and the CFO of diverting settlement funds due to victims of an Indonesian airline crash. Girardi’s crash and burn continues.

# Lawyerly Lairs: George And Kellyanne Conway's $8 Million Mansion
## This prominent presidential adviser and her husband, a longtime Biglaw partner, are living large.

The real estate purchases of George and Kellyanne Conway can change history. If the Conways hadn’t lived in Manhattan’s Trump World Tower, where Kellyanne Conway served on the condo board, Kellyanne [might never have met](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/a-closer-look-at-george-conway-wachtell-lipton-partner-and-husband-of-kellyanne-conway/) Donald Trump. If Kellyanne had never met Donald Trump, she might never have served as his campaign manager. If she hadn’t served as his campaign manager — she stepped in at a crucial time, when the campaign was in a tailspin, and turned things around — Donald Trump might not be our president.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Kellyanne Conway, a leading pollster and political strategist, now serves as a senior adviser to President Trump. Her husband [George T. Conway III](http://www.wlrk.com/GTConway/), a longtime litigation partner at Wachtell Lipton, reportedly will be nominated to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Division. (But I do wonder why his nomination hasn’t been announced yet; could he be having second thoughts, like some [other potential Trump appointees?](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/28/trump-russia-scandal-government-lawyer-hiring-238887))

Given that that their real estate transactions can change history, it is fitting and proper that we look at the Conways’ latest purchase: a lavish lawyerly lair in D.C.’s ritzy Massachusetts Avenue Heights, acquired for a cool $7.785 million.

How did they afford this magnificent mansion? They both had highly successful pre-government careers — she as a top pollster, he as a partner at a firm with [almost $6 million](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-2017-am-law-100-a-turning-point-for-biglaw/) in profits per partner last year — and they boast assets that could be worth as much as $44 million, according to Kellyanne’s [financial disclosure form](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/04/the-lawyers-in-the-trump-white-house-how-much-are-they-worth-part-1/). And recall that financial disclosures don’t include the value of primary residences — so that $44 million doesn’t include this $8 million home, nor the Conways’ [$6 million home](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/kellyanne-conways-political-machinations) in tony Alpine, New Jersey. (It’s not clear whether they’ve sold the residence in Alpine — “America’s most expensive zip code,” according to Forbes — or whether they still own it.)

The Conways went into contract for their D.C. digs back in April, as Marisa Kashino reported for [Washingtonian](https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/06/kellyanne-conways-new-house/) at the time. The deal closed on May 17 and the deed got recorded last week, according to the [Washington Business Journal](http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/05/25/kellyanne-conway-buys-a-spectacular-d-c-mansion.html) — which notes these clues about the buyers’ identities:

Broker sources tell the Washington Business Journal this was a Conway buy. The home was purchased under the name Antoinette Associates LLC, and it so happens that Kellyanne Conway’s maternal grandmother was named Antoinette.

And it was a steal. The home was originally listed years ago for $22 million, then the price dropped to $18 million, then roughly $12 million, then $8 million. It’s been on and off the market since at least 2012. The property’s 2016 assessment was just shy of $10.7 million, per the D.C. tax office.

Citibank N.A. provided a loan of about $5.8 million to Antoinette Associates, according to trust documents filed with the Recorder of Deeds and signed on behalf of the LLC by an associate in George Conway’s law firm.

This strikes me as credible evidence that the Conways are the buyers. But if Kellyanne Conway would like to present [“alternative facts,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts) I will happily hear her out.

I reached out to George Conway for comment, but did not hear back from him. Samu Qureshi — son of the former prime minister of Pakistan, prior owner of the house — also declined comment to Washingtonian, citing a confidentiality agreement.

But who needs comment? A picture is worth a thousand words — and we have [several pretty pictures to share….](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/lawyerly-lairs-george-and-kellyanne-conways-8-million-mansion/2/)

# Is Trial By Combat Coming To NYC?

Well, I am kinda foolin’ ya since this is a story about an attorney from Staten Island, not really the city (I am from there, I am allowed to make these jokes). But this isn’t a fever dream caused by a dangerous combination of limoncello and binge watching Game of Thrones, it is an honest to goodness, real-life court filing requesting a trial by combat.

Listen, Staten Islanders — I know that a BOAT is still a popular method of conveyance (and not in a rich person, yacht-y kind of a way), but it is not actually the 1700s, so maybe layoff on the antiquated legal procedures? No? Okay then. Bring on the trial by combat.

I guess this is how we do it in the rugged lands of Shaolin — at least in a post-George R.R. Martin world.

Attorney [Richard A. Luthmann](http://www.luthmannfirm.com/) is the defendant in a lawsuit which alleges he advised a client to liquidate assets and transfer them “beyond the reach of creditors,” such that when the plaintiffs sought money they were owed by Luthmann’s client, they were unable to recover the money. So the next step for the plaintiffs was to sue the lawyer. Luthmann strongly contests these allegations, and he has some choice phrases for the plaintiffs:

[W]hen viewed in a light most favorable to opposing counsel – [the allegations can] only be termed as a glorified comic book piled on top of pure and adulterated extortion wrapped in a transparent abuse of legal process.

Well, why don’t you tell us how you really feel. Oh, he does — calling the plaintiffs “professional thugs.” Glorious.

Luthmann also has little respect for plaintiffs’ counsel, querying:

From Pilot and Above The Law  
[W]hether opposing counsel was asleep the day in law school when they actually practiced law.

Sick burn.

So it seems Luthmann is mad as hell and he isn’t going to take it anymore. Fair enough. But he wants to put more than just words on the line — bankruptcy is something he “intends to pursue before extortionists [plaintiffs] take a red cent of his hard-earned money.”

But is there another way to really amp up the stakes? Faced with, what he believes, is an absurd lawsuit, Luthman responded in kind, requesting the said trial by combat. From the [Staten Island Advance ](http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2015/08/real-life_game_of_thrones_layw.html)(pronounced add-vance in my best Staten Island intonation):

“They want to be absurd about what they’re trying to do, then I’ll give them back ridiculousness in kind,” said Luthmann, an admitted fan of “Game of Thrones,” the smash HBO series based on the George R.R. Martin books in which three disputes have been settled in its five seasons through bloody trials by combat.

“If these people want to insist on having it out, then we’ll have it out,” said Luthmann, who’s tilted at a few windmills over the years, as evidenced by his numerous battles with local Democratic Party leaders.

And, though he admits the absurdity of the request, Luthmann is still rocking a legal argument, specifically the 9th Amendment:

But he insists there’s a bigger Constitutional issue here: Exactly what rights are protected under the Ninth Amendment?

The amendment protects all the rights of the people not mentioned specifically elsewhere in the Constitution. In this case, it’s trial by combat, says Luthmann.

“The judge may look askance at it, but I’m prepared to take it to the highest level,” Luthmann said. “I’d love to have a court determine whether we have those rights under the Constitution.”

At least Luthmann knows there are personal and professional risks involved in this cockamany scheme:

The lawyer realizes his request for mortal combat isn’t without personal risk.

“One of the inconveniences of this procedure is, that the party who institutes it must be willing, if required, to stake his life in support of his accusation,” he wrote.

Luthmann may be sticking his neck out professionally, as well.

He acknowledged the judge could take a dim view of his request, when a reporter asked him that question.

A court might take a “dim view of his request”? That is just the ultimate in understatement. Well played. You’d think that a place known for spawning Mob Wives wouldn’t get nuance, but welp, you’d be wrong — and pleasantly so.

Car rides home.
Free dinner after 8.
Braves tickets.
Charity gala tickets.
Free coffee (and creamer!).
Dream tickets.  (It’s a [WNBA team](http://dream.wnba.com/).  What, you didn’t know that?  Try to be a little more enlightened.)

Now, I don’t have any of that stuff.  I leave work and there’s no line of black cars.  I have to enter my own credit card information into SeamlessWeb (the horror).  No charity galas.  I can’t even consider the coffee free, since I have to buy the K-Cups myself.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Do I miss it?  Maybe a little.  One of the guards on the Dream was pretty cute.  And when there was a big Braves game in the evening, I liked the gamesmanship of all of us staring down at our blackberries (because emails hit mobile devices a few seconds before they hit desktops) trying to see who could fire off the email accepting the tickets first.  (If you were really good, you already had the message written, so you just had to cut and paste.)  Once, I even got Rolling Stones tickets.

But you learn to live without all that stuff, because at the end of the day, you don’t need it.  To be a lawyer, you just need you, your legal skills, and clients.  That’s why it doesn’t cost much to open a practice.  Maybe [having an office](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/the-office-decision/) will help you provide legal services in a more effective manner, but how do last-minute baseball tickets contribute to this?  I’m not even sure how productive we all were when it was nearing 6 p.m. and we were staring down at our smartphones.

It’s a natural progression to want to be your own boss when you’re older.  And though it’s great to finally have no one but clients telling you what to do, you have to give up the perks.  It’s almost childish to whine about them, like saying you won’t ride in the car seat without your favorite toy.  No 50-year-old with a successful practice is sitting around stressing over whether he’s going to get free Braves tickets that evening.  (They stink this year anyway.)

This is, of course, universal.  My firm is a small business, and I’ve written before about how I now feel a special [kinship with my small business clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/04/part-of-the-community/), who have all made the same choice.  I’m not about to complain to an owner of a bistro who works dusk to dawn 365 days a year to make payroll every two weeks that no one is giving me free Justin Bieber tickets.  In Biglaw, the people at our client companies with whom I was interacting on a daily basis were also in the [middle of the totem pole](http://www.ebitinfosys.com/8-key-to-successfully-move-your-way-up-the-work-totem-pole-by-ambra-benjamin/), also getting dinners and car rides home, so we could commiserate if, say, car rides home weren’t available for some reason and one of us had to take a taxi or (gasp) the subway. Not anymore.

All that is necessary is me, my legal skills, and clients. (Paying clients, preferably.) I might miss being able to order dinner on a client’s dime, but I can afford my own burrito bowl, and even when I can’t — e.g., if I get stuck with clients who don’t pay — as Aesop said, [better to starve free than be a fat slave](http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/28.html).

# Beyond Biglaw: Interview With A 'NewLaw' Pioneer (Part 2)
## The conclusion of an interview with the COO of a law firm offering clients and lawyers an alternative to Biglaw structure and rates.

Last week was [part one](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/beyond-biglaw-interview-with-a-newlaw-pioneer-part-i/) of a written interview with [Marlene Laro](http://www.potomaclaw.com/attorney-profiles/marlene-e-laro/), partner and chief operating officer of [Potomac Law Group](http://www.potomaclaw.com/), a law firm founded with the idea of offering clients and lawyers an alternative to BigLaw structure and rates. I want to thank Marlene for sharing her insights, and for having the courage and wherewithal to build a successful new firm based on a business model that benefits both clients and the firm’s lawyers. While the legal industry can support a range of legal service providers, there is an expectation that NewLaw firms explain their model as compared to the classic pyramid/apprenticeship model embraced by traditional law firms. We pick up the conversation around that point….

GK: How important is the ability to compete with BigLaw on price/compensation when it comes to attracting ‎talent and clients?

ML: Very. Law is a relationship-based industry, filled with long-term, durable representations. Disrupting those relationships is difficult and takes time, even with highly skilled lawyers working in a modern, efficient environment. If we were only marginally less expensive than the big firms, say 10 or 15 percent, I don’t think we would have gained the traction we’ve seen (60 percent compound annual growth rate over the last five years). But the substantial reduction in rate coupled with the terrific team has helped get us noticed.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
On the recruiting side, better compensation is one of a handful of key factors generating interest in our model, especially among the BigLaw partner set. Others are less bureaucracy, enhanced quality of life, greater ability to telecommute, and better work-life integration.

GK: What reservations have you encountered from GCs in developing the business?

ML: As with any new idea, it takes some time for mindsets to shift. Historically, the legal industry tends to be slow-evolving and risk-averse. I have heard the saying “nobody ever got fired for hiring Cravath” many times. It is understandable that GCs would still seek out Biglaw firms for “bet the company” litigation or big public M&A deals. At the same time, GCs understand that a significant amount of work performed by outside counsel does not require a Biglaw approach. Our value proposition – experienced lawyers at a fraction of the Biglaw rate – presents a good opportunity to try something new in those areas.

GK: How scalable is your model in terms of firm size and geographic expansion? When do conflicts become a bigger problem?

As with any firm our size, conflicts do occasionally play a role (as they should), and we on occasion have had to decline a representation. But that is not a meaningful factor in our expansion calculus at this point.

GK: While your firm started with an unusually heavy concentration of female and minority lawyers, it looks like your expansion has not been limited to lawyers falling within one of those groups. Why, and what do you learn from that transition?


Marlene Laro

ML: We are very proud of our diversity. Over half of the firm’s management team, partners and counsel are women. Last month, [Working Mother](http://www.workingmother.com/working-mother-20-companies-to-watch#page-10) magazine named Potomac Law, along with Google, Facebook and Starbucks, as among the top 20 innovative companies in the crucial areas of women’s advancement and work life integration.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
At the firm’s founding in 2011, almost all of our attorneys were women. Interestingly, as we grew both in number and visibility, we received enormous interest from a greater variety of lawyers – female/male, rainmakers/service lawyers, full-time/part-time – as well as lawyers at different stages in their careers. We learned that nearly all lawyers enjoy the flexibility and autonomy built into our firm’s model, but often for different reasons. Initially, lawyers sought us out for the opportunity to work with a familiar colleague base on matters similar to what they had experienced in Biglaw, but with the ability to maximize work-life integration. Over time, we began to attract the interest of Biglaw partners seeking greater control over their rates and a higher portion of the fees they generated. Many of our lawyers billed at rates approaching $1,000/hour; those ever-increasing rates, coupled with Biglaw’s resistance to discounts, create much frustration for lawyers seeking to build – or even maintain – their practices. Other lawyers have concluded that our model enables them to be more entrepreneurial, a quality that is not always encouraged in Biglaw.

GK: Do you ever feel like you are giving up something by getting bigger or moving away from a primarily female/minority-staffed firm?

ML: Not really. Our growth has been steady – nearly 60 lawyers in five years – and purposeful. We are careful that the fit, both in terms of practice area and attorney personality and style, is a good one for our firm culture. And we have not departed much from our roots. As of now, our firm essentially reflects the composition of law school graduating classes in terms of gender and ethnicity. We believe that balance is – and remains – an essential part of our success.

# Another Am Law 200 Firm Cutting Salaries And Furloughing Staff
## Another firm institutes cost-cutting measures.

At some point, perhaps in a few weeks or so, it will be easier to track the Biglaw firms that aren’t cutting salaries than those that are. But right now reports of salary cuts are coming in quickly, and each one has an impact on the overall landscape of Biglaw.

The latest firm to cut salaries is Snell & Wilmer, a firm with $262,000,000 in 2018 gross revenue making it 120th in the Am Law 200. Tipsters report Snell Wilmer is cutting associate salaries by 10 percent. Some staff, those who can’t work remotely, are also being furloughed, and the firm will keep paying their portion of benefits and give them legal advice to navigate CARES Act benefits.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Matthew P. Feeney, chair of the firm, provided this comment:

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Snell & Wilmer has been committed to doing everything possible to ensure the health and safety of our staff, attorneys, clients, and communities, while continuing to provide the highest quality legal services in a timely and efficient manner. Consistent with that commitment and in furtherance of the long-term success of the entire Snell & Wilmer family, we announce the difficult decision to implement pay reductions at the firm and furloughs for certain employees who are unable to work remotely due to the nature of their positions or whose work has significantly declined because of the current crisis.

In May, partners’ monthly draws and the base salaries of non-partner attorneys will be reduced by 10 percent. Administrative professionals will see reductions from 1 percent to 10 percent depending on their annual salaries.

The furloughed individuals are valued members of the Snell & Wilmer team and we expect to bring them back following the furlough. The firm will cover both the employer and employee portion of health, life, and long-term disability insurance premiums for all furloughed employees. Snell & Wilmer attorneys are assisting furloughed employees in obtaining unemployment and CARES Act benefits. These employees have also been invited to participate in our weekly staff town hall meetings.

These decisions were difficult, but we believe they will best serve our clients and our team. Going into this pandemic, Snell & Wilmer has never been stronger. We know this extremely challenging time will pass.

Best of luck to those dealing with austerity measures.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know. Our vast network of tipsters is part of what makes Above the Law thrive. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs/Salary%20Cuts) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Running Our Own Gauntlets
## Gender is going to matter in your career. You don’t want it to, but it is better to come to terms with it early.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts on motherhood in the legal profession, in partnership with our friends at [MothersEsquire](https://www.mothersesquire.com/). Welcome Kate McKune to our pages.

A dear friend from law school was in town recently for work, and we had one of those evenings where you stay up too late talking because you just don’t see each other enough.  We sat in my car outside her hotel for an extra hour while I was supposed to be dropping her off, talking about our work, our families, our aging parents, and our health.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Seventeen years (!!) out of a top 10 law school, we have really different lives.  She is a kick-ass litigation partner in a Biglaw firm in New York who lives between two cities, travels nationally to try mass tort cases, and has three dogs and a very good college basketball team she adores.  After a clerkship and a short Biglaw stint in D.C., I spent a dozen years in private practice at a litigation boutique in a mid-size city. I have been general counsel at a regional financial institution for the last two years. My husband and I have three kids, now 6-13, who are currently engaged in loads of activities and a serious lobbying effort to add just one dog (“Please!?!”) to our household.

These differences bear out broadly in our group of female law school friends too.  Almost all are still working as lawyers, but they are Am Law 50 practice group chairs and big industry power players, small company GCs and counsel in-house and outside, with FBI agents in between.  We are in big cities and smaller cities. Some are married; some are not.  Some are childless; some are not. Some have scaled back their work at times or permanently; some have not.

But as my friend and I talked that night, in spite of the differences in our day-to-day work and the arcs of our careers, and in spite of the privileges we admittedly enjoy because we are straight and white, we kept coming back to the way gender has mattered in our careers and in this group of friends.  She said, “We have really had to run our own gauntlets, haven’t we?”

We have made choice after choice in our company to ensure we were “beyond reproach” and no one could claim that our children affected our work, only to have a less-experienced male counterpart promoted above us. We have had to invest precious hours to serve on the firm comp committee because we see repeatedly that our female colleagues are cut out of fair compensation.  We have had a law firm partner complain straight-faced that we did not ask him before we had another baby.  We have had to endure a male colleague who undercuts and competes against us, even within the firm, and whose retaliation we have to take into account.  We have stood while a colleague told a young male associate we were “too nice” to make a certain argument.  We have seen the motherhood penalty play out many ways, including incremental marginalization in our organizations as opportunities went elsewhere.  And these are just a few examples among this group of women.

Over and over in the time since law school, I have considered the advice I would give a group of third-year female law students, thinking really about the advice I wish someone could have given me then.  I fantasize taking these women friends with me to talk about our experiences, because as wide-ranging as the career and life paths of my female friends from law school have been, there are these striking common threads.

Yes, I would tell those younger women that what they want may change over time.  What looks, from the vantage point of your 3L year, like the next brass ring, the next in an impressive string of achievements, will evolve as life does — as personal relationships change, as parents age, as you decide whether to be a parent yourself, as career twists and turns come and go.

And yes, I would tell them there are more paths than you can imagine to a fulfilling career and life.  I would ask them to be open to the possibilities of opportunities they did not imagine and to pick what is right for each of them.

But I also would tell them that gender is going to matter.  You don’t want it to, and I am sorry that it does, but it is better to come to terms with it early.  Gender is a factor when you don’t want it to be, and I can only imagine the complexity when it is layered with race and/or sexual orientation.  We can implore those younger women not to spend years beating themselves up or wondering “Is it just me?”  It is not.

Maybe, if they can listen to me, to my friends, tell our stories of the pernicious and pervasive ways it has mattered for us, they can avoid some of the struggles we have had.  Maybe they can keep from internalizing criticism that is really about broken systems that are still not working for women in law.  Maybe they can help us keep trying to change the systems.

Maybe they can hear the recommendation to find an honest mentor a few years older who will share her perspective, because we all have these stories.  People will tell you things have changed — just not as much as we would have hoped.  Let’s get to it.  These women and I are still here, in these workplaces, trying to be part of the solutions, and thankfully, supporting one another along the way.

# Profits Per Partner At Am Law 100 Firms That Have Not Raised Salaries For Associates

What do profits per partner (PPP) look like at the Am Law 100 law firms that have not yet raised associate pay in the wake of the new [Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/)?

Hint: Average PPP for the Am Law 100 as a whole [grew by 4 percent](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/) in 2015. Nineteen firms saw their PPP grow by at least 10 percent in 2015. Some of these firms seem to have no excuse for not giving associates raises.

# The Global 20 Law Firms Revealed (2016)

The world keeps on getting more and more interconnected, and law firms that are able to smoothly navigate those international waters are extremely valuable. Cross-border legal work is complex, and the firms that do it well deserve recognition.

[Law360](http://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/807403) has announced their list of the top 20 global law firms. Their methodology, described below, attempts to find the firms that are truly able to compete in the international legal market:

Firms are ranked based on five factors: the percentage of the firm’s attorneys located outside its home country; the number of offices outside the firm’s home country; the number of countries where the firm has at least one office; the practice area breadth of the firm’s cross-border and international work; and the size and complexity of the firm’s cross-border and international work.

The firms that make this year’s cut are:

1. Allen & Overy
2. DLA Piper
3. White & Case
4. Freshfields
5. Norton Rose Fulbright
6. Hogan Lovells
7. Baker & McKenzie
8. Squire Patton Boggs
9. Shearman & Sterling
10. Skadden
11. Dentons
12. Herbert Smith
13. K&L Gates
14. Cleary Gottlieb
15. Dechert
16. Paul Hastings
17. Reed Smith
18. Mayer Brown
19. Gibson Dunn
20. Orrick

These firms combined have offices in 227 cities around the word, and every single one has offices in New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong and Beijing. And most of them know how to compete for the best talent in New York — all the firms but five ([Norton Rose Fulbright, Squire Patton Boggs, Dentons, Herbert Smith, and Reed Smith](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/?rf=1)) have already raised the salaries of those associates to the recently announced $180K scale.

Congratulations to all the firms on the list!

# AI-Powered Legal Recruitment: Revolutionize Your Law Firm With haistack.ai
## Haistack - Law Firm, developed in partnership with Lateral Link, revolutionizes legal recruitment by using AI to efficiently source and retain top attorney talent.

[Haistack – Law Firm](https://haistack.ai/law-firm/), developed by [Michael Heise](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/09/meet-the-cto-of-haistack-ai-and-creator-of-haistack-law-firm-a-qa-with-michael-heise/), in partnership with Lateral Link, greatly simplifies and enhances the process of sourcing candidates for attorney roles. It also helps firms identify which of their current lawyers are likely to be in high demand in the lateral marketplace, enabling more targeted retention efforts.

Making recruiting and retention more efficient and effective

Traditional mechanisms for sourcing lateral candidates are laborious and slow. Recruiters typically conduct LinkedIn keyword searches and ask contacts in their network to suggest potential candidates. Haistack – Law Firm replaces a process that often takes a couple of weeks with one that requires only a couple of clicks. Firms can manually add jobs, that are not posted publicly, and our AI takes minutes to return a list of best candidates not only for the job but for the firm also. This process would normally take days.

Haistack – Law Firm uses machine learning to identify the best candidates for a specific attorney role. The tool aggregates publicly available attorney, firm, and law firm job data from across the internet and enriches it with proprietary Lateral Link data. The goal is not merely to find candidates who have the necessary seniority in the relevant practice area and geographic market. Rather, Haistack – Law Firm also identifies those likely to be cultural fits by analyzing the profiles of a firm’s current attorneys and highlighting similarities between that current pool and a potential candidate. Where did the candidate go to law school? Did they write for a journal? Did they graduate with honors? Haistack – Law Firm considers factors like these and illustrates specific connections between a candidate and a firm. When recruiters or hiring partners review the Haistack – Law Firm output, they are presented with the estimated strength of fit for each identified candidate and the logic underlying that determination. All these characteristics are badged on a candidate profile and seen by the users of Haistack – Law Firm.

Based on the connections that Haistack – Law Firm highlights, strategies for contacting high-potential candidates who have not yet applied are immediately apparent. A recruiter can turn to a current lawyer at the firm who is connected to a potential candidate both to validate the prediction of a strong match and to help reach out to the candidate and sell them on the role. Not only does Haistack – Law Firm reduce the time to identify candidates, but it also makes the process of cultivating them more efficient and effective.

Haistack – Law firm provides an additional source of insight to assist with retention. Given the tool’s ability to identify external lawyers who would be strong lateral candidates, it equally can determine which members of a firm’s current attorney pool are a likely flight risk, based on compatibility between their profiles and opportunities in the wider marketplace. This early warning will prompt firms to evaluate how much they value at-risk talent, while there is still time for affirmative steps to retain critical team members who are in high demand.

Shorter time to fill vacancies = less foregone profit

Filling vacant attorney roles efficiently makes a substantial difference to a law firm’s profits. As we have [previously](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/maximizing-law-firm-profits-the-impact-of-expert-legal-recruitment-strategies/) [explored](https://haistack.ai/the-true-cost-of-vacancies-addressing-lost-profits-in-law-firm-recruitment-departments/), a single sixth-year associate slot left vacant for 30 days could cost $117,329 in lost profits. The estimated loss escalates to $351,986 if the vacancy remains open for 90 days. With figures like these at stake, the business case for investing in a more efficient recruiting process is obvious.

85% of roles for which Lateral Link is the recruiter are filled within 60 days. With the help of Haistack – Law Firm, we estimate that we can reduce the expected time to fill from 60 days to 50. In the case of a sixth-year associate, this equates to a savings of $39,110.

Let’s imagine a firm with two vacancies: one for a sixth-year associate and another for a fifth-year associate. If we assume that Haistack – Law Firm helps fill these vacancies in 10 days less time than would otherwise be required, the firm will achieve savings of $39,110 (sixth-year) + $37,774 (fifth-year) = $76,884. That savings exceeds the cost of a Haistack – Law firm subscription ($75,000 for up to 5 users).

For law firms, time really is money. Traditional recruitment processes just don’t cut it—especially when your competitors have embraced more sophisticated alternatives. Haistack – Law Firm is the new way to recruit: swift, precise, and effective. Is your firm ready to operate at the forefront of recruitment innovation?

# More Peeks Inside The Black Box Of Jones Day
## In the era of Donald Trump, Jones Day is the Biglaw name on everyone's lips.

Writers at Above the Law (and [German prosecutors](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202781440396/VW-Defends-Jones-Day-After-German-Prosecutors-Raid/)) aren’t the only ones interested in looking inside the [black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) that is [Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/jones-day/). Over the past few months, this powerful and prestigious firm with a [penchant for secrecy](https://abovethelaw.com/2009/09/jones-day-secrecy-breeds-strength/) has attracted a lot of mainstream media attention — due in large part to its famous client, President Donald Trump. (Jones Day and partner Don McGahn [represented Trump during the presidential campaign](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/jones-day-helping-donald-trump-to-make-america-great-again/), and after Trump’s big win, McGahn left the firm [to become White House Counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-partner-to-be-trump-administrations-white-house-counsel/).)

The latest look inside Jones Day comes to us from Paul Barrett of [Bloomberg Businessweek](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/donald-trump-s-favorite-law-firm). After noting the [raft of Jones Day lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/jones-day-in-the-white-house-the-biglaw-firm-fills-top-jobs-in-the-trump-administration/) who are filling the upper echelons of the Trump Administration, he points out this interesting fact:

Despite some of its attorneys’ enthusiasm for serving in the Trump administration, Jones Day’s lawyers contributed only $7,422 to his campaign, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. That compares with $267,899 given to Hillary Clinton.

So even though JD is now becoming known as “Trump’s law firm,” it’s worth noting that many of its lawyers exhibit the [typical liberal leanings](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/09/the-mostly-liberal-political-ideologies-of-american-lawyers-law-schools-and-firms/) of Biglaw attorneys.

Jones Day lawyers can certainly afford to support political campaigns. Barrett summarizes the firm’s financials:

Jones Day’s revenue of $1.94 billion in 2015 ranked sixth among the top 100 firms in the American Lawyer’s most recent rankings. Partner compensation at Jones Day varies widely; the average take-home pay of just over $1 million earned a ranking of only 72nd.

That might seem a little low by Biglaw standards. But Roy Strom of the American Lawyer, in a [piece about Jones Day](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202779428361/A-Quiet-Law-Firm-With-a-Famous-Client) from earlier this month, points this out:

Jones Day only identifies one class of partners—all of whom are equity, the firm said. “There are no nonequity partners,” said Jones Day spokesman Dave Petrou. “Suggesting anything to the contrary would not be accurate.” However, several ex-partners say that there are functional divisions in the partnership. Some partners, referred to as “percentage participants,” are paid based on a portion of the firm’s profits, according to three former partners. Another group of partners makes a flat salary, creating a structure virtually equivalent to the equity and nonequity tiers at many Am Law 100 firms, they say.

According to Strom’s sources, the Jones Day partners who participate in firm profits — the lawyers who would be “equity” partners at any other Am Law 100 firm — enjoy profits per partner of around $2 million. That figure is more in line with Jones Day’s high prestige (#18 in the latest [Vault 100 rankings](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/jones-day/company-overview.aspx)).

And the years ahead could be very good for the firm. As Paul Barrett [writes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/donald-trump-s-favorite-law-firm):

Rivals say Jones Day will benefit from its prominence in the administration. Firms such as Jones Day “generally get their lawyers back having had high-level government experience and boosted their name recognition,” Karen Dunn, a partner in the Washington office of Boies Schiller Flexner who served as an associate counsel to President Obama, said in an email. William Burck, a former deputy counsel to President George W. Bush and a partner in the Washington office of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, said in an email that Jones Day gave up some of its top talent to the administration: “Noel Francisco is one of the best appellate lawyers in the country, and Greg Katsas, the deputy White House counsel, is a brilliant legal thinker.”

If the Jones Day lawyers in the Trump Administration serve the president well, this will only burnish the firm’s brand further. Note how Jones Day recently displaced Skadden as the [best brand in Biglaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/the-best-brand-in-biglaw-isnt-skadden-anymore/) — driven in part by JD’s high score in the “top of mind awareness” category.

Both Jones Day and Donald Trump seem to not like mainstream-media coverage — but one would be hard pressed to find a Biglaw firm and a political leader who are better than they are at getting it.

# A Troubling Lack Of Response To A Major Problem
## You are either part of the solution or part of the problem. It's heartening to see that some firms want to be part of the solution.

Patrick Krill, the author of the [seminal study](https://journals.lww.com/journaladdictionmedicine/fulltext/2016/02000/The_Prevalence_of_Substance_Use_and_Other_Mental.8.aspx) on problem drinking and mental health in the legal profession, recently [partnered with](https://www.law.com/2018/09/14/alm-survey-on-mental-health-and-substance-abuse-big-laws-pervasive-problem/) ALM Intelligence on a survey to get a feel for how law firms view these issues within their walls and the industry overall.

Here is the good news. Thirteen Am Law 100 and Am Law 200 law firms have signed on to the American Bar Association-sponsored pledge to do more to deal with substance use and other mental health issues within their firms and our profession at large. Here is the bad news. Only 13 law firms (to date) have signed on. Here is even worse news. Only

“It’s a confidential survey, but it will surely get out that we think there is a problem in our firm and clients won’t hire us.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Maybe the views echo an email I received from a Florida lawyer who believes the problem overstated. He has only seen one problem-drinking lawyer in his many years as a member of the bar.

Of course, his anecdotal observations are not predictive of the profession overall, and the study tells a much different story. During my shorter time as a member of the Texas Bar, I’ve seen many lawyers in firms large and small who are problem drinkers, who are dealing with clinical depression, and who have substance use issues beyond alcohol.

I could have sent him the incredibly disturbing alcohol-related photos texted to me from the most recent annual gathering of Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers or the emails I received about the flow of alcohol and inebriation in “private rooms” at the ABA Mid-Year in Vancouver. That is not meant to be an indictment of the very progressive Florida Bar or the ABA. Both are doing a lot to change the messaging and culture on these issues.  We are also not a profession of teetotalers.

It’s about being a responsible profession and acknowledging what’s at the tip of our noses. It is a problem that has solutions. Time for a cliché. You are either part of the solution or part of the problem. It’s heartening to see that some firms want to be part of the solution. Disappointing to read the survey response and at least in perception, appear that so many are indifferent. Instead of preaching to the choir maybe it’s time for a follow-up survey to survey non-responders with some simple questions about that indifference. It will probably go into the same email trash bin that the first survey went to.

While you’re indifferent or too busy, here is a hard reality. You have one or more lawyers in your firm who is struggling, whether it’s drinking, substances, or depression. Because you can’t feel or see the Earth spinning on its axis from your desk or courtroom does not mean it’s stopped.

Forget the studies. Forget the survey. Pay attention to the people around you. Their lives extend beyond the office, courtroom, and billing pressures, encompassing many things they may not feel comfortable telling you about because your office culture discourages such vulnerability. These lawyers have childhoods, families, pets. They love. They marry. They divorce. People in their lives die. Their pets die.

Let’s talk about economics. Every one of these things has an impact on the quality of work they do for you. There is no such thing as a high functioning lawyer who is struggling. There is only a decrease in functioning that may be imperceptible at first but becomes cumulative until it’s costing both the lawyer and your firm on multiple levels.

These are complex issues that won’t change overnight as a profession, but they can begin to morph into a positive culture at a human level right now, one firm at a time and one person at a time.

Let’s start with this. Find that survey you moved to trash and take it. No need to even send it in. You might be surprised at what it tells you about your own beliefs. One person at a time starts with you.

# Power Niche Marketing: Moving On To Michael Porter

Michael Porter

Sorry for all the intellectual “stuff” as I try to effectively “teach” professional services marketing through this column, but sometimes you have to buckle down to the books rather than just winging it. I didn’t get to where I am in the marketing/legal world by just wandering out and bumbling around. I took the time to read and think. So I am moving on from Peter Drucker (the topic of my last [article](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/power-niche-marketing-always-start-with-peter-drucker/?rf=1)) to Michael Porter.

Michael Porter is also very cool and a famous professor at Harvard Business School. He is known for his incredible insights into competitive advantages and his famous “Five Forces” to assess competitiveness of an “industry” are taught in “every” business school.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
He has written a ton of stuff and if you are a scholarly type, his books are like catnip to a cat; however, if you want to just learn the basics, they are explained in a great book by Joan Magretta called, aptly, [Understanding Michael Porter](http://amzn.to/2m0mzFp) (affiliate link). In any case, the buildup is over and let me get to the point.

Professor Porter is often asked what is the biggest mistake people make in the business world and he answers “trying to be better” than their competition. If you try to get “better,” all you do is spur your competitors to do the same thing. Then pricing falls or efficiency rises, etc. All that then happens is the upside from your industry (and indeed the upside from your investment in getting “better”) goes straight to the customers, and not to you. Indeed, when you are the absolute “best” you can be and so are your competitors, the result is zero profit!

So what should you do? Mr. Porter answers “be different.”

This is not far off from the concept of “innovating” is it?

You will hear a lot more about this as my articles unfold.

Also, by the way, for those of you who read my prior series of articles on Above the Law — [Reinventing the Law Business](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/reinventing-the-law-business/) — you may recall I started out that series of articles with Messrs. Drucker and Porter. They are always a good place to start.

Now to sum up and put Mr. Drucker and Mr. Porter — my intellectual heroes — together, your plan in the business world should logically be

Innovate and market to create customers

Do this by being different from others, as opposed to being better

I know this article is shorter than usual; however, this really is the basis for my marketing plan and the essence of the Power Niche — and it is worth dwelling on it.

Here is the definition of Power Niche again so you have it handy.

In brief, a Power Niche is a small-sized niche within a bigger industry that no one else yet dominates or owns. The niche isn’t obvious so you have to figure it out and “create” it. You step in and learn everything about it and everyone in it. You tell everyone about what you are doing – incessantly – and become the real “owner” of the niche merely by staking out your homestead in virgin territory. This then becomes a virtuous cycle as the more you know, the more you do, and the more you do, the more you know. Before long you are the world’s unquestioned expert in this (smaller) niche. All of this enhances your bargaining power within that niche. Instead of begging for business in the bigger industry, you now have eager clients paying you top dollar within this smaller Power Niche.

# Biglaw Porn Attorney Is In Biglaw No More

While a partner at Fox Rothschild, [Lincoln Bandlow](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/lincoln-bandlow/) has become a bit of a sensation at Above the Law. He represents the [extremely litigious](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/biglaw-firms-staggering-work-on-behalf-of-a-porn-studio/) porn studio, Strike 3 Holdings, and has filed hundreds of copyright infringement cases on behalf of that client.

The cases, largely filed against John Doe downloaders as part of what’s been described as a file-and-settle strategy, have come under fire from judges. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth of the District of Columbia said Strike 3 [“treats this court not as a citadel of justice, but as an ATM.”](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/biglaw-firm-gets-benchslapped-over-controversial-representation-of-porn-company/?rf=1) In California, another judge sanctioned Bandlow $750 for missing deadlines in [numerous copyright cases ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/fox-rothschilds-representation-of-porn-client-lands-them-in-hot-water-with-judge/)calling his actions [“willful disobedience”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/biglaw-firm-sanctioned-over-willful-disobedience-of-court/) of the court.

Despite the somewhat unsavory nature of Strike 3’s business and their litigation strategy — one judge called the company a “copyright troll” — Bandlow has defended the representation, in an[ interview with ALM,](https://www.law.com/2019/05/07/partner-representing-litigious-porn-company-leaves-fox-rothschild/) saying, “It’s good content, and a quality company that pays its employees well.”

Now, as [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/05/07/partner-representing-litigious-porn-company-leaves-fox-rothschild/) Law.com, Bandlow and the Am Law 100 firm have parted ways. Bandlow is taking the porn studio with him as a client, and he’s opened his own firm, The Law Offices of Lincoln Bandlow, and that is currently listed as the firm of record on 40 Strike 3 cases. Other Fox Rothschild attorneys who worked with Bandlow on Strike 3 cases have filed motions to withdraw as counsel.

Neither the Biglaw firm nor Bandlow have commented on the move, or whether the notorious representation precipitated it.

# Counterpoint: You're A Lawyer, Not A Sherpa

I am so goddamn sick of hero lawyers who act like physically being in the office is some kind of requirement for being good at your job. “Oh, I slapped on some Redwelds as skis and distended my ulna’s for balance, and I made it to the office by 9:35. Where are you?”

[F**k Joe](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/good-morning-biglaw-sorry-the-snowstorm-sucked/). It’s 2017. We can communicate, instantaneously, across long distances, more effectively than Force users. We have access to nearly every conceivable professional document from nearly any conceivable global position. And if you really need to see somebody, the honorable Prophet Jobs has provided a thing on your phone that literally calls itself FACETIME, as if the name itself was intended to troll Joe’s Alpine Law position.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
If you are going to work today, you’re not doing it because you have a deeper commitment to the practice of law than your colleagues. You’re doing it because you are a piss-ant little striver willing to trade efficiency for “toughness.” You’re not interested in getting the work done, you’re interested in looking like you are working. You’re going in to suck up, while other people are staying home to work.

Joe’s position is, sadly, typical of young associates who are trying to paper over their lack of talent with sheer doggedness. But their strategy often pays off, because it’s a position shared by older partners who don’t “trust” technology, and have children who are either grown or hate them so much that staying at home is uncomfortable.

For most people in the middle of their careers, coming in today is just not an option.

As I pointed out to Joe, childless genetic dead end that he is, SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED today. Daycare too, in many places. If your kids are home, you have to be home. That’s how it works in a society with strong prohibitions against child abuse.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
And if you have kids, you are more likely than not to live in the suburbs, outer boroughs, Silver Spring, Jamaica Plain, or whatever Mid-Atlantic hellscape outside the city center you’ve moved to in order to raise your brood. That means you rely on roads and commuter rail to get to work. You can’t just take a zipline from your building to the office like you did when you were 25 and lived only for yourself.

We don’t have the social net OR the infrastructure necessary to help a family with two working parents make it in on days like today. Don’t blame me… I’ve never voted for a Republican in my life.

There are people who have to be outside today. Mainly, those are people who did not have the privilege of investing hundreds of thousands of dollars into their educations in order to score a coveted “indoors job.” You are a lawyer: not a firefighter, not a bartender, not a “student athlete” with millions of dollars riding on your play-in game. NOBODY NEEDS TO SEE YOUR DUMBASS TODAY.

Stay home. Stay safe. Stay the hell off the roads.

And when Joe emails you from the office [talking about](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/quotes?item=qt0461247) “Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities?” — remember that Dick Hallorann would have survived The Shining if he had just stayed the f**k home and left the crazy white people to their fates.

# Legal Briefs Usually Don't Need To Be Perfect
## Although no judge has ever rejected a legal brief because it was too well written, edited, and proofed, a diminished return on investment is reached at a certain point.

For many litigation matters, legal briefs are the main way for a litigant to convey their point to a court and persuade a judge to rule in that party’s favor. Depending on the jurisdiction and the judge, courts often do not grant oral argument, so briefs are possibly the only option for litigants to argue their case. Accordingly, lawyers and other legal professionals spend an incredible amount of money ensuring that no typos or formatting issues might make a brief look bad. However, legal briefs do not need to be perfect, and a cost-benefit analysis might suggest that lawyers spend less time proofreading a legal brief for typos or other issues.

I am the type of person who spends an incredible amount of time making sure my legal briefs have no typos or similar issues. Typically, I get to work researching and drafting the substance of the brief as soon as possible. After my arguments are drafted, I review the brief — perhaps a dozen or more times — making sure that I catch the errors that might make the brief look bad to a reader.

The day I file a brief, I typically sit at my desk for hours making sure that everything is perfect. Something about a filing deadline gives me greater clarity, and typically, right before filing, I catch glaring typos that I had not been able to see in the days or even weeks leading up to a filing deadline. Making changes to my drafts to correct typos adds to the stress of filing documents, and I am usually very relieved after I finalize and file legal briefs and other legal papers.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
I have spoken to law clerks and judges over my career about how courts operate to get a better sense of how to improve my practices to achieve the best results possible for my clients. On several occasions, I have been told that courts usually only look at legal briefs once or twice, and they might not look too closely at the documents. As a result, they might not even catch a typo or another grammatical mistake in legal papers. Even if courts do find a typo, it is likely not going to impact how a court rules. There is an old saying that the law does not expect perfection from its practitioners, and as long as the substance of papers is solid, and the papers have only a few typos, that is what counts.

Typos are a fact of life in the legal profession, and judges and practitioners should understand that some amount of errors might be acceptable. I have read many judicial opinions that include typos themselves. Recently, I found a recitation of law in a legal opinion that had a typo in it. I looked up all of the other courts that cited this legal principle from the case I was reviewing, and each court used selective quotations to work around the obvious typo.

Even in extremely important matters that are going to get a lot of exposure, typos are hard to avoid. One time, I was on a team that was researching and drafting a brief on a significant legal matter. This was when I was working at a large firm, and as many as a dozen lawyers, and a handful of paralegals, were also working on this project. I was tasked with reviewing the last draft shortly before the midnight filing deadline, and I told my boss about the handful of typos I found so that they could be corrected before the papers were finalized and filed.

The next morning, I looked at our filed brief with fresh eyes. Sure enough, not only did the first page of the brief have a typo, it was in the first sentence! I am not sure how a dozen or so lawyers could have all missed the typo, and the rational side of me knew that even though there was a typo, this would not materially impact our chances with the court.

Of course, I am not endorsing sloppiness, and every lawyer should do all they can within reason to ensure as few typos as possible end up in their papers. However, lawyers should not kill themselves when proofreading their papers, and legal briefs, as well as court opinions, are rarely perfect.

# The Outside Counsel Rankings: The Top Law Firms According To In-House Counsel
## We unveil a new ranking based on what In-house people say about their outside help.

Every law firm wants to say that they are a “trusted adviser” for their clients, and the biggest firms like to say that they are trusted by the largest corporations for their most important (and valuable) legal work. But it pretty difficult to know which firms are actually trusted. Raw profit numbers don’t tell the full story. Deal tables represent churn more than they necessarily represent high-value, complicated legal work. And most of the “prestige” firms trade on are based on self-congratulatory surveys filled out by other Biglaw lawyers.

I don’t really care if Jones Day attorneys think Cravath is a very good firm. I care if Coca-Cola attorneys think that Cravath is a very good firm. I particularly care if Coca-Cola attorneys think Cravath is a better firm than Jones Day when they have new IP to protect.

[Above the Law exists to shine a light on the legal industry, and today we’re in a position to put a different kind of spotlight on law firm prestige](https://abovethelaw.com/?page_id=492176&preview=true&rf=1). We’ve asked in-house counsel what they thought of their outside law firms. We received responses from over 1,000 in-house attorneys, spread across more than 500 companies based in over 50 cities. We think that looking at how in-house counsel rate Biglaw firms is at least as interesting of a question as how Biglaw lawyers rates Biglaw firms.

We asked these in-house attorneys two simple questions:

1) Which law firms does your company engage for legal services?

2) Please indicate the highest level legal work for which your company will engage the particular firm(s).

We defined the “levels” as:

- Cost-efficient, bulk tasks
- Routine matters
- High-value, complex matters
- “Bet-the-company” matters
Based on these responses, we’ve put together a list of the top 50 outside counsel, according to the in-house lawyers who use them.

The questions were so blunt that our survey did not lend itself to fine distinctions. Any individual in-house counsel is only going to work with a few firms, and they’re generally going to be happy with those firms because… why the hell else would they keep using them. And we only asked them to comment on firms they actually use. Therefore, our list doesn’t try to force an ordinal ranking onto the firms. We can’t tell you which firm is “number 1.”

But we can tell you, in broad strokes, which firms received generally more important work, and which firms received… less than that. If your Biglaw firm didn’t even make the top 50… well, you might want to make sure that your clients use you for more stuff! There were enough responses about enough firms that we felt comfortable distinguishing a top-tier from a second-tier of still highly respected firms that, perhaps, have not been trusted enough to really show what they can do.

Our top-tier has many of the usual suspects: Cravath, Davis Polk, SullCrom, Wachtell, household names all. But our survey also found that the “litigation boutique” was much more highly respected than some people might think. These are good days to work at Quinn or Susman Godfrey.

Our second-tier does seem to show that size matters. Baker McKenzie, Jones Day, even DLA Piper cracked that list, proving that DLA Piper’s Olympus Mons office is doing great work for Martian corporations trying to secure water rights in Space Court.

It’s a pretty cool list. The ATL Outside Counsel Rankings are brought to you by our friends at the commercial litigation finance firm [Lake Whillans](http://lakewhillans.com/). Litigation finance has rapidly evolved from a nascent financial product into an important and thriving fixture of the legal industry. Increasingly, innovative corporate legal departments are exploring litigation financing as a useful tool to help hedge risk, control costs, and provide flexibility.

It makes sense that a smaller group of law school graduates secured a smaller number of jobs, but I was surprised to see that the private practice number was so low. You have to go back to 1996 to find a comparably small number of private practice jobs.

Most jobs are not earmarked for new law school graduates, and graduates will continue to compete with other junior lawyers for most jobs other than entry-level associate positions at large law firms, some judicial clerkships, and some government honors programs. In the law firm environment, for law firms of every size, growing efficiencies created by technology and business systems and increased competition from non-traditional legal services providers will both likely continue to put downward pressure on overall law firm lawyer headcount in the coming years and even decades.

The overall jobs profile for the Class of 2015 has improved considerably from that for the Class of 2011, the class that faced the worst overall post-recession job market. Nonetheless, in this flat jobs market there is no evidence that the entry-level legal job market will continue to improve, or at least there can be little confidence that it will return to what it was before the recession. Certainly the members of the smaller graduating classes expected over the next few years will face somewhat less competition amongst themselves for the jobs that do exist, but the ongoing changes facing the industry make it all but certain that the job market will continue to change for new law school graduates in the years ahead.

— [James Leipold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesleipold), executive director of the [National Association for Law Placement (NALP)](http://www.nalp.org/), commenting on the organization’s findings as to [employment for the Class of 2015](http://www.nalp.org/2015_selectedfindings_pr), and the job prospects for future law school graduates. NALP reports that the employment rate for new law school graduates remains flat, at 86.7 percent, with 76.8% having obtained jobs for which bar passage was required. Only 51.3 percent of the Class of 2015 was employed in private practice, the lowest percentage in about two decades.

* Tired of remaining silent, Jones Day is now defending itself against a $200 million gender bias class-action lawsuit, saying that the firm is “proud of its success in promoting a diverse group of outstanding lawyers.” [[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/04/09/jones-day-speaks-out-on-bias-claims-says-working-mothers-thrive/)]

* Meanwhile, MoFo is seeking sanctions against the attorneys at Sanford Heisler Sharp who filed the “mommy track” lawsuit against the firm, as well as against one of the anonymous plaintiffs, alleging that the claims made were “knowingly baseless.” [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/04/09/in-mommy-track-suit-morrison-foerster-seeks-sanctions-against-former-associate-and-sanford-heisler-405-34857/)]

* As it turns out, during his testimony yesterday before the House Financial Services Committee, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin acknowledged that his legal department had already been in touch with the White House Counsel’s Office over the release of President Trump’s tax returns — an exchange that’s “deeply troubling and certainly violates the spirit of the law” meant to prevent such communications.

The special fall bonuses are still making their way through Biglaw. It may be taking a little longer than the insta-matches we’ve seen in compensation before, but the COVID-19 appreciation bonuses are still gaining steam. And a Magic Circle firm just joined in.

Yesterday, Freshfields announced that they’d be giving out special appreciation bonuses to associates on October 15th. The firm noted that money will not trade off with year-end bonuses, and they expected to be competitive with the market for those end-of-the-year bonuses. They’re matching the scale set earlier by Davis Polk, meaning associates will see between $7,500 and $40,000, depending on class year, as follows:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Sources at the firm describe the mood as excited, and as one tipster said it demonstrates the firm’s commitment to the U.S. market:

I think the mood is very positive around this, given Freshfields’ continued commitment to the US and recent expansion. People are glad to see the leadership putting their money where their mouths are and being an early-adopter of this trend (especially given the number of recent laterals).

# Am Law 100 Firm To Reimburse Employees For COVID Salary Cuts By New Year's Eve
## The firm announced bonuses, too. What a way to ring in 2021.

The closer we get to the end of the cursed year that is 2020, the more Biglaw firms decide to reverse their COVID-19 austerity measures once and for all. The firm we have news on today will be wishing its employees a very happy new year by repaying all of their salary reductions in full by December 31 and paying out bonuses.

You may recall that back in April, Davis Wright Tremaine — a firm that came in 92nd place in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, with $414,144,000 in gross revenue in 2019 — announced [across-the-board salary cuts and employee furloughs](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/am-law-100-firm-furloughs-some-slashes-salaries-for-all/), effective in May. These cost-cutting measures ranged from from reduced partner distributions and slashed salaries for associates and staff to furloughs and reduced schedules for staff. In September, the firm [dialed back those cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/davis-wright-tremaine-layoffs/), restoring 50 percent of the salary reductions that were made and bringing back a number of furloughed staff (while at the same time permanently laying off others).

Now, just in time for the end of the year, Davis Wright Tremaine is committed to making the holiday season extra happy for its partners, attorneys, and staff. Here’s what the firm is planning to do by the end of 2020:

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- Repay all 2020 salary reductions: All lawyers and staff who had their pay reduced this year will receive repayment of those reductions in full by December 31.
- Award discretionary year-end bonuses: Associate/counsel and staff discretionary bonuses will be awarded to recognize exceptional contributions.
- Restore equity partner distributions: We also expect to bring equity partners to 100% of total 2020 budgeted shares with the year-end distribution.
At this time, we don’t know what the discretionary bonus scale looks like at the firm. If and when we find out, we will make an update.

But that’s not all, folks. DWT has good things in store for 2021 as well:

- Fully restoring salaries for 2021: Beginning with the first pay period in January, all salary reductions instituted in 2020 will be eliminated.
- Restoring the profit sharing program for staff: This program will be restored in January, which will also reinstate partner contributions to the plan and permit partners to make contributions to the cash balance plan.

# Focusing On ‘Empathy And Understanding,’ Sidley Eyes September Return To Office
## A fresh take on the Biglaw office reopening: kindness.

One by one, the most prestigious of Biglaw firms are coming forward to announce their plans for a return to the office. The vast majority of firms that have notified employees of their reopening plans have targeted a September return, with the summer being used as a transition period in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest firm to make its plans known is no different.

Sidley Austin — the firm ranked at No. 6 in the most recent Am Law 100, with $2,462,935,000 gross revenue in 2020 — is in the midst of a “gradual and flexible transition” to its U.S. offices. A statement from the firm details how employees will be reintroduced to the office:

Opportunities to work remotely will remain during the transition and in the future as we continue to adapt to a new work environment post-pandemic. We will listen to the needs of our clients, lawyers and professional staff and respond with empathy and understanding. It is our priority to balance their needs with the opportunity to enhance the cohesive culture that distinguishes Sidley as a great place to work.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Attorneys and staff members will be gently eased back into in-office firm life during this time, with in-person team meetings and social events to help reacquaint teams with the office environment.

By the time September arrives, Sidley will welcome back all personnel, while at the same time making sure to “preserv[e] the ability to work remotely as needed and appropriate.” It certainly sounds like the firm is attempting to be as flexible —- and caring —- as it can be with its reopening plans.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Legal Secretaries Deserve More Respect
## It is disheartening to see that the roles of legal secretaries are vanishing at many law firms across the country.
By [Jordan Rothman](https://abovethelaw.com/author/jordanrothman/)

Several weeks ago, I wrote an article about how [paralegals deserve more respect within the legal industry](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/professional-paralegals-deserve-more-respect/). The piece received a lot of positive feedback from paralegals across the country, and I also received some emails from legal secretaries about their own roles within the legal profession. Of course, legal secretaries have been impacted by technological changes within the legal industry, and this website has recounted numerous times how legal secretaries and other administrative staff are laid off in high numbers whenever a law firm faces financial issues. However, legal secretaries deserve more respect within the legal profession because they are often a vital part of any law firm.

The main reason why legal secretaries are so important to law firms is because they can help attorneys generate more revenue. Indeed, from my own experiences, reducing the number of legal secretaries at a firm can sometimes be “penny wise and dollar foolish.” As many attorneys understand from firsthand experience, legal secretaries can often free up time so that lawyers can bill additional hours on legal work. If a legal secretary can empower a lawyer to bill an extra hour of work, this may pay for more than a day of a secretary’s salary, and legal secretaries can ensure that a firm is as efficient and productive as possible.

In my own career, firms at which I worked that had more secretarial support were often far more efficient and productive than firms that had fewer legal secretaries. For instance, I once worked at a firm that had a small number of legal secretaries who rarely performed work for associates. At that firm, the other associates and I spent much of our time on the road taking depositions and appearing in court in our area and across the country. Several times a month, I had to submit all my travel receipts for reimbursement, and since I was often appearing for multiple clients (and our firm system for some reason could not automatically split expenses between multiple clients) I had to do extensive calculations and make many entries to submit expense reimbursement requests.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
I spent hours each month submitting expense reimbursement requests, and all the other associates at the firm also spent a substantial amount of time on this chore. My morale, and I suspect the morale of other people at our firm, took a hit whenever we had a large amount of expense reimbursement requests to process, since it was a painful and laborious chore to submit those requests. Our firm could have freed up our time to spend on billable matters and improved our morale by hiring additional administrative professionals who could more efficiently handle this task. Indeed, I worked at firms at which legal secretaries handled expense reimbursements, and this freed up time for my colleagues and me to be more productive at our legal tasks.

There are so many other situations beyond expense reimbursements in which I could have benefited from a legal secretary even though my firm at the time did not provide much secretarial support to associates. One time, I was tasked with scanning and uploading deposition transcripts into a firm document management system for five days straight because that firm did not provide secretarial support to associates, and I was told to get this project done. The firm likely lost thousands of dollars of billing as a result of this inefficiency, and a legal secretary could have helped me with this purely administrative project. While working as an associate at a firm without many secretaries, every time I drafted a letter, printed it out on stationery, scanned it, and emailed and mailed it to an adversary, a secretary could have helped me so I would be able to move onto other billable tasks. The amount of revenue a firm could generate with secretaries is often more than without secretaries, and additional firms need to consider this dynamic more when they evaluate their administrative needs.

Furthermore, secretaries can add to the culture and institutional knowledge of a firm in important ways. I recently received an email from the first legal secretary who helped me out when I was a “baby lawyer” at a “street law” firm years ago. This legal secretary taught me more about the actual practice of law than my law professors, since she knew how to file documents, where court appearances took place, and other particularities of practicing law in our jurisdiction. In addition, the legal secretary knew exactly which exhibits I should bring to depositions, when I had to actually appear in court for appearances, and taught me our firm’s administrative procedures. Moreover, that legal secretary had been at the firm for decades, and she had endless stories of the partners as young lawyers and kept tabs on where alums of the firm had gone with their careers. This secretary was an institution, and the firm was much better off with her presence.

Furthermore, in my experience (and granted, this could vary at different shops), legal secretaries and other administrative staff are far more likely to handle the small things that boost morale at a firm. For instance, legal secretaries and administrative staff often handled the lottery pools at many firms where I worked, and this was often a huge deal at those shops. Moreover, legal secretaries were often far more likely to celebrate birthdays, bar passage, and other occasions that made it more fun to be at work.

All told, it is disheartening to see that the roles of legal secretaries are vanishing at many law firms across the country. Of course, law firm managers understand best how to adjust their overhead to increase their bottom line, and some smaller firms may not need secretarial support. However, law firm leaders should evaluate how much more productive and efficient attorneys can be with legal secretaries, since administrative staff can help attorneys bill more hours and generate additional revenue. In addition, legal secretaries are often institutions at their firms, and many shops benefit from the knowledge and experience of legal secretaries.

# President Trump Selects DOJ Veteran Christopher Wray As F.B.I. Director
## President Trump's pick for FBI director is ""amazing"" -- and no, that's not DJT exaggeration.

President Donald Trump continues to hire top talent for legal jobs in his administration. This just in, from the White House Press Office presidential Twitter feed:

I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [June 7, 2017](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/872419018799550464)

POTUS is known for engaging in hyperbole, but it’s no exaggeration to say that Christopher Wray has “impeccable credentials.” He graduated from Yale College in 1989 and Yale Law School in 1992, before going into a clerkship with Judge J. Michael Luttig (4th Cir.) — at the time one of the most coveted clerkships around, because of Judge Luttig’s near-perfect record as a Supreme Court feeder judge. (Judge Luttig was himself a [contender for FBI director](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/who-is-being-considered-to-succeed-james-comey-as-director-of-the-fbi/).)

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Chris Wray was the rare Luttigator who didn’t clerk for SCOTUS, but it doesn’t seem to have hurt his career any. From 2003 to 2005, he served in the Bush Administration as Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, one of the most important posts in the DOJ. He was an excellent choice for that job, having previously served the Department as Associate Deputy Attorney General and as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta).

After leaving government service, Wray joined King & Spalding, one of Atlanta’s top law firms, where he’s currently a partner. At K&S, he has handled such high-profile matters as representing Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey in the Bridgegate scandal. (He and Christie bonded when they both worked for the Justice Department during the George W. Bush presidency.)

So Wray has a great résumé, featuring a healthy blend of criminal law and political experience (which is apparently what gave him an edge over the runner-up, former FBI deputy director John S. Pistole; according to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/us/politics/christopher-wray-fbi-director.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0), Wray’s superior political chops carried the day). But that’s not all. Here’s a more colorful account of Chris Wray, which I wrote back in my days at [Underneath Their Robes](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2005/01/robing_room_rep.html) (UTR):

Least Loathsome Untouchable: [Christopher A. Wray](http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/index_wray.htm)

This prize, bestowed upon the hottest member of the Great Unwashed [UTR-speak for “never a Supreme Court clerk”], goes to Chris Wray, a participant in an “interesting,” “spirited” [Federalist Society] panel discussion on the [PATRIOT Act](http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162.html). Wray has done pretty well for himself professionally, despite being the only Luttigator not among the Elect [UTR-speak for “Supreme Court clerks”]. Overcoming this disability, he has risen to the post of Assistant Attorney General for the [Department of Justice’s](http://www.usdoj.gov/) [Criminal Division](http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/) (sizable shoes previously filled by one of the Anointed, Judge [Michael Chertoff](http://air.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=3003), [recently profiled](http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2005/01/chertoff_quiz.html) in UTR).

Wray wins the prize for Least Loathsome Untouchable, however, based not on his professional achievement, nor on the fact that “all the top D.C. firms have a [[crude word omitted](http://www.freesearch.co.uk/dictionary/hard-on)] for him” (as noted in [this article](http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1100137001242)). Rather, he wins for a far more meritocratic reason: he is “incredibly good-looking”! As one UTR reader gushed, Wray is “hunk-o-licious.” He combines “the irresistible, boyish good looks of [Nick Lachey](http://www.98degrees.com/the_guys/bio_nick.html) with the handsome, rugged manliness of [Campbell Scott](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001714/).” And his “genteel Southern accent” is “simply to die for!”

Christopher A. Wray (via King & Spalding)

As you can see from his King & Spalding photo, Wray’s “boyish good looks” have evolved into Silver Fox status.

Congratulations to President Trump on a great pick, and congratulations to Chris Wray on his new job (because confirmation for someone this qualified and respected should happen in the end, even if the Democrats rake him over the coals a bit). When Wray testifies in televised Senate hearings — get your popcorn ready for James Comey tomorrow, by the way — at least he’ll be easy on the eyes.

UPDATE (10:28 a.m.): Over at [Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/president-trump-nominates-chris-wray-fbi-director), Professor [Jack Goldsmith](http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10320/Goldsmith), a former colleague of Wray’s, offers these thoughts:

I worked with Wray in the Justice Department. He was the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division when I was Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel.

Wray is smart, serious, and professional. He doesn’t have quite the range of experiences that his two predecessors did. But he has deep experience with federal criminal law and the FBI. I think Trump’s firing of James Comey was a travesty. But Wray is a good choice, a much better choice than any name* of the politicians I previously saw floated, and a much better choice than I expected Trump to make. Without prejudging what will surely be a probing confirmation process, I think Wray is qualified to be Director of the FBI.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Goldsmith is an expert on national security law and far from a Trump cheerleader, so these words carry weight. Good luck to Chris Wray in his confirmation hearings, which should make a Luttig clerkship interview look like a walk in the park.

UPDATE (10:57 a.m.): This just in, from Judge Luttig (now the general counsel of Boeing, as most ATL readers know): “Chris Wray would have had the opportunity to clerk at the Supreme Court had he wanted.”

# Biglaw Chair Explains Why His Firm Hasn't Increased Associate Salaries Yet
## It's apparently a matter of multiple memos.

I think our lawyers know, based on our history, that we not only match but pay above market—that won’t change. At the end of the year, our lawyers will make more than the going market rate.

[C]oming up with multiple announcements just doesn’t make sense from our point of view. Our lawyers know we will match and exceed market. [V]arious firms say it’s X and then Y, we’ll just wait to see where the dust will settle.

— [William Hartnett](https://www.cahill.com/professionals/william-hartnett), chairman of the executive committee at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, commenting on the slowly unfolding [2022 Biglaw and boutique salary wars](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/), and [why his firm has yet to announce an increase in associate salaries](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/02/10/when-will-the-dust-settle-on-associate-pay-as-some-law-firms-wait-others-make-quiet-moves/). “This is a little bit unusual for how long the dust is in the air as opposed to settling,” Harnett noted on the delay in firms matching the new salary scale. How long will the firm wait to make its salary announcement? “We’ll know when we get there,” he said.

I’m a little surprised that firms appear to be willing to make an investment and carry underutilized lawyers for a little while longer. It’s been relatively quiet.

— Owen Burman, managing director of the Wells Fargo Legal Specialty Group, in comments given to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/lawyer-productivity-demand-dropped-2022-wells-fargo-report-2023-01-31/) on the state of Biglaw’s workforce, which is currently in a state of overcapacity, in the wake of both a drop in demand for legal services and lawyer productivity. According to Wells Fargo’s year-end survey, the average firm saw productivity fall 6.1% to 1,568 billable hours per lawyer. “We have some history going back quite a while on this, and we’ve never seen data for the Am Law 100 being less than 1,600 hours,” Burman told the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/31/law-firms-finished-2022-strong-but-bloated-raising-stakes-for-q1-2023/). “With low utilization and excess capacity entering this year, and not a lot of real positives on demand expectations, we’d expect to see more rationalization if we don’t see more positives on the economic front at the end of the first quarter.” Thus far, just three firms have conducted outright layoffs: [Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/cooley-layoffs-2022/), [Goodwin](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/am-law-20-firm-begins-layoffs/), and [Stroock](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/stroock-layoffs/).

# When A Summer Associate Says She's Escaped A Rape, Who Do You Believe, A Drunk Law Student Or Powerful Partner?
## Here in the legal profession, it is often the case that those who opt to break their silence are disbelieved, shamed, and even shunned.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. The Silence Breakers who have spoken out against sexual harassment and sexual assault were recently named as TIME’s Person of the Year, praised for their bravery in the face of adversity. Here in the legal profession, however, it is often the case that those who opt to break their silence are disbelieved, shamed, and even shunned. Today, we have a story about a drunken encounter that almost turned into a rape. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

It was a long time ago. A summer associate — pretty, Asian, 2L from a top 10 law school — repeatedly walked past and peered into my office around 10:40 p.m. (Yes, I remember the details that clearly.) She wanted to talk. When we met in the bar downstairs at 11 p.m., she told me a few days earlier she was asked out for drinks by a powerful partner and his two feckless sidekicks. The drinks turned into shots, the shots into a sloppy dinner at an expensive restaurant, then more drinks at the partner’s apartment and an effort to undress her for group sex. One of the feckless fellows stepped in just in time to stop a rape.

The 2L was severely rattled and wanted guidance on what to do.

I’d like to say I marched her back to the office to call the head of the firm at home… but I didn’t. Instead I wondered who’d believe a drunk girl. I wondered who would doubt the word of a lawyer with a big book of business. And what would be the effect on this young girl’s career?

Attitudes have not evolved much at all since then. Absent video, what chance do any of us really have in an industry where the women higher-ups are as likely to retaliate against a victim of near sexual assault as the men?

# Almost All Law School Students Received Biglaw Offers, But Will Coronavirus Ruin Summer Associate Programs?
## Can COVID-19 do away with these historic numbers?

‘We got offers!’

For the past few years, law student recruitment for summer associate programs has been incredibly successful, harkening back to the pre-recession era. The 2019 cycle was only different than usual in that its outcomes were even better than last year’s historic trends.

According to the latest law student recruiting figures from the National Association of Law Placement (NALP), offer rates from Biglaw summer programs have reached brand new historic highs. Not only did the aggregate offer rate jump to almost 98 percent (slightly better than last year’s historic high of nearly 97 percent), but the acceptance rate for those offers was 88 percent, the same as last year’s historic high. What’s even more exciting is that this historic acceptance rate is significantly higher than acceptance rates measured before the recession, which tended to hover between about 73 to 77 percent. On the other hand, the average size of summer associate classes at the largest of law firms fell slightly from 14 to 13. Here’s what James Leipold, NALP’s executive director, had to say about the latest figures:

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
What these data suggest is that in the more than 10 years following the Great Recession, law firms steadily rebuilt their summer programs and entry-level recruiting pipeline, but that regrowth has now definitively been capped, and in some cases firms have begun to implement a gentle taper, perhaps in anticipation of some economic uncertainty ahead.

Speaking of economic uncertainty…

Last week we wondered if the coronavirus would lead to a situation where upcoming [summer programs would possibly be postponed](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/could-coronavirus-play-a-hand-in-biglaw-firms-canceling-summer-associate-programs/) or even canceled outright. Leipold says that hasn’t happened yet, in terms of rescinding offers or anything of that nature, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anxiety in the air. From [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/03/18/summer-associate-hiring-was-strong-but-covid-19-prompts-uncertainty-ahead/):

“I don’t think canceling summer programs is what’s going to happen,” he said. “But I think if firms are still stuck in remote work, they’ll be thinking, ‘OK, what does that look like for a summer associate who has never worked here? How do we train them? How do we give them virtual assignments? How do we have social bonding when we can’t come into work?’ I think those are the questions being asked right now for the incoming summer class.” …

“Nobody has really made a decision,” Leipold said of how firms will handle the incoming summer associate class and upcoming recruiting season. “Firms are grappling with that right now. I think firms will make good faith efforts to honor their commitments under the present circumstances. There’s not enough information in the marketplace yet to know how all of this will play out. But it will certainly have an impact on everything.”

Ouch. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN16T11O)] * Now that Harvard Law has decided to accept applicants' GRE scores in lieu of their LSAT scores for admissions purposes, other law schools have decided to try the alternative exam on for size.

* Dean Alex Acosta of Florida International University School of Law, a man who is better known these days as Trump’s nominee to be the Secretary of Labor, not only says the fiduciary rule requiring retirement investment advisers to put their clients’ interest first goes too far, but indicated that he may decline to defend a rule doubling the salary ceiling under which employees would be eligible for overtime pay. Ouch. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN16T11O)]

* Now that Harvard Law has decided to accept applicants’ GRE scores in lieu of their LSAT scores for admissions purposes, other law schools have decided to try the alternative exam on for size. Suffolk Law, for example, launched a study last week and offered students $100 to take the GRE. Suffolk’s dean says that “the mad dash for the GRE is not being driven by declines in applications.” Bless your heart.

# Biglaw Firm Offering Signing Bonus For 3Ls!
## The first-years will be making much more than $180K.

A year after announcing that it would [decimate its summer program](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/)[1] going forward, Quinn Emanuel announced a new plan to follow through on its strategy of recruiting 3Ls to fill its ranks of eager litigators.

The firm is offering a $35,000 signing bonus to rising 3L students who interview this fall and join the firm as first-year associates in fall 2017.

Well, that certainly sweetens the pot. Especially after Quinn Emanuel [already raised salaries to the $180K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/quinn-emanuel-announces-pay-raises-for-associates/). Since the firm is mostly hiring 3Ls and clerks — who are [earning bonuses on the $75K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/clerkship-bonus-watch-will-75k-become-the-new-standard/) — this means the majority of first-years at Quinn Emanuel will be earning much more than the $180K the rest of the first-year cohort at other firms expect to make.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)
The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The firm took the opportunity of this announcement to take another swipe at the concept of summer programs:

Choosing a law firm is a big decision for a law student; it is about a career, not a summer program. Inertia causes most students to choose a law firm after only one year as a law student, when students have little experience or information. By the time students are in their third year, they are in a much better position to make an informed decision. We believe third year students who know they want to be trial lawyers will understand what QE has to offer them.

You say “inertia,” I say, “white-knuckled risk aversion,” let’s call the whole thing off. Whatever the reason, it’s true that 3Ls are in a much better position to make an informed decision about their long-term future, but frankly we’re comparing them to rising 2Ls, so maybe we’ve set the bar pretty low. It’s hard to know much of anything about the proper shape of a career when a student is only one or two years in. While the firm is silent on how many 3Ls it hopes to hire, the fact that it’s placing so much emphasis on lawyers making an informed decision suggests the firm may be eyeing lateral hires a bit more often than 3Ls to build for the future.

## * What's it like to be the ""tweetingest judge in America""? Justice Don Willett of the Texas Supreme Court tells us what it's like to live a week in his life in this endearing column. From letting us know where he spends much of his time (the local Chick-fil-A) to revealing the reason he Tweets so much (to get reelected) to describing his love for his children, Justice Willett is a true gem of the judiciary. [[Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-week-in-the-life-of-justice-don-willett-1483641585?mod=e2tw)] * Judge Timothy Parker of the Carroll County District Court in Arkansas has resigned from his post and agreed to never serve as a judge again to avoid being charged with ethical misconduct. Judge Parker was accused of arranging for defendants' pretrial releases in exchange for sexual favors, but says he never contested the allegations on the record because he has kids and ""[didn't] want them exposed to that kind of crap."" [[AP](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/e524dac204c34586a299184634da7aee/arkansas-judge-accused-sexual-misconduct-steps-down)] * The Partnership for Civil Justice Fund has threatened to file suit against the National Park Service for ""stonewalling and refusing to release permits that are vitally needed by organizers in order to plan and execute peaceful, lawful free-speech activities"" -- that is, protests and rallies -- of Donald Trump's presidential inauguration. Only three groups out of 26 have received permits, and the inauguration is in two weeks' time. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL1N1EV1ZF?il=0)] * ""While it is encouraging to see small gains in most areas this year, the incredibly slow pace of change continues to be discouraging."" The most recent National Association for Law Placement report has revealed that as usual, women and minorities are just barely making progress at the nation's largest law firms when it comes to their representation as a whole and their presence in firm partnerships. [[DealBook / New York Times](http://nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/dealbook/law-firm-diversity-women-minorities.html)] * Per Altman Weil's latest report on law firm mergers, there were six fewer mergers in 2016 than in 2015. Although just 85 deals were announced last year compared to 91 in 2015, they were ""better"" than those announced in years prior, and in fact, some of the biggest names in Biglaw agreed to combine, including the Eversheds and Sutherland Asbill merger and the Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer merger.

* “While it is encouraging to see small gains in most areas this year, the incredibly slow pace of change continues to be discouraging.” The most recent National Association for Law Placement report has revealed that as usual, women and minorities are just barely making progress at the nation’s largest law firms when it comes to their representation as a whole and their presence in firm partnerships. [[DealBook / New York Times](http://nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/dealbook/law-firm-diversity-women-minorities.html)]

* Per Altman Weil’s latest report on law firm mergers, there were six fewer mergers in 2016 than in 2015. Although just 85 deals were announced last year compared to 91 in 2015, they were “better” than those announced in years prior, and in fact, some of the biggest names in Biglaw agreed to combine, including the Eversheds and Sutherland Asbill merger and the Arnold & Porter and Kaye Scholer merger.

# Cloud-Based Firm Thinks It Can Compete With Skadden

We’re not out here to try and be the biggest firm in the world or get the scraps of Big Law. We see ourselves as white-shoe law firm 2.0.

—Co-founding partner and CEO of alternative law firm Rimon, Michael Moradzadeh, [sounding off](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2020/01/20/cloud-based-law-firm-rimon-opens-year-with-3-international-hires-from-big-law-403-45189/) about the cloud-based firm’s ability to compete with Skadden. Rimon has made a series of international lateral hires as part of their aim to be a full-service firm for clients in finance, tech, entertainment, and the international corporate space. One lateral partner, former Gibson Dunn partner Richard Ernest said, “To me, it is clear that Rimon gives senior, experienced partners (20-plus years), who are seen by their clients as go-to practitioners, the chance to work freely, flexibly and collaboratively with like-minded souls in order to vastly improve upon the service and fee flexibility demanded by global clients.”

# Current And Future Issues In Litigation Finance
## Increased scrutiny and regulation are unlikely to stop the growth of this booming field.

Last week, I managed to escape the New York City cold and head down to sunny Delray Beach, Florida, for a litigation finance conference. Sunny weather and temperatures in the 70s, plus insights into the booming field of litigation funding — what more could one ask for?

The conference kicked off with “The 2019 State of Litigation Funding,” a keynote address by Chris Hagale of [Lake Whillans Litigation Finance](http://bit.ly/2RwCSZG) (which kindly sponsored our conference coverage). Before joining Lake Whillans, Hagale, a graduate of Yale College and the University of Chicago Law School, was a partner at Bartlit Beck, the high-powered and extremely prestigious litigation boutique. He’s yet another example of the [top-tier talent](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/a-front-row-seat-to-the-rise-of-litigation-finance-an-interview-with-marla-decker/) entering the world of litigation finance.

What drew Chris Hagale to litigation funding? As he told the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/04/24/litigation-funder-lake-whillans-hires-former-bartlit-beck-litigator-as-managing-director/), “My favorite parts of practicing law were sitting in a group and discussing cases, discussing the narratives. In litigation finance, that’s every day.”

In his conference keynote, Hagale identified the following current and future issues in the field:

1. As litigation finance continues to grow, how will funders differentiate themselves?

Awareness and use of litigation funding are expanding rapidly. A [survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/the-litigation-finance-survey-report-check-out-our-findings/) conducted by Above the Law and Lake Whillans found that some 40 percent of litigators have firsthand experience working with a funder. Expect that number to grow. A [survey](http://www.burfordcapital.com/2018-litigation-finance-survey/) from Burford Capital found that of litigators who have not yet used litigation finance, 72 percent expect to do so within the next two years. Ten years ago, in contrast, use of litigation finance was negligible, according to Hagale.

As more capital and providers flood into the space, how can funders differentiate themselves, both to claimants and to investors? Hagale identified a few possibilities. First, for appealing to claimants, there’s reliability of performance — will the funder stick around for the duration of the litigation, and perform as required under its contract? Second, for appealing to investors, innovative companies can develop new products and new users. Defense-side funding and portfolio funding, as opposed to standard single-case funding, remain relatively unexplored.

2. Will bar associations and regulators of the legal profession raise ethical issues about litigation funding?

In 2018, the New York City Bar Association issued an [opinion](https://www.nycbar.org/member-and-career-services/committees/reports-listing/reports/detail/formal-opinion-2018-5-litigation-funders-contingent-interest-in-legal-fees) concluding that portfolio funding arrangements between a funder and a law firm (as opposed to the more typical arrangements with a party or claimant) violate the prohibition against splitting legal fees with non-lawyers. The litigation funding industry pushed back strongly against the opinion — see, e.g., this [rebuttal from Bentham IMF](https://www.benthamimf.com/blog/blog-full-post/bentham-imf-blog/2018/09/11/curiouser-and-curiouser!-a-review-of-the-nycba-s-ethics-opinion-on-litigation-funding) — but it’s quite possible that other bar associations or regulators could follow suit.

As noted by Bentham IMF, the NYCBA’s ethics opinions are advisory, so last year’s opinion has no immediate implications for the industry. And, as is often the case in finance, funding arrangements can be structured in ways that achieve a substantially similar economic outcome while avoiding the problems identified in the NYCBA opinion. But this is certainly an issue worth watching.

3. Will disclosure requirements for litigation financing increase?

In terms of a specific ethical or regulatory issue where we could see activity, disclosure of funding arrangements tops the list. At the current time, there’s no overarching rule that requires disclosure in U.S. litigation, but there are some exceptions. As we’ve [previously discussed](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/the-evolving-regulatory-landscape-for-litigation-finance/) in these pages, [Wisconsin now has a law](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/wisconsin_law_requires_all_litigation_funding_arrangements_to_be_disclosed) requiring disclosure of litigation funding arrangements, and the Northern District of California [has a local rule](https://www.dandodiary.com/2017/01/articles/litigation-financing-2/district-court-adopts-first-kind-litigation-funding-disclosure-requirement/) requiring disclosure in the class-action context.

The most notable new development here is the (re)introduction, by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and other Republican senators, of the [Litigation Funding Transparency Act](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/02/13/republican-senators-reintroduce-bill-pushing-for-disclosure-of-litigation-funding/) (LFTA). If enacted, the Act would require disclosure of third-party funding for class actions, in multidistrict litigation, and in cases where plaintiffs get cash.

It’s not clear that the Act will pass. An earlier, narrower version of the bill never made it into law, and that was before the Democrats took the House. (Republicans, perhaps spurred on by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a longtime foe of funding, tend to be more pro-disclosure than Democrats.)

But even if the LFTA or similar legislation gets enacted, it’s unlikely to slow down the growth of litigation funding significantly. Disclosure of funding often helps rather than hurts the funder, by letting the defendant know that the plaintiff has financial backing and can’t be ground down through a war of attrition — and this can trigger faster settlements (which benefits funders, since they get their capital back sooner and can redeploy it).

At the end of the day, when it comes to litigation funding, [“there’s gold in them thar hills.”](https://truewestmagazine.com/whats-the-story-behind-the-phrase-theres-gold-in-them-thar-hills/) And increased disclosure requirements and regulation won’t be enough to stop the influx of capital, financial and human alike, into such a growing and profitable field.

# Clients Routinely Influence Law Firm Employment Decisions
## The legal industry should take a dim view of clients having any influence in almost all law firm employment matters.

Earlier this month, Above the Law and other media outlets reported that Elon Musk allegedly pressured a law firm handling work for Tesla [to fire an associate who interviewed Musk](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-firm-chooses-associate-over-elon-musk/) while the attorney previously worked at the SEC. The law firm apparently did not relent to this pressure, and many within the legal community applauded this decision. Although I am an Elon Musk fan myself (and am a very satisfied owner of a Tesla Model Y), I also believe that if these allegations are true, it was inappropriate for a client to pressure a law firm to fire an associate. However, this episode got me thinking about all the times in my career that I witnessed a client or a representative of a client influence employment decisions at a law firm. The legal industry should take a dim view of clients having any influence in almost all law firm employment matters whether it be firing associates, hiring attorneys, or otherwise so that employment matters can be based on merit alone.

In my experience, the main way that clients and representatives of clients try to influence law firm employment decisions is in the hiring process rather than in the firing process. Sometimes, clients will reach out to high-ranking partners at law firms if their relative or someone close to them is looking for work and see if there is a position open. In many such instances, law firms will give the job candidate preferential treatment even if their background is not up to the caliber of attorneys that usually work at a shop.

For instance, I once knew someone who was finishing up his first year of law school and needed a job for the summer. He told me that his uncle was an executive at a large company that used a particular law firm and that he asked his uncle to try his best to get him a job at that law firm for the summer. The law firm eventually offered him a summer job at the shop, even though the firm may not have offered a person with his academic credentials a job at that firm if he did not have his uncle pull strings for him.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Another time, I was working at a firm that had some people working for the shop for the summer. One of the summer employees did not seem as if he had the background needed to secure a job at that firm. I always wondered how that person got a job at the shop. One day, I saw this summer employee with the top partner at our shop and another person. I eventually found out that this other individual was the summer employee’s father, and he was apparently an executive at one of the big clients of the firm. The summer employee seemed like he did not want people to know his dad had a connection to our firm and its top brass, and this was likely a substantial reason how that person was able to score a summer role at our firm.

Sometimes, if clients cannot ensure that favored people secure jobs at a law firm, they ask that their connections get preferential treatment during the hiring process. For instance, I once worked at a law firm that was performing poorly financially and that did not seem to be actively hiring. One day, out of the blue, I was told that I would be interviewing a job candidate. The firm liked to include a few associates in the hiring process so that interviewees and firm attorneys could have a well-rounded understanding of the firm and the hiring process.

I looked at the job candidate’s resume, and this person did not seem like he had the academic or vocational credentials of other attorneys at the firm. I wondered why we would be interviewing this person, especially in light of the fact that the firm was performing poorly financially, and we did not seem to be hiring anybody at the time. I later overheard this job candidate speaking to a top partner after the interview, and it was clear from the conversation that this person’s father was an executive at one of our clients. This was likely the main reason why this person was interviewed. The strange thing was that the interview was likely just scheduled as a courtesy given that the firm did not seem to be hiring. I am not even sure that inviting a job candidate with connections to a firm’s client to interview is the right thing to do when the firm does not have any open positions and is performing poorly financially.

In any case, it is usually unfair if people are given special treatment in employment matters because a client is trying to thumb the scale for or against certain employees of the firm. Law firms should make decisions based on the qualifications of attorneys and should not judge an attorney or job candidate differently based on how a client wishes a law firm to act in a given employment matter. The widespread support of a law firm declining to fire an associate at a client’s insistence is a good thing. However, the legal community can do more to ensure that all employment decisions are more fair and free from client influence.

# Former Biglaw Partner Fails To Understand Seriousness Of His Misconduct
## Professional Responsibility committee recommends against his reinstatement to practice law.

Well, here’s a turn I sure didn’t expect [when I last wrote](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/former-biglaw-partner-suspended-from-practice-of-law-after-insider-trading-conviction/) about former Biglaw partner Robert M. Schulman.  The former intellectual property litigation partner at Hunton & Williams and Arent Fox was [convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/biglaw-partner-convicted-of-insider-trading-after-jury-trial/?rf=1) in 2017 — sentenced to three years probation, fined $50,000 and ordered to forfeit about $15,500, and required to serve 2,000 hours of community service.

See, way back in 2010, Schulman allegedly [got drunk](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/09/tipsy-partner-tipped-insider-trading-defendant-sec-alleges/) before sharing inside information about a planned M&A deal with a friend and investment adviser, Tibor Klein. He hinted that his client King Pharmaceuticals was going to merge with Pfizer, saying, “It would be nice to be King for a day.” A statement he allegedly repeated before saying it wasn’t something he could trade on himself. Klein then bought King Pharmaceuticals stock for 48 clients, including for Schulman (their agreement didn’t require Klein to get specific approval for a trade from Schulman).

Last year, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ad hoc committee on professional responsibility and Schulman entered into a[ negotiated discipline](https://www.abajournal.com/files/Schulman_June_16_report.pdf), and Schulman agreed to a three-year suspension, retroactive to June 28, 2018. At that point, I pretty much thought this story was over. But the reinstatement was conditioned on fitness, and well, apparently Schulman didn’t clear that hurdle.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A [report](https://www.dcbar.org/ServeFile/GetDisciplinaryActionFile?fileName=HCRobertMSchulman21BD021.pdf) and recommendation by an ad hoc hearing committee of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals’ Board on Professional Responsibility reflects concern that Schulman “continues to implausibly downplay the extent of his disclosure to Klein,” and his “story does not add up.”

Unspoken in that testimony is the belief reflected in the rest of the testimony, that in other senses he very much was the victim. Indeed, Schulman does not appear to have engaged in much introspection during his suspension about what led him to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. To the contrary, the tenor of his testimony was that while he technically violated the rules, he does not believe he truly did anything wrong. Even when testifying about what he says is “the lesson I think I’ve learned the most,” Schulman described his own actions as “a fleeting, passing comment made under what you consider the safest of circumstances, which I did meeting with a close colleague in a family situation.” Tr. 129-130. While he says he now understands that there can be “zero tolerance” for disclosing client information in that situation, Schulman’s testimony reveals that he still believes it should have been “safe[]” to do so. Id.

And even though there are some factors in favor of reinstatement — Schulman disgorged his profit, paid his court-ordered fine, served more than 2,000 hours of community service, finished a master’s degree, started a community garden, tutored ESL students, and kept abreast of in developments in the law — it’s not enough:

We find those factors are outweighed by Petitioner’s failure to demonstrate that he appreciates the seriousness of his misconduct or that his present character favors reinstatement. We have given the greatest weight to the factors that bear on the reasons for Petitioner’s suspension, which in this case are the circumstances that caused his misconduct to be particularly serious. Petitioner fails to acknowledge or take responsibility for those circumstances, which were largely of his own creation or within his control. In sum, we find Petitioner has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence the fitness qualifications required for readmission

# Stressed Out? 6 Tips to Help Manage Being a Lawyer
## 56% of Biglaw attorneys describe themselves as unsatisfied.

The stress in Biglaw can push someone to their absolute limit. The work demands of successful attorney have not changed much in 25 years – hours spanning from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. When you factor in your daily commute and getting ready in the morning, how much time does that leave you for yourself? If you bill 2,000 hours, you are likely working 2,500 hours.   If you are a gunner and bill 2,800 hours, you are likely single and working weekends. You also can’t forget that sleep takes up about 7 hours of your 24-hour day, as well. You probably have a measly 3.5 hours a day for personal time, if that – which is likely further siphoned by chores, errands, etc.

Biglaw has many rewarding aspects to it, but many lawyers can agree, there are also times were frustration and stress get the best of you. The evidence behind this is eye-opening to some – lawyers suffer from depression at a much higher rate than the general population, nearly 4x as likely as the general population (that number is more than likely higher for Biglaw attorneys). Additionally, the suicide rate for lawyers is among the highest in the nation – rivaling alcoholics and drug abusers.  But you are paid handsomely and are rewarded financially, even above bankers, doctors, consultants in the same peer group.

There are ways lawyers can manage the stress that comes with their profession:

Exercise. I know what you’re thinking, “who the hell has time to fit in a workout when I have to file a Motion for Summary Judgment before the clerk decides to reject it for being 12 seconds late?” We all know the struggle that is the gym life, but even sneaking away during your lunch break for a 30-minute workout can tremendously improve your mood, focus and energy for the rest of the day. The confidence and the jolt you get from just walking into the gym and doing something active will change your day drastically. Even if you can’t in the middle of the day, exercising before or after work can greatly help combat anxiety by releasing serotonin and endorphins and ultimately help you better fall asleep at night.

Sleep. You’re probably saying to yourself, “duh,” but what is the likelihood that my advice falls on deaf ears? The epidemic of eye bags among younger associates sustained on energy drinks and the promise of spontaneously growing wings seems to worsen by the year. Many attorneys try to give up some hours of sleep time to catch up with personal time in the evening. Terrible idea. Not only is this bad to your mental health, but it also slowly deteriorates your physical health and affects your productivity the next day. You basically put yourself on a downward spiral by not catching enough zzz. So, if you truly value the prospect of making partner one day, or even just springboarding to that highly coveted client, make sure you get as close to seven hours of sleep as you can. I would suggest eight, we all know that’s not happening. As the Sleep Doctor, Dr. Michael Breus says, “everything you do, you do better with a good night’s sleep.”

Cannabis (THC & CBD). Weed is a touching subject, one we don’t endorse, but at least can broach. The conversation won’t apply to everyone (given that not every state allows the use of marijuana recreationally or medically), but if you live in a weed-free state, taking advantage might prove beneficial. [Research](https://today.uic.edu/low-dose-thc-can-relieve-stress-more-does-just-the-opposite) has shown that low doses of THC can help reduce stress and anxiety and also help with sleep. Overdoing it, however, could have a counter-effect. If you are open to the idea of smoking marijuana or taking an edible, doing it in moderation has its perks. If smoking isn’t your cup of tea, cannabidiol (CBD) supplements, creams and mouth drops are available, it seems like, anywhere these days. “CBD may help to improve both depression and anxiety, at least in part through its interactions with serotonin receptors in the brain. Research shows that CBD can reduce both mental and physical symptoms of anxiety,” says Sleep Doctor, Dr. Breus.

Work Should Stay There. Do you discuss work when you are not working?   If you go on a lunch with colleagues, keep the work discussion in the office. Even if your lunch is a quick 20-minute getaway from the office, that 20 minutes is for recharging your brain and taking the pressure from the deadline filing you have to do when you get back. It is also beneficial to you and your family if you don’t bring the work back to your home. This will not only affect your mood but could take a major toll on the family. Home is for yourself and your family.

Sex. How many of you are on Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, etc. swiping away? You are better off for it. Having sex consistently is as important as anything mentioned on this list. Find time to date, socialize and have sex. Psychologist Dr. Andrew Goliszek says, “Sex is a great way to relieve stress. The benefits include release of endorphins and other hormones that elevate mood, and exercise, which itself is an effective stress reliever.”

Music. No matter what genre you prefer, music is a quick escape from the reality of the moment and can allow you to refocus on the task at hand. Many relaxing playlists have been created on Spotify and Apple Music that allow people to decompress and relax their mind.

The stress of living through litigation or closings can cause anxiety attacks, panic attacks and various other health issues. So, it is important to keep things into perspective. The people who toil at Biglaw and become partners are there because they love it.  And they also love money and financial success as do the dependents who enjoy the fruits of their labor.  To many lawyers, it’s not a chore to make their way to the office for ten hours a day. Nonetheless, 56% of Biglaw attorneys describe themselves as unsatisfied. For some, happiness exists outside of Biglaw, for others, it exists at another firm. It is not ‘Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,’ so whether you want to lateral, move in-house, or move outside of law entirely, our team of experts are more than happy to help you figure out what would make you the happiest.

# The Law Firms With The Hottest Appellate Practice (2018)

Trial work might be the form of litigation that most non-lawyers recognize, but those in the profession recognize the essential work that an appellate practice does. So in acknowledgement of the hard work of appellate lawyers, ALM puts together[ a yearly “Hot List” of the best appellate and Supreme Court practices.](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/10/26/the-2018-appellate-hot-list/)

There are a lot of big-name firms with prominent attorneys on the list. But when the top appellate litigators were asked what advice they’d give to their younger selves, they say to focus not on the academic or clever, but on the practical. Kirkland & Ellis’s Paul Clement [says](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2018/10/26/appellate-hot-list-2018-kirkland-ellis/), “Common sense beats a footnote every time.” While Munger, Tolles & Olson’s Don Verrilli [says](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2018/10/26/appellate-hot-list-2018-munger-tolles-olson/), “Focus on what’s right and true, not what’s clever and shrewd.” And Shay Dvoretzky, partner at Jones Day, [says](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2018/10/26/appellate-hot-list-2018-jones-day/) to eschew flowery language and to, “Write in plain English.”

The 22 law firms, in alphabetical order, with the best of the best appellate practices for 2018:

# The Wild West Is Alive And Well And It's The Houston Energy Law Market

While most of the headlines focus on last week’s announcement that Hunton & Williams and Andrews Kurth are going full Voltron and creating [Hunton Andrews Kurth](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/biglaw-merger-creates-new-1000-lawyer-firm/), it’s worth noting that this dramatic move fits right in with the Houston legal market these days.

Mergers, new offices, aggressive lateraling — Houston has it all. And why not if you’ve got a high demand market paying New York salaries. From the Houston Chronicle:

As oil prices rise, so are the deals, and law firms are scrambling to hire experienced energy lawyers with established clients who will follow them. This year’s chair jumping is so intense it almost takes a score card to keep up.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Oil prices are looking to be up around 60 percent from their 2016 lows. Still, they’re not even close to the $100+/barrel highs of earlier this decade. Perhaps that’s something to look forward to.

Hurray?

Sidley is a relative newcomer to Houston, opening its office here six years ago with seven partners lured from seven different firms. Today the firm, which has grown to 63 lawyers, is trying to fill holes in its energy practice so it can offer a wider range of expertise from mergers to regulatory issues to financing deals.

“It’s almost like a football team,” said energy lawyer Brian Bradshaw, who recently joined Sidley from Morgan Lewis. The organization needs a variety of skills, not only quarterbacks, running backs and receivers, but also linemen, punters and special teams players.

Helpful hint: don’t be the Sidley lawyer they consider the punter.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“Many of us were lifers at where we started our careers,” said George Vlahakos, part of a recent wave of lawyers leaving Andrews Kurth, an old Houston firm that recently said it would merge with Hunton & Williams.

That dynamic of starting at one firm after finishing law school and staying until retirement is disappearing. Firms dissolve and rivals merge, providing opportunities for other firms to pick up experienced lawyers known as “laterals,” who have “sticky” clients. “Sticky” is the industry term for clients who won’t leave their lawyers, no matter where they go.

“Disappearing”? This is sepia-tinted pablum. Biglaw has operated as a pyramid scheme for over a hundred years. Show me an aging lawyer that started at the firm as a law clerk and I’ll show you the 90 percent of that lawyer’s colleagues that lateraled, moved in-house, opened up a solo shop, went to the government, or simply fell by the wayside. Biglaw has never offered a dynamic of “starting at one firm after finishing law school and staying until retirement.” These homegrown top partners are the exceptions that prove the rule. They are a handful of a handful.

Not to say the Houston market isn’t doing a real number on those lifers. That elite population may dwindle a bit as a hot market shuffles a higher proportion of partners than before, but let’s not act like this is the near-extinction of the Buffalo or anything.

But that analogy aside, if you’re a young lawyer and agnostic about where you want to build your career, to borrow an old saying, “Go West, young people. And kind of South… unless you’re already on the West Coast, then go East.”

That didn’t work as neatly as planned. Maybe Davy Crockett has the better quote, “You may all go to hell and I will go to Texas.”

# Top Biglaw Firm Starts New Year Off On Right Foot With Merger Announcement
## What a way to kick off 2023!

Welcome to the new year, Biglaw! We’re just four days into 2023, and one of the most successful law firms in the country has announced a merger with the preeminent Nashville firm. That’s right, top 30 Am Law firm Holland & Knight has made it official with 260-lawyer firm Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis.

We originally [covered the merger talks](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/one-year-after-its-last-merger-top-biglaw-firm-looks-for-new-merger-partner/) between the two firms back in September 2022. AT the time, we noted that H&K, just one year off its merger with Thompson & Knight, had set its eyes on Waller and its incredibly successful healthcare practice. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/01/04/holland-knight-announces-merger-with-nashvilles-waller-landsen/) once again has additional details on what the Holland & Knight/Waller merger will look like:

Florida-based Holland & Knight raked in about $1.4 billion in revenue in 2021, while Waller reported revenues of $182 million the same year.

Combined revenue is not the only benefit from the deal. While Holland & Knight has offices all over the country, Waller has offices in Nashville, Austin, Birmingham and Chattanooga, giving both firms larger geographical footprints. Waller is also known for its health care practice, which is also a major industry in Florida.

In its previous reporting, Am Law noted that the firms would collectively bring in $1.58 billion and climb the Am Law 100 four spots to 26th.

“New year, new you” applies to Biglaw firms too, so congratulations to Holland & Knight and Waller! Best wishes for a prosperous combination.

Another day, another ranking for lawyers to ogle in a search for meaning as they attempt to get through the day’s billables in this “post”-pandemic world we’re living in. Despite all the unrest and change the legal profession and the world at large has experienced since 2020, this is still the life of a Biglaw attorney, always on the hunt for confirmation that their firm is the best firm, the one that’s hitting all of its essential metrics year after year. If that sounds like you (and you might as well admit it, it probably does), then you should check out the latest offering from the American Lawyer, the annual A-List ranking.

Are you unfamiliar with this ranking? Here are all of the metrics that it measures to determine which Biglaw firms are the best of the best:

The A-List score ranks firms based on their average score across five key metrics, calculated throughout the year in various other surveys by ALM. These metrics are revenue per lawyer, associate satisfaction, diversity, pro bono and the percentage of female equity partners. Revenue and diversity data are double weighted.

With that said, the full top 20 firms and their scores are listed at the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/07/27/the-2022-a-list-top-20-firms/). Without further ado, here are the top 10 to satiate your rankings cravings (with the firms’ total scores noted parenthetically):

Munger Tolles (91.2)
Ropes & Gray (91.2)
Orrick (90.3)
WilmerHale (89.4)
O’Melveny & Myers (87.8)
Paul Weiss (87.5)
Skadden (87.4)
Morgan Lewis (86.3)
Debevoise (86.1)

Congratulations to all of the firms that made this year’s Am Law A-List.

# Office Politics Make Law Firm Holiday Parties Incredibly Stressful
## Get ready to act interested in old war stories and laugh at jokes no matter how horrible they are.

For many people in the legal profession, the holidays are usually “the most horrible time of the year.”  There are many factors that make the holiday season so awful for people in the legal field, including last minute efforts to meet annual hour requirements and the need to collect bills before the end of the year.  Office holiday parties are also one of the most dreaded parts of the holiday season for many legal professionals.

I have worked at several different firms [both big and small](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/balance-side-hustles-main-job/) since graduating from law school, and each firm at which I worked had different kinds of holiday parties.  Some of the firms had holiday parties that were were more stressful than others.  From my own personal experiences, office politics is one of the main reasons why law firm holiday parties can be such awkward and stressful affairs.

As many attorneys are likely aware, office holiday parties can be a battleground for politics that are percolating around an office.  For many people who work at law firms, office holiday parties are the only times that attorneys see their bosses in a more casual setting.  And since office holiday parties are one of the few times that attorneys can rub elbows with their bosses, many attorneys try to use office holiday parties to score points with supervisors.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
From my own personal experiences, attorneys usually strive to get into conversation circles with more senior lawyers at holiday parties, so that they can get noticed and score points with their bosses.  Sometimes, the efforts of attorneys to capitalize on opportunities to speak with their supervisors in a more casual setting is pretty overt.

One time, I remember talking with a senior associate at an office holiday party, and I thought we were having a pretty good conversation.  However, when the senior associate saw a partner nearby, he stopped talking to me mid-sentence, and turned around so that he could get into a conversation circle with that partner!  The senior associate probably realized that he could not score any points by speaking with a lowly first-year attorney, and I felt pretty down that a senior associate would only speak with me until he had the chance to speak with a partner.

Many attorneys also use holiday parties as an obvious way to curry favor with their bosses.  One of the best parts of office holiday parties is to people watch, and see attorneys ingratiate themselves to their supervisors.  At holiday parties, groups of junior attorneys usually circle around more senior lawyers, acting interested in old war stories, and laughing at jokes no matter how horrible they are.  Typically when I see this, I’m usually happy that office holiday parties have a large supply of free booze!

From my experiences working at several law firms, I think the amount of office politics at a firm has a huge impact on how dreadful office holiday parties are.  When I was working at a smaller shop, there wasn’t much office politics.  The attorneys weren’t paid too much money, and since no one expected to stay at this shop for too long, [or owed much to their bosses](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/time-side-hustles/), there wasn’t much politics around the office.

As a result, the holiday parties at this smaller firm were fun events that did not have an element of politicking.  Everyone had a good time, and once the office holiday party was over, most of us headed to after-parties that went late into the night (and early morning).  Indeed, the parties at this firm were a lot like the Above the Law holiday party that occurred last week, which was a lot of fun in case you missed it!  In any case, [no one was really trying to score points at that smaller firm](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/), so we just focused on having fun while attending office holiday parties at that shop.

However, when I was working at a Biglaw firm, there was a ton of office politics.  People knew that they owed their big paychecks to their bosses, and everyone wanted to score points to have a long-term career at the firm.  Accordingly, the amount of politicking at the office holiday party was off the charts.  The office holiday party at this shop was a stressful, tiring affair, since attorneys needed to be on their “game” and work hard to score points with the partners.

Of course, I understand why many law firms have holiday parties.  Attorneys sometimes spend more time with people they work with than their own families, and it is usually a good idea to interact with coworkers outside of work.  In addition, some might view office holiday parties as a time to relax and let loose.  However, the politics involved in some office holiday parties can really add to everyone’s stress around the holiday season.

Biglaw firms across the country are continuing to slim down for summer, as yet another one conducts a reduction in force.

The firm behind the latest round of layoffs is Eckert Seamans. After conducting a “strategic review of [its] resources and evaluation of [its] business services” — Eckert — which brought in $139,650,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 187 in the most recent Am Law 200 ranking — announced earlier this week that it would be making firmwide cuts among its business professionals. In the memo announcing the reduction in force (available on the next page), the firm cited its “existing and forecasted demand” amid a “challenging economic environment” in its decision-making.

According to a firm spokesperson, no attorneys were affected by this reduction, and approximately 2% of business administrative professionals were impacted. Their last day with the firm was June 1.

It’s hard to continue holding money back from people who were expecting it originally. Also, the environment for sought-after lawyers has never been more competitive than it is now. … It’s hard to hold on to your best people if you’re paying below market.

— Kent Zimmermann, a law firm management consultant at Zeughauser Group, commenting on the recent wave of law firms that have either [rolled back their COVID-19 austerity measures](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/10/16/as-budgets-improve-more-large-firms-restore-attorney-and-staff-pay/) or [handed out bonuses to associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/), mentioning that competition could play a role in why these things have occurred.

# Stats of The Week: Not All Biglaw Firms Publicly Sad To See Legal Services For The Poor Eliminated
## Major law firms are presenting a not-quite-unified front against the proposed ditching of the Legal Services Corporation.

It’s been more than a month since the since the administration — you know the one I’m talking about — issued its budget plan, which promised to finally rid the nation of feckless burdens such as Meals on Wheels and Big Bird. Also slated for defunding: the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). The LSC was established under Nixon and today is the single largest source of funding for civil legal assistance to the nation’s poor. (For the full story, read [David Lash’s post](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/03/legal-aid-is-under-assault-but-dont-count-it-out/).)

In protest, the leaders of more than 150 law firms signed [a letter](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/image/nlj/LegalServicesLetter.pdf) sent to Office of Management and Budget. The letter read in part:

Eliminating the LSC will not only imperil the ability of civic legal aid organizations to serve American in need, it will vastly diminish the private bar’s the private bar’s capacity to help these individuals. The pro bono activity facilitated by LSC funding is exactly the kind of public-private partnership the government should encourage, not eliminate.

Moreover, LSC-funded civil legal aid is essential to individuals living in rural areas that large law firms have difficulty serving because of the lawyers’ geographic location and/or bar membership. In many counties across our nation, LSC grantees are the only available help for low-income Americans.

The irony in that second paragraph is of the “bitter” flavor. Anyway, not every Biglaw firm leader signed off. A glance at the list of signatories makes a rebuttable presumption that every major firm leader in the country was given the opportunity to add his name. (Except maybe Jones Day, because why even bother?) To have declined seems much less trivial than, say, refusing to share some “I hate cancer” meme on Facebook. Below are the dozen eleven most prominent — in one opinion — firms that made the decision not to protest the elimination of the LSC. I’m sure everyone had a great reason.

- Boies Schiller
- Cahill Gordon
- Greenberg Traurig
- Irell & Manella
- K&L Gates
- Paul Hastings
- Schulte Roth
- Wachtell
- Williams & Connolly
- White & Case
- Willkie Farr
UPDATE: one firm has contacted us to let us know that they were “mistakenly left off of an earlier letter” to OMB, so that firm has been deleted from the above list.

# Is Your Firm Recession-Resistant Enough To Thrive In An Economic Downturn?
## The good news is that if you are at a well-diversified firm, recession fears should not keep you up at night.

We’ve all heard the adage that sex sells. But when it comes to the financial press, no topic is more irresistible than speculating about the possibility of a recession. Are we on the verge of an economic downturn? I don’t know, and frankly, neither does anyone else. But given all the recession talk, now is a good time for lawyers to consider their strategy in the event we do experience a downturn.

There are two key messages to keep in mind. First, the good news is that if you are at a well-diversified firm, recession fears should not keep you up at night. Most major Am Law 200 firms are recession-resistant thanks to their diversity of practice areas.

Second, hiring remains strong by any normal standard: there were around 300 more lateral placements in Q2 2022 among Am Law 200 firms than there were in Q2 2021. And as you might remember, spring of 2021 was not exactly a slow market!

Law firm hiring is like squeezing a balloon. Last year, we saw an overwhelming appetite for capital markets and M&A laterals to fill the never-ending demand for attorneys to service deal flow. Today, we are seeing a large uptick in the demand for litigation laterals. That’s exactly what we would expect given the historical pattern of recessionary times fueling more litigation and insolvency work from deals gone bad and inevitable breakups.

In Q2 2021, 30% of lateral placements in the Am Law 200 were in corporate practices, and 27% were in litigation. By contrast, in Q2 2022, only 24% were corporate and 30% were litigation. Bankruptcy hiring was a small proportion of the total in both quarters, but it is clearly picking up. There were 67 bankruptcy lateral placements in Q2 2022, as compared to 46 in Q2 2021.

Is now a good time to lateral?

If you aren’t happy at your firm, don’t let concern about the economy dissuade you from making a lateral move. If you’re in a situation where you don’t feel supported, it would be a mistake to resign yourself to being miserable just because people are talking about recession. The truth is that demand for lateral candidates is persisting across a broad range of practice areas, so you likely have options.

However, if you are at a firm overly dependent on corporate M&A and capital markets work, perhaps you should look at some alternatives that are better positioned to weather the storm, if not come out of it even stronger.  The benefit of being at a well-diversified law firm is roughly analogous to the benefit of being in a long-short fund as an investor. The long-short structure gives you upside while protecting the downside through diversification of puts, shorts, and long positions. Similarly, a strong bankruptcy practice may not “pull its weight” in the good times, but it is extremely useful when the economy sours.

Although you shouldn’t hesitate to accept a good lateral offer, you may want to think twice about pivoting to a new practice area unless you are certain retooling meets your long-term career goals. With an uncertain economic outlook, it’s especially important that you make an immediate impact at your new firm — now is not the best time for a long ramp-up period.

If we reach the point of layoffs — which, again, are not happening yet in any widespread way — firms will primarily consider the revenue impact of each practice group and lawyer. An advantage of the billable hour model is that individual contributions are more easily measured than in a typical corporation. So instead of taking a blunt “last in, first out” approach, firms can be more targeted. The way to protect yourself isn’t necessarily to cling to your current job, but rather to put yourself in a situation where your skills will be well utilized.

What about a move in-house?

It’s more difficult to generalize across in-house roles because some sectors are likely to be more resilient in recession than others. But broadly speaking, you should be wary about moving in-house with a downturn potentially on the horizon. When a company is forced to cut costs, the most recent hires are often the first to go. You could then find yourself looking for a job in a relatively weak market.

If you are considering an in-house transition, it’s important to understand that switching back to a firm likely won’t be easy. Firms value law firm experience more than in-house experience, so returning to law firm work can be a challenge even in a good economy. Now imagine trying to make that switch while unemployed, in a soft economy, when your skill set has stagnated.

That’s not to say that going in-house is definitely a mistake. Individual circumstances vary. But make sure you are clear-eyed about the risks and your potential backup plan.

Strengthening your position at your current firm

What if you’re reasonably happy at your current firm and just want to guard against a layoff?  The first thing to realize is that this is not 2009, where we had a complete collapse of the financial markets and widespread law firm layoffs. Instead, we expect that the uptick in litigation and insolvency work will largely offset any slowdown in corporate.

So the better question is how do you protect yourself and stay relevant if you are a corporate attorney? There are a few things you can do to strengthen your standing ahead of a potential downturn.

First, do you have strong relationships with partners? If not, make it a priority to develop some. You should be doing this regardless of the economy, as it will both improve your experience at your firm and position you to be recommended for future external opportunities. But obviously, these relationships can be especially valuable in the event a practice group head is instructed to cut headcount.

One way to build stronger relationships is simply to make yourself more visible. Spending less time in the office over the past two years may have made it easier to hide, whether intentionally or not. If you haven’t been making an effort to connect with partners, either in person or virtually, now is the time to start. Make sure they know who you are and that you’re eager to be helpful.

As mentioned above, your recent record of billable hours will be an important factor in case of layoffs, so an obvious way to strengthen your position is to make sure you’re meeting billable expectations. For most Biglaw associates, that hasn’t been a problem recently, but if the economy slows, billable hours will be less plentiful in some practices. In that scenario, you will want to be flexible about accepting work outside of your primary practice area. You may not enjoy bankruptcy work as much as M&A, but if the alternative is falling short on your hours, the choice should be clear.

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to catch up with Rhonda Mims, and she was gracious enough to share insights from her career as well as provide advice for ATL’s law school audience. Here are some key excerpts from our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): What does being a lawyer mean to you?

Rhonda Mims (RM): I like the flexibility a law degree provides. A legal training prepares you to tackle a host of situations. Being a lawyer also allows you to be able to drive systemic change.

RC: What attracted you to the legal profession, and how did you choose University of South Carolina School of law?

RM: Interestingly enough, I was attracted to the legal profession by my undergraduate major of Criminal Justice. I am from South Carolina originally and thought I would work in the state the majority of my life. At the time, there was only one law school in the state, the University of South Carolina “USC”. I attended USC for undergraduate and worked as a University Presidential Intern. We essentially served as University Ambassadors. I loved the school and that role. Many of the interns at the time went on to law school. It seemed like a natural progression for us.

RC: I noticed that in addition to being named the chair of the Executive Leadership Council (ELC), you currently serve as the managing director for corporate social responsibility at Paul Hastings. Prior to these roles, you served as President of the ING U.S. Foundation, as an environmental civil litigation attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice, and as a senior attorney with the National District Attorney Association’s American Prosecutor’s Research Institute. I would love to hear more about your career and learning experiences along the way.

RM:  My career has certainly taken an interesting path. I started out as a prosecutor in Charleston, South Carolina, and quickly found my way heading up the prosecution division of the S.C. Attorney General’s Office. I believe I was 27 years old at the time and was given a great deal of responsibility by the then Attorney General. I loved managing staff and other prosecutors, but I also liked developing alternative community programs… Hence, my interest in foundation and community work.

After leaving the Department of Justice, I struggled with whether to leave the practice of law to enter corporate America. I accepted a position with ING, the global financial services company, and was provided with incredible opportunities as a litigator, external affairs counsel, diversity advocate, manager in sales in marketing, and Foundation leader. There I found wonderful mentors and sponsors, who guided my career along the way. One of my greatest champions was a fellow lawyer, Kathy Murphy, who now serves as President of Fidelity Investments. She showed me that a lawyer could add incredible business value to the company.

RC: What advice do you have for those candidates who are about to embark on the law school journey and/or for those students who are about to graduate law school?

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
RM: My biggest piece of advice is to take things slowly and try not to stress over small matters. I went directly from undergraduate to law school. I wish perhaps that I would have gained a few years of work experience under my belt before embarking on law school. Then most likely I wouldn’t have taken things so seriously.

RC: Outside of the legal universe, what are you passionate about?

RM: I love spending time with my 10-year-old daughter. I enjoy international travel and spending time with close friends. My favorite thing to do is to enjoy an incredible dinner with friends.

RC: If you didn’t become a lawyer, what profession/occupation do you think you would have pursued?

RM: I would probably pursue something in the design space. I love interior design. Fashion merchandising has also always been an interest of mine.

RC: How can young lawyers and millennials help shape our profession and society in general?

RM: We are at an incredible stage and can perhaps truly change the face of the profession. I think young lawyers have an opportunity to demonstrate that it is okay to be yourself at work. It’s time the legal profession allowed individuals to bring their entire self to the profession. We have all heard the saying “diversity drives innovation.” People from various backgrounds and experiences bring different perspectives to the table. We must allow diversity in order for the profession to evolve and for us to be able to provide the most innovative solutions for our clients.

RC: What does diversity mean to you?

RM: Everyone is diverse. Traditionally, when we speak of diversity we refer to ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc. However, diversity for me means an inclusive society where everyone is welcomed and included in societal conversations.

RC: It was great chatting with you — is there anything else you would like to share with our audience?

RM: I absolutely love my role as a corporate social responsibility executive. It allows me to utilize my legal training while having a real impact globally.

RC: On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Rhonda Mims for sharing her experience and wisdom with our audience and wish her continued success in her career.

Just because it is Friday afternoon and the week is almost over, doesn’t mean that Biglaw cost-cutting measures have taken a break. Austerity, particularly in the time of COVID-19, waits for no one.

Akerman LLP, ranked 88th in the nation on the[ 2020 Am Law 100 ranking](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/04/21/the-2020-am-law-100-ranked-by-gross-revenue/#), is not immune to the COVID-19 austerity measures. The Chair and CEO of the firm, Scott A. Meyers, delivered a video message to employees last night, and tipsters say the message was focused on salary cuts.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

So what are the salary cuts? According to multiple tipsters, they’re tiered by position with equity partners seeing a 35 percent cut to their draws; nonequity partners, of counsel, and consultants making over $150,000 will have a 25 percent salary cut; consultants making less than $150,000 are getting a 15 percent pay cut; associates are also seeing a 15 percent pay cut, as are staff making $150,000+; and staff making less than $150,000 are seeing a 10 percent cut.

Though salary cuts are becoming increasingly common in Biglaw, that doesn’t mean folks aren’t pissed about it. Especially when it’s a top 100 firm[ known](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/days-go-by-and-associates-keep-getting-angrier/) for paying associate below [top of the market](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/):

Scott A. Meyers, Chairman and CEO at Akerman LLP just send a video message to all Employees from announcing salary cuts. Employees are devastated; Akerman salaries were already less than what firms of that level are paying.

Additionally, multiple sources note that Meyers’s message about the austerity measures included a reference to “adjustments to right size our workforce,” which tipsters rightly characterize as “layoffs in other words.” But exactly who or how many or even which positions were impacted by the layoffs was left unsaid.

UPDATE:  Sources at Akerman have reached out to Above the Law with reports of the scale of the layoffs:

I want to add that Akerman laid off over 3 dozen attorneys, including partners and associates (does not seem tied to any particular office).  We don’t know the number of staff laid off.

We reached out to the firm for comment, but have yet to hear back.

# Musical Chairs: Cadwalader Antitrust Stars Decamp For Paul, Weiss
## What does this move say about the futures of the two firms?

There’s no shortage of opinions about the antitrust group at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. Some people think it’s one of Biglaw’s [most underrated antitrust practices](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/10/biglaws-most-underrated-firms-by-practice-area/), while other people think it’s one of the [most overrated](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/10/biglaws-most-overrated-firms-by-practice-area/).

Regardless of what opinion you hold of CWT’s antitrust group, that opinion will need to change. The practice’s rainmaking leader and three fellow partners are taking their talents to Paul, Weiss. Here’s a report from Casey Sullivan of [Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/top-d-c-antitrust-lawyers-to-leave-cadwalader-source/):

Four antitrust partners in Washington, D.C. whose clients include Microsoft and Cigna, are leaving Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft to join Paul, Weiss Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.

Leading the group is Charles “Rick” Rule, the head of Cadwalader’s antitrust group, chair of the firm’s litigation department and managing partner of its Washington, D.C. office, according to a [Paul Weiss announcement](https://www.paulweiss.com/practices/litigation/antitrust/publications/paul-weiss-adds-four-prominent-antitrust-lawyers.aspx?id=22317) on Thursday.

The three others: Jonathan Kanter, Joseph Bial and Andrew Forman, all of whom practice in D.C.

Rule will become co-chair of Paul Weiss’s antitrust group, the firm said.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Rule previously served as Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division (and was the youngest person to lead the Antitrust Division at the time of his appointment 30 years ago). His clients include Microsoft, which he’s advising on the $26.2 billion LinkedIn acquisition, and Cigna, which he’s advising on its $48 billion merger with Anthem.

One can see why Rick Rule and his colleagues would be in high demand, given recent government zeal in antitrust enforcement. As PW chair Brad Karp told the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/business/dealbook/paul-weiss-hires-4-partners-to-bolster-antitrust-practice.html?_r=0):

Given the intense regulatory scrutiny of strategic M.&A. transactions and the heightened focus on antitrust enforcement, trends highly likely to continue, we are thrilled to be able to add a marquee merger-clearance team and elite antitrust litigators, led by Rick Rule. This opportunity takes full advantage of our market-leading litigation and public M.&A. practices.

So it seems that Paul, Weiss remains on a lateral hiring spree; recall its headline-making hires of [M&A star Scott Barshay](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/a-deeper-dive-into-scott-barshays-move-from-cravath-to-paul-weiss/), from Cravath, and [leading litigator David Bernick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/musical-chairs-leading-litigator-david-bernick-leaves-dechert-to-join-paul-weiss/), from Dechert. Brad Karp [said in June](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-peek-inside-paul-weiss-10-secrets-to-biglaw-success/) that PW might be taking a bit of a breather from lateral hiring, but it seems that day has yet to come. And given its recent success on that front, backed by strong financials (profits per partner over $4 million, [#3 in the Am Law 100](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-2016-am-law-100-trouble-ahead/2/)), one can see why it would want to maintain momentum.

What do the defections mean for Cadwalader? Some thoughts from Julie Triedman of [Law.com](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2016/08/04/paul-weiss-hires-cadwalader-rainmaker-rick-rule/?kw=Paul%20Weiss%20Hires%20Cadwalader%20Rainmaker%20Rick%20Rule&cn=20160805&pt=Am%20Law%20Daily&src=EMC-Email&et=editorial&bu=The%20American%20Lawyer):

Washington, D.C.-based Rule, a longtime member of Cadwalader’s seven-member management committee, was named the firm’s litigation chair just last month. For nearly the past two years, the firm had been struggling with poor financial performance and an exodus of litigation talent, but its leaders recently said it had turned a corner.

In large part, said one partner, that was due to Rule. His recent work defending Cigna Corp. in an antitrust showdown with the U.S. Department of Justice over its proposed tie-up with Anthem Inc. “was the reason that Cadwalader was profitable as of April 1 this year,” said one Cadwalader partner, asking not to be identified. The DOJ sued to block the deal on July 22, suggesting that work may only intensify.

Last year, Rule was the highest paid partner at Cadwalader, earning $3.5 million, the partner said. Rule, who left a position at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson as chair of the antitrust practice for Cadwalader in 2007, was the main reason that Cadwalader opened a Brussels outpost in 2011.

It’s interesting that Rule topped the CWT partner pay scale with comp of “only” $3.5 million. Per Am Law, the firm has profits per partner of just over $2 million, so it seems to have a fairly low [partner pay spread](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/07/the-haves-and-the-have-mores-partner-pay-spreads-at-leading-law-firms/).

As alluded to by Am Law, Cadwalader has experienced some financial challenges and lateral losses lately (such as the litigators who [left for Greenberg Traurig](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/4-leading-litigators-leave-cadwalader-for-greenberg-traurig/) in the spring, amid reports of [litigation slowness at CWT](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/catching-up-with-cadwalader-partner-profits-associate-bonuses-lawyer-departures-and-more/)). It has also had some [leadership shake-ups](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/musical-chairs-a-major-move-out-of-cadwalader/) in the past two years.

In a firm-wide email about the antitrust partner departures (posted in full on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/musical-chairs-cadwalader-antitrust-stars-decamp-for-paul-weiss/2/)), managing partner [Pat Quinn](http://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/pat-quinn) had this to say:

Quinn’s focus on “our Firm, and our opportunities” — emphasis in the original — struck some of our sources as a little defensive. As one tipster told us, “While I actually really like working here, it’s worrisome to get an email that says, ‘We’re great! Don’t worry!'”

Will that greatness continue, as Cadwalader moves deeper into its third century of existence? We’ll keep an eye on goings-on at CWT. If you have any info to share, feel free to reach out [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Cadwalader) or by text message (646-820-8466). Thanks.

# Some Cautious Optimism About Biglaw -- And A Prediction On 2020 Biglaw Bonuses
## Bonuses will be down this year -- but in these trying times, that's no cause for complaint.

(Photo by David Lat)

Over my years as a commentator on the legal profession, I have made many predictions. And many of my predictions have turned out to be wrong.

But sometimes I am happy to be wrong. And this is one of those times.

Back in April, when law firms were truly reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and economic downturn, I [predicted](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-state-of-biglaw-3-thoughts-from-david-lat/) that we were only at the beginning of the bad times. I predicted that the list of [law firms enacting COVID-19 austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/the-covid-crisis-law-firm-layoff-tracker-whats-your-firm-doing-to-survive/?rf=1) would continue to grow for quite some time.

And for a while, I was correct. In April and May, more firms continued to [tighten their belts](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/07/31/pay-cuts-layoffs-and-more-how-law-firms-are-managing-the-pandemic/), engaging in salary cuts, layoffs, furloughs, and other money-saving steps.

But then we got a pleasant summer surprise. Finding that things weren’t as dire as they expected, firms started to reverse some of their salary cuts and other cost-cutting measures, at least in part. As reported yesterday by Christine Simmons and Dan Packel at [Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/08/20/more-firms-are-partially-restoring-pay-but-full-salaries-may-wait-until-2021/), about a dozen Am Law 100 firms have reversed, at least partially, their compensation cuts for lawyers and staff. Just this week, three firms joined that happy club. (You can track developments by following ATL’s coverage of [salary cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/salary-cuts/), which includes their reversal.)

Of course, we aren’t out of the woods just yet. I have written before about the significant [perils posed by the pandemic](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/the-covid-19-crisis-and-the-perils-it-poses/) to the world of Biglaw. If the economy gets worse, if the (seemingly unstoppable) stock market takes a tumble, or if we get the second spike in COVID-19 cases that many fear, we could see a reversal of the reversals — or worse.

But right now — based not just on the publicly reported news, but also on the many conversations I have each week as a legal recruiter with partners and associates around the country, in many different practice areas — I’m cautiously optimistic. In the past few weeks, I’ve spoken to a partner whose firm is down in revenue year to date by just low single digits, another partner whose firm isn’t down at all (flat is the new up), and an associate who has hit two of his record months for billables during the pandemic.

Lawyers remain busy — and not just bankruptcy lawyers. Even with many courts closed, in whole or in part, litigators have been doing their thing — and elite litigation boutiques are even busy enough [to be in hiring mode](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/new-opportunities-for-new-york-litigators/).

Transactional lawyers are doing fine too. M&A is a bit slow — the pandemic and downturn complicate many parts of the process, including coming up with valuations and [doing due diligence](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/how-to-go-in-house-and-how-to-excel-once-youre-there-an-interview-with-david-stiepleman/) — but other practice areas, including finance and fund formation, are busier than you might think.

Just because times aren’t as terrible as some expected, however, doesn’t mean that they’re good. So associates who are hoping to see bonuses on last year’s [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/cravath-announces-bonuses-now-the-2019-bonus-season-can-really-begin/) (or should we say [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/)) scale are probably going to be disappointed.

The current bonus scale, starting at $15,000 for first-years and going up to $100,000 for seventh-years, has been with us for six years (during which associates also saw two increases in base salaries, the Cravath-led [move to the $180K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) in June 2016, and the Milbank-led [move to the $190K scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) in June 2018). The current bonus scale dates back to 2014, a very exciting bonus cycle in which Simpson Thacher (not Cravath) [led the way](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/), then got beaten [by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/associate-bonus-watch-davis-polk-beats-simpson/) — and the Davis scale then got adopted by pretty much everyone else, including Simpson.

What about this year? As discussed, some firms — including many of the firms at the top of the profitability charts, who tend to set the pay scales — are doing just fine. They could definitely afford to pay the same bonuses as last year. And keeping bonuses at the same level could yield some advantages for them, such as putting the screws to the less profitable firms — and causing the star associates at those firms to seek more prestige and pay by “trading up” (a trend we saw in lateral associate hiring for the past few years, until this year).

But I don’t think we’re going to see that — not because of firm finances, but because of optics. In dark times for the country — COVID-19 deaths closing in on 200,000, millions of Americans out of work, companies filing for bankruptcy left and right — it might strike some as unseemly for Biglaw to take a “business as usual” approach.

General counsels who are seeing their companies suffer — well, at least if their companies aren’t named [Apple](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/technology/apple-2-trillion.html) or [Amazon](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348368/amazon-q2-2020-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-jeff-bezos) — probably won’t take kindly to seeing associates at their outside law firms taking home the same amount of money as last year. In fact, keeping bonuses the same would mean that many associates at firms that didn’t cut salaries would actually fare better financially in 2020, since many of their expenses — dining out, entertainment, commuting costs, gym memberships — have disappeared or dipped dramatically during the pandemic.

How much lower will bonuses go? It’s anyone’s guess, but if I had to guess — which I suppose I do, since it’s kinda my job — I’d say that 2020 bonuses will clock in at [2013 levels](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/12/breaking-cravath-announces-year-end-bonuses-let-the-2013-bonus-season-begin/). In that scale, first-years got $10,000 and seventh-years got $50,000, meaning that bonuses were half to two-thirds of the 2014-2019 scale. It’s a significant cut, but not a cataclysmic one — and in these trying times, it’s no cause for complaint.

Of course, a consequence of lowering bonuses for associates by that much could mean that at some firms, we could see partners take less of a financial hit than their associates, thanks to lower compensation costs — the biggest expense of a law firm. And at some firms, especially ones with strong bankruptcy and restructuring practices, we might even see profits per partner increase. But we won’t find out about that until, well, the Am Law 100 numbers come out in spring 2021 — by which point things might be better (or at least improving), meaning that clients might not be as upset.

But spring 2021 is still a long time away, and a lot can happen between now and then. The year 2020 has been full of surprises, many of them quite awful — and it is far from over.

In addition to reversing their cost-cutting measures, some firms have picked up their hiring, at least in select practice areas. Here at Lateral Link, we are quite busy (and even [in hiring mode ourselves](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/introducing-stephen-damato/)).

Right now, despite a generally slow market, I have multiple associate and partner candidates interviewing at top Biglaw firms and elite boutiques. If you’re a candidate who might benefit from working with a recruiter — and the best way to tell is if you’re already getting emails and calls from other recruiters — please feel free to reach me by email at [dlat@laterallink.com](mailto:dlat@laterallink.com). I have extensive knowledge of (and deep connections within) Biglaw, from having worked in and written about this world for some two decades, and I’d be happy to have a confidential conversation with you about your career, the state of the market, and possible new opportunities.

# Biglaw Firm Matches Market -- But Only For Junior Associates
## Another black box for more senior associates? Sigh.

Another day, another firm that’s moving to the $205,000 starting salary scale that was set by new market compensation leader Davis Polk last month. Before associates get too excited, we must caution you that like several other firms that have made this move, this is not a match of the full salary scale. Let’s get into the details.

Schiff Hardin — a firm that brought in $173,956,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at No. 163 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — made its salary announcement this past Friday. As of September 1, the firm will be moving to a $205K scale for the classes of 2020 and 2021 only. For third-years and up, Schiff Hardin will switch to a lockstep system “based on achieving certain performance thresholds.” The firm is also working on changes to income partner and counsel compensation. Associates seemed pleased about the news, but called the memo “cryptic,” saying, “It may be a two-year lockstep and then black box? No idea.”

Joseph J. Krasovec, Schiff Hardin’s managing partner, said the firm was changing its compensation scheme for the following reasons: “We recognize the value our many talented associates bring to our clients and the firm and we are committed to recruiting the best and brightest lawyers to Schiff Hardin.”

Come September, please help us open this black box. Until then, congratulations.

For almost two decades, [Kinney Recruiting](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/) has been a top international legal recruitment agency and home to some of the most professional legal recruiters in the world. With vast market experience and our trademark “no BS” approach, Kinney’s recruiters are favorites among candidates and clients in the legal industry. We are keen to share some of what we have learned with more people, so we have launched [Ask a Legal Recruiter](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ask-a-legal-recruiter/), an opportunity for our recruiters to answer your questions. Do you want to know more about how legal recruiting works or what lateraling looks like? How about our take on the market? If you have a question, email askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com and we will get back to you with our take!

Question: I took a class cut at my current firm and am looking to lateral. Is the cut something I should disclose during interviews if I am not specifically asked?

[Katherine Loanzon](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/katherine-loanzon/): If you don’t want to continue your career with the cut in class year, then this is not something you would offer up if not asked during the interview, ESPECIALLY if you feel you deserve to be given your true class year at the new firm. If you feel like your responsibilities are comparable to your true class year, then a new firm will give you the opportunity to get paid what you deserve relevant to your experience. Partners can determine your class year relative to similarly situated associates at the firm you are interviewing with and will do their best to properly place you in the right class year.

Question: What should I do when a recruiter I’d sent my resume to ghosts me? As a third year, I’m getting a good amount of contact from other legal recruiters. Can I just move on and start working with a new recruiter?

[Joshua Shirley](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/joshua-shirley/): This won’t happen with any recruiters at Kinney! If this has happened to you with another agency my advice is to send them an email asking that your resume materials not be shared with anyone or any other firm moving forward. Make sure you keep that email. Get a list of places your materials have been sent (hopefully you’ve already been keeping track of this) and reach out to someone at Kinney ASAP.

Question: How would I go about letting a firm know that I need some time before responding to an offer (when in actuality I want to wait to see if the other company has an offer as well)?

[Jessica Chin Somers](https://www.kinneyrecruiting.com/recruiters/jessica-chin-somers/): This is a tricky situation and one that we deal with all the time. The truth is that a candidate who is ready to accept an offer will do so within a few days of when an offer is made (provided that the offer is in line with expectations). When a candidate asks for more time, the firm already knows the candidate is either waiting on another offer or overcoming some sort of personal roadblock (i.e., spouse does not want to relocate). The best thing to do is be honest with us and let us do the messaging. Remember, the prize for getting more time and accepting an offer at the last minute is… working with the folks who made you the offer! So the more honest you can be, the more understanding they will be and the better likelihood of a good working relationship going forward.

Have a question of your own? Email askarecruiter@kinneyrecruiting.com and we will get back to you with our take!

# Beyond Biglaw: Testing For Practical Intelligence
## New research could provide law firms with a useful tool for identifying problem lawyers.

By now, the newest crop of associates has begun to settle into their jobs at firms nationwide. There is no doubt that the transition from law school to actual legal practice is a difficult one, and the difficulty is compounded for many new associates by the fact that many law firms are a lot better at picking talent than they are at integrating it into the firm.

For their part, firms are always wary about new associate hires, particularly recent graduates, because of the (perhaps overblown) concern that these new lawyers are the firm’s weakest link the minute they cross the building lobby for their first day of work. The perception, which is actually a misplaced one in many cases, is that the chances of a catastrophic mistake are highest with new associates. But smart firms also make sure that new associates are never put into a position to make a catastrophic mistake in the first place.

In fact, there is a good argument that the risk of a catastrophic mistake by a lawyer increases based on a commensurate increase in that lawyer’s experience and level of responsibility for client or firm administrative matters. At the same time, firms are rightly concerned about quickly identifying problem associates, so that their shortcomings can be addressed before they embarrass the firm in some way. Identifying associates who innately know what not to do is a good start on that front, and testing to measure that aptitude is therefore valuable for firms.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Of course, the idea of identifying problem hires early is not limited to the legal industry. I recently saw some [interesting research](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hiring-tip-find-the-person-who-knows-what-not-to-do-1475249980) that could provide both firms and associates (or new/lateral partners for that matter) a tool for early identification of potential problems. In fact, the research results themselves suggest that utilizing this tool upon intake of new lawyers (or other employees) at the firm will result in maximum effectiveness. But even experienced personnel can benefit as well from periodic testing of their disaster-avoidance capabilities.

The key intellectual framework behind the research I saw was constructed on two basic principles. First, that good employees can come in a variety of flavors, making it difficult to isolate precise characteristics that are absolutely essential for success in a firm environment. Second, that the most dangerous thing for a business, particularly one in a service industry, is employees who demonstrate bad judgment. Worse still is the risk that a single employee’s bad judgment could cause irreparable harm to a firm’s reputation or client relationships.

With these principles in mind, the researchers sought to identify the riskiest employees — but not by their possession or lack of certain skills or characteristics. Instead, the researchers decided to test the ability of any given employee to select the worst solution to any given problem. Employees who correctly identified the worst options were more likely to succeed, and testing for this ability is potentially superior to testing for the ability to choose the best answer to any given problem. In this way, employees who performed poorly could be flagged as potentially faulty in their ability to demonstrate good judgment, and remedial actions could be taken.

The researchers dubbed the test as a way to measure “practical intelligence,” though we can easily see that this test is just a way of isolating the disaster-prone in any given group. For example, any lawyer who consistently, or even just once, picks the absolute worst approach to dealing with an issue is a lawyer with impaired judgment. Considering that most of a lawyer’s value to clients and firms is their ability to demonstrate good judgment, a poor result on this test would suggest that any lawyer who earns such a result would be fighting an uphill battle in terms of career success and longevity. Worse, any lawyer who performs poorly on such a test could rightly be considered “dangerous,” even if their performance record was absolutely clean up to that point. It may seem a little counterintuitive to reduce an associate’s prospects to their disaster-avoidance ability, but it is an essential initial hurdle that any lawyer needs to successfully clear.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Because the ability to demonstrate good judgment is so fundamental, firms should consider some variant of this testing for any new lawyers who join the firm. In particular, recent law school graduates would perhaps benefit the most, since there is still time to train them to demonstrate better judgment, free from any bad habits or ego accumulated over years of prior practice.

Ultimately, the earlier and more often a lawyer’s judgment is tested, the better — especially in this age of open communication and alternative media, where mistakes are both magnified and made public seemingly instantaneously, compounding their reputation-damaging effects. Many firms like to set minimum thresholds in terms of their hires, whether based on law school performance, test scores, or other metrics. Testing for practical intelligence is likely just as important, especially for firms that want to have the ability to bail on any misplaced investments in bad hires at the earliest opportunity. One of the building blocks of success, after all, is the ability to avoid perpetuating mistakes.

# Lawyers Should Often Be More Gracious In Defeat
## It's the right thing to do and it can achieve the best results for clients.

One of the basic facts of the legal profession is that in litigation, there are often winners and losers. Of course, parties usually try to reach a resolution that results in each party getting something that they want from the other. However, when push comes to shove, and matters are submitted to a court or a fact finder, one party is usually happy with the result while the other party is not. When lawyers lose (and even the best attorneys will lose), attorneys should act graciously in defeat since it is the right thing to do and because this can achieve the best results for clients.

I remember the first time I lost a motion, in 2014. I was absolutely certain that I deserved to win, and I thought that both the law and the facts were on my side. However, the judge sided with my adversary, and I took it far more harshly than I should have, especially since it was a nonimportant discovery motion. I did not even want to acknowledge my adversary after oral arguments for the motion, and I was far more focused on how I would win the war of litigation even though my adversary had won the battle. I eventually did win that lawsuit on summary judgment, but I was not too happy with how I handled my first defeat.

Later in my career, I made sure to be more gracious in defeat and to acknowledge the solid work of my adversaries. More recently, I argued summary judgment motions in a lawsuit that I had been litigating for a few years. Both my adversary and I filed summary judgment motions, and the oral arguments for the summary judgment motions were heated. In the end, the court denied my adversary’s summary judgment motion and denied my summary judgment motion except that the court decided to dismiss my adversary’s counterclaims.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Even though I had gotten more from the summary judgment motions than my adversary, I gave my adversary a call after the summary judgment arguments to congratulate him on not letting me win summary judgment on my claims against his client. The adversary seemed shocked that I would call him to congratulate him like this, and I am sure that not many of his adversaries in the past, if any, had called to tell him that he did a good job.

In any event, this gracious act helped build rapport between my adversary and me, and we almost immediately thereafter began talking about a settlement. Eventually, the matter settled on terms that my client seemed happy about. Had I not congratulated my adversary and built some good will with him, I doubt that the case would have resolved as quickly as it did, which was a good outcome for my client and me.

I had situations in my career in which I have faced off against adversaries that were not gracious in defeat. One time, I asked for some materials that would help me build a spoliation argument in a case I was litigating. Another party had deleted some surveillance footage, and I requested information about when the footage was regularly deleted and when the party knew that there might be a claim related to an incident to help me make a spoliation claim. My adversary opposed the motion, saying that the information I requested was not relevant to the litigation we were handling.

When we argued the matter in front of the court, it was clear from the beginning that thew court would side with me. The information I requested was relevant to making a claim for spoliation, and the issue of spoliation was clearly relevant to the case. My adversary called me on the phone only minutes after the court had decided in my favor. Rather than congratulating me, the adversary just related that he thought I was wrong and that the court was off the rails in granting pretty much any discovery request. This was completely untrue, and I had much experience with spoliation matters to know that the information was relevant to the case and my adversary was wrong on the merits. Of course, I did not tell my adversary that he was being a sore loser since I thought I would be better off keeping a solid connection with my adversary. However, my adversary could have been more gracious in defeat, which would have probably led to a better working relationship for us.

All told, no one likes to lose, and litigators are natural fighters who likely hate to admit when they are wrong and concede defeat. However, if lawyers are more gracious in defeat, they can build a better rapport with adversaries and probably have better outcomes for themselves and their clients.

# When You Stiff A Biglaw Firm, They're Probably Going To Come After You
## White & Case is suing a former client over unpaid bills.

Earlier this week, Biglaw firm White & Case filed an ~$8.3 million lawsuit against a former client, special purpose acquisition company Colonnade Acquisition Corp. II. The claim is for unpaid bills for three years of legal work.

Of all the bills to skip out on, it sure seems like skipping out on the legal bills is the surest way to invite litigation. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/03/22/white-case-files-8m-suit-against-former-spac-client/) Law.com:

According to White & Case’s complaint filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, its former client, called Colonnade Acquisition Corp. II and referred to as CAC II, told the law firm for the first time in February that because it never successfully entered into “a business combination” with another company, after hiring White & Case to help it with such a transaction, “it was not required to pay White & Case anything for the prior three years of [legal] work.”

Oh, so perhaps there’s a contingency-type agreement that CAC II is relying on to get out of paying their lawyer fees? That seems a little atypical for a Biglaw firm, but they do say alternative fee arrangements are the future of the industry.

Oh wait, never mind.

But in its filing, White & Case cited two engagement letters entered into with CAC II in 2020 and 2021, respectively, while contending that the letters made it clear that legal-work billing would be based on “the amount of time spent on this matter by each lawyer or legal assistant that performs work,” as opposed to any type of contingency based on a successful business combination for CAC II.

Plus there’s this detail, from the complaint: “CAC II reflected White & Case’s fees as current (as opposed to contingent) liabilities in its subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which constitutes an admission by CAC II that such fees were not contingent upon the closing of any business combination.”

The timing of the lawsuit is critical too. According to the complaint, CAC II, a Cayman Islands exempted company, “has continued to take steps to cease operations, liquidate the assets in the trust account for distribution, and then dissolve without making any payment to White & Case.” And if that happens, “White & Case will be irreparably harmed as it will have no means of recovering the over $8 million in work done on CAC II’s behalf.”

The complaint was filed in Manhattan Supreme Court and details claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit.

# We Have Our First Match Of The New Biglaw Compensation Scale

Well, well, well. That didn’t take too long at all.

[Earlier today, Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) reasserted their dominance over the Biglaw compensation market by giving all associates a raise and pushing first-year compensation to $200,000 — a threshold [long hoped for](https://abovethelaw.com/2007/08/nyc-to-200k-the-american-lawyer-weighs-in/) in the industry. As exciting as that initial announcement was, the real question was how quickly the rest of the market would match (or, if we dared to hope, would come over the top of the standard set by Milbank).

Now we have our answer.

McDermott [confirmed](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/06/10/matching-begins-after-milbank-boosted-associate-salaries/) they’d be matching the Milbank scale. That means associate salaries at the firm will soon be as follows:

Class              Salary
2020               $200,000

2019                $210,000

2018                $230,000

# The Biglaw Firms Associates Rank As The 'Best Of The Best' (2022)

What does it take to cultivate job satisfaction at a law firm? Earlier this week, we focused on a new report from BTI Consulting, where associates pointed out exactly what they wanted from and valued in their work lives, and which firms were the best at committing to their overall happiness.

According to BTI, Biglaw associates are looking for much more than just big paychecks from their firms, including these eight core activities:

- Commitment to helping associates in their career
- Specific action to help develop a career path
- Access to training they need
- Good mentoring
- Optimism about growing within their firm
- High levels of job satisfaction
- Being well paid
- Having at least one partner watching out for them

After going evaluating 4,000 responses, BTI found that 147 Biglaw firms did the best job when it came to associate satisfaction. But which firms did the best in each category? Yesterday, we [covered](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/the-biglaw-firms-that-are-best-for-associate-satisfaction-2022/) the firms that were considered the best at helping associates in their careers and those with partners who have associates’ backs. Today, we’ll chat about the firms that have helped associates build their careers and provided access to the training they want and need.

When it comes to helping associates develop a career path in Biglaw, 53 firms came out on top, but associates ranked nine as the best of the best:

- Baker Donelson
- Faegre Drinker
- Greenberg Traurig
- Jackson Lewis
- Jones Day
- Milbank
- Mintz

# Special Bonuses Don't Make Associate Happy At This Biglaw Firm
## There's some fine print with the bonuses.

Usually when a Biglaw firm announces special bonuses, associates rejoice. After all, saying thank you for hard work during a pandemic with cold hard cash is generally the way to associates’ hearts. But, that’s not always the case.

You see, once there’s momentum in the market for a certain standard for special bonuses, anything less can feel like an insult. This is something Kramer Levin is learning the hard way. They announced special bonuses yesterday, but not everyone is happy about it. As one Kramer Levin tipster called them, they’re “the SHIT bonuses.” But let’s take a look at the details:


Hmmm, everything looks pretty standard, so why are folks so pissed? Well, it comes down to the fine print. Associates have to bill 1,900 hours (950 by June, 950 by year end) to qualify — [which isn’t even the most arduous requirement we’ve seen so far](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/cwt-special-bonuses/) — but only client-billable hours count. Though at least a make-up bonus is available for associates who hit their billable target only in the back half of the year.

Here’s what more tipsters have to say:

Kramer Levin comes out weak and clearly way off market. Bonuses for ONLY client billable work – if 950 by June end. And if 950 between June and Dec. catch up. If pure client billable is 1900 by end of December. This is ridiculous. The firm was off market last year too with COVID bonuses limited to client and business dev work. And at this point it’s pay is just way below market. Even below some of the lower ranked firms

Firm morale is extremely low and associates are heavily disappointed specially because there was no loss in earnings last year.

If you’re a Kramer associate and want to sound off on your special bonuses, feel free to send a line to tips@abovethelaw.com — a fun or insightful response may make it into an update of this article.

# Former Biglaw Partner And 'Prolific Money Launderer' Sentenced To 7 Years In Jail
## The prosecution says he funneled $2.1 million through various accounts, including attorney trust accounts.

Raymond Ho became a partner at Arent Fox at [just 33 years old](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/he-was-a-partner-at-a-major-dc-firm-at-33-now-hes-going-to-prison-for-7-years/2018/02/02/c27eb9e0-0765-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html?utm_term=.83f4b6f78ded) and worked at numerous prestigious law firms before opening up his own IP firm. But that illustrious page of his legal career is well over. In October, Ho pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering — the prosecution said that he funneled $2.1 million through various accounts, including attorney trust accounts.

According to the sentencing memorandum filed by the government in the case — which referred to Ho as a “prolific money launderer” — Ho’s legal credentials were just a front for an elaborate money laundering scheme:

“Raymond Juiwen Ho seemingly had it all,” the sentencing memo said. “After emigrating from Taiwan at a young age, he excelled in U.S. schools, earned two legal degrees, practiced law at some of the largest law firms in the country, and even opened his own patent law firm.

“The defendant, however, was not the upstart attorney his résumé would suggest. Rather, from at least March 2013 to February 2017, the defendant engaged in a large-scale money laundering scheme.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
As [reported by](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former_biglaw_partner_an_alleged_prolific_money_launderer_is_sentenced_to_s) ABA Journal, Ho’s attorneys revealed his troubles began before he embarked on the money laundering scheme. After his annual compensation took a hit, he began looking for a side hustle. His attempts at making additional money included: raising eels for export, tuna fishing, brokering the sale of distressed banks, selling train rails for scrap metal, recycling copper, and brokering the sale of a Chinese restaurant in Maryland.

Unfortunately, none of these were successful, and his lawyers say he tried serving as a paymaster when he got caught in the fraudulent scheme:

The only venture that was successful was serving as paymaster by holding funds as a disinterested party. In 2013, he was introduced to a person known as “Chief Onwa,” though Ho never met him in person. Chief Onwa asked Ho to cash two checks. Ho deposited the checks and wired the money to Onwa before finding out they were fraudulent.

In a bid to recover the money, Ho “foolishly agreed to facilitate additional transactions” for Chief Onwa, the court document said. “Before long,” Ho’s lawyers wrote. “Ho became involved in a set of fraudulent schemes that was larger than he could have ever anticipated.”

On Friday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema sentenced Ho to seven years in prison, saying the harsh term was appropriate for “somebody with your level of education and understanding of the law.”

# The Paul Weiss v. Kirkland Lateral Hiring Duel Could Inspire Other Firms To Make Major Moves

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

There will likely be ripple effects beyond those law firms. A firm might see Paul Weiss doing a difficult and challenging thing like taking 13 partners from Kirkland and start to think about movement at the top. It inspires other firms to approach the market in a more targeted and proactive way.

— [Sabina Lippman](https://ljpartners.com/who-we-are/sabina-lippman/), co-founder of legal recruiting firm Lippman Jungers, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/09/18/will-lateral-battle-between-kirkland-and-paul-weiss-create-ripple-effects/) on the potential effects that the back-and-forth lateral partner swipes between Paul Weiss and Kirkland could have on the rest of the Biglaw market. “[T]hese kinds of moves generate excitement and motivate other attorneys to dip their toes in the lateral market,” she said.

# Will Individualized Bonuses Be A Boon For Sidley Associates?
## Hmmm, is this a good thing for associates?

Individualized bonuses: yay or nay? They can be a bit of a mixed bag. High billers can be pretty happy with them, and even beat the market standard. But for the rank and file associates, the lack of clarity can be frustrating.

Today, Sidley Austin announced their annual bonuses were on their way, though associates will learn their “individualized” bonuses sometime over the next week or so. But the firm also released “base bonus amounts by class year,” which line up neatly with the market bonuses established by Cravath at the start of this bonus season:

As is our custom, we have determined bonuses on an individual basis.  Annual bonuses continue to be discretionary, and general eligibility criteria remain the same as in past years.  In establishing bonus amounts, we have given substantial weight to the quality of an associate’s work and the hours that each associate has spent on chargeable, pro bono, and certain non-chargeable matters, such as legal services and other special contributions to the Firm.  Subject to these considerations, we are pleased to announce the following general base bonus amounts by class year.  We note that associates with higher productivity and exceptional performance may be eligible to receive a bonus above these amounts.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class Year

2017 Bonus

2016

$15,000

2015

$25,000

2014

$50,000

2013

$65,000

2012

$80,000

2011

$90,000

2010

$100,000

2009+

$100,000

 

So it looks like this year — in a deviation from past practice — Sidley has established a baseline for bonuses, and is leaving the door open to pay above market rates for high billers. Whether a bunch of associates will get below those announced amounts remains to be seen. Announcing this baseline has been met by trepidation by some tipsters:

It will be interesting to see how much they are willing to depart from it for people who billed more.

# DLA Piper Partner Accused Of Sexual Assault Speaks Out
## He says his accuser is exploiting #MeToo.

Louis Lehot

The allegations against DLA Piper partner Louis Lehot have reverberated through Biglaw. Now Lehot has released a statement and over 40 pages of correspondence with his accuser, Vanina Guerrero.

Earlier this month, DLA Piper partner Vanina Guerrero released an open letter to the firm, and filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, [alleging that the co-managing partner of the Silicon Valley office, Louis Lehot, repeatedly sexually assaulted her after ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-fellow-partner/)she’d been recruited to the firm in 2018. She additionally asked the firm to release her from their mandatory arbitration agreement so she’d be able to pursue her claims in open court. The firm has been conspicuously silent on the forced arbitration agreement — despite the [attention their arbitration stance](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/kamala-harris-gets-dragged-into-dla-piper-sexual-assault-controversy/) in this case [has garnered](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/law-school-students-protest-outside-of-dla-piper-over-alleged-sexual-assault/), but, they did announce that Lehot had been [let go from the firm.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/dla-piper-partner-out-amid-sexual-assault-allegations/) Then the firm put Guerrero on [leave](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/now-the-dla-piper-accuser-has-been-put-on-leave/), saying they’d uncovered allegations unrelated to Lehot during their investigation of her claims.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As [reported](https://www.law.com/2019/10/21/ex-dla-piper-partner-denies-assault-claims-blasts-accuser-for-exploiting-metoo/) by Law.com, today Lehot admitted to having an “emotional relationship” with Guerrero and he said that was the reason he agreed to leave the firm.  His statement also said in no uncertain terms that he does not believe Guerrero is a victim:

“I acknowledge poor judgment in developing an emotional relationship with Vanina Guerrero. I deeply regret the pain this has caused my family, colleagues, clients and friends,” Lehot continued. “This isn’t victim-blaming or victim-shaming. She’s not a victim here.”

Lehot also released emails that are purportedly between himself and Guerrero that he says show a friendly rapport between the two during the time of the alleged assault. Of course, it frequently[ takes time for victims of assault](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801204272240) to process and name their experiences, particularly when they’ve been victimized by an acquaintance.

Guerrero’s attorney took this latest development as an opportunity to further push to be let out of her mandatory arbitration agreement:

DLA Piper has no new comment about this latest development.
