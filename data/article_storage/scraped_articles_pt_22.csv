Marie-Joe Abi-Nassif (Photo via Facebook)

If you thought you were busy and overworked as a Biglaw associate, just imagine trying to balance your legal career with a professional singing career. That’s exactly what [Marie-Joe Abi-Nassif](https://www.lw.com/people/marie-joe-abi-nassif), a second-year associate at Latham & Watkins, has to do every day.

While training at Julliard, Abi-Nassif started her career at the firm as a paralegal in the capital markets and M&A group. After working at the firm for two years, the accomplished opera singer enrolled in Columbia’s LL.M. program. Since graduating last year, she works as an M&A attorney at the firm by day, and by night — and in whatever spare time she can find when she’s not billing her life away — she practices her music.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Balancing music and law isn’t easy, but’s possible to hit high billables and high notes if you try hard enough. Abi-Nassif elaborated on that in an interview with the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202774740556/Latham-Associate-Moonlights-as-Opera-Singer?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=3): “When you work at a firm like Latham, you need to be responsive to the clients and the supervisors … but I try to manage my musical schedule according to my availability from a work perspective. Sometimes I have to cancel my trainings because I need to be at the office late, but this doesn’t prevent me from studying when I go home.”

For lawyers who once dreamed of becoming singers like Abi-Nassif and felt the need to put away their musical passions to practice law, perhaps it’s time to start honing your hobby again — it could make you a better lawyer. Here’s what Abi-Nassif had to say about that in an interview with [Columbia Law School](http://web.law.columbia.edu/news/2016/12/hitting-high-note), her alma mater:

“It takes a lot of mental control to shift gears every day,” she says. However, Abi-Nassif finds her relationship with music informs her legal work. “I think my singing career gives me the ability to think outside the box as a lawyer,” she adds. “It also gives me the emotional intelligence to understand other people and adjust accordingly.”

Marie-Joe Abi-Nassif’s debut at the famed Carnegie Hall is [tomorrow at 8 p.m.](http://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2016/12/16/0800/PM/Marie-Joe-Abi-Nassif-Mezzo-Soprano/), where the mezzo-soprano will perform songs and arias from works by Bellini, Rossini, Bizet, Fauré, to name a few. Many of her Latham colleagues, including the the managing partner of the New York office, will be seated in the front row for her performance.

# First-Year Associate Salaries Are Up, But Is It Time For Another Raise?
## The pandemic couldn't stop salaries from climbing. Is it time for a $200K first-year salary?

The pandemic gave rise to a year of uncertainty across the legal profession, but one thing COVID didn’t bring crashing down was first-year associate salaries. Yes, Biglaw firms of all stripes instituted austerity measures during 2020, but according to a new report from the National Association for Law Placement, first-year associate salaries are actually up despite all of the financial chaos.

NALP’s 2021 Associate Salary Survey report notes that as of January 1, 2021, the median base salary for first-year associates was $165,000, which is up $10,000 from 2019, the last time this survey came out. Of the 572 responses received, 78% of them came from law firms of more than 250 lawyers.

James G. Leipold, NALP’s Executive Director, had this to say about the report:

Despite widespread media reports of austerity measures implemented by law firms during the pandemic, including delays in partner draws and in some cases temporary salary reductions for lawyers, the findings from NALP’s latest Associate Salary Survey show that associate compensation has continued to grow over the last two years, with first-year associate compensation of $190,000 now measured as the most common starting salary, reflecting the continued strength of the legal sector despite a difficult year.

$190K may now be the most common starting salary — after the Great Associate Salary Increase of 2018, where firms of more than 700 lawyers doled out $10,000 raises from $180,000 — but not all firms were able to bump their first-years to such salary heights. As it turns out, the greatest salary growth was seen at firms of 101-250 lawyers, where median first-year salaries increased by $15,000, from $115,000 in 2019 to $130,000 in 2021. At firms of 251-500 lawyers, base salaries for first-years grew by $10,000, from $160,000 in 2019 to $170,000 in 2021.

The NALP survey did have this interesting nugget of information on salaries:

Geography continues to have a considerable impact on salary differences across regions, cities, and states. This year’s report contains analyses for 23 individual cities as well as additional states and regions not encompassed by those cities. These analyses reveal a wide spectrum of law firm compensation, with median first-year salaries by city ranging from $115,000 to $190,000. Outside some of the largest markets, $190,000 salaries were still not the norm. Regionally, the highest median first-year associate base salaries were in the Northeast ($175,000), followed by the South and West, both at $170,000. The lowest salaries were in the Midwest ($130,000).

So, with all of these inventive bonuses and a hot lateral market, we’ve got to ask: is it time for another Biglaw salary increase? We saw one in [2016](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2016-associate-salary-increase/), one in [2018](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/2018-associate-salary-increase/), and [2020](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-chart-2020/) and [2021](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/) have turned out to be big bonus years. Is now the time for a $200K first-year salary? Should associates be expecting a raise sometime later this year or in 2022? We guess they’ll have to stick around to find out.

# Biglaw Start Dates: When's Your Firm Welcoming New Associates?
## How Biglaw is dealing with the COVID new normal.

COVID-19 keeps on messing up… everything. And with a whole mess of states not even close to controlling the outbreak, well, it isn’t going to end any time soon.

In normal times, the Biglaw year has a certain rhythm to it. The Summer Associates start in June, on-campus recruitment starts in August, the class of new associates begin in September/October after they’ve taken the July bar exam… but the coronavirus has thrown a wrench into all of this. Sumer programs — to the extend they’re happening — [have been thrown into chaos](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/every-summer-associate-program-change-in-one-chart/), and are [mostly happening online](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/most-firms-intend-to-host-summer-programs-entirely-online/). My colleague Joe Patrice [has made a veritable cottage industry](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bar-exam/) out of writing about how various states are changing (or not, yikes) the bar exam to deal with this new reality.

Now we’re focusing on when Biglaw firms will welcome their newest class of associates. Since firms are taking distinct approaches, it’s appropriate to start a chart to track exactly which firms are doing what.

# Biglaw Mental Health Needs To Be About More Than Just ‘Puppy Yoga’
## More firms need to change their wellbeing programming to better assist their attorneys.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Puppy yoga is not a wellbeing strategy. Sure it’s lovely, crack on and have a cuddle with a puppy! But it’s absolutely nothing to do with the business-critical concept of wellbeing.

It has to be something that the leadership of a firm has in its culture. I believe you cannot look after other people if you’re not looking after yourself.

— [Caroline Turner-Inskip](https://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/people/ck0dynssauul60b36twurqu01/caroline-turner-inskip), global head of wellbeing at Simmons & Simmons, in comments given to [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2024/03/28/puppy-yoga-is-not-a-wellbeing-strategy-are-law-firms-doing-enough-on-mental-health/) on the need for law firms to expand their mental health offerings. “I’m part of the ownership of the business,” she said, “and I think what that allows me to do is to push and say ‘As a partner of this firm, this is what we’re going to change here.’”

# Biglaw Firm Under Attack (Again) By Law School Students Who've Had Enough With Mandatory Arbitration
## Law students aren't going to let the firm sweep the issue under the rug.

The fight over the use of mandatory arbitration agreements at Biglaw firms continues. A group of Harvard Law student activists, organized as the [Pipeline Parity Project](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org/about/) (PPP), have kept the heat on Biglaw firms over their use of the agreements. Yesterday, these law students organized a protest — [again](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) — against one of the firms, [Venable](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/venable-law-firm-targeted-by-harvard-law-school-students-over-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/), that seems hell-bent on keeping mandatory arbitration agreements.

As [PPP notes](http://www.pipelineparityproject.org), the protest was organized during a Venable recruiting event, designed to get elite law students interested in the firm:

On Tuesday, Venable LLP thought it was holding a recruiting reception for first-year law students in Washington, DC. But their efforts to woo prospective associates may have backfired, since the Pipeline Parity Project took the opportunity to educate our fellow law students about the firm’s deceptive forced arbitration policy.

Law students from several schools joined together to educate our peers about how Venable’s forced arbitration policy threatens their civil rights—by leafleting on the sidewalk outside Venable’s DC office as prospective associates entered for a reception.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
This is the second time protestors have[ taken to the streets](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/law-school-students-are-taking-to-the-street-over-biglaw-firms-with-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) outside Venable. They also let it be known that they will continue their protests just as long as the mandatory arbitration agreements are in force at the firm:

“If Venable doesn’t drop forced arbitration, it won’t be the last either,” said Beth Feldstein, a second-year student at Harvard Law School.

The practice of mandatory arbitration agreements in Biglaw came under fire when Munger Tolles was [called out on social media for the practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/) last year. That firm changed their policy as a result, and other firms [voluntarily did away](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/this-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-step-forward-and-do-away-with-mandatory-arbitration-for-all-employees/) with the [practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/another-biglaw-firm-kicks-mandatory-arbitration-to-the-curb/). Others [required some good, old-fashioned pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/law-school-students-stand-up-to-biglaw-firm-win/), but eventually eliminated the agreements. But, of course, there have been some firms that have [held fast](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/), despite complaints, including Venable.

Venable’s position on the agreements is particularly notable because the firm only adopted the policy after the controversy over mandatory arbitration had begun. Last summer,[ a survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/which-biglaw-firms-still-require-summer-associates-to-sign-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/) was sent to Biglaw firms on behalf of T14 law schools. In response to that inquiry, Venable said the incoming summer associate class would not have to sign mandatory arbitration agreements. However, [only a few weeks later, the firm reversed course.](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/venable-law-firm-targeted-by-harvard-law-school-students-over-mandatory-arbitration-agreements/)

And as revealed in social media, the firm’s quick change on mandatory arbitration is definitely fueling the protestors’ ire at the firm.

## Counsel are getting in on the action, too!

Biglaw firms continue to open their coffers to award their hardworking associates with higher salaries. Not all firms will be able to make a Cravath match, of course, but those that wish to maintain their status as members of the elite certainly will.

The latest firm to do so is Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a firm that landed at No. 62 in the most recent Am Law 100, bringing home $723,452,000 gross revenue in 2020. This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:



In other news, the firm has committed to maintaining its “super bonus” programs that award associates with up to an additional $50,000 in above-market bonus bucks for high billables. Associates and counsel who qualified for the firm’s first- and second-tier super bonuses in 2021 have been awarded with 50 qualifying hours towards their 2022 bonus and billable hours thresholds as a sign of Pillsbury’s appreciation for their hard work.

Pillsbury associates (and counsel) will see their raises reflected in their March 31st paychecks, retroactive to January 1. Congrats to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Pillsbury.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Biglaw Is Looking 'Pretty Tepid' When It Comes To 2023 Finances

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I think most firms may well come in around their budgets. But I don’t think there will be many setting the world on fire.

My gut tells me it’s going to be a pretty tepid year. [A] lot will depend on decisions made in the last quarter about hiring; whether firms will seriously adjust their quotas on hiring or offers going out, because that can certainly drive up your expense burden faster than just about anything in a law firm.

— Jim Jones, director of the Georgetown University Law Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/2023/10/20/many-law-firms-on-pace-to-meet-budget-but-uncertainty-lingers-in-strange-year/), on Biglaw’s financial picture in Q4 amid economic uncertainty and industry analysts still painting year-end profitability pictures as “flat-ish” and “volatile.”

The rise of SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies), aka the “blank check boom,” has significantly shaped the IPO and M&A markets over the past year. Law firms have innovated and expanded their capabilities and offerings to specifically advise on these popular transactions. How have SPACs affected law firms, attorney recruiting, and the current legal job market?

What are SPACs, exactly? Here’s a good overview, from a [McGuireWoods client memo](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/Alerts/2021/2/spac-litigation-likely-to-surge-in-2021):

SPACs are publicly traded companies created as vehicles to take promising private companies public. A SPAC offers securities for cash, and places the offering proceeds into a trust or escrow account to be used to acquire one or more operating companies. After the IPO, the SPAC generally has a limited amount of time to identify acquisition targets. SPACs sometimes are called “blank check companies” because their investors give management discretion to identify and acquire private companies after the IPO.

SPACs are attractive to investors and target corporations because they allow companies to go public faster and with lower costs and with fewer regulatory hurdles than traditional IPOs. In 2020, SPACs grew exponentially, raising a record-high of over $83 billion with 248 blank check IPOs, according to [SPACInsider](http://spacinsider.com/stats) — a 320 percent increase in the number of SPAC IPOs compared to 2019. Looking at 2021, there have already been more SPAC IPOs than in all of 2020, with 308 SPAC IPOs completed and over $99 billion in capital raised as of this writing.

Some of the most notable recent SPAC IPOs include the fantasy sports and sports betting company DraftKings, the electric car battery manufacturer QuantumScape, and spaceflight company Virgin Galactic. Also, recently, the global office-space commercial real estate company WeWork announced its planned merger with the SPAC BowX Acquisition Corp.

SPACs have been around since the mid 1990s, but back then they had more regulatory hurdles and investor risk. As explained by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/22/the-rise-of-spacs/), in the past “SPACs have been the avenue of last resort for companies that want to go public but can’t — either because underwriters won’t take them public or the public markets won’t embrace them.”

Over the last 10 years, however, the number of SPAC IPOs has steadily increased as a result of [structural improvements and decreased regulation](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/03/25/spac-to-the-future-law-firms-are-riding-the-wave-as-interest-explodes/). Per a [Skadden Arps client memo](https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2021/01/2021-insights/corporate/the-year-of-the-spac):

The popularity of SPACs can be attributed to various factors, including highly regarded sponsor teams, their unique investment structure, a better understanding by the market of the SPAC structure, the well-established complementary private investment in the public equity (PIPE) financing market, and the potential attractiveness for target companies of the subsequent acquisition as compared to a traditional IPO or M&A transaction.

The substantial increase in SPAC-related transactions has spurred demand for the services of large law firms across corporate, finance, tax, and other practice groups. Numerous firms have formed multidisciplinary SPAC sub-specialty teams bringing together attorneys from different practice groups to advise sponsors, SPACs, underwriters, and target companies through the entire life cycle of SPAC transactions.

Specifically, capital markets, M&A, finance, private funds, and tax teams work together on transactional and regulatory matters surrounding SPAC IPOs and mergers, including SPAC formation and structuring, SPAC merger-related securities filings, SPAC merger financing arrangements, IPO offering materials and pre-IPO diligence, SPAC merger redemptions and repurchases, and cross-border tax issues. Private-equity-focused corporate practice groups have also held a central presence in the SPAC IPO market, with SPACs often backed by private equity sponsors and the use of PIPE financing to raise additional capital for SPAC IPOs, as recently discussed by [CNBC](https://followup.cc/l/11085515/d83ded8fcfafcc466278943f1da38456/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2021%2F01%2F25%2Fhow-financing-spac-takeovers-became-wall-streets-new-favorite-trade.html).

Firms are also predicting and seeing an increase in SPAC-related commercial and securities litigation. As noted by [McGuireWoods](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/Alerts/2021/2/spac-litigation-likely-to-surge-in-2021):

Right now, there is a growing trend of SPAC shareholder lawsuits filed soon after announcements of mergers between SPACs and their target companies. Those business combinations are often called “de-SPAC transactions.” The lawsuits typically seek both money damages and injunctive relief to prevent the culmination of the transaction. In addition to individual shareholder suits, class actions are being filed.

The lawsuits typically seek both money damages and injunctive relief to prevent the closing of the transaction. Class actions have also been filed alleging inadequate pre-merger management disclosures or violations of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

Looking at [SPAC Research’s Legal League Tables](https://www.spacresearch.com/legal?year=2020), in 2020 Skadden and Kirkland led in total deal volume at $20.6B and $20.5B, respectively. The New York boutique of Ellenoff, Grossman, & Schole, which has long specialized in SPAC IPOs and related transactions, led in total deal count, with 69 SPAC IPOs in 2020, followed by Kirkland at 64. Thus far, [in 2021](https://www.spacresearch.com/legal), of the 308 SPAC IPOs, Kirkland leads in total deal volume at $24B, followed by Skadden at $22.1B. Looking at total deal count, Ellenoff leads with 78 SPAC IPOs, followed by Kirkland advising on 68 total. Other firms at the front of the pack for highest SPAC IPO 2020–2021 market share include Ropes & Gray, White & Case, Davis Polk, Weil Gotshal, Latham & Watkins, and Greenberg Traurig.

Since the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, there has been unprecedented demand for capital markets and corporate M&A partners and associates. SPAC activity along with the larger resurgence in corporate deal and lending activity has contributed to ascending growth in these practice areas. While SPACs have prompted demand in other practice areas, M&A and capital markets are the most directly related to SPACs. Despite this increased demand, there have been [a limited number](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/03/25/spac-to-the-future-law-firms-are-riding-the-wave-as-interest-explodes/) of corresponding SPAC-focused corporate partner or group hires. This is likely due to the limited number of practitioners specializing in SPAC-related transactions, with SPACs being a relatively nascent industry for most law firms.

Corporate and finance associate lateral activity could not be busier. In the first quarter of 2021, according to data from [Leopard Solutions](https://www.leopardsolutions.com/default.aspx), there were 480 lateral corporate and finance associates hired into Am Law 200 firms nationally. This is a 27 percent increase from the first quarter of 2020, which reached a five-year-high of 379 lateral corporate and finance associates hired into Am Law 200 firms. (Most law firm COVID-related economic repercussions began in the second quarter of 2020.) This year’s first quarter results also represent a 37 percent uptick over the 2016–2020 first quarter average of 350 associates hired by Am Law 200 firms. Therefore, it is safe to say we are well above pre-pandemic hiring levels.

While there is debate among economists and finance leaders over how long the boom in SPACs will continue or if we are looking at a SPAC bubble that could eventually burst, the consensus is that robust SPAC activity levels will persist for the foreseeable future. SPAC transactions will thus continue to drive law firm demand along with the larger economic recovery.

# If Biglaw Firms Don't Think Recruiters Will Go After Them For Not Raising Salaries, They're Wrong. This Email Proves It.
## Firms can't have it all. If they don't pay top-notch salaries, they'll not have top-notch talent.

Some firms don’t seem to understand that recruitment and retention is a zero-sum game. If they want the talent pool to consistently compete for the top-tier clients, they need to either pay associates top-tier salaries or find some other credible advantage — like being an 1800 hour/year firm and meaning it, or being in a cheaper cost of living market — that associates are willing to trade a few tens of thousands of dollars for. What a firm can’t do is expect associates to work at a top-tier level while lagging the market in compensation.

And when they do that, the invisible hand of capitalism — in the avatar of legal recruiters — will sweep in and efficiently allocate the lagging firm’s attorneys to other firms that are paying top dollar.

Partners should realize that as soon as they send that compensation email without a full raise, there will be consequences. That’s not necessarily a bad thing… but they just need to understand that their turnover is about to go up. Because legal recruiters are going to start sending associates emails like this one that a tipster forwarded from an [RPN Executive Search](http://www.rpnexecsearch.com) recruiter:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
As it has been widely reported, Greenberg’s compensation structure is not consistently keeping up with the market increases. If you did not get your raise and summer bonus, you are not in a profit center or not at the top list for a promotion, or both. What you are getting paid is one of the most transparent signs how the firm values your position and progression. The market is so robust that we are even skipping the typical August lull and placing attorneys across practice areas. Many of our clients that are paying the new Cravath salaries are making associates whole on the bonus and not pro-rating it.

The biggest newsflash in this email is the revelation that some higher-paying firms aren’t going to wait until the end of the year to get access to attorneys with wandering eyes. The lateral market used to be more cyclical, with most attorneys unwilling to leave their home firm until securing their full annual bonus. Leaving earlier was just leaving money on the table. It’s the reason a number of firms moved to distributing bonuses in February or March of the following year — to keep their associates behind the lateral market. It’s an anachronistic trick these days, with a year-round lateral calendar and target firms offering to cover the difference on bonuses.

While this email focuses on Greenberg, all the firms who’ve held out on their associates should expect something similar — nay, many somethings similar — lighting up their associates’ emails, texts, and phones for the next several weeks and months. In a couple of years, we’ll see the results of The Great Sorting as talent flows to its proper home.

Will being a holdout firm pay off? It might. Or it might not.

# Legal Sector Loses Almost 9K Jobs In August -- But Is 'Rightsizing' To Blame?
## Yikes!

With the country in a technical recession, financial worries have been plaguing the legal profession. Demand for legal services has slumped since the early post-pandemic’s heydays, and law firms are reportedly looking to [rightsize their workforces](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/are-stealth-layoffs-ahead-firms-are-threatening-to-rightsize/).

But has the rightsizing already started?

Preliminary August 2022 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the legal services sector lost 8,900 jobs, for a total of 1,179,300 employed in the legal field, including lawyers, paralegals, and other legal professionals. This alarming loss comes hot on the heels of five consecutive months of gains.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Despite the 0.75% decline, the number of legal services jobs in August is still higher than the number of legal jobs recorded in August 2021 (1,157,200), and higher still than the sector’s February 2020 pre-pandemic high of 1,163,000.

What could possibly be the cause? Here’s more, from [Law360](https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1519010/after-steady-growth-legal-sector-shed-9k-jobs-in-august):

According to John Cashman, president of legal consulting and recruiting firm Major Lindsey & Africa, the recent decline of legal jobs has largely stemmed from the slowdown in demand for corporate transactional lawyers and their support staff.

“What we’re really seeing is a mismatch — a lag, if you will — between overall economic activity and the legal work that supports it,” Cashman said. He added that he anticipates the legal sector will continue to “retrench” as firm leaders wait to see what happens to the broader economy.

Yikes. This all stinks of [stealth layoffs](http://abovethelaw.com/tag/stealth-layoffs), the disturbingly popular method used by firms to cull the associate herd. For those who might be hearing the term for the first time, stealth layoffs are used throughout Biglaw and they allow firms to cut headcount without confirming that there were any financially based layoffs. Firm frequently couch the reductions in performance review terms that coincidentally happen in the midst of a downturn — whether economic- or demand-related — often making those let go doubt their lawyering skills. By their secretive nature, they can be challenging to confirm in specific numbers, but insiders slowly find out something is amiss.

As far as staff is concerned, they’ll sometimes be victims of stealth layoffs, but it’s far more likely that they’ll be offered a [voluntary buyout](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/voluntary-buyouts/). We often refer to buyouts as the kinder, gentler way of parting with employees, but those on the other side of a buyout are still left without jobs.

As we’ve mentioned in the past, the good times don’t last. Perhaps this is why [Biglaw summer bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/summer-bonuses/) were almost a complete no-go — firms were much more busy contemplating their financial futures and quietly letting staff and associates go. Good luck out there, everyone.

If your firm or organization is reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Catching Up With Cadwalader: Partner Profits, Associate Bonuses, Lawyer Departures, And More
## Profits dipped a bit last year, the firm reinstituted a billable-hours requirement for associate bonuses, and lawyer and staff departures are running high in some departments.

When we last checked in with [Cadwalader](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cadwalader/), the firm paid out bonuses on the New York market scale — and [without a specific billable-hours requirement](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/associate-bonus-watch-without-a-billable-hours-requirement-all-associates-at-this-firm-got-bonuses/). Associates were generally pleased about their bonuses — and, it seems, CWT in general. Last year the firm enjoyed a big jump in the American Lawyer’s [associate satisfaction survey](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202735469012), leaping from #47 all the way up to #14.

If some of that happiness flowed from not having a billable-hours requirement for bonuses, though, it could be short-lived. In December 2014, the firm announced [elimination of the billable requirement for bonus eligibility](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-no-billable-hours-requirement-still-equals-high-bonuses-at-this-firm/), with managing partner [Pat Quinn](http://www.cadwalader.com/professionals/pat-quinn) telling [Law360](http://www.law360.com/articles/512261/cadwalader-detaches-associate-bonuses-from-billable-hours) that the change reflected “our firm’s emphasis on excellence of work, rather than quantity of work.” But now, just a little more than a year later, the firm is reinstituting a billable-hours cutoff, as one tipster told us:

CWT’s bonus policy recently changed. It was previously for everyone in good standing, but there are now hour requirements – 1600 billable + 200 quality non-billable (CLEs, recruiting, pro bono etc) for 50% bonus, 1800 billable + 200 non-billable for 100%, and 2200 for an extra 20%.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
On the bright side, our sources seem fine with it. From a second source:

I think it’s pretty fair. Slower groups will dislike it, but it makes economical sense for the firm. Getting 200 non-billable is not terribly difficult as there are almost daily trainings that count, as well as pro bono and recruiting. That leaves 1800 billable to get 100%, which seems standard in major markets.

I think people’s biggest issue is that firm backtracked from the policy instituted recently to eliminate the hours requirement so associates could focus on quality over quantity.

Our original tipster also wasn’t too troubled, but noted that others might feel differently:

The bonus policy actually seems pretty reasonable. No one in my department is particularly upset because we’ll probably still make our hours, but litigation associates are a bit bummed as their department is really slow.

Ah yes, litigation slowness — a common complaint in Biglaw today, but still frustrating. Pat Quinn cited it when discussing the dip in Cadwalader’s profits in 2015, reported last month by the [American Lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202749052997/The-Am-Law-100-the-Early-Numbers-Profits-Continue-to-Slide-at-Cadwalader-):

Gross revenue at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft fell 3.7 percent, to $463.5 million, in 2015, while partner profits declined 6.8 percent, to $2.06 million, the firm reported.

Revenue per lawyer also took a hit, dropping 2.8 percent, to $1.04 million. The firm added 11 new lateral partners last year, but overall lawyer head count decreased from 452 to 448….

Quinn said the revenue generated by the firm’s corporate department was up 32 percent in 2015. The firm’s litigation department, he said, experienced a slowdown that was on par with industry trends.

The slowness in litigation has resulted in litigation associates “dropping like flies,” one source told us. It’s not clear whether this headcount loss, reflected in a steady flow of departure memos, is voluntary or involuntary. (If the latter, Cadwalader wouldn’t be alone; we’re hearing reports of multiple firms trimming their ranks, but with so-called [“stealth layoffs”](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/stealth-layoffs/) — telling a small number of lawyers on an individual basis that it’s time to seek new opportunities, spread out over time to avoid publicity.)

We’ve heard reports of reductions on the staff side as well, but again, it’s not clear whether the departures are voluntary or involuntary. They could be voluntary; we’ve heard complaints over the past few months from CWT staff about how they haven’t received year-end bonuses since 2008. For example:

Each year since 2008, the firm stopped giving out bonuses to administrative staff. That includes the IT Department, Compliance, and Secretarial Services. (I haven’t asked anyone in Marketing or Accounting yet.) It’s been almost 10 years and the top brass still does not give out bonuses to administrative staff. We get a $250 gift card, which is a slap to the face and, as my colleague put it, “downright insulting,” considering that the fellow law firms we checked out on Glassdoor reported giving their administrative personnel $1,000+ in bonuses. Don’t get me wrong, it’s better than nothing, but when a bonus is an indicator of their appreciation, consider us underappreciated….

I know your publication focuses primarily on lawyers, but I wanted to share the overlooked story of the working class plebeians that hammer away in the bowels of this law firm. As such, if you deem this appropriate to share, please keep me anonymous as I don’t wish to be screwed any more than I already am. There is not enough Vaseline to go around.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
We reached out to Cadwalader about (1) its bonus policies for associates and staff and (2) possible layoffs of litigators and staff. Here’s what the firm had to say:

Cadwalader entered 2016 with an eye to the future, aligning pay, staffing and overall compensation to match the strategic opportunities we see ahead for the firm. Our associate bonus policy, described in the attached email, is among the most generous in the industry. When it comes to our administrative staff, our approach to compensation is focused on the total compensation package, and it is very competitive with other top law firms.

Regarding your second inquiry, the firm has reduced staff over the course of more than a year in certain areas; however, it has also hired and continues to do so in others.

Fair enough; that’s a commendably candid statement by Biglaw standards. And you can flip to the next page for the full memo laying out the revised bonus policy (which strikes me as perfectly reasonable, even if the about-face from a year ago is odd).

# Biglaw Firm Pushing Out Senior Associates
## We're told the associates have six months to find new jobs.

What exactly is a stealth layoff? Due to their, well, stealthy nature they’re a little hard to define. But basically it’s when a firm wants to cut headcount but doesn’t want blowback from announcing actual layoffs. So, they’ll give the associates X number of months to find a new job and the firm may even couch the reductions in performance review terms, making those let go doubt their lawyering skills. But when a Biglaw firm tells 85 percent of a class of senior litigation associates they have to go, the problem is a lot more likely to be with the firm than the associates.

That’s certainly how tipsters at Cahill Gordon are reacting to reports that the overwhelming majority of senior litigation associates in a particular class (we’re not publishing the exact year to protect their anonymity) are being asked to leave the firm, before they’ve even had the chance to go up for partnership. Multiple sources report the associates were told they weren’t partner or counsel material, given only a portion of their bonus and told they had six months to get out of Dodge. And even though pushing out these associates is being framed as connected to their inability to make the leap to the next level, sources say most of them weren’t even able to hear any reviews of their work.

The reactions from the associates we’ve heard from have been unanimous in their shock/anger over this personnel decision and are riffs on the theme that the firm seems more interested in saving money than holding attorneys to an arbitrary standard of excellence.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The associate ranks at Cahill are fuming… Cahill should not receive airtime on Above the Law for above-market bonuses when they cut ranks… to get there.

We reached out to the firm to comment on the headcount reductions, but have not heard back.

Best of luck to those that are being pushed out of the firm, hopefully your next job is less than six months away.

If you have news of layoffs — stealth or otherwise — at other firms please reach out. You can [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Layoffs) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Layoffs”) or text us at (646-820-8477).

# New York Biglaw Makes Waaaay More Money Than The Rest Of You
## When the legal market struggles, these firms still surge.

The legal industry may still be slowly crawling its way out of a Great Recession-sized hole, but everything continues to come up roses for New York’s biggest Biglaw badasses.

Which isn’t really a surprise if you’ve followed the industry for [any length](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/top-firms-get-richer-in-otherwise-poor-year-for-the-legal-industry/) of [time](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/biglaw-strikes-back-the-rich-firms-get-richer-this-quarter/). When times get rough, bigger fish have the resources to weather the crisis better and nervous customers feel more risk-averse and continue to spend with brands they know rather than substitute to cheaper alternatives.

So we’ve all read that the top firms were getting richer, but Am Law Daily has a new survey that [puts some concrete numbers on this windfall](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202783254665/New-Yorks-HighFlying-Firms-Hit-New-Heights-in-Profits-Revenue?mcode=0&curindex=0&curpage=ALL):

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Profits per equity partner, for example, shot up by 18 percent at Cravath, Swaine & Moore; 13.5 percent at Davis Polk & Wardwell; 14 percent at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson; 12.8 percent at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy; 18 percent at Shearman & Sterling; and 22.6 percent at Weil, Gotshal & Manges.

“It was our best year ever,” said Davis Polk managing partner Thomas Reid, adding that the firm saw “above-normal strength in restructuring, leveraged finance and M&A.”

Also reporting strong partner profits were Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, up 7.2 percent; Cahill Gordon & Reindel, up 8.2 percent; Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, up 7.8 percent; and Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, up 8.5 percent.

Consider what 18 percent means to a partner pulling down a Cravath share. Their partners got a raise the size of what some small-firm partners bring down in a year. This is why nobody was crying for the Biglaw giants that raised associate salaries last year.

It’s not like the market’s any better for these firms, they just have the Veblen Good power to raise their rates in the face of economic uncertainty and watch clients fork over more money:

Some top-line growth for top New York firms was driven by increased regulatory and investigations, private equity, mid-market M&A, bankruptcy and restructuring work, [Citi Private Bank Law Firm Group head of advisory services Gretta] Rusanow said. But there was no uptick in demand. In fact, lawyer demand, as measured by total logged billable hours, was up for New York-based firms by an average of just 0.1 percent, compared with 0.3 percent growth for the industry, Rusanow said.

Instead, revenue growth was driven by stronger rate increases—up to 3.7 percent among New York firms compared with 3.3 in the industry­—and less discounting pressure, Rusanow said. “They were able to retain higher rate increases,” she said.

So much for all that [sanctimonious posturing about rate increases](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/some-clients-are-super-pissed-about-associate-raises/). But this again cuts to the core of why the fallout from last year’s associate raises will be intriguing to watch. Firms like these knew they could pass the cost along to the client with few questions asked. Others rushed to match without seriously considering whether or not their clients would be as forgiving.

It’s going to take a couple of years, but early indicators suggest a lot of mid-tier firms just helped their top-notch colleagues stretch their lead.

# Biglaw Firm Encourages Associates To Sleep During Working Hours

If you’re an associate at a large law firm, it goes without saying that you’re probably tired — extremely tired. There’s only so much that coffee can do for you after all of the late nights and all-nighters you’ve had to pull. If your firm allowed you to sleep on the job, would you do it?

One firm is offering its attorneys the ability to do so with “energy pods,” and at $13,000 a piece, it’s surprising that this perk is still being offered considering associates were the ones to ask for them, but apparently haven’t been using them.

Which firm is encouraging its associates to take naps at work? It’s White & Case, and [Francis Vasquez Jr.](https://www.whitecase.com/people/francis-vasquez-jr), the partner who worked with associates to bring these marvels of modern technology to the firm, has tried the napping pods out for himself. “It’s like ‘Wow, I’m refreshed,'” he said after using one of the pods before starting his day. Kudos to Vasquez and White & Case for attempting to assist its sleep-deprived associates with a brief respite at the office.

Here’s more information on the associate nappers from the [Am Law Daily](http://www.americanlawyer.com/top-stories/id=1202786349002/Napping-Pods-One-Firms-Solution-for-Tired-Lawyers?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=6):

The models White & Case bought are manufactured by MetroNaps, a New York-based company that sells “the world’s first chair designed for napping in the workplace,” as its website touts. Think of them as lounge chairs with a dome or “privacy visor.” You can listen to “relaxation rhythms” provided by the machine or drift off to your own tunes in cozy seclusion. After 20 minutes, the pod gently nudges you awake with vibrations and soft lights. …

Other businesses that use MetroNaps’ “corporate fatigue management solutions” include Google Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP. The company has been around for 10 years, but only “a handful” of law firms have been customers, said CEO Christopher Lindholst, who holds a master’s in business from Columbia University. The other law firms are small, he said, and he declined to provide their names. “It’s not been a significant vertical for us,” he said.

If your firm is unwilling to purchase a pod for $13,000, there are other options. For only $1,995 down and $160 a month, your office can lease a napping pod to help associates be more productive and feel more satisfied with their jobs.

Even though Biglaw firms seem like the perfect places to install “corporate fatigue management solutions” like energy pods, some partners don’t want to pay their associates for catching much-needed zzzs when they could be billing. While many Biglaw firms claim to fully support work/life balance initiatives, they’d rather associates do their life balancing — and sleeping — at home.

Has your firm installed napping pods? If not, do you think your firm allow you to be asleep on the job? Contact us via [email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com), text message (646-820-8477), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atlblog/), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/abovethelawblog/). Sleep tight (and don’t let the office bed bugs bite)!

Before I was a psychotherapist, I was a patient, and at some point in my time as a patient, I participated in group therapy, and witnessed an unsettling interaction. (Unsettling-interaction-witnessing occurs in groups, where you spend time watching people “work their stuff out” and often “work your stuff out” at the same time.)

A new group member, a 20-something, showed up for his first session with us, and like new members sometimes do, he presented as quiet and a bit deferential — eager to fit in, and above all, to please.

Eventually, the therapist leading the group went to Newbie directly, and asked how he was doing on his first day. He replied with some variant of “fine” and she probed further, asking if there was anyone in the room he felt drawn to, or perhaps shy to approach (this is typical group technique, designed to make the Newbie conscious of how he’s relating to others in the room.)

Newbie opted for the “drawn to” half of the question, probably aiming to sound upbeat rather than scared, and gestured towards an older guy sitting beside him.

“I guess I’m drawn to Joe. He seems like a father figure to me.”

To which, without a flicker of hesitation, Joe snapped under his breath (loud enough for everyone to hear): “I’m not your damn father.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Newbie winced, and he wasn’t alone. That was a chilly welcome, coming from a member of your new therapy group.

On the other hand, Joe’s statement was true — he wasn’t Newbie’s damn father. More to the point, he didn’t want to be, to judge from his reaction. That wasn’t Joe’s role. He didn’t sign up to parent Newbie in that therapy group; he was a member like anyone else, trying to make himself a bit less neurotic and maybe happier. It was Joe’s right to be there, in that room, for himself, taking care of himself. And maybe Newbie wasn’t the only one there longing for a father figure — maybe Joe could have used a father figure, too.

I realized at that moment that I’d been like Newbie in my first group, too — searching for a father (for reasons I won’t bore you with), and drawing close to folks I might have been better off shying away from.

There were larger implications: I’d done the same thing at workplaces, including at my law firm, with disastrous results.

A lot of lawyers make that mistake. After working as a therapist with lawyers for a dozen years or so, I can say plenty of attorneys confuse their law firm with a parent figure, then relate to the firm like eager-to-please children. It leads to hurt feelings, resentment, anger, and much unnecessary human misery.

The Supreme Court has been dominating headlines with a series of monumental decisions with implications for individual rights, state regulations, stare decisis, and more.  

The flurry of activity at the term’s end has included a strengthening of gun rights in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, a weakening of Miranda rights in Vega v. Tekoh, and an overruling of the abortion rights granted in the landmark Roe v. Wade case in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, among others. As the far-reaching impact of these and other decisions unfolds, practitioners should be aware of the latest developments and their implications. 

At PLI’s upcoming [24th Annual Supreme Court Review: October 2021 Term](https://www.pli.edu/programs/supreme-court-review?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) program, chaired by Dean Erwin Chemerinsky of UC Berkeley School of Law and Professor Martin A. Schwartz of Touro Law Center, a faculty of nationally recognized Supreme Court, constitutional law, and civil rights experts will analyze, discuss, and debate the major developments of the Supreme Court’s October 2021 Term. 

The one-day program will discuss vital constitutional questions, including:

- The validity of a state ban on pre-viability abortions
- Whether the Second Amendment protects the right to carry a gun in public
- Whether the state’s denial of tuition assistance for sectarian education violates the Establishment Clause
- Whether a high school football coach’s post-game prayer is protected by the First Amendment
- The constitutionality of the imposition of the death penalty in the Boston marathon bombing case. 
The program will cover a wide range of pressing legal issues, including First Amendment freedom of speech, EPA and OSHA rule-making authority, immigration, Section 1983 civil rights litigation, abortion rights, Second Amendment gun rights, Federal Governmental Power, Criminal Procedure, and more. 

Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the key Supreme Court decisions of the October 2021 Term, along with their current impact and the far-reaching effects they might have on existing precedent. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/supreme-court-review?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

Joe Borstein

Close your eyes and picture a magically perfect legal services market.

In this meritocratic legal-utopia, the best law firm (with the best legal talent, innovative technology, and processes/solutions) wins the work every time. Innovative upstarts take on (and take out) incumbents by taking risks and building a better mousetrap. Law firms clamor for tools that give them an edge (which, in turn, venture capitalists clamor to fund!). In the end, the best law firms (law companies and technologies) win, while clients’ rights and interests are optimally protected at the lowest possible cost… and we all live happily ever after.

Today, [Jae Um](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaesunum/) and I explore what such a world would look like!

Gears Make the World Go Round (Faster)

I asked Jae to help visualize a theory we are calling “The Gears of Commerce.” If you don’t know [Jae](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaesunum/), shame on you. She’s the newest [must-read](https://www.legalevolution.org/2018/05/legal-innovation-is-an-extreme-sport-51/) [influencer](https://www.legalevolution.org/2018/12/rx-for-data-dizziness-getting-started-with-data-requires-smarter-strategy-075/) in [legal](https://medium.com/@jaesunum/the-empire-strikes-back-and-2017-is-mostly-a-win-for-am-law-100-5df57b4651b3). While her [longform essays](https://www.legalevolution.org/2018/09/huge-true-microsofts-big-ideas-transform-legal-buy-069/) speak for themselves, I’ll add that she is also a true expert on all aspects of strategic marketing (from brand and positioning to sales and pricing).

We agreed that it’s not productive to blame Biglaw lawyers (who are [smart and hardworking](https://www.legalevolution.org/2018/06/big-law-partners-arent-dumb-theyre-just-not-in-the-room-054/)) for the slow pace of legal innovation. Rather, the frustrating pace of progress is a function of the systemwide inefficiency of all commercial activity in our industry which, unfortunately, is visualized below.

To solve these blockages, we need to ask smart questions about how that market actually works and how it can work better. What are the specific cogs and wheels that must click together and rotate in perfect synchronicity?

The Best of All Possible Worlds (With Fine Print, Of Course)

Back to our opening question. How would a more perfect legal market work?

Because both Jae and I are pragmatists, we constrained our thought experiment to reflect the current regulatory environment: (a) law firms remain protected as the only business entity authorized to practice law, and (b) lawyers maintain their monopoly on equity ownership of law firms.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here’s a simplified flowchart of our ideal state:



- CLIENT PROBLEM: clients approach leading law firms (the only organization in the United States who can practice law) with a legal problem, and seek proposals to solve it;
- VIRTUOUS CYCLE / SOLUTION DESIGN: law firms weigh the cost and benefits of various courses of action, and propose solutions;
- BUY BUILD OR PARTNER: these solutions would include both their legal expertise, AND best-in-class technology, outside services and financing, all of which would be designed to lower costs and risks, and improve legal outcomes;
- CLIENT-SIDE BUYING SOPHISTICATION: the law firm with the best proposal would be selected;
- FIRM-SIDE EXECUTION: Law firm would serve as general contractor, executing the proposed solution as promised;
- COMMERCIAL LOYALTY (NOT JUST <3): if the solution was successful, this strategy would please the client encouraging them to use the law firm more in the future, while also encouraging others clients;
- TRUTH IN ADVERTISING: the law firm would advertise their win, and have outsized odds of picking up more like clients;
- RIGOROUS REPORTING: the legal media would also pick up the innovative story and speed the adoption of the technologies, services and financing used by the law firm;
- SMART CAPITAL: venture capital and strategic buyers would increase investment and acquisition of similar solutions, making them better and better, faster and faster!
- RINSE & REPEAT: Well, you get the picture!
The Red Pill: The Real World We Occupy Today

Well, anyone who works at the intersection of law and innovation today knows we are far from this ideal state. In order to grease the gears of commerce, we first have to diagnose the barriers preventing the best of all possible worlds.

We identified three categories of barriers that slow the pace of innovation, each at different points in the go-to-market process: (1) being presented to buyers; (2) being adopted by a critical mass of clients, and; (3) being rewarded by the market.

Failure of Best Solutions Being Presented:

It’s the revenue, stupid!  The [legal innovation paradox](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/competition-is-for-losers-the-rise-of-atrium-part-i/) states clearly that solutions that make legal matters more efficient tend to reduce billable hours.

- Many innovations reduce the revenue Biglaw will generate on a given matter. Unless Biglaw partners believe they will be rewarded in other ways, this is a disincentive to innovation (think predictive coding for litigation or leveraging AI like [Kira](https://kirasystems.com/) or eBrevia for diligence).
- You can’t leverage what you don’t know! Most Biglaw attorneys have very little knowledge of the alt.legal landscape. Again, this is NOT because they are dumb or lazy (most are smart and hard working) but because they are busy! Few firms have influential chief innovation officers, or people in other influential roles to serve as trusted curators of institutional knowledge for best-in-breed innovations.
- How do you price it? Don’t forget that just a decade ago, nearly everything was handled internally by the law firm (copy fees anyone?). You can’t blame Biglaw partners for not knowing how to price the subcontracting of predictive coding technology or legal process outsourcing teams in ways that are fair and profitable.
Failure of Best Solutions Being Adopted:

Next, even if innovations are presented, there are barriers to adoption by clients.

- Have you tried contracting with a Fortune 500? [It’s hard… very hard… and very slow.](https://www.legalevolution.org/2018/08/legal-innovation-woes-part-ii-tbd-markets-mia-customers-063/) Often, a major company doesn’t want to try the newest thing at all. Surprised? [Geoffrey Moore of Crossing the Chasm](https://www.legalevolution.org/2018/06/playbook-for-innovation-magic-052/) tells us that only about 16 percent of people seek novelty; the rest of us prefer to shop for established, reliable products we know will work.
- Cost savings are not always a priority, and they’re certainly not the only priority. While “more for less” has been the rallying cry of corporate counsel since the Great Reset of 2009, legal procurement simply isn’t a one-size-fits-all proposition. For many big-ticket, high-consequence items, white shoe firms will tell you that their clients simply want [everything done perfectly](http://www.legalexecutiveinstitute.com/nyu-law-panels-legal-tech/), and that clients truly don’t care about cost. The latest [Altman Weil Chief Legal Officer Survey](http://www.altmanweil.com/AW111218/) tells us that the white shoe firms are neither dumb nor deluded in this view: CLOs indicated that nearly 25 percent of outside counsel fees are “price-insensitive.” (Consider that a typical bet-the-company litigation or major merger dwarfs even the astronomical fees of elite Biglaw firms to a rounding error.)
- There is often a light form of capture, where in-house counsel want to be brought back into Biglaw as a partner (or at least be invited to their sweet parties!). Indirectly or subliminally, some senior counsel do balance incentives between squeezing Biglaw for discounts and protecting the long-term relationship.
Failure of Best Solutions Being Rewarded:

Finally, if a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?

Biglaw partners correctly surmise that there will be little marketing, media or fanfare in response to innovative solutions — even better, cheaper, and faster results. Thus, there is no guarantee they will pick up new clients by being better (sad).

Furthermore, the bigger the matter, the less likely it is to recur — so the firm might not even get materially more work from THAT particular client.

Without a guarantee of effective and meaningful storytelling from the very top of the marketing funnel to the point of sale, the proposition is to perform all this extra work and take on all this extra risk… at the expense of current revenue!

In the current state, the primary pitfalls in the marketing cycle are:

- Advertising in legal doesn’t work well and is highly regulated!
- Media doesn’t always cover the HOW behind major innovation wins.
- Word of mouth is limited in legal and very, very slow.
Despite the ongoing and increasing interest in legal innovation as a whole, the aggregate volume of hype often results in meaningful signals getting lost in the noise.

So. What Do We Do About It?

As we enter 2019, it is my commitment to cover in these pages the lawyers, companies and innovators working to make these gears turn faster. Stay tuned, and thanks Jae!

The pressure on in-house legal professionals is higher now than ever, as they face pervasive, ongoing change.

Wolters Kluwer’s 2022 Future Ready Lawyer survey focuses on these unprecedented challenges — volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, or VUCA.

The conclusion? For today’s professionals, “future ready” means “VUCA ready.”

Join our expert panel on Oct. 20 at 1pm ET for a deep dive into specific steps law departments can take to come out on top in the next normal — along with what they hope to see at the upcoming ACC meeting.

You’ll learn:

- How to best address emerging challenges facing law departments – from compliance requirements to new competition to ESG complexities
- What our experts expect to focus on at the upcoming ACC meeting (and where you can come say hi if you’ll be attending)
- Tools available to law departments and how they can help you position for
a post-pandemic future
Scheduled Panel:
Bob Ambrogi, Legal Tech Journalist, Above The Law
Michele Alwin,  Associate Director, Product Management, Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory US

# 0.1 Time Entries Definitely Add Up
## Attorneys can implement a few strategies to make sure that all of the small tasks they complete are being properly recorded.

Most people who work at law firms have billable hour requirements under which an attorney needs to bill a set number of hours each year in order to meet expectations of management. Depending on the type of firm, an associate’s billable hour requirement might average around 1,900 to 1,950 hours a year, although some firms have requirements in the 1,800-hour range, and other law firms have billable-hour requirements that exceed 2,000 hours. Associates might need to scramble to bill the requisite number of hours, since billable hour requirements often require lawyers to bill around 40 hours a week, and we all know that associates need an hour or two a day for breaks and other nonbillable activity. Although it might not seem too important, small time entries can often be extremely important when meeting and exceeding billable hour requirements.

Most law firms bill clients in six-minute increments, so the smallest time entries of lawyers is usually 0.1 hour. This unit of time is typically reserved for emails, phone calls, or other tasks that do not take too much time to complete. It might be difficult to record all of the tasks that attorneys spend less than six minutes on throughout the day. This is because it might be hard to remember that the attorney completed such tasks, and it can take a minute or so to enter the time entry if the lawyer does not have a system that helps populate entries into timekeeping software. I’ll admit that I have probably missed out on recording small tasks over the course of my career since I either did not remember I completed the task or found it would be onerous to record the time entry for such a small amount of work.

However, if attorneys are more vigilant about the smaller tasks that they complete in a day, the small time entries can definitely add up. The first time I ever heard about this was as a summer associate. The firm at which I worked organized a seminar for the summers about how to write solid time entries and how to be efficient when entering time. To this day, I still write “evaluate” instead of “review” in time entries since a partner alleged that a client would much rather see that an attorney evaluated materials than reviewed documents.

A partner also explained that every task within reason should be billed as a 0.1 if is took less than six minutes to complete. The partner said that if associates have a handful of 0.1 entries over the course of the day that they make sure to enter, the time would eventually add up. This could even be the different between meeting or falling short of a billable hour expectation, or being eligible for a bonus since that law firm based bonuses on the number of hours worked.

Attorneys can implement a few strategies to make sure that all of the small tasks completed by a lawyer are being properly recorded. Perhaps the easiest way that small tasks can be recorded is by reviewing your email account at the end of the day to make sure that nothing is missed. An email account is a great way to reconstruct things that occurred during a business day, and the act of composing and reviewing email is recorded as billable time. By reviewing email each day, an attorney should be able to see if they missed billing a given task, and email messages, within reason, can themselves be recorded.

Evaluating phone records at the end of the day is also a great way to tease out tasks that might not be recorded when an attorney initially enters time for a day. Lawyers might receive dozens of calls a day from witnesses, investigators, other attorneys, and clients. All of these calls are usually considered billable time, but it might be difficult to record the call and the subject matter of each call contemporaneously throughout the day. However, reviewing call logs, voicemails, and the like can refresh a lawyer’s recollection and lead to billable time entries. Even short phone calls that only comprise 0.1 in billable time can add up and can help a lawyer meet billable hour expectations at a law firm.

All told, it is difficult for lawyers to meet billable hour requirements in some circumstances, and part of the reason for this is because lawyers sometimes do not record all of their time. However, by reviewing email accounts and call histories, and by ensuring that even smaller tasks are recorded, lawyers can make it easier to satisfy billable hour requirements.

# Navigating Your Performance Review
## Instead of viewing your performance review as something to be endured, take control of the process to the extent possible.

Bonus season is around the corner!  But first, associates need to make it through performance reviews.  Few people look forward to the review process.  Some find it stressful — after all, these can be complicated conversations.  Others may be tempted to dismiss it as pointless, considering that many firms award bonuses based primarily on class year and/or hours billed.  But even if you’re at a firm where performance reviews are not a critical compensation driver, you should treat the review process as a valuable opportunity to elicit helpful feedback.

Instead of viewing your performance review as something to be endured, take control of the process to the extent possible.  Put in the time to prepare fully, clarify the feedback you receive, and reflect on the implications for your broader career goals.

Prepare for the review conversation

It’s likely that your firm will ask you to do some form of self-evaluation ahead of the review process, but regardless of what is formally expected, preparation is critical to achieving a productive conversation.  Questions to ask yourself include:

- Did you make your hours?
- What sort of feedback have you gotten along the way?
- Did you have a trend line this year of improvement, or did you have the same problems all year?
- Did you successfully address the feedback you received in last year’s review?
Identify your weaknesses, and think about how to frame them constructively.  You want to go into the review conversation prepared to talk about what you learned and what you’ll do differently next time.  Demonstrating that you have a specific plan for future improvements helps your evaluator look past any bumps.

Ahead of the review, be sure to update your deal sheet or representative matters list!  In case you don’t already have a deal sheet, see how to make one [here](https://tinyurl.com/4y3chrxd).  Updating your deal sheet will help you review your work and prepare to discuss both victories and setbacks.  It’s too easy and too common for a supervisor to forget about things you thought were really important, so don’t rely on your reviewer to generate a comprehensive list.  Having your deal sheet at your fingertips will make sure you’re prepared to advocate for yourself.

Listen carefully and seek clarification

During the review conversation, remember to take notes as best you can.  You can’t expect to remember it all, especially if you’re anxious or you get feedback that surprises you.  Detailed notes will be helpful if you need to follow up on something later.  

Ideally, the feedback you receive will be specific and actionable, but it’s possible it will be generic and unhelpful.  If so, it’s on you to ask granular questions to elicit more precisely what the reviewer is talking about.  This applies to either positive or negative feedback, but it’s especially critical in situations where the reviewer is expressing concern about your performance.  Valuable questions to ask include:

- Am I on track for partnership?
- What do I need to do this year to get there/stay there?
- What specific skills would you like to see me acquire this year?
- Are there any weaknesses I need to shore up?
- Now that I’m a Xth-year associate, how do you see my role on deals in the coming year?  In mentoring juniors on our team?  In business development?
Ask for clarification, especially about critiques, but don’t be defensive.  Remember: “curious, not furious.”  Achieving this balance can be really challenging for us over-achieving lawyers.  You may find it helpful to practice reacting to feedback in advance, ensuring you enter the review conversation with some default responses.  [Ask A Manager](https://www.askamanager.org/2008/06/how-to-take-criticism-without-getting.html) has some great advice on this, as well as scripts for if you disagree with the criticism.  For example: “I’m glad you’re telling me this.  I’ve been letting some deadlines on this project slide because I had thought that projects x and z were higher priorities and was more focused there.  But am I looking at this wrong?”

Keep in mind that it’s perfectly acceptable to ask for a follow-up conversation!  You may find that you ask more effective questions after having had some time to gather your thoughts.  Ahead of the follow-up, draft a list of questions digging into the specifics of how the firm wants you to perform in the next year.

Reflect on your broader career trajectory

Although the review process is principally about your performance in your current role at your current firm, don’t forget to reflect on the bigger picture.  The end of the year is a great time to consider whether your firm remains the best setting to achieve your career goals.  Are you getting the work you want?  How do you feel about your professional development?  Have you found your people at this firm?  Are you content?

If not, keep in mind that other firms would be happy to have you.  I’d love to help you think through your options or connect you with one of my colleagues in your area.

Good luck!

# Are More Biglaw Firms Planning To Defer Their Incoming Associates?
## Biglaw firms aren't playing 'follow the leader' when it comes to associate deferrals... yet.

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Even the firms that have had layoffs have not followed the follow-the-leader path that we typically see in Big Law. In 2020, firms began delaying or shortening summer classes and this resulted in a slew of firms following suit. Right now, it’s been a drip-drip-drip of layoffs and deferments, which is very different than 2020 and the panic we saw during the recession of 2008/2009. Right now, it seems like it’s impacting some firms but not all of them.

— [Summer Eberhard](https://www.mlaglobal.com/en/people/summer-eberhard), a partner and legal recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/11/cooley-deferred-its-incoming-class-will-others-jump-on-the-bandwagon-or-hold-the-line/) on Cooley’s decision to [defer its incoming class of associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/) shortly after a [similar announcement](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-firm-lays-off-10-of-its-workforce-may-defer-incoming-associates/) that was made by Gunderson, and whether she thinks any other firms will make the same choice. “Given how low hours have been at many firms, I could see other firms making similar decisions to protect the utilization of the associates they have and to hopefully allow work to pick up to where there is enough work to go around come next year,” Eberhard cautioned.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Top Biglaw Firm Announces Raises And Special Bonuses For Associates
## Will any other Biglaw firms be willing to match these special bonuses?
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

Biglaw firms are continuing to spring into action when it comes to adopting the generous Cravath salary scale for associates. But what could possibly be better than a big salary increase? A salary increase with bonuses and a special bonus!

Hunton Andrews Kurth — a firm that landed at No. 61 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking, with $743,100,000 gross revenue in 2020 — recently announced that it would be increasing salaries for associates in line with Cravath’s new compensation grid. At the same time, associates also learned that they would be receiving bonuses on the Cravath scale. (If you’re wondering why the firm’s year-end bonuses are first being announced now, it’s because Hunton’s fiscal year runs from April to March.)

This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm:


But that’s not all, folks. Hunton has also announced a one-time special bonus for associates — and it looks awfully familiar. (Don’t forget, the firm [already adopted Davis Polk’s special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/hunton-special-bonuses/) last year, but pushed the second payment installment into April 2022 due to its fiscal year. This means that associates will be receiving a lot of money next month.)

Here’s what the firm’s brand new special bonus scale looks like:

Hunton Andrews Kurth is now the third firm to announce additional bonuses in 2022, making this an official trend. Will any other firms be willing to make a match here? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Hunton Andrews Kurth.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# No T14 Degree? No Peer Firm Work? No Problem! Biglaw Firms Change Hiring Criteria In 'White-Hot Market'
## Straying from tradition is opening up an entirely new talent pool for Biglaw firms.

Biglaw firms are doing everything they can to hire new associates in this super-competitive, post-COVID market, and to snatch top talent, some of them are expanding their searches outside of their traditional recruitment criteria. If you work in a sought-after corporate practice area but don’t have a degree from a top law school or have never worked at top Am Law firm, then it may be time to brush off your resume because opportunity apparently awaits.

“In the past, they would have easily gotten a rejection,” said Katherine Loanzon, New York-based managing director of Kinney Recruiting, in an interview with [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/some-law-firms-change-hiring-habits-in-hunt-for-associate-talent). “But now, because the talent is so tight, they’re getting a response. They’re getting hired.” Michelle Fivel, a partner at Major Lindsey & Africa, elaborated, saying, “The last time I saw this really happening to the degree that it’s happened was back before the last recession. Those are things that only happen when it’s a white-hot market—and it is a white-hot market right now.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Typically, Am Law 50 firms poach associate talent from peer firms. But over the last few months, associates from regional firms are getting scooped up by top firms. Those firms are primarily concentrated in corporate transactional groups like capital markets, financing and mergers and acquisitions, said Loanzon.

“It’s so unusual because in the past, its almost unheard of, and now it’s great for these associates who may never have had that opportunity to go to a global law firm,” Loanzon said. This is particularly true if they have the right experience in terms of M&A and capital markets, she said.

Firms are also straying from their T14 law school fanaticism as they expand into secondary market searches because a top law school in a smaller market isn’t necessarily one of the nation’s most elite. Just ask Jennifer Bluestein, chief talent officer at Perkins Coie, who says, “Somebody who took a scholarship and went to a lower ranked law school because they didn’t have the finances and didn’t want to take the risk of $120,000 in loans is still the same person had they gone to the more expensive T14 law school.” How nice that firms have finally come to this realization.

The pandemic has given some associates more freedom to work remotely, and now it’s giving others opportunities to work for global law firms. For those looking for a chance to hit it big, let’s hope this curve isn’t one that gets flattened.

# Biglaw Firm Makes Bonus Money Magically Appear For Associates
## Congrats on the bonus bucks!
By [Staci Zaretsky](https://abovethelaw.com/author/staci-zaretsky/)

It’s the most wonderful time of the year — and at Magic Circle firms, it’s also the most magical time of the year, because bonuses are out.

At Allen & Overy, the good news for associates is that their bonuses match the prevailing market rate that was set by Baker McKenzie last month. The firm brought in $2,672,969,000 gross revenue in 2021, putting it in 11th place on the 2022 Global 200 ranking, so it’s not exactly surprising that they’re willing to hand out generous bonuses to associates.

Here’s what the bonus scale looks like at the firm:

- Class of 2022: $15,000 (pro-rated)
- Class of 2021: $20,000
- Class of 2020: $30,000
- Class of 2019: $57,500
- Class of 2018: $75,000
- Class of 2017: $90,000
- Class of 2016: $105,000
- Class of 2015+: $115,000
Associates will see bonus bucks hit their bank accounts on January 16, 2023. Congratulations, everyone!

(Flip to the next page to see the memo from Allen & Overy.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Steps Up Its Support Of Working Parents
## It's rough out there for working parents. This Biglaw firm wants to help.

I’m not even a parent yet my social media timeline is clogged with working parents concerned with exactly what is happening for the 2020-21 academic year. COVID-19 is a real bitch, and school districts are struggling to balance the safety and educational goals of students, while frequently under economic threats from state governments that don’t want to admit the reality of a pandemic. It’s basically a mess, and parents are going to be pressed trying to juggle it all. And it’ll be even worse if the parents also have to balance a full-time job on top of it all.

At least one Biglaw firm sees the buzzsaw its employees with children are heading towards, and they want to do something about it. At Fenwick & West, they’re offering a series of new programs to support their employees as they try to tackle this impossible semester:

· Tutoring or Back-Up Care Stipend: Fenwick is providing up to $500 as a reimbursement stipend to Fenwick employees who are parents or legal guardians of children under the age of 18, to help defray some of the costs for tutoring or learning support or back-up childcare.

· Tutoring, Online Resources, Learning Pods: Partnering with Bright Horizons, parents who have enrolled will get a 20% discount on tutoring, schoolwork help and learning pods from the care provider’s partner vendors.

· Parent Support Workshops: They’re offering a Parent Support Workshop with a well-being coach and consultant to help parents create work-from-home health and well-being plans.

· Loaner laptops for students: While many school districts are providing students with technology tools for online learning, we can help bridge shortages for those families in financial need if our employees’ child’s district isn’t providing a needed technology resource.

· Parents Network: They’ve launched an internal Parents at Fenwick group, as an online forum for sharing resources and ideas and for connecting and providing peer support.

# The April Trial Of Dominion v. Fox
## The pundits assume the case will actually go to trial in April. But will it?

Everyone (except Fox News) is talking about the recent summary judgment papers filed in Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation case against Fox News. Fox News isn’t saying a word.

Although MSNBC expresses shock — shock! — that Fox isn’t talking, that’s really no surprise: Anyone with half a brain doesn’t talk about pending litigation. The hole is deep; anything more that Fox says will only make it deeper. Every lawyer — including the good ones that Fox has retained to defend the case — is certainly telling Fox to remain silent, and Fox is heeding that advice.

All of the pundits are also repeatedly describing the Dominion lawsuit as a “1.6 billion dollar” case, because Dominion’s prayer for relief in the complaint seeks $1.6 billion. Describing the case as one for “1.6 billion dollars” is, of course, idiocy. Plaintiffs can claim any number at all in their complaint; the demand is pure fiction. Plaintiffs can request “an amount in excess of the jurisdictional minimum of the court,” which is enough to establish jurisdiction without getting everyone all excited. Or plaintiffs can demand a million bucks, or a billion, or a trillion, or a quadrillion, or whatever comes next.

Dominion was clever to ask for a billion six; the number is huge, but small enough to sound as though it’s within the realm of reason, so the number gets repeated by the pundits. If Dominion had asked for a quintillion bucks (see? I really did know what came next), everyone would know the demand was fiction, and no one would repeat it. If Dominion had asked for a buck fifty, the demand would have been too low; it wouldn’t have been worth talking about. A billion six was a good choice.

But the billion six is the product of some lawyer’s imagination. If the case goes to trial, I’m confident that the amount of damages that Dominion suffered will be hotly contested, and I suspect that neither side will have evidence that precisely a billion six is the right number.

The pundits also assume the case will actually go to trial in April, as scheduled.  Maybe, maybe not. I’ve seen enough trials get postponed — because judges or lawyers or witnesses become unavailable — to know that trial dates are not set in stone.

There are, of course, reasons beyond scheduling to wonder whether the case will go to trial.

Naturally, Fox will try to settle this case. It seems as though Fox has not yet made any settlement offers, but that will change. After the summary judgment motions are decided, and as trial approaches, both sides’ knees will weaken, and settlement talks will begin.

Dominion, of course, would love to try the case: Look at the reputational damage Dominion could inflict on Fox! Look at the potential damage award! Look at the vindication! Look at the glory!

But then Fox will offer $200 million, or $300 million, or $400 million, and Dominion will start thinking, “Gee, $400 million is a lot of money. And we could lose at trial. Even if we win, the jury could decide that our actual damages were less than $400 million. And this case is pretty damned expensive to try. Maybe we should take $400 million.”

We’ll see how settlement talks progress.

On the other hand, Fox will also be sorely tempted to settle. I’m confident that Fox knows that it is facing big exposure at trial.

But Fox is facing other risks, too. Fox faces reputational risk: A trial will drag its name through the mud — day by day, for weeks on end — as each news cycle covers what prominent witnesses say at trial. And that’s just the witnesses’ testimony; I’m not yet thinking about the reputational damage inflicted by an adverse verdict.

Moreover, think about those witnesses who will be testifying. There will be widespread coverage on the days when Rupert Murdoch or Paul Ryan (a Fox director) testify. But how about the days when Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham are on the stand? This trial will put O.J.’s trial to shame! This will be the trial of the century, until some case against Trump begins.

Think how Hannity and the others feel about being forced to testify at trial. Do they really want to spend hours (or days) being cross-examined on the witness stand by hostile lawyers?  If those on-air personalities have clout with the muckety-mucks at Fox (and they do), the personalities will be begging Fox to settle at any price, to avoid the distraction, stress, and indignity of testifying.  We’ll see how the muckety-mucks react to that.

Lastly, however the defamation case against Fox plays out, the trial will disclose yet more incriminating evidence against the company. Some of that additional evidence is likely to be terribly damaging. For example, the board of directors of Fox owed its shareholders (a majority of whom are not named Murdoch) duties of care and loyalty. Murdoch has already testified that he could have stopped the network from broadcasting defamatory information about the 2020 election result, but he did not. Arguably, that’s a breach of the duty of care: If Murdoch knew that the network was broadcasting inaccurate defamatory information, and Murdoch had the ability to stop it, why didn’t he? If the trial causes Murdoch (or Ryan, or others) to speak more broadly about that subject, Fox could be paving the way for a shareholder derivative suit that could make Dominion’s demand for a billion six look like a walk in the park.

Maybe this case will go to trial in April.

But don’t hold your breath.

## * Will Chief Justice John Roberts be asked to testify before Congress for his role as the appointer of judges for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court?

[[National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/sites/nationallawjournal/2018/02/08/will-chief-justice-roberts-be-asked-to-testify-on-nunes-memo/)] * Quinn Emanuel's Bill Burck is representing two Trump administration rejects (Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus) and a current major player in the Trump administration (Don McGahn), all at the same time. The discussion about whether there's any conflict of interest here between Burck's triple-play is pretty interesting. [[American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/02/08/bannon-priebus-mcgahn-bill-burcks-white-house-client-juggle/)] * Sigfredo Garcia and Katherine Magbanua, who are both currently waiting to stand trial for the murder of Florida State Law Professor Dan Markel, are now facing some additional charges. The pair now face counts of conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder. We wonder when either of them will take a plea.

# Top Biglaw Firm Announces Big-Time Raises, Bonuses For Associates
## After all this time, this top firm is only the second one to offer supersized bonuses to its super-senior attorneys. Great news!

January is almost over and temperatures are cold, but Biglaw raises are still coming in hot.

We’ve now confirmed that WilmerHale — which reported $1,344,519,000 in gross revenue in 2022 according to the most recent Am Law 100 — has chosen to use the Cravath scale for its compensation increases, meaning these are the salaries associates at the firm will see, retroactive to January 1:

- Class of 2023 – $225,000
- Class of 2022 – $235,000
- Class of 2021 – $260,000
- Class of 2020 – $310,000
- Class of 2019 – $365,000
- Class of 2018 – $390,000
- Class of 2017 – $420,000
- Class of 2016+ – $435,000
WilmerHale is also matching the Cravath bonus scale. The firm reports that 40% of eligible attorneys are receiving above-market compensation thanks to its performance-based merit bonus program. This is what year-end bonuses will look like at the firm, to be paid next month:

- Class of 2023 – pro-rated
- Class of 2022 – $20,000
- Class of 2021 – $30,000
- Class of 2020 – $57,500
- Class of 2019 – $75,000
- Class of 2018 – $90,000
- Class of 2017 – $105,000
- Class of 2016 – $115,000
- Class of 2015+ – $125,000
Wilmer is now the second firm to offer more bonus cash to its most senior attorneys, coming in oh-so close to matching the $130K bonus that Ropes offered to its super seniors. Kudos!

Congratulations to everyone at WilmerHale!

# A Running List Of Lawyers And Law Firms Who Have Refused To Represent The President Of The United States
## Donald Trump has somehow turned POTUS into a dog of a client self-respecting lawyers do not want to touch.

This weekend, we learned that Joseph diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, [were conflicted out of representing Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/trump-digenova-toensing.html) in the ongoing investigation into his campaign and Russian interference. This inspired Trump to tweet out:

Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case…don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new……

….lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country – and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

Hmm… that doesn’t seem true to me. It’s not as demonstrably false as some of the president’s other tweets. But by the same token, Trump can’t really prove that there are a bunch of respected lawyers and law firms out there dying to work for him.

What we  do know is that many lawyers who Trump has reached out to have told him no. They’ve decided that representing the President of the United States — which is usually a sought-after, high-profile engagement — is something their résumé can do without.

Here’s a running list of law firms and attorneys who have decided they don’t want to represent the president. Please send a note to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) if there are firms that we’re missing or attorneys who have been approached that we just don’t know about. Here’s who we do know about:

- [Brendan Sullivan](https://www.wc.com/Profiles/Brendan-V-Sullivan), Williams & Connolly: Sullivan represented Oliver North after the Iran-Contra scandal, but won’t represent Donald Trump.
- [Paul Clement](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentID=230&itemId=12393), Kirkland & Ellis: Clement defended DOMA — the Defense of Marriage Act — and was a leading litigator in the constitutional challenges to Obamacare. But he won’t represent the leader of the Republican party.
- [Mark Filip](https://www.kirkland.com/sitecontent.cfm?contentId=220&itemid=9711&section=1), Kirkland & Ellis: Filip is a big-time white-collar defense lawyer who served as Deputy Attorney General in the George W. Bush administration. He was unwilling to return to government work to help defend the current president.
- [Robert Giuffra](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/RobertJ-GiuffraJr), Sullivan & Cromwell: Guiffra represents Volkswagon in its litigation about using devices to thwart clean-air standards, and defended UBS from disaffected Enron shareholders. Defending Trump’s financial dealings from Robert Mueller was apparently not something he wanted to do.
- [Emmet Flood](https://www.wc.com/Profiles/Emmet-T-Flood), Williams & Connolly: Emmet Flood represented Bill Clinton in his impeachment hearing. Of course, Clinton was impeached (just not convicted), and we know that Trump prefers soldiers who never captured.
- [Robert S. Bennett](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/robert-bennett), Hogan Lovells: Bennett represented Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones dispute. Seems relevant.
- [Theodore Olson](https://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyer/olson-theodore-b/), Gibson Dunn: Ted Olson represented George W. Bush in the Bush v. Gore case where the Supreme Court chose the American president. [And he wants no part of Trump](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/sources-report-ted-olson-will-not-be-joining-trump-team-or-bathing-in-raw-sewage-i-assume/).

Again, these are just the people we know Trump has reached out to, based on published reports in the press. Who knows how many lawyers have been quietly asked, either directly or through networks, if they’d be interested.

While it’s, frankly, hilarious to look at all the well-respected attorneys who don’t want to get Donald Trump all over them, there is potentially a deeper issue. If all the good attorneys — the ones with reputations to preserve and ethics to uphold — refuse to represent the president, what’s left are the “bad” attorneys. The ones who don’t have [the slightest idea what a moral and ethical principle is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09UceNTOXA0).

# Largest Law Firm In China Looks To Absorb Struggling American Firm
## CKR may be making a deal with a global behemoth.

[CKR Law](https://www.ckrlaw.com) has had a pretty bad couple of months. First, [cash flow problems came to light](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/global-law-firm-facing-cash-flow-problems-considering-terminating-partners/) that the firm claimed to be on top of, but tipsters have continued to report that partners have not been getting their full draws — some say for months — as the firm continues to lose attorneys seeking greener pastures. Then the firm [was sued for allegedly operating a “sexually hostile work environment](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-faces-allegations-of-a-sexually-hostile-work-environment/).”

While observers wondered if CKR would survive the summer, it appears they’ve been thrown a tentative lifeline. Whether or not the numbers ultimately work out remains to be seen.

CKR just announced that [Yingke](http://www.yingkeinternational.com), the largest China-based law firm, has agreed in principle to take on the firm and [create “YKR” a U.S. firm with around 10 offices](https://www.newswire.com/news/ckr-law-and-yingke-law-engaged-in-discussion-to-create-new-legal-20959916).

If Yingke really goes through with this verein-like deal, it would mark a significant contraction for CKR. The firm currently boasts around 20 U.S. offices and 31 foreign offices which are numbers considerably bigger than “10.” It’s unclear what would happen with all those attorneys in offices that miss out when Yingke partners with the rump of CKR. In any event, despite the rosy press release language, it’s hard to see this proposal as anything but a survival play for CKR, trying to secure an infusion of capital and a massive downsizing effort to get back on solid footing. It’s the kind of deal that makes it seem like those cash flow issues were a bigger deal than management officially claimed.

The deal is set to be finalized September 30th if due diligence doesn’t turn up any red flags. For those of us wondering if all the rumors coming out of CKR about a cash flow crisis were true, we’ll know if it really is a minor setback or a genuine existential firm crisis if Yingke pulls out of this in the Fall.

# Associate Bonus Watch: Moving The Goalposts?
## Some associates think the firm could have been clearer in its communications about bonus eligibility.

Moving the goalposts?

Earlier this week, [Paul Hastings](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/paul-hastings/) announced its 2015 associate bonuses. The bottom line: the firm paid market-level bonuses to qualifying associates, plus supplemental bonuses to certain high-achieving associates. The PH associates we’ve heard from expressed happiness with their individual amounts.

But there was a slight rub pertaining to bonus eligibility, as one PH source explained:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Bonuses are out. Market match, which is good. But [some folks] aren’t pleased with the way they raised the hours minimum.

For the past several years, the stated hours budget has been 2000 but they reduced it to 1950 to be bonus eligible. If you polled all the associates in the middle of 2015 on what was required to get a bonus, 100% would have said 1950. This year, they sent out a very vague memo in the fall that (among many other things) reiterated the 2000 hours expectation. That got associates confused, so they sent out another memo later on that, essentially [saying] nothing has changed.’

Well, this year they set bonus eligibility at 1990. I got a bonus and everybody else I’ve spoken with also did, but [I wonder whether some] associates got screwed by landing between 1950 and 1990. Everybody knows 2000 is fair by Biglaw standards, so I don’t think anybody would care at all if they had just said at or before the start of the year and in an unambiguous manner that they were going to strictly enforce the 2000-hour budget this year. Other firms have raised the minimum lately and given over a full year’s notice (e.g., [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/11/associate-bonus-watch-skadden-increases-its-minimum-hours-for-bonus-eligibility/)). Seems like common sense.

But a second source we contacted was much less troubled:

I agree that the firm could have been more transparent in its hours expectation — if you consistently deviate from a 2,000-hour expectation to 1,950, 1,950 understandably becomes the expectation in associates’ minds. That being said, I think anyone coming in between 1,950 and 1,990 hours (and I can’t imagine there were that many, given the firm’s busy year) was aware that they were taking *some* risk by doing so.

This sounds like a 1L Contracts question. If the document says bonus eligibility starts at 2000 hours but the firm has a pattern or practice of paying bonuses at the 1950 hours, which hours threshold controls?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
We did some digging and learned that, in one sense, “nothing has changed.” The firm has had a 2000-hour requirement for quite some time now, and it has also had a practice of adjusting that requirement at the end of the year to reflect lawyer productivity, whether the firm “made budget,” etc. In the past few years, that process happened to lead to an adjustment down to 1950; this year, because the firm was having such a strong year, the adjustment went down by less, to 1990. But the 2000-hour requirement and the methodology for adjustment have remained constant, so in that sense, “nothing has changed.”

Could the firm have communicated this more clearly? Perhaps. But one source explained to us that because of how busy the firm was, it didn’t expect many associates to have a problem hitting 2000 hours. Accordingly, it didn’t feel the need to spell out in the memo that the downward adjustment might be smaller or that associates should operate on the assumption of a 2000-hour requirement.

We understand that only a small number of associates, less than a dozen, were affected by the shift from 1950 to 1990 hours (and that these associates’ cases were individually reviewed and many got bonuses anyway). We also hear that even with the increased threshold, a significantly higher percentage of associates received bonuses this year compared to last year. And supplemental or discretionary bonuses were more generous this time around, going both to associates with high hours and associates with strong performance.

In the grand scheme of things, this is a pretty minor issue. Paul Hastings is still one of the most highly desirable Biglaw employers, with an [A-minus rating on the ATL Insider Survey](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/paul-hastings/) and lots of other industry recognition as a [great law firm to work for](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/the-best-law-firms-to-work-for-2015-2/) and a [top law firm for diversity](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/the-best-law-firms-for-diversity-2016/).

If you are lucky enough to work at Paul Hastings and have your heart set on a market-level bonus, though, just bill those 2000 hours. It’s possible that the firm might set the hours threshold below 2000 at the end of the year — but you don’t know ex ante that it will go lower or by how much, so better safe than sorry.

# Biglaw Firm Offers Big-Time Perk For Working Parents
## Less work with more pay? What could be better?

Returning to work after being on parental leave for a number of months can be a difficult process, especially for new parents employed at Biglaw firms. One firm is trying to make it a little easier for new parents who have to manage heavy workloads and billable hours requirements amid sleepless nights filled with diapering and feeding crying infants.

Gibson Dunn has created a new transition period policy that will allow new parents — even new parents who were already working on flex-time schedules — to scale back their hours without their pay suffering at the expense of easing back into work.

Yesterday afternoon, [Kenneth Doran](http://www.gibsondunn.com/lawyers/kdoran), the firm’s chairman and managing partner, detailed the new policy in an email sent to all U.S. associates and of counsel. Doran’s email is available in full on the next page. Here’s the policy in relevant part:

We recognize that in many cases it takes time to transition back into the full-time practice of law following a leave. As part of the Firm’s commitment to support attorneys during such transitions, we will relax our hours expectations for the first 3 months after returning from leave to 75% of targeted pace without any corresponding impact on compensation. This benefit will apply automatically to U.S. associates and of counsel who are the birth mothers and/or primary caregivers of a new baby, adopted child or foster child and are returning from an eligible leave. A similar benefit will apply to lawyers on flex time – i.e., they may work at 75% of their approved flex-time pace during this transition period. This new transition period policy is effective retroactively from the start of this compensation year (November 1, 2016).

This seems like it could be wonderful for new parents at Gibson Dunn, but the new policy will only be as wonderful as it sounds if the partners who work with new parents at the firm allow them to take full advantage of its benefits. We’ve heard from numerous sources across multiple Biglaw firms that while myriad work-life balance and transition policies like Gibson Dunn’s are offered to make parents’ lives easier, it’s nearly impossible to utilize them due to the demands of partners who assign them work.

That being said, we’d like to offer our congratulations to Gibson Dunn on its new transition period policy for working parents. This is a step in the right direction, and we’re sure attorneys at the firm will be very happy that such a policy now exists.

# Fired Kirkland Associates Alleges Gender Discrimination In Federal Lawsuit
## The firm denies the allegations.

The world’s richest law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, along with 5 of its current/former partners — Adam R. Alper, Michael W. DeVries, Akshay S. Deoras, Leslie M. Schmidt, and Mark D. Fahey — are named defendants in a gender discrimination lawsuit filed last week. The[ federal complaint](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/vAlperetalDocketNo322cv05990NDCalOct112022CourtDocket?1666022268), filed in the northern District of California by former Intellectual Property associate Zoya Kovalenko, alleges gender discrimination and retaliation.

As [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/kirkland-ellis-female-ex-associate-accuses-firm-of-sex-bias) Bloomberg Law, Kovalenko says her 10-month stint at the firm was mired by preferential treatment for male associates:

The discriminatory practices included overloading Kovalenko with work relative to male IP associates, the suit says. Kovalenko was also paid less than comparable male associates, forced to work during planned time off so male associates could enjoy vacations, and saw male associates praised for their performance while the efforts of herself and other female associates didn’t draw the same praise, the suit says.

The sex bias in Kirkland & Ellis’ IP litigation practice group was evidenced by the “alarmingly high turnover of female associates relative to male associates,” Kovalenko says. She is aware of at least seven female associates who left the firm during her tenure but is aware of just one male associate who did so, Kovalenko says.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Kovalenko was reportedly in “total shock” after being fired during her first performance review at the firm. The complaint further alleges her performance reviews were “completely fabricated statements” that were defamatory and impacted her “livelihood and professional reputation.”

“Defendants’ publication was malicious, intentional, willful and done with callous disregard for the foreseeable injury and damage to plaintiff’s professional career, reputation, and livelihood and to foreseeable collateral damage to third parties who are close with plaintiff,” according to the complaint. “Defendants’ defamation of plaintiff caused and has continued to cause plaintiff severe emotional, psychological, and physical harm and injury.”

In a statement about the lawsuit, Kovalenko, who is representing herself, [pointed to the importance](https://www.law360.com/articles/1539087) of holding lawyers accountable:

“It is also important that individuals who hold positions of power and influence are held accountable and do not think they are above reproach,” Kovalenko said. “This is especially true for attorneys who are supposed to serve as agents of integrity and justice and relatedly to multinational law firms, such as Kirkland, that have a large impact on society.”

Through a spokesperson the firm denied the allegations in the complaint and indicated Kovalenko’s work was “below the standards that the firm expects of its associates.”

“The allegations in question were investigated and found to be entirely without merit,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “To the contrary, the attorneys named as defendants and unfairly targeted are known for their integrity and commitment to mentorship.”

# Cravath Returns To The 2021 Bonus Scene To Put Its Seal Of Approval On Davis Polk Special Bonuses
## Get ready for *all* bonus matches to include special bonuses now, too!

Guess what, associates? Cravath is back with another bonus announcement, and this time, the firm is making a match of its own. Year-end bonus totals are going up, up, up at the firm that [first announced its numbers](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) because Davis Polk’s special bonuses are now on the table.

In case you’ve somehow forgotten, here’s what the special bonus scale looks like:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Now that Cravath has officially signed off on these special bonuses, we can surely expect all the other firms that matched prior to the Davis Polk announcement — firms like Cleary; Boies Schiller; Cadwalader; Fried Frank; DLA Piper; Cohen Ziffer; Glenn Agre; Holwell Shuster; Mayer Brown; and Hogan Lovells — and all firms that have yet to announce bonuses, to issue their own special bonus matches as well.

Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Cravath.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# From Biglaw To The Classroom: This Former Magic Circle Attorney Just Won Teacher Of The Year

There is no question that Biglaw can set you up with a lot of money. But that’s not all — somewhere in between meeting client demands and hitting billable hours, the process can create some very capable lawyers. Take Clifford Chance, the Magic Circle firm that grossed $2,711,508,000 in 2021 and placed 9th on the 2022 Global 200 ranking. Turns out the firm produces more than just earnings for its clients. It also trained one hell of a teacher. From[ Legal Cheek](https://www.legalcheek.com/2023/06/former-magic-circle-lawyer-crowned-law-teacher-of-the-year/):

Sadie Whittam, a practicing solicitor and director of clinical legal education at Lancaster University Law School, received the coveted award last week at the Celebrating Excellence in Law Teaching conference in London.
…
She was nominated by two colleagues who described her as an “exceptional, talented and gifted educator”. Their nominations were largely based on student feedback, with one student saying: “She is the best teacher I have ever had, and she has forever become my mentor. Her involvement and ideas for […] workshops and assessments are out of this planet.”

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The award, offered by Oxford University Press, is far from a participation trophy. She was one of five finalists and, while I am sure that they too were amazing, it is hard to beat a professor that boasted a 100% satisfaction rate for her 2021-2022 clinical law program. You know how hard it is to please everybody — especially when the group in agreeance is a bunch of would-be lawyers?  And to do so on your 5th year of teaching? That’s an achievement any law professor should be able to take notes from. Thankfully, she’s done everyone the kindness of sharing a bit of how she approaches her lessons in the [school’s press release](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/law/news/lancaster-university-law-lecturer-awarded-prestigious-teaching-accolade).

“I use various techniques to help students understand difficult material,” she adds, “from student participation in a simulated mediation and advocacy in our mock courtroom, to running class quizzes and inviting guest speakers, to developing a partnership with a local newspaper so that students can have their work published in a legal column. I care very much about my students’ whole lives and careers – not just their law school education.”

If you thought being cold called was pressure, imagine your mom seeing your ramblings on common law posted in the paper. Maybe that would have gotten me to pay a little more attention in torts. Hopefully this study technique doesn’t cross the pond — journal is stressful enough.

Whether it is [TikTok stardom](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/looking-for-a-cool-jd-advantage-gig-have-you-considered-tiktok/), teaching, or [traffic court](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/former-biglaw-partner-caught-doing-long-stint-in-traffic-court-at-the-bench-because-hes-a-judge-there-now/), it is always a nice chance of pace to read about the folks that find the courage to try their hands at public service or a passion.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Are Biglaw Associates Billing Themselves To The Brink Of Exhaustion For Subpar Bonuses?
## Bonuses are coming... but they might not be big enough.

It’s been almost one week since Baker McKenzie [unexpectedly kicked off Biglaw’s 2020 bonus season](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/breaking-biglaw-bonus-season-comes-early-and-no-its-not-cravath/), and the announcement has been met with crickets. To be honest, no one thought Baker of all firms would be the one to make the first move, and based on associates’ responses to our [annual bonus and billable hours survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/11/biglaw-bonus-season-is-here-but-which-firm-will-make-the-first-move/), no one really thought this year’s bonus scale would be announced as early as it was due to the ongoing pandemic. Thirty-four percent of our respondents think a big bonus announcement will drop sometime this week, while 33 percent think it will come next week. As a reminder, last year, bonuses were announced on [November 7](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/11/breaking-biglaw-bonuses-are-here/), and the year before that, bonuses were announced [just before Thanksgiving](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/breaking-cravath-announces-annual-bonuses/), in the second to last week of November.

When do you think 2020 bonuses will be announced?

- Next week (Nov. 16 - 20) (34%, 116 Votes)
- Last full week of November (Nov. 23 - 27) (33%, 112 Votes)
- First week of December (Nov. 30 - Dec. 4) (22%, 76 Votes)
- This week (Nov. 9 - 13) (10%, 34 Votes)

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Based on past precedent, it seems much more likely that if Cravath is the first firm to announce after Baker McKenzie, bonuses should be expected on either Monday, November 23 or Monday, November 30. This seems really far away, but Cravath tends to stick a schedule as far as these things are concerned, and in recent years, it has announced its bonus news on either the last Monday in November or the first Monday in the first week of December (this year, the first Monday in the first week of December is… November 30, oops). But with Milbank in the mix, it’s really hard to say what will happen. The firm announced last year’s bonus scale on the first Thursday of November and it announced the [$190K salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) on the first Monday of June back in 2018. The firm seems to like to announce things during the first week of the month, and that’s already come and gone. Unfortunately, there may no rhyme or reason when it comes to the rest of this year’s big bonus announcements.

While associates are busy counting down the hours until Bonus Day, they’re likely even busier counting up the hours they’re on track to bill in 2020 to meet their targets for bonus eligibility. Just how much are associates expected to bill during a worldwide health crisis? The answer is: still quite a lot. About 66 percent of our survey respondents are on track to bill 2000 hours or more (much more, actually) in 2020.

Here are the full results from our survey:

How many hours are you on track to bill in 2020?

- More than 2400 (18%, 143 Votes)
- 2000 - 2099 (17%, 137 Votes)
- 2100 - 2199 (14%, 110 Votes)
- 1900 - 1999 (11%, 83 Votes)
- 2200 - 2299 (10%, 76 Votes)
- 1800 - 1899 (9%, 69 Votes)

- 2300 - 2399 (7%, 54 Votes)

Remember these strong numbers when bonuses begin to hit bank accounts. You may have worked your Biglaw bums off, but 80 percent of survey respondents thought that this year’s bonuses would be no different than last year’s bonuses, not including COVID bonuses — and they were right. Baker McKenzie’s bonus scale is last year’s bonus scale, and no mention of additional bonuses in light of the coronavirus crisis was made. [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) set the standard on those bonuses, which ranged from $7,500 to $40,000. Keep this in mind, associates (and Biglaw management): If 2020’s year-end bonuses are the exact same as 2019’s year-end bonuses, total bonus compensation in 2020 will be substantially lower, since associates at many high-end firms also received appreciation bonuses in generous amounts earlier this fall.

Either way, Biglaw associates can soon look forward to their bank accounts being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkeys they’ll gobble down next week.

As a little reminder, we love covering the Biglaw bonus season, but we need your help. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file.

Don’t forget, if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please enter your email address in the box below. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish — including, of course, the first such announcement.

# This Top 50 Law School Dean Is Also Of Counsel At A Top Biglaw Firm
## That’s some side hustle.

Serving as the dean of a top law school can be an immeasurably difficult job, but for some, it’s just not enough. Some are looking for a little more of a challenge. But what could possibly be more challenging than working as a law school dean? Working as a top law school dean while advising as of counsel to a top Biglaw firm, all at the same time.

This is the challenge that Dean [A. Benjamin Spencer](https://law2.wm.edu/faculty/bios/fulltime/spencer.php) of William & Mary Law School recently welcomed to his life when he accepted an of counsel role at McGuireWoods, a firm that brought in $977,373,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 52 on the most recent Am Law 100.

Spencer, a noted civil procedure scholar, will work part-time in the firm’s business and securities litigation department while at the same time working on learning initiatives and client development opportunities — and he’ll do all this while fulfilling his full-time duties as the dean of the top 50 law school. Did we mention that Spencer also serves as a major in the U.S. Army Reserve Judge Advocate General’s Corps? Phew, this is one busy law school dean!

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
So, why has Spencer taken on all of these additional roles? In an interview with [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/09/20/william-mary-law-dean-has-a-new-side-gig-of-counsel-at-mcguirewoods/), he explained that he went to law school to practice law. “Being able to provide advocacy and sound counsel for those who need it is what being a lawyer is all about, and I am a lawyer through and through,” he said.

An of-counsel work arrangement like this is actually quite rare for a law school dean. [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/09/20/william-mary-law-dean-has-a-new-side-gig-of-counsel-at-mcguirewoods/) spoke to Jim Rosenblatt, dean emeritus of Mississippi College School of Law and creator of Rosenblatt’s Deans Database, for more insights on this unique situation:

“Serving ‘of counsel’ to a law firm is unusual for a dean,” Rosenblatt … told Law.com. “I am of the opinion that most law school deans would say there was not room on their plate for such an arrangement.”

“There are clearly advantages to the law school as well, particularly with regard to career services and development and the contacts and relationships the arrangement will bring to the law school,” Rosenblatt said. “It also enhances the reputation and regard for the law school dean.”

Spencer downplayed the situation, telling [Law.com](https://www.law.com/2023/09/20/william-mary-law-dean-has-a-new-side-gig-of-counsel-at-mcguirewoods/) that “[t]he work with McGuireWoods involves only a couple hours (no more than four) each week of consultative and advisory services.” He continued, offering that “[i]t is not an employee-employer relationship or a part-time job as is the case with Army Reserve service.”

As for McGuireWoods, the firm is simply “delighted” about Spencer’s affiliation. Managing partner [Tracy Walker](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/people/w/j-tracy-walker-iv) referred to the dean as a “gifted lawyer and a wise and thoughtful leader,” and went on to note that McGuireWoods and its clients will “benefit mightily from his counsel.”

Congratulations and best of luck to Dean A. Benjamin Spencer!

# Netflix Has It Right With Firm Values -- Does Your Law Firm?

Netflix has one of the coolest statements of values I have ever seen. About 100 pages long but only a few words on each page. They start out:

Many companies have nice sounding value statements displayed in the lobby, such as:

Integrity

Communication

Respect

Excellence

Enron, whose leaders went to jail, and which went bankrupt from fraud, had these values displayed in their lobby:

Integrity

Communication

Respect

Excellence

The actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go.

Actual company values are the behaviors and skills that are valued in fellow employees

At Netflix, we particularly value the following nine behaviors and skills in our colleagues … meaning we hire and promote people who demonstrate these nine.

Pretty cool stuff isn’t it? It is a dramatic and powerful call to action.

As you read this, consider your law firm. Does it have cool values? I bet it does somewhere.

But — and this is a big but (so to speak) — does your law firm do what Netflix is trying to do? Meaning really hiring and promoting based on these values?

If so — you probably are in a great law firm.

If not — I wonder how it makes you feel when leadership is trumpeting values that are simply not being followed?

Well, I don’t need to wonder. Of course I know exactly how you feel. Disillusioned at best and angry at worst and most likely not really bought into that law firm.

My view is that it is better — much better — to have no values at all than to espouse values that are ignored when it counts.

For example, does your law firm say that teamwork and collegiality are critical but at the end of the year all that goes into compensation is cold hard hours and origination credit for client work?

I mean, at such a law firm, if teamwork and collegiality are so critical why are they then ignored in compensation?

Or, does your law firm really mean it and essentially penalize those who are not into the team or collegiality or over-reward those who are?

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Notably, it gets even worse for law firm management if it espouses values that are not followed. This is because people assume that if management is essentially lying — yes, it is lying — about something this fundamental, then management is probably lying about other things.

And if you think about it more, there is no reason to stay at such a firm other than the cold hard cash they are paying you. And if someone offers more you might as well just take it, right?

In this age where attracting and retaining talent is so important, management should really think about this kind of thing.

To conclude, management of a well-run law firm should assess values in the following manner:

First — determine what are the values? I mean the real, true values. Don’t lie to  yourself, as everyone will figure it out. If you are really truly in business to make a sh*tload of money, it is not illegal to do that, and it is a possible business model.  And that — ruthless — environment might be excellent for some types of lawyers.  But if that is what you are really about, then be true to it, as opposed to mouthing fake platitudes about caring about people and society.

Second — when you figure out your values — make sure you do what Netflix does: namely, promote and hire and fire based on those values.

Third — make clear to everyone exactly what you are doing — be completely transparent about it.

I must say that during my — now very long — career, I have worked for different kinds of law firms. I remember that one of them told me how wonderful their values were but when tested didn’t follow those values. The other one told me up front it wasn’t a nice place, and it wasn’t nice at all. I must say I liked the latter a lot better than the former.

Our firm has some cool values — among others:

Do the right thing even when it hurts.

I hope and pray that we follow these values punctiliously at all times.

# Simpson Thacher Finally Announces Its New Salary Scale
## Many people hoped this firm would beat the new market scale for Biglaw salaries. Were their prayers answered?

Back in October, when salary raises for Biglaw associates’ base salaries were nothing more than a dream, we wondered whether Simpson Thacher & Barlett would once again be the firm to step up and [raise base salaries to $190,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/10/ny-to-190k-which-firm-may-be-raising-first-year-salaries/). After all, Simpson Thacher raised market salaries from $145,000 to $160,000 on January 22, 2007, and all other firms quickly followed. STB has always been a market leader, and as recently as 2014, bucked trend and announced [generous year-end bonuses first](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/11/bonus-season-comes-early-and-its-not-cravath/) instead of waiting for Cravath, as was standard industry practice.

Now that Cravath has set the new market rate for associate salaries starting at $180,000, we’ve been waiting with some anticipation to see what Simpson Thacher had up its sleeve. In a recent poll, 44 percent of our readers thought that another firm may dare to beat Cravath’s $180K salary scale, and [raise the pay scale to $190K](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). For those of you who’d hoped that Simpson Thacher would be the firm to do so, we’ve got some bad news.

As of approximately 11:15 a.m., Simpson Thacher & Barlett has matched the [Cravath salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/?rf=1). Associates were notified of the match via email from [William Dougherty](http://www.stblaw.com/our-team/news/william-r-dougherty), chairman of the firm’s executive committee. This market leader now seems to be a follower — though we’re sure associates at the firm don’t mind, what with all of the extra cash that’s soon to be padding their bank accounts. It’s also worth noting that STB will offering “proportionate salary increases” to all English law qualified associates in the firm’s London office who are currently receiving sterling-based salaries.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Earlier today, we’d wondered what firms would be doing to compensate their summer associates. [Paul Weiss started a trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/ny-to-180k-the-raises-spread-to-summer-associates/) that was quickly [followed by Cleary Gottlieb](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/cleary-gottlieb-matches-cravath-scale-or-maybe-beats-it/), and it looks like Simpson Thacher has joined in as well. Summer associates received the following email from Bill Dougherty this morning:

Dear Summer Associate Class of 2016,

Earlier today, salary increases were announced for our associates as of July 1st. Your weekly salary will also be increased to $3,500 as of July 1st.

On behalf of the partners of the Firm, I hope that your summer experience has been productive and satisfying so far.

Bill Dougherty

With three large firms now leading the charge on summer associate on a $180K base for summer associate pay, it looks like a new market has been set. We suspect many large law firms will soon make similar announcements.

Congratulations to all Simpson Thacher associates and summer associates. Just because STB didn’t raise the bar to $190,000, it doesn’t mean the firm won’t be offering incredibly generous bonuses this winter.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

[Doom and gloom](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/performance-improvement-plans-the-new-way-for-biglaw-firms-to-conduct-stealth-layoffs/) in Biglaw might be [the trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/goodwin-is-conducting-performance-reviews-that-have-resulted-in-job-cuts/) that [industry observers](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/biglaw-associates-are-growing-increasingly-worried-about-layoffs/) are loving right now — after all, who doesn’t love a good fear-click? — but not every Biglaw firm is looking to [make cuts](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/another-top-50-am-law-firm-cuts-its-global-work-force/). Sure, [some big firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/top-50-am-law-firms-leader-explains-his-decision-on-layoffs-deferrals-amid-turbulent-economy/) (particularly those that are tech heavy or are[ overloaded](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/fenwick-deferral-associates-corporate-technology/) on M&A) are [cutting associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/biglaw-dechert-overhiring-layoffs/) or delaying the [start date](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/orrick-layoffs-deferral/) of the[ class of 2023](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/after-layoffs-last-year-cooley-delays-start-date-for-first-year-associates/). Those aren’t great signs — and they certainly[ have the ring of 2008](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/is-this-deja-vu-all-over-again/) aka, the Great Recession. Hence, the negative Nancys predicting more cuts on the horizon.

But unlike the Great Recession, these slashes to overhead were more of a trickle than the 2009 tsunami of bad news. Another key difference? A lot fewer firms are participating in the cuts. Indeed, some are zigging while others are zagging and hiring *more* folks despite the “industry trends.”

Take a look at a recent Paul, Weiss social media post. [On LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/paul-weiss-rifkind-wharton-&-garrison-llp/), the Biglaw firm is advertising they’re still hiring junior associates (Class of 2023) for their corporate department.

# World's Largest Law Firm To Mandate Vaccines In The United States
## Mega firm is updating their office reopening plan.

With over 10,000 attorneys and 190 offices across 77 countries, it is fair to say that Dentons is a pretty big law firm. But, just like everyone else, the leadership of the firm is trying to figure out how to respond to the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. Towards that end, the firm has rolled out an amended reopening plan.

The firm is doing a few things in response to the Delta variant: the firm’s U.S. reopening launch (when people were expected to be in the office on a “more regular” basis) has been pushed back from September 13th, though a new date has not been selected. Furthermore, starting September 7th, all people entering a Dentons U.S. office — employees, clients, vendors — must be vaccinated. The firm had a confidential portal set up for folks to upload their vax cards.

The full memo from Dentons is available [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/dentons-vaccination/2/)

Will your firm be changing its plans when it comes to vaccination for attorneys and staff thanks to the Delta variant? Please let us know. What about your firm’s reopening plan? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to the office.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# LegalZoom Is Coming For Your Lunch
## The online behemoth has been authorized to dispense legal advice in Arizona and Utah.

Stuff is getting real down here in Arizona. Last year, Arizona’s Supreme Court approved a new Alternative Business Structure (ABS) framework, which permits companies other than law firms to apply for the right to provide legal advice. The goal is to allow new players into the space to increase the public’s access to legal services. These changes have opened the door to a laboratory for some potentially wild experimentation.

A few small ABS entities have been approved to date, but the first major new player has now arrived on the scene. LegalZoom, flush with cash following its IPO back in June, has [been approved ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/legalzoom-gets-green-light-for-arizona-non-lawyer-owned-services)to run an ABS in Arizona. It will be permitted to hire attorneys to practice law despite not being a formal law firm.

One would think that facing a new competitor with a multibillion-dollar market cap would give most law firm managers pause. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. Whether right or wrong, the perception among many in Biglaw is that LegalZoom may not be able to provide the quality of service needed to compete at the top end of the field. In the eyes of many firm lawyers, LegalZoom provides mass market, dollar-store-level work, while Biglaw remains the exclusive provider of high end, bespoke, sophisticated work.

A steakhouse owner doesn’t worry their business will get hurt when a McDonald’s opens down the street, even though they both sell beef.

Nothing to worry about, right?

If You’re Not Worried, You’re Not Paying Attention

If only it were that simple. There are several reasons why a knee-jerk dismissal of LegalZoom’s latest move is a mistake — and a missed opportunity.

It’s rarely smart to bet against a motivated, entrepreneurial, cash-rich competitor, and trends in the legal industry overall may point toward a bright future for LegalZoom and similar alternative providers. How much comfort are we as attorneys really supposed to take in the argument that LegalZoom is targeting a different market than we are, and so we shouldn’t worry about them? That argument admits as its premise that there’s a massively underserved market segment that traditional law firms have not tapped. LegalZoom has been successfully targeting that market for two decades, and just got the greenlight to offer more and better services to people who previously had no economical options. Why are we supposed to take refuge in the notion we’re ceding potentially billions of dollars of market share to a competitor who’s already sitting on a dragon-size hoard of cash?

Biglaw may also be underestimating the power of packaging. LegalZoom has figured out how to sell legal services in a way that appeals to the consumer. I’ve written previously about [productizing legal services](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/02/what-productizing-means-to-your-law-firm/?rf=1), and how crucial it will be for firms looking to compete in the 2020s and beyond. In a nutshell, productizing is the process of taking a broad, amorphous service and converting it to a recognizable, predictable product that can be sold to a broad market. To stick with the McDonald’s theme, a hamburger is a broad concept that can be made a thousand ways; a Big Mac is a product.

Clients love productized legal services. Bespoke lawyering is time-consuming and costly. Worse yet, those costs are unpredictable. Some months they might be high, some months they might be really high. With productized legal services, costs are perceived as more predictable, and thus easier for clients purchasing those products to sell to their own internal clients and stakeholders. Even if the productized legal services are more expensive, the predictability of that expense is worth its weight in gold.

Productized legal services are already well-established in market segments like trusts and estates, in no small part due to companies like LegalZoom. I’ve argued before that law firms looking to stay competitive need to work on standardizing and productizing their services ASAP, because the appetite for productized services is everywhere. LegalZoom already has the experience and resources to meet that client demand, and now it also has the regulatory greenlight to make its play. There’s every reason to think they’re building better mousetraps as we speak.

Even Warren Buffett eats a Big Mac now and again.

Beating LegalZoom At Its Own Game

So what are law firm managers supposed to do to head off this wealthy, experienced, potentially game-changing competitor? They beat it at its own game. Instead of letting LegalZoom gobble up the underserved bottom and middle of the market on its way to competing at the top, smart firms will find ways to seize that market themselves.

Law firms remain the most trusted source of legal services, in part because we had decades as the only source of legal services but also because we pride ourselves on quality. Let’s tap that trust and get ahead of the game on productizing our services so we can bring that quality and reputation to the masses — and make a pile of money while we’re at it.

But what about our existing clients? They’ll flee if they think we represent clients other than the most elite, right? A Biglaw firm’s brand and image could be destroyed if it expands to serve a new, middle-market, or emerging business client base. The very fabric of the firm will be torn apart — leading to the inevitable and near-certain implosion of the firm. How could any rational firm think about evolving its business model given these dire consequences?

Lawyers love to catastrophize and find ways to not take risks or advance the business model. It’s precisely this mentality that allows businesses like LegalZoom to have a field day. I don’t mean to be overly blunt: we as lawyers need to get over ourselves. Even the storied Goldman Sachs, known for catering to the uber elite, has launched an online consumer-focused brand, [Marcus](https://www.marcus.com/us/en).

Goldman realizes that to expand into the future, it needs to find new ways to gain market share. Although Goldman is still investing in building Marcus, it’s baby brand racked up [$100 billion in deposits](https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2021/goldman-sachs-marcus-deposits-at-97-billion-as-2020-ends/) by the end of last year. No doubt in part because of the bet it’s making on the future, Goldman’s stock has also been [the highest performing in the Dow in 2021](http://www.dailystockmarkets.com/best-and-worst-performing-dow-jones-djia-stocks-in-2021-as-of-august-25/). We as lawyers like to think of ourselves as special, and we fear change, but Goldman shows us that you can expand to new markets while still preserving your brand.

And to those Biglaw firms that don’t care about expansion and just want to cling to what they have, I’d say that embracing new ways of operating and delivering legal services is necessary for that, as well. It wasn’t that long ago that high-end retailers like Neiman Marcus, Lucky Brand, and Brooks Brothers doubled down on their traditional brick-and-mortar model believing that their high-class customers would never debase themselves by ordering from Amazon. All went bankrupt.

The battle between Biglaw and alternative legal service providers is raging, but many refuse to acknowledge that it’s even begun. We need to treat this new front opening in Arizona and Utah as a preview of what the rest of the nation will be experiencing in the coming decade. When LegalZoom and its kind come to your state, they’ll have the groundwork laid and experience necessary to make a play for even your most seemingly reliable clients. They’ll be ready for the fight when it comes to your backyard. Will you?

They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Law Firms Versus Corporations: What Counts As Work

Is this work?

At a law firm, you know what counts as work.

Legal research, drafting a brief, taking a deposition, attending a client meeting, arguing an appeal.

You know:  Work.

Productive stuff.  That moves the ball.  For which you can ask a client to pay.

There’s a word for other things that you do during the day:  Vacation.

Well . . . not exactly vacation.  At most firms, you can write down all the other stuff under some nonbillable category.  At the end of the year, it wasn’t billable time, so you might as well have been on vacation.  But the firm let you feel better about that time because you recorded it on a timesheet.

What’s weird about corporations is that the other stuff counts as work.

I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s true:  You get paid for doing the other stuff.

People think it matters.

Like face-to-face meetings with people in other offices.  You’re out in Los Angeles.  You work for a day.  And then you spend an extra day, just chatting with people on your team, or in the business, or whatever.  Chatting with them for no particular purpose.  You’re just showing your face to folks on your team, or meeting folks in the business; you ask people how it’s going and shoot the breeze for a while.

Honest to God, you get paid for this.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Some folks make special trips solely for the purpose of showing the flag around the world.

This is considered to be work.

You spend four hours in a “performance calibration” session, designed to ensure that you use the same general definition of a “3” for everyone whose performance was rated a “3” in the law department.

They don’t do that at law firms.  They don’t formally rate people.  They surely don’t hold meetings to ensure that the ratings are fair.  And if they did these things, firms would know that this wasn’t actually work.  It was — you know — nonbillable time.  At the end of the year, you could have been on the beach with your family or you could have attended a “calibration session.”  It’s the same thing either way — vacation.

Meeting every week to chat with the people on your team.  Giving performance reviews.  Receiving performance reviews.  Attending the global law conference.

At law firms, attending the “litigation meeting” or a “partners’ meeting” is a chore.  You’re required to attend (or you wouldn’t) but, at the end of the year, you would rather have been enjoying your vacation hours with your family instead of spending those hours with people at the firm.

At a corporation, attending the global law conference is work.

For which you’re paid.

And people think it matters.

Similarly, suppose management offers some webinar on something.  You can attend.  It’s work.

You must lead a meeting during which you’ll “cascade” some message from on high down to the troops.  You spend time preparing for this internal meeting.  It’s allowed.  You get paid for it.  It’s work. 

I know what you’re thinking:  “They pay you for that!?  Life at a corporation must be great!” 

I suppose it is.  But you’ll surely go home from your in-house job some night thinking, “I was in the office all day.  I talked to a lot of people.  But it would have been nice to do some work.” 

Old habits die hard.

Perhaps law firms are too stingy characterizing things as work.  Maybe tending to the career development of folks around you is worth doing.  Maybe business development efforts are worth undertaking.  Maybe firms should value certain things for which the firm is not paid.

But firms don’t.

And corporations do.

Really.

It’s remarkable.

Every minute of every day, security teams everywhere fend off cyber attacks.

In the case of law firms, a cyber breach may lead to enormous costs in terms of reputation, data, and monetary losses.

And for firms that lag on cybersecurity, clients who feel unsafe will quickly head to the exits.

To explore the challenges faced by law firms, Above the Law and security operations solutions provider Arctic Wolf surveyed more than 160 individuals responsible for technology decisions in the legal industry.

Now, we’re pleased to share this new report, which explores:

- The frequency — and consequences — of law firm data breaches
- The relationship between firm size and cybersecurity preparedness
- The biggest emerging threats to law firms — and how you can combat them

# Biglaw Firm Lashes Out At Ex-Exec And Calls Out 'Facially Absurd' Story
## Proskauer's case against its former COO is getting heated.

The latest filing in the explosive [lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/proskauer-files-lawsuit-against-fired-chief-operating-officer-what-you-need-to-know/) between Biglaw firm Proskauer and its former Chief Operating Officer, [Jonathan O’Brien](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/jonathan-obrien/), reveals the type of rancor we’re rapidly coming to expect from the case. You’ll recall, the firm alleges the now-former COO downloaded 34 gigabytes of internal data to a USB drive before announcing he was leaving the firm to [work for a competitor](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/ex-proskauer-exec-was-heading-to-paul-hastings-before-biglaw-lawsuit-blew-it-all-up/). (The firm fired O’Brien the same day they filed the Southern District of New York complaint.) The complaint also alleges O’Brien attempted to delete emails subject to a litigation hold.

Of course, because this case is nothing if not acrimonious,[ O’Brien responded](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/former-chief-operating-officer-accuses-proskauer-of-machiavellian-management-in-latest-filing/) by calling the firm’s management “Machiavellian.” He told the court he only downloaded the information necessary to do his job as he traveled abroad at year end.

In the latest[ court filing](https://www.law360.com/articles/1567797/attachments/0), Proskauer calls O’Brien’s explanation for his possession of the documents in question “ludicrous” and “facially absurd,” as [detailed by ](https://www.law360.com/articles/1567797)Law360:

“Did [O’Brien] really need to download more than 34 gigabytes of data (including detailed financial performance metrics for every partner in the Firm) in case he might need to work on vacation?,” the firm asked in its brief.

“Is it remotely believable that this activity was for the Firm’s benefit given that he planned to join a competitor upon returning from the vacation and refused to disclose to the Firm that that was his plan? Is it credible that he needed to take all of this highly confidential and sensitive information with him … when virtually all of the Firm’s year-end work had been completed nearly two months before he left on vacation?”

The filing also identifies Jeremy Russo, Proskauer’s former director of financial planning, as working with O’Brien on his plan. Both Russo and another executive, the former chief financial officer, resigned from Proskauer in mid-December, shortly before O’Brien announced he was leaving the firm.

Reminder, these are just the filings for a preliminary injunction. The case is bound to get juicier as the litigation heats up.

# Good: Biglaw Firm Encourages Charitable Donations. Bad: Biglaw Firm Reminds Associates They Haven't Gotten Raises.

It’s not hyperbole to say associates at Biglaw firms that have *not* matched the new Milbank/Cravath compensation scale are obsessively checking their email hoping for word on raises. This pressure-filled environment is something the powers that be at Biglaw firms must be aware of, and act accordingly. If they don’t they’re likely to step right in it.

Like they did at Allen & Overy.

The firm sent out an email encouraging associates to donate to [Women for Women International. ](https://support.womenforwomen.org/)No issue there — it’s a solid charity that does important work in conflict areas. But the “how to help” aspect of the call is more than a little tone deaf.

In an internal email seen by Above the Law, the firm asks recipients to “Donate your first hour or first day of January’s pay to support Women for Women International’s work.” Which begs the question: HOW MUCH ARE THEY ASKING YOU TO DONATE? The raises sweeping through Biglaw are widely effective January 1, so whether or not A&O intends to raise salaries is very relevant to that particular call to action.

As a tipster at the firm notes:

Allen & Overy is sending emails asking us to give up a portion of our salaries before sending an email telling us if we are getting bonuses. It’s a good charity but a bad look for the firm, as there is a lot of uncertainty about associates’ futures with the impending merger and the recent defection of several high-profile partners to other firms.

This [isn’t the first](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/law-firm-fakes-out-its-associates-over-pay-raises/) time a firm has made a [similarly ill-advised](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/if-youre-not-announcing-associates-raises-dont-do-this/) announcement. So please firm admin, before sending out any firm-wide emails, ask yourself how associates that are desperate for news about raises and bonuses are likely to read them.

On this 4th of July week, we Americans celebrate our independence from the UK.

But, as lawyers who love innovation, we should also take a moment to admire our innovative legal brethren across the pond — who seeded our common law, after all. While we come from the same legal roots, today the UK legal market is fundamentally different from ours . . . in many ways, better. Why?

Well, since the passage of the [2007 Legal Services Act, which allows non-attorney ownership of law firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-quiet-crisis-in-legal-and-how-to-fix-it-eddie-hartmans-vision/)s (also known as an ABS structure) there has been an explosion in innovative business models combining great lawyers, business professionals, and technologists (think [Riverview Law](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/alt-legal-the-quiet-crisis-in-legal-revisited-riverviews-view-on-non-attorney-ownership/?rf=1)). UK Biglaw also seems to get that times are changing. [A&O](http://www.allenovery.com/pages/default.aspx), for example, has actively reimagined the “obsolete” Biglaw model, and embraced the disaggregated future through launches of new and innovative businesses filling legal and quasi-legal niches! (I still want my interview with Biglaw hero, David Morley, if he’s reading this.)

Which brings us to today’s thought experiment: picture a red-hot UK firm running a mature, accelerator-like program for legal startups inside their walls.  Specifically, imagine [Y Combinator](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/08/y-combinator-gets-alt-introducing-ironclad-the-legal-startup-for-startups-legal/) of the tech world fame, but inside a law firm with open access to the partners, associates, technology infrastructure, and staff — who are all encouraged (from the top down) to help these legal startups solve THEIR problems. Now imagine the idea of this program is not just to accelerate legal technology, but to give their firm a meaningful (and sustainable) edge in their practice. Imagine being a Biglaw partner at such a firm, and being able to look your clients (or potential clients) in the eye to tell them which bleeding-edge technologies are game changers for them, and which are vapor-ware. You can do that honestly, because your firm helped design and test them. Of course, you’d also have to imagine a ridiculous world where recruiting new lawyers is about more than the billable hours minimum — it’s about offering  young lawyers the opportunity want to have one foot placed firmly in the future of the legal industry.

Welcome back.  You have just imagined [MDR LAB](https://lab.mdr.london/).  It’s real, and it is run out of UK powerhouse firm [Mishcon de Reya](https://www.mishcon.com/) (a firm with over 500 lawyers which has been on a rocket ship of growth).  Last week, I sat down over coffee (should have had tea, damn!) with [Nick West](https://www.mishcon.com/people/nick_west). Nick runs the program and also sits as the firm’s CTO (post an illustrious career running Axiom UK).  As CTO, if he believes in your tech, he can act on implementing it.

This is my column, so I get to have an opinion . . . I freaking love this idea! Now listen, I’m glad I called it quits after the half-decade mark in Biglaw, but if my firm had a program like MDR LAB, I might just still be there. It would be like combining all the fun of startup-life at WeWork with the sweet sweet paychecks of Biglaw. Also, you just might come to believe that the practice of law was a modern profession, which needs to do weird things like push the technological envelope forward every day to stay competitive — like every other business in the global economy.  Refreshing.

Enjoy the interview!

Joe Borstein: Thanks for the time Nick.  Give me a bit a background on yourself.

Nick West: I trained and qualified as an antitrust lawyer at Linklaters, but knew quickly that practising law wasn’t for me. After a detour to McKinsey for a few years, I came back into the legal industry working with a range of legal technology at LexisNexis, where I worked from 2006-2013, eventually running the legal product suite in the UK. In 2013, I left to run Axiom in the UK and then joined Mishcon de Reya in 2016 as Chief Strategy Officer, with the mandate to rethink the business and practice of law, with a focus on new and emerging technologies that have the potential impact to revolutionise the legal market. Since 2018, I’ve been Chief Technology Officer as well with ownership over the whole stack of technologies.

JB: Thanks, but this is alt.legal, so please tell me about the MDR LAB?

NW:  MDR LAB is our legal tech incubator. We aim to find interesting new technologies that are changing the practice of law, bring them into our business for 10 weeks, wrap a team of lawyers around them, and help them develop their product. By the end of the programme, hopefully, we’ve helped them create a product that we’d want to use and that others in the market would too.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Mechanically, each year we ask for applications from the legal startup world. Ultimately, we’re aiming to select 4-6 companies to come in and spend 10 weeks in the firm. This year, for example, we had 136 applicants, we invited 16 to an in-person Pitch Day at our office, and we chose 5 for the MDR LAB programme itself. Who wins? For me, it’s the startups which have a laser-like clarity about what they do; about what problem they are trying to solve. So many startups talk about technology first — those are less interesting for me, to be honest. I need to start from a problem statement — if I recognise the problem, then I’m interested in how the startup might solve the problem and things tend to progress well from there.

On the programme, we agree with each startup on a clear goal for the 10 weeks and then we wrap a team of lawyers, technologists, legal engineers, members of our strategy and data science teams, members of our finance and BD teams, and other relevant people around them, and they all work together collaboratively against those goals. At the end of the programme, we have a Demo Day, attended by ~150 internal and external technology enthusiasts!

The startups come from all over the world — we’ve now had LegalTech companies from the UK, US, Germany, Israel, and India in the 2 cohorts to date, but we’ve had applications from over 20 countries. In fact, there are very few pre-requisites. First, they must be technologies that are relevant to the types of law that we practise — the LAB is not purely altruistic; whilst we want to help the emerging LegalTech sector, we want to transform our own practice, so they’ve got to be technologies that Mishcon de Reya could use. Second, they must be willing to spend 10 weeks in London because it’s not a remote programme; it’s demanding and hands-on and we’re trying to achieve a lot of actual product development in 10 weeks. And third, they must agree to an equity option ahead of the start of the programme — at a mutually agreed-upon valuation.

JB:  Sounds like a hell of an opportunity for them.  We all know how hard it is to get that Biglaw access.  Give us one exciting example of a company that has come through MDR LAB.

NW: Last year, we had a company called Orbital Witness on the programme. It was barely 6 months old and joined the LAB with nothing more than an idea. The business was founded by 3 men from the space and satellite industry who had a belief that they could use satellite imagery to help with real estate disputes. Over the 10 weeks, we helped them design the actual product through a series of design sprints. First, they realised that whilst there could be value in the satellite imagery, the disputes angle probably wasn’t scalable — yes, our real estate litigation lawyers do indeed work on boundary dispute cases, but only occasionally. Instead, through a set of interviews and shadowing of our lawyers, they realised that the scalable use case would be for the diligence tasks at the outset of almost every real estate matter — establishing title. Over the course of the 10 weeks, the founders built up a picture of what real estate lawyers do day in and day out and how a map-based application allowing the users to drill down into different layers of data for a given title/asset, coupled with the satellite imagery, would provide real value. By the end of the programme, they had a fully fleshed-out product concept. Over the next 6 months, they raised capital and started to build their product and since March 2018, we’ve been piloting their application in our real estate department, with real success.

JB:  How did you convince the firm to take the innovation plunge, which surely consumes time, effort, and billable hours?

NW:  I always get asked that question! It actually was not that difficult. Kevin Gold, our Managing Partner, is a true visionary. He understands that as technology is changing the world, so it will inevitably change legal. And when I got here, he asked me to spend 6 months just immersing myself in the firm. When I finally got to articulate some ideas to him, and suggested the idea of an incubator, which is really a proven concept borrowed from many other industries, he saw the value. I wrote a short paper to the board, and a week later it was done.

MDR LAB is only a component of what we do, however. We see the world in 3 technology horizons.

- Horizon 1 is the set of existing legal technologies. Think Relativity, iManage, etc. We need to make good choices between these mature providers, ensure we’re getting value from what we’ve paying for and make sure that we’ve got good adoption.
- Horizon 2 is the set of LegalTech startups — the companies you talk and write about. These are companies that are trying to look at current ways of working and making them better. They are technologies that could be ready for a firm like ours to use in 6-24 months. They are mature enough for us to understand whether they address a pain point that we have, but still young enough that we could actually have a bearing on their development. And so they are ideal for MDR LAB.
- Finally, Horizon 3 represents the technologies that MAY change the world tomorrow. Think Smart Contracts. This set could be transformational for legal or could be hot air. I don’t think we should wait to find out, but instead should be involved in a number of the projects related to them — typically, we might partner with universities to explore these technologies.
To support all this, we have a great group of tech enthusiasts around the firm — lawyers, legal engineers, strategy managers, data scientists — who all work together in different combinations. Critical to our way of thinking is to include lawyers from the front line. Although I was a lawyer 20 years ago, I don’t really know what conduct of a litigation matter or a real estate transaction is like — but our lawyers do. I need some of those lawyers involved — working with our current suppliers to test product, working with the startups to develop ideas, working on university projects thinking about future use cases. So, we have a small cohort of lawyers who have had 20% of their fee-earning targets eliminated so that they can spent that time on technology-related projects.

JB: What has the feedback been from the associates and partners?

NW: The feedback has been great. Those who have been involved have really enjoyed it and learned a great deal from it — about how hard it is to run a start-up, about product development, about product management and feature prioritisation. They’ve also had their minds opened to the possibilities that technology brings to their particular field of practice. Obviously not every employee at Mishcon de Reya is involved, but the reach is wider that you’d think because we livestream events like Pitch Day and Demo Day. Overall, we have 30+ people acting as mentors to the LAB companies this year and many more working with them day-to-day.

What the LAB has done is to infuse a group of legal professionals who really love tech to have a common interest, a common platform to talk about how technology is changing the practice of law. Many of these people are the ones who are already working the 60+ hours a week, but because they are interested in new ways of working will still find 5 hours to pilot new technologies. There are now about 100 people like that in the firm. Some of those are the ones now spending 20 percent of their time on this work and have gotten approval to lower their billable hours to improve the technology of the firm. Some are even making their case for partnership through their work in the LAB.

There is no doubt that over the past couple of years we have gained a good reputation as a firm doing innovative things. And that’s helpful in client conversations and when we’re recruiting. This is not just MDR LAB, but all of the tech stuff we’re doing — the LAB has been a lightning rod, helping us to attract innovative, energetic people.

JB: Do you think there will ever be a legal Jeff Bezos in the next decade? (i.e., a billionaire who blows up the whole market)?

NW: That’s a tough question. And I’m probably the wrong person to ask. A lot of what we do is try to make the existing processes better and more efficient and to think of new and better ways to do things within the current confines, such as the courts’ procedural rules on how to litigate or the current paradigm for a real estate transaction. What’s really happening is that legal is catching up to the wave of digitization and automation that happened in other industries in the 1990s and 2000s.

What’s really needed is a completely different way — and it’ll probably need an outsider to do that. I mean someone who completely reconfigures transactions — diligence replaced by insurance, negotiation replaced by standard terms, etc.

How likely is that? Lots of people talk about it, but when you get into the detail it isn’t easy. Clients really just want to get the legal stuff done and move on, rather than rewire the whole system, and it’s hard for those of us in the system to revolutionize it. So, I don’t hold up much hope for the market blow-up… but if anyone out there has an idea, I’m all ears…

JB: Thanks Nick, awesome stuff!

# Beyond Biglaw: 3 Insights About Boutique-Firm Practice
## Aided by technology, smaller firms can compete for the most sophisticated legal work.

For the second year in a row, I have had the good fortune to participate in Above the Law’s [Academy for Private Practice](http://events.abovethelaw.com/app/) (APP), which was held this year in Philadelphia. Even though these appearances have generally coincided with quite busy work periods, I have found the experience worthwhile both times, due to the top-notch quality of the presentations. While the event is geared to solo and boutique firm lawyers (and vendors looking to service that market), I actually think that Biglaw firms looking for some true competitive intelligence should consider sending representatives as well. Based on what was discussed and displayed at APP, there is no doubt that Biglaw firms have a big bullseye on their collective backs from small-firm lawyers with the capability to service Biglaw’s clients without a drop in legal quality. The conference further made clear that there is a veritable army of technology providers and other vendors ready and able to outfit intrepid Biglaw-slayers with the tools they need to succeed at that mission.

In fact, the panel I was on focused on how smaller firms can compete with Biglaw firms for sophisticated and lucrative work. The panelists included myself, Carolyn Elefant (representing the solo practitioner and ultra-niche legal practice world), and Andrew Dick, a former Biglaw corporate attorney turned legal practice disrupter and small-firm network creator. In short, three practicing lawyers of very different backgrounds and legal areas of focus. A recipe for interesting conversation, especially since we were in the able hands of Bob Ambrogi, who moderated with aplomb and kept the panel humming along.

While you can see some of our comments from the panel on Twitter, or listen to our post-panel podcast on the Legal Talk Network, now that this year’s experience is over, I wanted to share a few insights from our panel that I think warrant additional thought and consideration over time.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
First, I found it very interesting that even though we were three lawyers with very different practices, we have all been involved, since launching our own firms, in developing “side businesses” to support our practices. On our panel, we discussed how Andrew and Carolyn have built platforms for building referral networks in their areas of law and beyond, and how I have been involved with my partners in creating tools like Litigation Alpha to help support our consulting efforts on behalf of investors interested in the outcome of certain litigation events. The common thread between these efforts is that all of us recognized in the course of our legal practices that certain things could be improved. So each of us went out and did something about it.

At the same time, and judging by some comments from the audience at our panel, there is still a sense that lawyers need to focus only on their practices, and leave the innovation to others. While that may be true for some, it is also true that it is easier than ever today for lawyers who identify a product or service that can fill a gap in the market to just go ahead and find a way to build it. Doing so is a no-brainer, especially if that new product or would be of interest to clients or help support a lawyer’s own practice. Perhaps we are entering an age where lawyers, at firms of all sizes, decide that innovation can come from all corners, including from oneself.

The second insight that I believe worthy of additional consideration has to do with one of Biglaw’s favorite aspirations — cross-selling. What both my co-panelists have recognized, and have built platforms to improve, is the importance of cross-selling for any lawyer, irrespective of the size of their firm. As a former Biglaw partner, I personally know how difficult it can be to get lawyers within the same firm to cross-sell each other’s services — and it can be even more difficult when trying to do so outside of one’s own firm.

But as we see from the rise of virtual law firms, or looser referral networks among smaller firms and solos, Biglaw is not alone in its pursuit of cross-selling as a way to generate additional revenue. One big advantage that Biglaw has when cross-selling is that the client has already bought into the firm brand, and trusts the firm with at least some of that legal work. Smaller firms, especially if they are trying to convince their clients to work with a trusted outside firm within a referral network, have to bridge that trust gap somehow. There is plenty more to consider on this issue, but our APP panel made it clear that there are smart lawyers looking to bring cross-selling to smaller firms, and once again try and co-opt Biglaw at its own game.

Third, the panel discussion focused on Biglaw as the target, in terms of poaching work, but maybe we all need to think more on how to convince in-house teams to farm out work in the first place. One of the less-discussed developments in the legal industry is the increasing tendency of corporations with robust in-house legal teams to [keep more work in-house](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/5-tips-for-running-your-in-house-legal-department-like-a-business/). The assumption is that most if not all of that work would have gone to Biglaw firms. The open question is whether smaller firms, particularly those with a compelling value proposition, can identify opportunities to peel some of that work away from corporations. Sure, they will be competing with Biglaw firms for that work, but maybe the fact that the corporations have already pulled the work from Biglaw means that they would be more likely to consider smaller firms if they later decide to hand off that work to outside counsel again. We will see how this develops over the next few years.

Ultimately, the APP conference highlighted what we already know about the legal market for smaller firms — that it is at once both challenging and dynamic. Aided by technology, it is an exciting time for smaller firms looking to compete for the most sophisticated legal work. At the same time, displacing the incumbents, or trying to identify new marketing opportunities, is as challenging as ever. While the best path forward may be subject to debate, I for one am glad to participate in the conversation.

# The Gap Between Growing Law Firms And Stagnant Ones Is All About Marketing
## Marketing is incredibly important for law firms.

There’s a perception that chalking up the difference between two companies as “all about marketing” was a knock on the more successful entity. As though consumers just flocked to the bigger brand because they’re stupid lemmings that can’t discern the substantive similarities. Or at least that used to be the perception. Maybe Mad Men radically improved everyone’s appreciation for advertising.

But marketing is more than just advertising. It’s the whole bundle of brand leverage that gets the firm’s name out there, builds relationships, maintains relationships, keeps the firm top-of-mind at all times, and recognizes networking opportunities before they present themselves. When we say high growth firms are doing better because of the marketing, that’s not a knock and it’s not a superficial quality — marketing and business development contribute to the firm’s substantive strategy.

The [2021 LexisNexis InterAction Marketing & Business Development Report for Law Firm and Legal Practices](https://www.interaction.com/legal-bdsurveyreport/) came out this week and the biggest takeaway — besides the understatement of the millennium that COVID was, in fact, a challenge last year — is that the growth gap turns on which firms have robust marketing strategies and which don’t.

The report is filled with insights, but graphs like these kept leaping out:



Look at these disparities. That marketing budget figure is damning. On the one hand, stagnant firms don’t have the resources to spend as much outside of core legal services, but this overlooks advances in relatively affordable CRM solutions out there that can give firms a leg up in client relations without breaking the bank.

Check out the advantages firms are getting merely by investing in the CRM component:

That’s pretty useful data to have and it’s remarkably easy to capture if firms take the plunge.

And it’s important because client retention is an issue and guess which firms it hurts more?



As one might suspect, the higher growth firms are the ones winning competitions. But the extent of the disparity between categories of firms is impressive. Competition is rising all over the place but the firms with more investment in business development don’t perceive it as nearly the threat no-growth firms do.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Rolls Out 'Enhanced' Bonus Structure
## Not so fast, it's not as 'enhanced' as you think it is.

Thank God it’s Friday night and I just just just just juuuuuuuust, got paid! That’s what associates are singing at Dechert right now, because their firm finally decided to hop aboard the spring special bonus bandwagon.

Earlier this afternoon, we called the firm out as one of the few Top 50 firms that had yet to announce special bonuses, and now, here we are. Dechert will be matching the Davis Polk bonus scale… kind of. Here’s what that looks like at the firm (full memo available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/dechert-special-bonus-2021/2/)):

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
This what we’ll call a creative way to make sure everyone gets a little taste of the bonus cash, no matter their hours. Associates and counsel across all class years will automatically receive a minimum bonus of $6,000 in the spring and fall. Attorneys who meet the firm’s standard bonus hours requirements will be eligible for an “enhanced” bonus — and by “enhanced,” Dechert means everyone will be eligible for the rest of the prevailing market bonus. Those who meet their hours requirements in both the spring and fall will be eligible for a match of the full Davis Polk bonus scale. Those who reach their hours targets at year end but missed the first payment cycle will receive the full “enhanced” bonus.

Congratulations to everyone at Dechert.

(Flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/stroock-special-bonus-2021//2/) to see the full memo from Dechert.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Partners *Still* Don't Want To Go Back To The Office

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

I just don’t believe you’re going to get some partners and senior partners sitting in an office again. Ever.

— Jeffrey Lowe, founder and managing partner of a new advisory firm, Jeffrey Lowe Partners, in comments given to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/18/amid-layoffs-and-attrition-law-firms-are-planning-more-staffing-adjustments/) on Biglaw’s mandated return-to-office plans, which he says are still being met with resistance by partners. Earlier this summer, Lowe [echoed the same sentiments](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/06/not-even-biglaw-partners-want-to-return-to-the-office-3-days-a-week/), saying firms are “finding that their partners especially really do not want to come back into the office and they’re not quite sure what to do with it.”

# Biglaw Partner And Client, NFL Team The Washington Commanders, Hit With Defamation Lawsuit
## They practically dared the plaintiff to bring this lawsuit.

Holland & Knight partner John L. Brownlee, along with his client — NFL team the Washington Commanders — are the named defendants in a recently filed defamation lawsuit. The complaint was filed earlier this month by former Commanders executive, Jason Friedman.

The [complaint](https://www.law360.com/articles/1700484/attachments/0) alleges Friedman was called a “serial liar” and his credibility was called into question after he testified before Congress about alleged financial improprieties. Friedman is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for “economic and emotional harm.” As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1700484/commanders-atty-accused-of-defaming-exec-after-testimony) Law360, the actions of the team and Brownlee have caused him “severe anxiety and depression.” And he says he’s been “unable to find a comparable job due to the team’s deliberate and malicious destruction of his reputation.”

As detailed in the filing, the defamatory statements allegedly began when Friedman testified about the team’s handling of season-ticket deposits.

In March 2022, Friedman, who had been fired by the Commanders in 2020, testified about improprieties in their handling of season-ticket deposits. After his testimony, the Commanders in early April released a statement denying the allegations, saying, in part, that anyone who made such accusations against the team had “committed perjury, pure and simple.”

Lisa Banks, who represents Friedman and about 40 other former employees accusing the team of sexual abuse and harassment and a toxic workplace environment, replied that the team’s statement defamed Friedman even though it had not named him. The Commanders replied with a statement saying that if Friedman believed that, “he should bring a defamation suit” and the team would “vigorously defend any such claim.”

And with this suit, Friedman said, bet.

But that wasn’t the end of the alleged defamatory statements. In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, the team wrote Friedman’s allegations about financial impropriety were “a lie from the beginning,” and that he was a “serial liar” with “notable impediments to his credibility.” The team also made the letter to the FTC public “with malice, ill will and spite,” causing Friedman additional reputational harm.

Additionally, according to the complaint, Brownlee went on a radio show and said of Friedman that he “became the very toxic work environment that the team was trying to rid itself [of].”

Since the Commanders/Brownlee’s offensive against Friedman, the House Oversight Committee released a [report](https://www.law360.com/articles/1556507/house-probe-rips-snyder-nfl-for-toxic-workplace-in-report) into the work environment at the Commanders which, inter alia, included accusations the team retaliated against those who spoke out against the organization. They’ve also [settled a lawsuit](https://www.law360.com/articles/1595295/commanders-to-pay-fans-ag-625-000-in-ticket-deposit-suit) regarding season-ticket deposits.

# The Am Law A-List: Ranking The Most Elite Law Firms In America (2018)

Another day, another ranking for lawyers to ogle in a search for meaning as they attempt to get through the day’s billables. Such is the life of a Biglaw attorney, always on the hunt for confirmation that their firm is the best firm, the one that’s hitting all of its essential metrics year after year. If that sounds like you (and you might as well admit it, it probably does), then you should check out the latest offering from the American Lawyer, the annual [A-List](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/07/24/the-american-lawyers-2018-a-list/) ranking.

Are you somehow unfamiliar with this ranking? Here are all of the metrics that it measures to determine which Biglaw firms are the best of the best:

On this list, profits don’t reign supreme, nor does size. Since its inception, the A-List has recognized firms based on a combination of factors, both financial and cultural: revenue per lawyer, pro bono commitment, associate satisfaction and racial diversity, with RPL and pro bono given double weight. And now, for the second year in a row, we also include a score for gender diversity—more specifically, the percentage of women equity partners.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
As my colleague Joe Patrice [mentioned](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-2017-a-list-arrives-to-salve-that-itch-you-had-for-another-law-firm-ranking-this-week/) last year, we’re still left to wonder why pro bono has been given double weight over significant stats like associate satisfaction, racial diversity, and gender diversity. Yes, pro bono work is very important, but if we’re ranking a firm’s culture — a measure where associate satisfaction and diversity are key — these metrics ought to be given their due in this ranking.

With that said, the full top 20 firms and their scores are listed at the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2018/07/24/the-american-lawyers-2018-a-list/). Without further ado, here are the top 10 to satiate your rankings cravings:

- Ropes & Gray (National)
- Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr (National)
- Munger, Tolles & Olson (Los Angeles)
- Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe (National)
- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison (New York)
- Debevoise & Plimpton (New York)
- Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (National)
- Covington & Burling (Washington, D.C.)
- O’Melveny & Myers (Los Angeles)
- Paul Hastings (National)
Congratulations to all of the firms that made this year’s Am Law A-List.

A three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit has affirmed a lower court ruling, stating that Title IX protects transgender students' rights to use the bathrooms of their choice. This is the first time that an appellate court has issued a ruling of this kind. [[Reuters](http://reuters.com/article/USLegal/idUSL1N1IW1UR?il=0)] * ""No one knows how many qualified individuals never even advance their names."" Biglaw attorneys would usually jump at the chance to leave private practice and take a gig working for the Labor Department, but under this presidential administration, there seems to be a bit of hesitancy due to their unwillingness to ""incur a lifelong Trump association."" [[Bloomberg BNA](https://bol.bna.com/big-law-attorneys-think-twice-about-trump-labor-gig/)] * More and more Biglaw firms have decided to reevaluate the way they evaluate their attorneys.

# Legal Vineyards: Cultivating Rich Connections For A Bountiful Harvest

In the intricate world of law, the strength of your professional network can be likened to a well-cultivated vineyard.

Just as the finest wines are the product of time, care, and the gentle nurturing of grapevines, so too are the most fruitful professional connections grown from the seeds of past associations.

Reconnecting with old law school friends, past clients, and former colleagues is not just a walk down memory lane; it’s an investment in your career’s future bounty.

This article explores the art of networking on how to nurture these connections for a harvest rich in opportunities and referrals.

Planting the Seeds

For attorneys, each connection — whether an old classmate, a former client, or a professional peer — represents a potential avenue for growth, a seed sown in the rich soil of your career path.

In the legal field, where opportunities and referrals can significantly impact success, nurturing these seeds is not just beneficial — it’s strategic.

Recognizing and cultivating your existing network goes beyond simple relationship maintenance.

It’s about building a robust foundation for future opportunities, enhancing your reputation, and opening doors to new avenues for collaboration and client acquisition.

By investing in these relationships, you’re effectively laying the groundwork for a professional ecosystem that can yield an abundant harvest of success, setting you apart in a competitive legal landscape.

Watering With Interactions

In the same way that vines require consistent watering to flourish, your professional relationships thrive on regular, impactful interactions.

However, this doesn’t entail overwhelming your contacts with messages. Instead, focus on the quality of your engagements.

Leveraging commonalities can significantly deepen these connections. Whether it’s a shared interest, a mutual alma mater, or a common professional challenge, touching base on these shared experiences or values can forge stronger bonds.

Additionally, blending professional courtesies with personal touches — such as congratulating them on personal milestones, or sharing insights on mutual interests — can seamlessly intertwine the professional with the personal.

This approach not only keeps your “relationship vine” vigorous and growing but also cultivates an environment where professional and personal spheres enrich one another, creating a network that’s both robust and genuinely connected.

Fertilizing With Value-Added Exchanges

Just as the right fertilization can invigorate a vineyard, infusing your interactions with meaningful value can significantly strengthen your professional relationships.

This involves more than just staying in touch. It’s about enriching these connections with relevant content — such as articles, reports, or insights — that resonate with their current interests or professional challenges.

Offering your expertise freely, without expecting anything in return, lays the groundwork for a relationship based on mutual respect and value.

Consider their broader goals and personal aspirations, whether they’re looking to join a board, seeking opportunities to speak at conferences, or simply in need of a friend to unwind with over drinks.

By catering to both their professional needs and personal interests, you’re not merely maintaining a connection — you’re deepening it, fostering a more productive and fulfilling partnership.

Strategically Pruning Your Professional Circle

In the meticulous care of a vineyard, pruning is crucial — not just for preventing overcrowding but for the overall vitality of the vines.

Similarly, in the realm of professional networking, it’s imperative to curate your connections wisely, focusing on those that foster mutual growth and enrichment.

This process is about discerning quality over accumulating quantity.

It’s perfectly acceptable, even necessary, to distance yourself from relationships that drain your energy or don’t align with your values, including those with individuals you may find challenging or incompatible.

Embrace the power of selectively nurturing the connections that resonate with your professional ethos and personal standards.

By doing so, you create space for more meaningful, rewarding relationships that contribute positively to your career and well-being, leaving behind those that do not serve your professional journey or personal peace.

Reaping the Rewards of Your Network

As your strategic nurturing comes to fruition, your carefully cultivated relationships will yield an abundance of opportunities ripe for the taking.

These rewards may manifest as referrals, partnership offers, or invaluable insights, each contributing significantly to your professional advancement.

Importantly, laying this foundation often leads to serendipitous opportunities — those unexpected yet fortuitous encounters that only arise when you’ve invested in a robust network.

The harvest represents not just a culmination but a vibrant phase in a cycle of continuous growth and renewal, where the seeds of today’s efforts blossom into tomorrow’s successes.

Embracing Serendipity

The true beauty of a well-tended network lies not only in the anticipated outcomes but also in the unexpected opportunities that surface along the way.

These serendipitous moments — be it a chance meeting that leads to a transformative partnership or a casual conversation that sparks a groundbreaking idea — underscore the unpredictable yet invaluable benefits of cultivating your professional relationships.

Such moments reaffirm that beyond the referrals and collaborations, your network holds the potential to surprise and inspire you, revealing paths and possibilities previously unimagined.

By embracing the art of networking, you open the door to a world where professional growth and personal development intersect, leading to a richer, more fulfilling career journey.

Cultivating Success

The cultivation of our networks reminds us that with patience, care, and the right strategies, we can turn our existing network into a source of sustained professional enrichment and practice development.

As attorneys, we’re trained to advocate, negotiate, and strategize, but the art of networking requires a different set of skills — one that involves the heart as much as the mind.

By watering our connections with meaningful interactions, fertilizing them with value-added exchanges, and carefully pruning our network, we can harvest the rich fruits of mutual benefit, growth, and success. 

So, let’s raise a glass to the vineyards we cultivate in our professional lives: May they be ever fruitful and flourishing!

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Unintended Consequences When Powerful People Speak
## If you're a general counsel or other senior in-house lawyer, watch what you say.

When Fareed Zakaria interviewed Lloyd Blankfein recently, Blankfein said something like, “I have to be careful. Sometimes, I’m just thinking out loud, and people take what I’m saying as an edict.” (I’m paraphrasing here, but you can [listen to the interview yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywu1tIojb8), and get the words exactly right.)

Blankfein is right: When important people speak, people sometimes listen. And that can cause problems.

Like in 1170, when Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was excommunicating people who sided with the King of England in a dispute over the powers of the church and throne. According to oral tradition, King Henry II asked, [“Who will rid me of this troublesome priest?”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Becket) This was interpreted as a royal command, and four knights — [Reginald FitzUrse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_FitzUrse), [Hugh de Morville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_de_Morville,_Lord_of_Westmorland), [William de Tracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_de_Tracy), and [Richard le Breton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_le_Breton) — traveled to Canterbury and assassinated the Archbishop.

If you’re important, you have to watch your words carefully.

When a member of the Board of Directors says, “I wonder how BigCo would handle something like that,” maybe he’s just scratching his head aloud. Maybe we shouldn’t assemble a task force to investigate whether BigCo has ever confronted the issue, how many times, and how it responded on each occasion. (Or maybe we should. It all depends.)

But that goes for less important people, too.

When a partner at a law firm says, “I wonder if there’s any email traffic on that subject,” the partner might be seriously curious. But this might also just be an idle comment. Three weeks later, when an associate presents the partner with binders of all email traffic on the issue (assembled at a cost of $40,000), the partner may not be pleased; “What the heck is all this stuff? I was just wondering aloud. And how much did you spend on this?”

So, too, in-house.

Suppose the general counsel asks, “What’s the statute of limitations on a possible claim against us?” She might just mean generally: In [some state], the most likely claim would be for negligence, and the statute would be [whatever].

But you might not hear it that way.

Before you ask outside counsel for a memo on that point, think.

Outside counsel is likely to decide that this is a serious issue, of intense importance to the general counsel. And it might turn out that there are four possible claims — negligence, misrepresentation, a state consumer fraud claim, and breach of contract. And it might turn out that different limitations periods govern each possible cause of action, and the dates on which each of those four periods starts to run is different.

When you present the general counsel with a 20-page memo analyzing the multiple possibilities (and concluding that the ultimate answer is uncertain), the general counsel may look at you like you’re crazy: “Why in God’s name did we commission research on this? We haven’t even been sued yet! I just generally wanted to know what the limitations period was.”

So be careful.

If you’re important, watch what you say.

And if you’re helping someone who’s important, make sure the boss actually requested something before you provide it.

Otherwise, you could accidentally martyr the Archbishop of Canterbury.

# Where Good Ideas Come From
## A law firm with a good chance of success will have seeking ideas in its DNA.

For anyone running a law firm of the future, competition is not only going to be tougher, it will also morph and change constantly. A law firm with a good chance of success will have seeking ideas in its DNA.

A book, which I suspect I found many years ago browsing in a book store, caught my fancy in this vein. It is called “Where Good Ideas Come From” and was written by Steven Johnson.

I took a chance and read it and was quite impressed.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Going back to Peter Drucker’s epiphanal statement that all businesses must do two things to succeed — namely, Innovate and Market — it seemed like the generation of good ideas, wherever they might come from, would be useful for any law firm of the future. So here is what Steven Johnson came up with:

- Liquid Networks: This is my favorite one. It is where random unrelated contacts in divergent fields yield incredible breakthroughs. For example, this is the concept of where the printing press supposedly came from, (i.e., an idea in one field of endeavor that was extraordinarily useful outside that field).
- The Adjacent Possible: This is where learning gets to a point where the next level of thought can be figured out. This is difficult to describe, and perhaps the least useful concept, but it makes a lot of sense — why people simultaneously and independently make the same discovery in different places.
- The Slow Hunch:  Johnson postulates that this is where you think of something vaguely, and it sits in your mind for a while — possibly even for many years — and then something hits a tripwire and it becomes incredibly useful. I have found this to be the case for me. This is why, when I have an idea that seems interesting, I write it down and put it in a pile of things to look at someday. When someday comes, sometimes that (old) idea literally leaps off the page to tell me some incredible breakthrough thought.
- Serendipity:  This is where you go for a walk, you browse, you wander around, and you let your passive brain think on it. I find this less useful for new ideas but more useful for solving problems that I cannot easily sort out. It is somewhat like sleeping on a problem and waking up with a greater idea than I had the day before.
- Error: Yes, Edison is famous for saying that he never failed when he kept trying to create a lightbulb. Instead, when asked, he said that he had succeeded in learning several thousand ways not to make a lightbulb.
- Exaptation:  Maybe this is my real favorite: to take ideas from one branch of knowledge and apply them in another area. I do this all the time, and it has resulted in many breakthrough ideas for me. For example, my idea of putting lawyers as more important than clients within my law firm came from Starbucks’ business model to put the customers second and the employees first. That was a breakthrough idea in the legal world at the time.
- Platforms: This is very interesting. His example is a coral reef, where each party on the reef is doing its own thing without really thinking about the reef, but somehow it all cooperates together. An analogy for humans might be a city.  He proposes that cities stimulate a ton more innovation and creativity due to the use of the above possible places for good idea creation. Applying this to law firms, it makes even more important the logic of the lawyers coming into the office a good amount to emulate that choral reef.
- Just Slamming Away: This is my personal idea and not in Johnson’s book. I like to just sit there with a pad and a pen — and no iPhone — and just think, damn it!!! And all sorts of ideas burble forth.
So great law firms that will survive and thrive will have creating new ideas in their DNA and maybe even come up with formal processes to push these kinds of things to happen.

In celebration of American Lawyer’s 40th anniversary, ALM has collected a treasure trove of Biglaw data. Since 1985, the year this stat goes back to, Wachtell has dominated in revenue per lawyer. How much was Wachtell’s industry leading revenue per lawyer in 1985?

Hint: In 2019, Wachtell’s revenue per lawyer clocks in at $3,207,000. It was… a good deal less in 1985.

Few ideas can muster the bipartisan support that “upholding de facto segregation” can in well-to-do communities.

Republicans and Democrats came together in Westport, Connecticut, to vote to request the school board cut off [Shipman & Goodwin](https://www.shipmangoodwin.com/), the firm that’s represented the school board for over 30 years, [in retaliation for the firm’s work on behalf of developers seeking to build affordable housing in the town](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-lawyer-fought-housing-segregation-now-wealthy-suburbanites-want-to-fire-his-firm). The school board is, of course, an independent entity from the town itself and is free to ignore the request, but the town happens to control the school board’s budget and is giving off every indication that it could sacrifice the town’s own kids if the school board doesn’t join its crusade to keep the community free from….

What’s gotten into the town’s bonnet is the fact that Shipman & Goodwin partner Timothy Hollister is willing to say the next part out loud. In a [ProPublica and Connecticut Mirror investigation into housing segregation](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-some-of-americas-richest-towns-fight-affordable-housing) earlier this year:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Does anybody say we need to keep blacks and Hispanics out of Westport? No, but they talk about property values, safety and preserving open space — all the things that a town can do to prevent development that would bring up a more economically and racially diverse housing population,” Hollister said. “They don’t use the overt racial terms, but it’s absolutely clear to everybody in the room that’s what they’re talking about.”

Westport flipped out that someone might insinuate that they’re doing what they seem to be actually doing and called the remarks “inflammatory and insulting.” I mean… are they talking about “property values, safety and preserving open space”? Because if they are, this statement isn’t insulting as much as a lesson about well-documented dog whistles. Even if the Board wasn’t seeking segregation as a conscious effort, a statement like this should give them pause to critically reconsider the assumptions behind the rhetoric they’re using.

Shunning that lesson, the two Republicans and one Democrat on the town’s Board of Selectmen wrote the school board demanding they drop S&G as counsel.

“S&G cannot have it both ways,” the town’s two Republican selectmen and their Democratic colleague [wrote](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6426006/09-19-2019-FINAL-Letter-to-BOE-Re-SG.pdf) to the school board, referring to the firm’s work for Summit Development LLC, a developer that is seeking to build a 187-unit apartment complex a half-mile from the local train station. Fifty-seven of those units would be reserved for low-income residents. Town officials said the firm’s “dual representation” constitutes a conflict of interest.

But it’s not a conflict of interest. Indeed, Connecticut ethics authorities have already weighed in that this is not a conflict of interest because it’s not a “dual representation” to represent two completely different clients. What might actually be a conflict of interest is a town official seeking to undermine the school board’s independent judgment and potentially its budget over a land use spat. Boycotts are all well and good, but using government funds to boycott another public interest function is much thornier.

The correct move here was to write a letter back explaining that if this all comes to pass, the firm is prepared to file a suit against the town for tortiously interfering with the firm’s relationship with its existing client. For its part, S&G took a completely different approach:

But, over the past few months, the law firm has sought to make amends with the town. Hollister apologized, and Shipman & Goodwin took the extraordinary step of giving Westport an effective veto over its future affordable housing clients. In a [letter](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6426004/07-09-2019-Fr-T-Hollister-to-J-Marpe-Re.pdf) to local officials last month, attorney Thomas Mooney, who represents the town school board, said the firm, “out of respect for our relationship,” would never again take on a client challenging a land-use decision without written permission from town leaders. However, for ethical reasons, the firm could not drop its current client that has been trying to build affordable housing in town for the last 13 years, he wrote.

The firm followed up the written apology with a personal visit to last week’s selectmen’s meeting by managing partner Alan E. Lieberman, who reiterated the firm’s remorse.

“It was undoubtedly deeply hurting and obviously very inflammatory,” Lieberman said of Hollister’s remarks, “and we understand the reaction from the town.”

Ugh.

While S&G refused to pull out of representing this specific client, the whole tone of this effort to roll over when an adversary gets huffy is bad news for legal advocacy generally. The ProPublica report notes that another Connecticut town has already successfully pulled this stunt with S&G — in that case forcing the firm to drop its client. The Westport school board now has to consider whether or not they’ll cave to pressure too.

E-discovery has been a key part of litigation for the past decade or more, becoming more complex each year.

Emerging social media and chat apps, along with cheap data storage, have increased the  volume of information to be processed in e-discovery. Greater use of personal devices for professional communications also adds to the amount of discoverable information to manage. 

You’d be hard-pressed to find a case today that doesn’t involve e-discovery in some capacity. To help you understand  how to effectively and fairly handle the myriad issues that commonly arise, PLI is offering a one-day program, [Hot Topics in Electronic Discovery 2022: What Corporate and Outside Counsel Need to Know](https://www.pli.edu/programs/hot-topics-in-electronic-discovery?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2).

An experienced panel of lawyers, judges, and e-discovery professionals will provide insiders’ insight into the current state of e-discovery, as well as the tips you need to know in order to avoid some of the most common pitfalls litigants have encountered in the years since e-discovery burst onto the litigation scene. Topics to be covered include:

- The latest legal updates in e-discovery
- How to face common e-discovery issues that can arise in litigation
- Experienced insights from e-discovery attorneys who have encountered the kinds of problems your clients will likely face in litigation
- Practical tips for conducting efficient and defensible discovery in the electronic age
- Why sanctions can be imposed for e-discovery violations and how you can avoid them
- An overview of Rule 37(e) regarding the loss of electronically stored information (ESI)
- How the pandemic has affected e-discovery practice
Eligible for one Ethics credit, the program offers the knowledge you need to best advise your clients on state, federal, and international e-discovery strategic and technology issues, as well as practical strategies to use when you need to provide guidance on e-retention policies or e-discovery. [Register](https://www.pli.edu/programs/hot-topics-in-electronic-discovery?t=live&tCode=CNS2_ATL01&utm_source=ATL01&utm_medium=DISPLAY&utm_campaign=CNS2) today.

No one is immune from the COVID-19 pandemic, not even law firms that have attempted to be “prudent” with their cost-cutting measures. What do you do as a newly merged megafirm that’s facing down a worldwide health crisis amid maddeningly declining markets? In this case, you first slash partner pay, and then turn to other costs at the firm.

Today’s news comes from Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath, the firm that was formed after Faegre Baker Daniels finalized its merger with Drinker Biddle & Reath on February 1. If you recall, the prospective Am Law 50 firm with more than 1,300 lawyers was one of the very first to [close its doors over coronavirus concerns](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/faegre-drinker-worldwide-office-closure-coronavirus/).

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Faegre Drinker’s partners took a “sizable” hit for the team at the start of April when announcing that they’d [deferred their distributions](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/newly-merged-megafirm-slashes-partner-pay-to-be-prudent-during-pandemic/) by one-third for the second quarter. Now comes news that later that month came firmwide salary reductions, coupled with staff furloughs. Here’s a relevant excerpt from the firm’s statement (available in full on the next page):

In response to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, Faegre Drinker’s partners led in absorbing the impact of the economic downturn by deferring a portion of distributions beginning on April 1. Following an internal announcement in mid-April, the firm also implemented a temporary, firmwide reduction in pay of 15% for other lawyers effective May 1. Professional consultant and staff pay has been reduced on a variable, compensation-based schedule, with no reductions for staff or consultants earning less than $50,000 graduating up to a 15% reduction for the most senior employees effective May 1. Faegre Drinker has also temporarily furloughed less than 1.5% of firm personnel, many of whom have responsibilities which are primarily office-based. Furloughed employees are maintaining firm benefits during the furlough period and also have access to state and federal benefits programs.

In addition to these furloughs, we’ve also heard about the layoffs of some personnel at Faegre Drinker. This is what the firm had to say about that:

Separately, Faegre Drinker’s leadership team has continued to advance a variety of combination-related integrations and synergies following the firm’s February 1, 2020 merger. Faegre Drinker completed the planned elimination of a small number of redundant staff positions created by the merger, representing 1.5% of total headcount, and continues to unify firm policies and procedures to realize combination-related efficiencies. Employees whose positions were eliminated due to the combination were provided with enhanced severance packages.

On top of all of that, the firm has deferred the start of its summer associate program to no earlier than July 6, 2020, and will likely be postponing the start date for its incoming first-year associates, but is “still considering options.”

Best of luck to those who suddenly find themselves without a steady paycheck in the middle of a pandemic/economic decline.

Across the nearly 300 posts on the subject, we’ve seen Texas just decide it was the new Manhattan, firms [eat their words](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/holdout-firm-flip-flops-on-salary/), the death of [the vaunted Jones Day black box](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-jig-is-up-opening-up-jones-days-black-box/) compensation scheme, and Hunton & Williams do… [whatever the hell they’re doing](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/am-law-100-firm-raises-salaries-kind-of/). But what does it all mean?

# More Prominent Prosecutors Leaving For Private Practice
## Some recent notable moves from government to private practice.

A leading indicator when it comes to the health of law firms: an increasingly rapid spinning of the revolving door between government and private practice. When times are good, top prosecutors and other government lawyers get wooed by leading law firms that are flush with cash; when times are bad, these lawyers hang on to their secure government jobs for dear life.

Over the past few years, a number of top Justice Department lawyers have headed for private practice. Last year, of course, former attorney general Eric Holder [returned to Covington & Burling](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/morning-docket-07-06-15/), where he was reunited with former criminal division head [Lanny Breuer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-business/post/lanny-breuer-chief-of-dojs-criminal-division-returns-to-covington-and-burling/2013/03/27/3b27d7a6-9703-11e2-b68f-dc5c4b47e519_blog.html).

More recently, former acting associate attorney general Stuart Delery [joined Gibson Dunn](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202767091350/Top-Obama-DOJ-Official-Stuart-Delery-Lands-at-Gibson-Dunn?slreturn=20160826151351) earlier this month. And the revolving door spins on the plaintiffs’ side too: Sean McKessy, former head of the SEC’s whistleblower program, recently moved to Phillips & Cohen, a top law firm in the qui tam space.

The moves are happening closer to home as well. Here in New York, prominent prosecutors are leaving the legendary Southern District of New York for greener pastures. The latest notable move, reported by the [New York Law Journal](http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202768277602/SDNY-Narcotics-Unit-Chief-Leaves-to-Join-Boutique?slreturn=20160826145141):

Litigation boutique MoloLamken has brought on Jessica Ortiz, the former chief of the narcotics unit at the Southern District U.S. Attorney’s Office. Ortiz is the first woman partner of the 25-attorney boutique….

Ortiz, 38, spent the last eight years at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, including a year and a half as head of the narcotics unit. She left in July.

She led 15 jury trials to conviction and worked on cases related to fraud, computer crimes, corporate embezzlement, public corruption involving city officials, health care fraud, organized crime, narcotics and murder.

With all this trial experience, Ortiz will fit right in at the elite boutique. Even though many of its partners came over from Biglaw, where settling cases is the order of the day, MoloLamken is a firm that [actually goes to trial](http://www.mololamken.com/firm.html).

Some other notable S.D.N.Y. departures (not intended to be an exhaustive list, of course):

Speaking of APDA, a number of ex-debaters — [Mark Oppenheimer](https://twitter.com/markopp1), [Jed Shugerman](https://twitter.com/jedshug), and [yours truly](https://twitter.com/davidlat) — will be live-tweeting the presidential debate tonight.)
- [Nicole Friedlander](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/business/dealbook/sullivan-cromwell-hires-nicole-friedlander-as-counsel-for-online-security.html): the former chief of the complex frauds and cybercrime unit joined Sullivan & Cromwell as counsel — make that [special counsel](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/NicoleW-Friedlander) — this month. This also makes sense; S&C senior chairman [Rodge Cohen](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/HRodgin-Cohen/) believes that [threats to cybersecurity](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/07/5-insights-on-representing-the-banking-industry-from-rodge-cohen-of-sullivan-cromwell/) are a major threat to American business.
- [Jessica Masella](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/news/2016/08/veteran-sdny-lawyer-jessica-masella/): the former co-chief of the narcotics unit became a DLA Piper partner in August.
- [Brendan McGuire](https://www.wilmerhale.com/brendan_mcguire/): A former head of both the public corruption unit and the terrorism unit, McGuire [joined the partnership of WilmerHale](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/business/dealbook/brendan-mcguire-prosecutor-in-terrorism-cases-to-join-private-law-firm.html) in May. (A shout-out to our shared alma mater, Regis High School.)
- [Sara Shudofsky](http://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/s/shudofsky-sara): the former head of the civil division [joined Arnold & Porter](http://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/news/2016/06/former-chief-of-sdny-civil-division-sara-shudofsky) as a partner in June.
And what about U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara himself? I suspect that the high-powered prosecutor has his sights on elected office — but if he were to cool his heels at the law firm in the interim, he’d be able to negotiate quite a deal for himself.

Should we be troubled by how rapidly the revolving door turns? It certainly raises concerns, and former government lawyers and the firms that hire them must make sure that they comply with all applicable rules of legal ethics.

Should those rules be tightened, to prevent such moves or to require a long period of time before a jump? I’m not sure that’s possible without negatively affecting the ranks of lawyers who are willing to enter government service. Working in public service is already a financial sacrifice, but lawyers are willing to do it because they know that they can make it up later in the private sector. If we deny them even that possibility, we must be prepared for a serious decline in both the number and quality of lawyers who are willing to go into government.

Critics of the revolving door might call it a former of “soft corruption.” Even assuming that’s true, it strikes me as far better than the hard corruption of a Sheldon Silver.

# Former Biglaw Partner Barred From Courthouse, Faces Discipline
## There are some wild filings in the case.

George Jackson III, a former federal prosecutor and former Polsinelli shareholder, has been temporarily banned from a Chicago criminal courthouse — unless accompanied by sheriff’s deputies — after being held in criminal contempt four times. Jackson also faces possible suspension — the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission [recommended](https://www.iardc.org/File/View/1663315?FileName=In%20re%20George%20Jackson%20III%2C%20Attorney%20Number%206189680.pdf) a three-year suspension until further notice for his behavior.

Jackson, whose [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-jackson-iii-a2903222/) now says he’s the managing partner of something called the Dred Scott law firm, earned the discipline while representing his brother in a criminal case. Anthony Jackson was ultimately convicted of murder after claiming he acted in self-defense for beating a stranger on a train platform. During the course of his brother’s criminal cases, there were two trials after Jackson helped his brother obtain a retrial after his first conviction, Jackson filed court documents filled with sexually explicit tangents, displayed hostility to Jewish people, and accused judges and prosecutors in the case of conspiring against his brother.

The ABA Journal [summarizes](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/former-biglaw-partner-temporarily-barred-from-courthouse-should-be-suspended-board-says) Jackson’s behavior:

• Alleged that the first judge in the case was biased against him and criticized the judge for an in-chambers meeting with a prosecutor. The judge had told Jackson that he and the prosecutor were discussing closed cases and DNA evidence.

• Said the judge “forever foreclosed his ability to be a fair judge” in matters involving Cook County prosecutors. Jackson said the “miscreant behaviors” of the judge and the prosecutor were “in a word, stupid.” And he said the judge “mirrors in clone-like fashion the Jack Nicholson character Colonel Nathan Jessup in A Few Good Men, a narcissist with unchecked hubris freely and knowingly violating rules he considers being nothing more than inconvenient nuisances.”

• Included a graphic description of the abduction of two “Jewish females,” a “mother and pre-bat mitzvah daughter,” and the rape of the fictional daughter by “Guy Black, aka ‘Meatman,’ a moniker bestowed on Guy because of his physical endowment.”

• Wrote: “What better way to emasculate a cadre of African American and Hispanic male defendants than to have them prosecuted by white women at the direction of a pseudo Black woman guided by a Jewish man, and under the presiding control of a white judge, who in turn meets in private with the Jewish man in promoting the goals of the pseudo Black woman?” Jackson said his mention of a “pseudo Black woman guided by a Jewish man” was a reference to Cook County State’s Attorney Kimberly Foxx and his opposing counsel.

• Alleged that judges are demonstrating “extremely diabolical prejudice” against him, and that one of the judges is “woefully intellectually challenged.”

• Said “a Jew or white man” would never be banned from the courthouse as he was. The requirement that he be accompanied by deputies, he said, was akin to ordering a Jewish man to “take this train to mandatory summer camp.”

• In a motion titled “Modern-Day Emmett Till,” said one white female prosecutor was “entirely unattractive,” although she “thankfully she lacks the feminine hygiene slight body odor of her former co-prosecutor.”

• In a motion for a change of venue, said Cook County judges “have concertedly manifested a street-gang psychosis of protecting its imagined turf and fellow members instead of following the law.”

The hearing board called Jackson’s behavior “egregious,” and his comments about opposing counsel “were reprehensible and have no place in the practice of law.” They also noted that Jackson continued to justify his comments and “displayed little to no recognition of or remorse for the impact his derogatory remarks had on others.”

Despite Jackson’s denial that the “stress of representing his brother in a murder trial affected his behavior, the fact that the misconduct was related only to that representation suggests otherwise.”

Jackson has not yet commented on the board’s recommendation.

# Being Bad With Numbers Is Forgivable, But You'd Think A Big Firm Would Know Better Than To Allegedly Facilitate Fraud
## Ah, the old Russian nesting dolls defense to fraud.

Ssshhhh… how could they know?

Few things grind my gears more than multimillion-dollar companies using bankruptcy to avoid paying out the money that they’ve hidden away. [But enough about Johnson & Johnson snubbing cancer patients](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/09/whose-remedy-is-it-anyway-the-future-of-product-liability-could-depend-on-it/) — this is about Biglaw. BakerHostetler, a national law firm specializing in business and tax, was recently accused of facilitating fraud in the order of about $100M.

A liquidating trustee for a reorganized pharmacy company has filed an adversary complaint in a Texas bankruptcy court, accusing law firm BakerHostetler of helping facilitate a $100 million insurance billing fraud scheme before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017.

In the [complaint ](https://assets.law360news.com/1535000/1535995/upliftbakercomplaint.pdf)filed on Sept. 26, trustee Yvette Austin Smith said Alliance Health Networks undertook a scheme to submit false insurance reimbursement claims for blood glucose testing strips that purported to be for supplying retail products, when in fact it was selling mail-order, not-for-retail strips that were cheaper than the retail items it billed for.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Wondering how somebody could go about this and think they’d get away scot-free? I hope you remember the finer details from your Corporations outline.

The suit accuses BakerHostetler of helping create a corporate structure that attempted to shield the company from liability for the alleged fraud, which Smith said cost the company and several test strip makers more than $100 million.

…

“Baker was fully aware of the company’s improper practices, but elected to assist Alliance’s efforts to hide its scheme by serving as Alliance’s first line of defense against [pharmacy benefit managers’] attempts to examine its activities,” the complaint said. “Baker helped Alliance evade scrutiny by designing a complex ownership structure that shielded the reality of Alliance’s ownership from PBMs that might have uncovered the fraud.”

No matter how complex the corporate structure, you’re gonna get damn near Enigma code levels of corporate cryptography when several thousands of dollars are on the line, let alone millions.

If you’d like to do some digging on your own, this should get you started:

# Top Biglaw Firm Pulls The Plug On September Return To Office Due To Delta Variant
## Another one bites the dust. Will attorneys be working from home until 2022?

Many Biglaw firms are still intending to reopen their offices to all attorneys and staff members later this month. Earlier this week, we mentioned that these early fall return dates may be [a tad unrealistic](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/09/will-biglaw-firms-be-forced-into-2022-office-reopenings/) considering the far-ranging spread of the Delta variant. After all, quite a few firms have already pushed back their return-to-office dates to late October, and others still won’t expect employees back in the office until January 2022.

Well, we hate to say we told you so, but… yet another firm has decided to postpone its plans to go back to the office in September.

Reed Smith — which brought in $1,310,596,000 gross revenue in 2020, placing it at #26 in the Am Law 100 — will no longer be expecting to see its employees in the office next week. Here’s a statement we received from a firm spokesperson:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Last month, Reed Smith announced that it is postponing the “full reopening” of its U.S. offices, which had been set for September 13, because of the surge in COVID cases driven by the Delta variant. Lawyers and most professional staff, those with hybrid and fully flexible work status, can continue to work remotely until further notice. Essential personnel will continue to work from the office, adhering to all safety protocols.

The firm’s U.S. offices remain open, and fully vaccinated personnel can work on-site if they so choose. Office access is limited to fully vaccinated personnel, and we continue to ensure that our people and visitors comply with all health and safety measures. We will stay in close communication with our people about reopening plans and will continue to prioritize the health and safety of all.

Will Reed Smith join the firms that are opting to open in October, or will it forgo 2021 return altogether? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see.

Help us help you. Let us know what your firm is doing to protect employees and adjust to the new normal during this unprecedented moment in time.

As soon as you find out about the reopening plan at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

# Technology Allows Law School Students To Work On A Deal Before Joining Biglaw

For those of us who entered law school without any experience of the legal world beyond what we’d seen on television, it’s no real surprise that we mostly ended up as litigators. That’s the practice we were all familiar with and law school didn’t do us any favors, crafting even the most transactional of subjects around court cases. Litigation rules everything around you in law school.

But there’s a lot more to legal practice than litigation. In fact, you might be setting yourself up for a better long-term career if you go out and try your hand at some corporate work. But how does a law student (or prospective law student) get some hands-on experience to let them know if they have the stomach to be drafting documents all day?

As you might suspect if you’ve ever read any article ever, this is the point where just such an opportunity is unveiled.

InsideSherpa is an open-access platform that seeks to connect people with potential careers by offering virtual work assignments that allow candidates to try out real — though anonymized — “day in the life” scenarios to test what it would be like to work in a particular field. The company already hosts experiences for Deloitte, KPMG, and Grant Thornton, and now White & Case has joined the platform.

Antonia Choi, White & Case’s Global Recruiting head, explains how a platform like this supercharges recruiting efforts:

While we can always talk about what law students can expect at White & Case, that’s no substitute for rolling up their sleeves and really experiencing the type of work they’ll be exposed to. InsideSherpa and our team worked closely together to design this program so that it resonates with students, and we think that they’ll enjoy completing the modules and seeing what it takes to succeed at the firm.

This virtual law firm experience, which [you can tackle here](https://www.insidesherpa.com/virtual-internships/prototype/pLAadpKXXzALFSAh5/White-%26-Case-Virtual-Experience-Program) (assuming you’re a college or law student — though if you aren’,t I’m not sure why you’d be doing it anyway), allows candidates to take on a Project Finance, M&A, or IP matter. The program is self-paced and takes about 5 to 6 hours to complete.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Here’s the background of the M&A assignment:

The Consortium intends to make an equity investment of $200 million in CopperCo by acquiring 15% of its shares. This investment is in addition to the $900 million loan covered in the Project Finance Module. The Consortium will incorporate a new company (called InvestCo) to facilitate this investment. After the transaction, ChileCo will own 85% of CopperCo’s shares, and InvestCo will own the remaining 15%.

InvestCo and ChileCo will enter into a joint venture agreement – this agreement will set out the rules between the companies with regard to their investment in CopperCo. A joint venture agreement will regulate things such as what happens when there is a dispute between the parties, under what circumstances can the shares be transferred, what the voting threshold is to make certain company decisions and so on.

Your supervising Partner, Sanjay, asks you to join the conference call where the attorneys of each consortium member will negotiate key aspects of the joint venture agreement. In particular, the part of the negotiation between the attorneys focusing on the exit matrix to be drafted in the joint venture agreement. The attorneys will agree on the triggers for drag-along and tag-along rights.

The experience then provides a 3-minute phone call to take notes on and a charge to draft a memo to the GC of the lead institution. The notes and the memo are uploaded to the system and the candidate is provided with model work.

It’s a cool way to afford folks a crack at how work really gets done. And from White & Case’s perspective, it puts the firm’s name first and foremost for students who find that they may have a real knack for tackling these practice areas.

And you don’t even have to fly to a warehouse in Topeka to learn how the industry works!

# 10 Ways To Invest In Yourself As In-House Counsel
## You may not have stuck to that gym resolution or ever gotten around to decluttering your home, but you can still accomplish some goals before the year ends.

When you’re putting out fires on a day-to-day basis and are on call after call and in meeting after meeting, it’s easy to forget about yourself and your own personal or professional development. Despite having set goals at the beginning of your year and having had the best of intentions, you may find yourself taking a breather, only to realize that somehow it is already September, and you haven’t done a single thing for yourself. If this is you, don’t give up. You still have time.

Here is a list of 10 ways you can still invest in yourself before year’s end.

1. Use Your PTO

With only one quarter left, if you haven’t taken a vacation, you have definitely earned it! Pull out your calendar now and schedule some time off, even if it’s a one-day spa visit. Even if you have taken vacation, look at your bank, and see what’s left, and consider whether you need to use it or lose it.

2. Attend A Conference

Conferences, if done well, are a great way to invest in yourself. Substantively, you can get your continuing legal education and can learn how to be more valuable to your client. At the same time, you can also broaden your network, meet new people, or deepen the relationships you have at a conference. Do this especially if your company is willing to pay for it. But even if they don’t, you may want to consider it as an investment in yourself.

3. Connect With A Mentor

Chances are that if you’ve been swamped, you have not taken the time to connect with your mentor. Schedule that time now. And if you don’t have one, block off some time on your calendar to work on finding one.

4. Attend A CLE

If a conference is too much to ask for right now based on what you have on your plate, attend a CLE, whether in person or virtually — and actually pay attention. Take notes and consider sharing something you learned at your next team meeting.

5. Work On Your “Done” List

Consider making the time to review the projects and work you’ve done this year and the impact they have had and make a list. This will be helpful when performance review time comes. It’s also a great way to reflect on what else you might want to do before the year’s end and the type of work you want to ask for next.

6. Spruce Up Your Resume

Even if you’re very happy where you’re at, it doesn’t hurt to always have a current resume ready, just in case an amazing opportunity comes along. When those opportunities open up, you want to be one of the first to apply and not end up panic-revising your resume.

7. Update Your LinkedIn

Same advice as above — even if you’re happy where you’re at, when recruiters are looking for candidates, LinkedIn is often one of the first places they stop. Even if your LinkedIn is simple, the best impression is for it to also be current, whether it’s your experiences or your photo.

8. Connect With A Colleague

Whether it’s grabbing coffee with a legal colleague you haven’t talked to lately or scheduling a 15-minute meet-and-greet with a new business colleague, invest the time. You can grow your network or learn something new about the business.

9. Consult A Coach

If you have a specific development goal in mind, you may want to consider retaining a coach to help you and to provide accountability. It could be growing your brand or how to be a better manager or how to speak with more credibility. Some organizations, like the Association of Corporate Counsel, provide you a complimentary session as a member. Also check out what your company might offer.

10. Review And Take Advantage Of Your Benefits

This may sound like a strange one, but when you’re busy, you may not have noticed new perks that your company launched, such as free access to a meditation app or complimentary coaching. There are also likely free courses, like tips and tricks on using One Note or some other app, that can make your job easier.

# NCAA's Latest March Madness? Winston & Strawn's Bills.
## In one shining moment, plaintiffs' attorneys can make bank.

While the NCAA’s marquee annual sporting event is heaping cash into its coffers, the group has a potential looming Biglaw bill that could put a damper on the month’s festivities.

Last year, the NCAA went to trial over an effort to cap education-related benefits for certain college athletes and ultimately lost, getting slapped with an injunction earlier this month. Now the [plaintiffs’ attorneys are looking for fees](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/03/27/plaintiffs-in-latest-ncaa-antitrust-case-seek-nearly-45m-in-fees-405-34124/) and the bill is a hefty one.

Winston & Strawn, along with co-counsel at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro and Pearson, Simon & Warshaw, have submitted a bill for services rendered. The bill represents over 51,000 hours of work put in by attorneys and staff behind the scenes to secure this historic ruling. [One might say to those folks](https://davidbarrett.com/one-shining-moment-lyrics/)…

And all the years
no one knows
just how hard you worked
but now it shows…

And boy does it show. Counsel submitted a request that amounts to $29,944,894, but they’re asking for a 1.5x multiplier, making the total bill around $45 million.

What is interesting to legal observers about this request is what it says about the course of Biglaw’s business model over the last few years. For those who’ve fretted over the last several years that law firm growth is driven primarily by jacking up billing rates as opposed to genuine improvements in demand, a closer look at the bills shows just how pronounced those rate hikes have been. Jeffrey Kessler, the sports law guru running the case for Winston, was billing $1,180/hour when the case started in 2014. Five years later, Kessler is billing out at $1,515/hour. That’s about 28 percent more. Other attorneys saw a similar bump. According to American Lawyer, “Partner David Feher’s rate went from $960 to $1,245 in the same span, and partner David Greenspan’s rate rose from $875 to $1,105.”

Oh, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that first-year associates are only making about 18 percent more over that stretch.

Is that a sustainable growth model? Well, so far clients seem to be paying — at least at the top levels of the profession. Only time will tell if there comes a breaking point where some firms have to admit that demand for their services isn’t Plastic Man levels of elastic.

This is certainly a significant bill, but while the mainstream press may wring its hands over the high cost of legal work, let’s remember that the NCAA is estimated to make $1 billion over the three weeks of the tournament, so maybe they don’t need your tears.

# Am Law 100 Firm Announced Bonuses While U.S. Capitol Was Under Attack
## And the firm didn't include special bonuses, to boot.

The perfect time to announce bonuses. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)

Yesterday, while our very democracy was under siege by Trump acolytes and MAGA cultists at the U.S. Capitol, one Am Law 100 firm decided it was prime time to announce its year-end bonuses. Unfortunately, announcing bonuses during a violent coup attempt wasn’t enough to hide the fact that the firm wouldn’t be offering special bonuses to associates.

Which firm would do such a thing?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
The firm in question here is Cadwalader. If you recall, the firm was one of the first to [institute COVID-19 austerity measures](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/am-law-100-firm-cuts-partner-pay-entirely-associate-salaries-by-25-percent/) back in March, with partners going without pay and associates and staff facing 25 percent and 10 percent salary cuts, respectively. In July, the firm [reversed course](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/07/am-law-100-firm-reverses-course-on-salary-cuts-meant-to-avoid-layoffs/), announcing that everyone’s salaries would be restored to their pre-pandemic levels. Yesterday, amid the chaos that consumed the nation’s capital, the firm not only announced that it would reimburse employee salaries (in full for administrative staff without any billable requirements, and in full for legal staff who had billed 1400 or more client hours in 2020), but it also announced bonuses matching the Cravath year-end scale for associates and special counsel (who billed 1900 client hours):



While the firm is offering bonuses “equal to 120% of the amounts listed above” for those who billed 2200 client hours or more during the pandemic (which is quite generous), eagle-eyed attorneys were quick to notice that Cadwalader made no mention of special bonuses — and they’re pretty pissed. Granted, this is one of the least important things to be concerned about right now given what’s going on in America, but this is where they work, and they’re rightfully upset.

Here are some reactions we received from sources at the firm:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The firm’s email ignores that “peer firms” are paying special bonuses this year. The firm didn’t even try to pretend it was matching by tying special bonuses to hours. Given how many times we’ve been told Litigation is having a blockbuster year and Corporate/Financial Services is doing better than expected, this feels like a major F you by the partners.

Associates in busy groups got slammed in 2020 and it’s pretty embarrassing that CWT isn’t paying them market comp like peer firms are. Already hearing from associates in those busy groups that they’re ready to leave if CWT doesn’t come through. I think CWT will see some very high attrition from high-billing associates who were shocked to learn today that they work at a below-market firm.

This is a major concession by CWT that it no longer even considers itself a top New York firm. I’ve been at the firm for many years, and this is the first time they’ve refused to pay NY market rates to associates across the board. That’s a surprising concession that Cadwalader is stepping out of the hotly competitive NY lateral market, settling instead for competing among sub-market firms. It’s also particularly insulting to associates after the firm heavily invested in expensive lateral partner recruiting in recent months and reported a profitable year for the partnership.

Perhaps Cadwalader’s leaders will change their minds and make haste with special bonus payouts, but attorneys at the firm won’t be holding their breath to find out.

(Flip to the next page to read the full Cadwalader memo.)

What's going on with these Florida public defenders?

But they're telling GCs it's the clients' fault for not pushing firms harder to change. Holy blame the victim, Batman. [[Law360](http://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/791281)] * As some of you may have heard by now, Milbank Tweed is ditching its downtown home for relatively law firm-free Chelsea.

[[Real Estate Weekly](http://rew-online.com/2016/05/05/law-firm-to-take-250000-sf-at-hudson-yards/)] * Law school rechristening its building over its namesake's KKK ties.

[[CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oklahoma-law-school-removing-founders-name-over-kkk-ties/)] * Judge Alan Simon has already received a suspension after a commission found a ""history of bullying and verbally abusing court staffers"" and now he may be losing his job.

[[Corporate Counsel](http://www.corpcounsel.com/id=1202756818515/When-Weed-Comes-to-the-Workplace)] * A breakthrough, ""gotcha"" moment on cross-examination in a big case is such a holy grail achievement of Matlockian proportions that we should celebrate it whenever it happens. Skadden managed to net one in a $2.1 billion suit this week. [[Litigation Daily](http://www.litigationdaily.com/id=1202756725432/On-Cross-a-Gotcha-for-Skadden-Litigator-in-21B-Mortgage-Suit)] * Kirkland & Ellis offering ""emotional fitness training"" at its offices. Pretty sure the curriculum for Biglaw attorneys should be a primer on [Wheaton's Law](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law) and [this video](https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/30150000/nocrying.gif) with the word ""baseball"" replaced with ""law.""

Skadden managed to net one in a $2.1 billion suit this week. [[Litigation Daily](http://www.litigationdaily.com/id=1202756725432/On-Cross-a-Gotcha-for-Skadden-Litigator-in-21B-Mortgage-Suit)]

# Law Firms Need To Market Their Knowledge And Use Of AI

It’s not a matter of whether law firms will need to market their knowledge and use of AI (artificial intelligence), it’s a matter of when. The smart law firms are going to start now.

I walked out of last week’s [Legal Marketing Association Annual Meeting](http://www.legalmarketing.org/annual_conference) (LMA) seeing the single biggest marketing opportunity for law firms as demonstrating a keen knowledge of AI and how AI is going to change the delivery of legal services.

I’ve been to LMA meetings for almost twenty years and have never even heard AI mentioned before. AI and machine learning may have been discussed in relation to e-discovery, but this year there were multiple sessions with legal technology and software presenting on AI.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Why now? Because the tools that consumers of legal services expect law firms to use will bring fundamental change to law firms’ traditional business model, that being to charge solely by the hour.

Businesses and consumers are not going to tolerate law firms charging for hours spent on tasks and projects which can be automated by software and AI.

The age of AI may not fully be upon law firms, but the consensus at LMA was close to what [Richard Susskind](http://www.susskind.com), author, speaker and advisor on the future of legal services, had to say at this year’s [British Legal Technology Forum](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/susskind-british-legal-technology-forum-2017/):

People are probably over-estimating what AI can do in the near term, but unfortunately [they] are underestimating what its impact is going to be long term in the industry.

AI is close enough along though that [Mark Greene](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-t-greene-phd-2815086/), a 30-year veteran in the development and deployment of business and marketing strategies, warned new associates that they should become knowledgeable on new tools and AI so as to remain valuable to the firm. Going the traditional partner track is much riskier, per Greene.

Former big law attorney, now Professor of law and Director of [LegalRND](http://legalrnd.org) at Michigan State University, [Daniel Linna](http://www.legaltechlever.com) commented [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kokeefe/posts/10154487965421696?comment_id=10154489246106696&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D&pnref=story) about the growing efficiencies that software and tools are already bringing to the law, saying it’s a mistake to ignore expert systems (or some might call them bots–think Turbo Tax for law).

The legal industry across the board could significantly increase productivity (double?) and also quality with better knowledge management and expert systems. Look at what [Illinois Legal Aid Online](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org) and [Michigan Help Online](http://michiganlegalhelp.org) can do with expert systems and document automation.

Many law firms are building expert systems, like [Foley FCPA](https://www.foley.com/foley-introduces-industrys-first-web-based-affordable-fcpa-compliance-solution-02-03-2015/), Akerman data breach navigator, Denton’s for European financial regulations, NetApp & ThinkSmart NDA automation. Lots of low hanging fruit.

AI folks say lots in legal cannot be automated because legal work is unstructured. Well, let’s start structuring it. We need more best practices and standards. Why do lawyers, even in the same firm, do the same task 10 different ways?

One way for law firms to market their knowledge of AI is to use AI — or at least tools and software approaching AI.

In addition to the firms mentioned by Linna, Seyfarth Shaw, in connection with subsidiary SeyfarthLean Consulting, [announced](http://www.seyfarth.com/news/seyfarth-shaw-blue-prism-bring-robotic-process-automation-to-legal-industry) in February an agreement with [Blue Prism](http://www.blueprism.com) to deploy robotic process automation (RPA) software to the firm, marking the first adoption of Blue Prism’s technology for the legal industry.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Blue Prism’s software robots are implemented as digital labor to eliminate low-return, high-risk, administrative and processing work to improve organizational efficiency and effectiveness while reducing operating costs.

Seyfarth’s chair emeritus [Stephen Poor](http://www.seyfarth.com/SPoor) sends a message we’re going to hear the likes of more frequently.

We’re excited about the opportunity this creates to free our lawyers from some of the more mundane legal tasks so they can focus on helping our clients solve their most complex business issues. In testing various use cases, we’ve already seen how Blue Prism’s RPA software can help us create exponential gains in productivity, and we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of possibilities.

CARA, an automated research assistant from [Casetext](https://casetext.com), uses AI and natural-language technologies to automate legal research tasks, allowing firms to spend time on higher-value, billable work—and not miss key precedents or decisions.

Quinn Emanuel quickly [got the word out](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170322005380/en/AI-Based-Legal-Research-Firm-Casetext-Closes-12), as part of Casetext’s recent funding announcement, that they’re on board with Cara. From partner [David Eiseman](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/eiseman-david):

CARA is an invaluable, innovative research tool. We can upload a brief and within seconds receive additional case law suggestions and relevant information on how cases have been used in the past, all in a user-friendly interface. This feature is unique to CARA, and a major step forward in how legal research is done.

“Important for law firms to understand,” per Greene “is that they’ll not be driving this change in legal services and business models with regard to AI, their clients will. The best thing firms can do is to be informed.”

Being informed is not enough. Lawyers and law firms will need to demonstrate that they are informed and have a working knowledge of AI.

Sure, writing and speaking about AI in the traditional fashion, is a start. But networking through the Internet via blogging and social media offers lawyers so much more – the ability to become a leader in the area.

Listen to the influential sources and key subjects (including terms, companies and products) on AI via Feedly. Share what you’re reading via Twitter, engage the sources and what they’re saying in your blog.

Doing so will get you cited by the influencers, demonstrate you’re keeping abreast of developments in AI and build an enviable network of those in the know on AI.

Doing a quick look around, I did not see lawyers out blogging on AI in a way that separates them from the pack. The opportunity is still there.

AI may even be the perfect place for law students and associates to start doing some online networking and blogging. Look at what Greene had to say about demonstrating your value — knowledge of AI.

Hey, I am am far from an expert when it comes to AI. But I do see a big marketing opportunity here for law firms.

If law firms have jumped on cannabis, food safety, and consumer finance regulations to make a name for themselves, firms can do it with AI — via the use of AI, or at least demonstrating a working knowledge of AI.

# If Biglaw Firms Want To Remain 'Elite,' They Need To Match Milbank's Money Moves

The elite firms match the market rate. It’s not even really a decision these firms can make. They just have to do it. If somebody falls behind, then all of a sudden, it is a differentiator.

— Bruce MacEwen of law firm consultancy Adam Smith Esq., commenting on the most [recent round of raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) that are slowly but surely[ spreading across the Biglaw landscape](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/associate-raises-are-back-will-fewer-law-firms-follow-this-time-2022-01-25/). Thus far, 16 law firms have matched [Milbank’s new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/), and one has told associates it is “monitoring [salary] changes” but has [not yet committed to matching](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/norton-rose-no-match/).

On Wednesday, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released its report, [Trauma at the Border: The Human Cost of Inhumane Immigration Policies](https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2019/10-24-Trauma-at-the-Border.pdf).

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Testimony received from asylum seekers, legal experts, and other witnesses to the impacts of changes in immigration policy at the southern border. The report focuses on the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents, and the housing and medical care provided to asylum seekers and other immigrants while detained. The report concludes that the impact of separating immigrant families and indefinite detention is widespread, long-term, and may inflict irreversible physical, mental and emotional trauma.

Despite an Executive Order purporting to stop family separation, there remain credible allegations that family separations continue. The Commission also heard directly from immigrant detainees who confirmed traumatic experiences as a result of enduring inhumane conditions at detention facilities and cruel treatment by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel….

Further, these policies disparately impact people of color, particularly Latinos, and agencies continue inequitable treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, individuals with disabilities, and non-English speakers.

As I’ve [previously stated](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/in-honor-of-world-refugee-day-lets-admit-america-is-breaking-conventions-it-once-held-dear/), although [seeking asylum is legal](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/whats-really-happening-asylum-seeking-families-separated/), we have now begun to treat this process as criminal. We have not only violated international treaties ([Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees)) for those fleeing persecution and seeking [safe harbor](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/01/29/america-did-aylan-kurdi-die-in-vain/) — but we have ripped away people’s kids from them with [suspect plans](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adolfoflores/dhs-border-patrol-ice-orr-no-reunification-children-parents?utm_term=.rnWrVQz7zl#.veN0M17P7b) for reunification. Not even in the Japanese internment camps did we separate innocent actors from their children.

The Trump administration has been executing its immigration restriction plans at a [record pace](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article236539203.html). From its intent on reducing [asylum](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/u-s-claims-reducing-refugee-numbers-helps-with-the-asylum-backlog-will-it) application and increasing [“public charge”](https://citylimits.org/2019/10/23/after-the-injunction-trumps-public-charge-rule-explained/) requirements to establishing a [“zero tolerance”](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/20/734496862/how-the-trump-administrations-zero-tolerance-policy-changed-the-immigration-deba) policy and third version of a [travel ban](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/a-guide-to-some-major-trump-administration-immigration-policies/), one needs [a guide](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/a-guide-to-some-major-trump-administration-immigration-policies/) to keep up with the [consequential](https://www.aila.org/infonet/deaths-at-adult-detention-centers) and [collateral damage](https://www.aila.org/advo-media/issues/all/featured-issue-end-family-separation-and-the-zero) resulting from this administration’s attack on [current immigration laws](https://www.aila.org/advo-media/press-releases) and [conventions](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/in-honor-of-world-refugee-day-lets-admit-america-is-breaking-conventions-it-once-held-dear/). If you have some time today, I highly recommend you review the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights [report](https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2019/10-24-Trauma-at-the-Border.pdf).

This week, we spent some time with Pitt Law alum and Sidley Austin partner [Marketa Lindt](https://www.sidley.com/en/people/l/lindt-marketa), who shared her current thoughts on immigration law and how her background shaped her career, as well as advice for others who are passionate about diversity and inclusion.

Lindt currently serves as the national President of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). She regularly speaks at national and regional conferences regarding business immigration law and I-9 compliance. She is a primary author of the immigration law and practice treatise Business Immigration Law. She has also authored articles for a number of leading immigration texts, including AILA’s Guide to Worksite Enforcement and Compliance, the Guide to PERM Labor Certification, and numerous annual editions of the Immigration & Nationality Law Handbook.

In addition to her business practice at Sidley, Lindt is committed to providing access to counsel for underserved immigrants. She serves in an advisory capacity to several Chicago-area cultural institutions and organizations that provide assistance to underserved immigrant communities. For a number of years, she has served as a member of the Leadership Board of the National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago.

Without further ado, here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation:

Renwei Chung (RC): Your family immigrated from the Netherlands to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. What was that like?

Marketa Lindt (ML): I was nine when I left the Netherlands to move to my new life in the U.S. with my parents and my two younger sisters. Leaving my grandmother, my friends, my school, and life as I knew it was both exciting and scary. I had started to learn a little English — Dutch kids begin English classes in the 4th grade — but I didn’t speak the language when I arrived. And everything seemed very different.

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Moving to the U.S. was a good career opportunity for my father, who had finally achieved his goal of working as an engineering professor at a university. And kids are very adaptable and resilient. I actually watched Sesame Street as a 4th grader to learn English and understand American culture better. So I learned English, began to make friends, and soon learned all kinds of interesting things about my new home.

RC: After you graduated University of Pittsburgh School of Law, you moved to Chicago. Can you tell us more about this and how you decided to embark on your career path?

ML: I had obtained my JD and a master’s degree in international affairs with the goal of working in human rights law. I had initially planned to work for an international organization in refugee law, but after working with Haitian refugees during law school decided to stay in the U.S. and work in the immigration field.

During law school, I worked with an immigration law firm in Pittsburgh and had intended to continue working there after graduation, when suddenly a job presented itself with a nonprofit organization working in the Chicago immigrant communities. I was young and unattached and couldn’t refuse an opportunity to live in one of America’s great cities.

I fell in love with Chicago the moment I arrived — the grit, the energy, the diverse urban communities — and have been thrilled to live and work in this amazing city ever since.

RC: In June, you became the AILA president. What has AILA been focusing on this year?

ML: I am serving as national president of AILA during a very challenging time in immigration law, where the agency is focused on limiting immigration to the U.S. in asylum, family reunification, and even business immigration. In my role as AILA president, my primary priority is to push back on these harmful policies and to work toward lawful, fair, and humane implementation of the immigration law for families and U.S. businesses.

We just hired an impact litigator and are working to educate and train the immigration bar to better challenge the implementation of these restrictive, and sometimes unlawful, policies in federal court.

We are focusing on the humanitarian crisis on the southern border and advocating for the transition of the politicized administrative immigration courts to an Article I court. And we are increasing our wellness and practice management programs to help immigration lawyers survive this very difficult time in our practice.

RC: As with many of my discussions, we somehow hit upon our mutual adoration of the musical [Hamilton](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/after-seeing-hamilton-im-convinced-our-democracy-go-renwei-chung/). Any particular scenes or themes you enjoy about this musical?

ML: One of my favorite parts of seeing Hamilton in Chicago was that I had a very special evening with my daughter, who was extremely excited to be there. But I personally was amazed at the number of interesting themes packed into a historical rap musical.

Of course, as an immigration lawyer, I loved the famous Hamilton quote, “Immigrants — we get the job done,” as it reminded me of all of the hardworking and talented clients that I have the privilege to represent.

But I also appreciated the themes of seizing your opportunities when they arise; of forgiveness and reconciliation; and most of all, of working hard and making sacrifices for a cause that you believe during the time you have.

RC: How do you think we can effectively advance diversity and inclusion efforts in today’s political climate?

ML: Diversity and inclusion is a critical value and goal, both within the legal profession and within the immigration bar. First, I think we need to continue to push forward the ongoing efforts to diversify the legal profession — the research, analysis, program development and implementation, education, and dialogue about diversity and inclusion that has helped us make progress to date.

Second, allies of diversity and inclusion are more important than ever and we should be working to mobilize them in support of our goals.

And, third, we need to keep working to engage across the spectrum on this critical issue, both with those who agree that diversity and inclusion are important values and goals as well as those who question those values or have not thought about them.

RC: What advice do you have for attorneys who want to begin a career in public service?

ML: My main advice is to know what drives you and to follow your passion. I have worked both in non-profit and in private practice, and I enjoyed both at different times in my career.

For some people, civic engagement means working at a law firm or in-house and then supplementing it with performing pro bono work, serving on a board or becoming engaged politically. Many lawyers in private practice find these activities to be a very meaningful and rewarding aspect of their professional lives. But for some the mission drives them to dedicate their full professional life to public service.

One of my former law partners, John Gallo, left a very successful career as a litigator at Sidley to become executive director of the Legal Aid Chicago, because he felt strongly that this was the way that he could best give back to the community.

RC: I have quite a few friends at your firm in Chicago. Do you recall what drew you to Sidley back in 1999?

ML: I originally met my current partner in the Sidley immigration group, Tim Payne, at a Saturday morning pro bono immigration workshop in Chicago. When an opportunity presented itself to work at Sidley in its business immigration practice some time later, I was impressed not only with its national-level immigration practice but the collegiality among the lawyers and the firm’s commitment to pro bono work.

The Sidley immigration group’s founding partner and statesman, Doug Donenfeld, was a very inspiring and exciting figure, and I was honored to have the chance to practice with and learn from him. All these years later, even though Doug has retired, I still draw inspiration from his leadership, generosity, and friendship. And I continue to work closely with Tim and the other attorneys and staff in our immigration group.

RC: You mentioned that it’s a very challenging time for those practicing and dealing with immigration law in our country. What areas do you think can be addressed in the near future and improved over time to strengthen the rule of law on this front?

ML: In my view, it is critical that the business community begins to actively challenge denials of business immigration petitions in federal court. We have seen a substantial increase in agency denial rates for visa petitions, particularly for H-1B professionals, without any change in standards in the law or regulations.

Companies are losing long-term employees due to denials of extensions for workers who have held H-1B visas for the same job for years. Many of these agency denials are overreaching and do not have a basis in the law or regulations.

Many U.S. businesses that have challenged these types of denials have obtained reversals. I believe that challenging agency denials through federal court litigation will be both helpful for companies to obtain the immigration benefit to which they are entitled in the individual case, but will also hold the government accountable and result in better adjudications in this important area.

RC: What is one thing that only your friends and family know about you?

ML: I have recently started taking fiddle lessons with my daughter in the hopes of someday forming a family bluegrass band. It has been a fun experience, but my progress so far suggests that I should probably keep my day job.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Marketa Lindt for taking the time to share her story with our audience. We look forward to following her successes and wish her continued achievements in her career.

# Vault 100 Rankings: The Most Prestigious Law Firms In America (2022)
## Money continues to matter most for Biglaw associates.

What do associates at major law firms care about more than money? Prestige, of course. But, at the end of the day, sometimes being a leader when it comes to compensation is enough to boost a firm’s prestige. As luck would have it, the closely watched Vault 100 rankings are here to remind lawyers at the nation’s largest law firms about exactly which ones are considered the most prestigious.

In last year’s Vault 100 rankings, Cravath — the firm that matched [Milbank’s $190K associate salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/) three summers ago with [over-the-top monetary compensation](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) for senior associates and [matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/cravath-raises/) the generous [new salary scale set by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) this summer — managed to retain its number 1 spot, with Wachtell Lipton edged out of second place by Skadden for the first time in the history of the Vault rankings. Was Cravath able to keep its cachet as the most prestigious Biglaw firm in the country in the latest Vault rankings?

Of course it was. Here’s what Mary Kate Sheridan, Vault’s senior law editor, had to say about Cravath’s placement in the latest rankings: “Cravath and prestige go hand in hand, with the firm securely atop the Vault Law 100 year after year and also within the top 10 of multiple practice area rankings including the top position in General Corporate Practice. When Cravath speaks, other firms follow. The firm has established industry standards on hiring and compensation for years, and even when it isn’t the first to move, Cravath’s decision to join influences the market—as with this year’s compensation and special bonus announcements.”

Biglaw may be on the Davis Polk scale, but Cravath remains the namesake for salaries because of its prestigious pull, with survey respondents referring to the firm as an “industry trend-setter” and a “compensation leader.”

Although Cravath stayed on top, this year, there was some movement when it came to the Top 10 in the Vault rankings. Here are the Top 10 Most Prestigious Law Firms based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2022:

- Cravath, Swaine & Moore
- Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz
- Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
- Sullivan & Cromwell
- Latham & Watkins
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Davis Polk & Wardwell
- Simpson Thacher & Bartlett
- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
- Gibson Dunn & Crutcher
This is the fourth year in a row that these firms have been in the Top 10, but as you can see, we had a two pairs of flip flops among them. At the tippy top, Wachtell has reclaimed its No. 2 position after losing the spot for a blip in time last year, and because fame is sometimes fleeting, Skadden is back with a bronze medal in hand. At the bottom of the top, Paul Weiss and Gibson Dunn have traded places. Surprised Davis Polk didn’t move? The Vault Associate Survey was conducted between March and May 2021 — before the firm’s monumental salary move. Perhaps we can expect it to move up a few spots in next year’s ranking.

# Biglaw Firm Encourages Associates & Staff To Use Gender Pronouns In Email Signatures
## This firm is taking a step in the right direction.

As Biglaw firms across the globe continue their efforts to promote diversity and inclusion among their ranks, some prominent firms are taking it a step further by recognizing that pronouns matter for their transgender, genderqueer, and nonbinary employees.

To that end, tipsters say that Sidley Austin recently offered its firmwide approval and support for associates and staff members to add their gender pronouns to their email signature blocks. In fact, the firm recently highlighted this practice in one of its Tech Tip Tuesday emails. Check it out, below:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
A source at the firm shared this powerful note with us about the importance of diversity and inclusion at Biglaw firms, even through actions as “small” as supporting the use of gender pronouns in email signatures:

Although I’m not transgender or gender-fluid, I am still incredibly proud of Sidley for being one of the few Biglaw firms that I know of to do this, and I would encourage more firms to take the leap. I know a lot of people don’t necessarily understand why this is important, or think that because they don’t “need” to provide their pronouns they shouldn’t bother adding the pronouns themselves. However, it can be incredibly isolating being the “only” person who needs/wants to self-identify pronouns, so there is power and support in having others do it first/with you. It’s such a small and easy thing that we can all do to be more inclusive and welcoming, and it can make a huge impact on people feeling marginalized or unseen.

This is a remarkably simple move, but one that goes pretty far in normalizing the practice and setting the tone of inclusion. Does your firm support the usage of gender pronouns in email signatures? Please let us know.

# Apparently ICE Is Messing With Skadden Partners Now
## These unjustified checks are impacting everyone.

Not content to be fueled by the screams of children, ICE has opened up an offensive in New York over the last couple weeks, harassing people of color throughout the city by demanding papers from completely legal residents doing nothing suspicious at all. Just another disturbing turn in the city where ICE just out of the blue stripped detainees of the [right to appear in-person at their deportation hearings](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/ICE-Suspends-In-Person-Deportation-Hearings-at-NYC-Immigration-Court-486758801.html). It’s why people in this city are rapidly getting behind the call to abolish ICE.[[1]](#f1)

But the collateral damage of ICE’s jackboot thuggery has finally hit Biglaw where it hurts. To be fair, Biglaw was [already in this fight for justice](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/opinion/zero-tolerance-trump-asylum-family-separation-lawyers.html), but this anecdote just personalizes it a bit.

Apparently in the last couple of weeks, ICE agents in Midtown hassled a driver waiting for a passenger at 4 Times Square, demanding his Taxi and Limousine Commission license (which should end the inquiry, because you have to have documented legal status to have one), driver’s license, and the car’s registration and ordered him to stay there until they came back. An hour later, according to reports, the driver walked to the NYPD kiosk in the area to seek help and the officer at the desk gave him back all the documents, explaining that ICE dropped them off with him and just left. It seems they never intended to let the guy off the hook once they realized they were harassing an innocent man.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But as you might have guessed from the “4 Times Square” part of the story, this unjustified hour-long stop stranded a Skadden partner waiting to be taken to court. The partner was reportedly furious over the whole affair, which is understandable both on a personal level and as someone who took a Con Law class at least once in their life and knew this shouldn’t be happening in America.

The title above isn’t meant to diminish what the driver went through. It’s traumatic when a guy who did everything right and was just minding his own business still experiences arbitrary and capricious intimidation. But it highlights how this “law enforcement” effort is doing a disservice to everyone in the country right now. When Biglaw’s business is getting disrupted by some civil service exam reject making an unjustified stop, it should make even the fence-sitters question whether ICE — and all the resources we’re dumping into it — is serving any useful purpose out there.

They should have wondered that when the screaming kids happened, but everyone has a different breaking point.

[ [1]](#reff1) Despite the hyperventilation out of conservative news outlets, abolishing ICE does not mean “open borders” because ICE isn’t the nation’s border control agency. That would be CBP. It shouldn’t be that difficult to grasp, as the latter agency has the word “border” in its name, but here we are. ICE, on the other hand, is a paramilitary group of wannabes who tear ass around the country harassing minorities in the off chance that they might be immigrants.

As a law firm owner building the various teams that enable your organization to run as you envision, each individual on those teams should check certain boxes. Your legal content marketing professional/content writer is no exception.

Specifically, your legal content marketing professional should be a skilled writer and editor with in-depth knowledge of editing rules. You might not know, but the rules of editing for the internet and for books aren’t the same. They follow different style guides, and which one you use where matters because, well, presentation matters.

If you see yourself authoring a business book or memoir one day to elevate your thought leadership efforts even further, consider searching for a content marketing professional possessing both writing and editing skills. That person will know you better than a writer/editor coming in off the street since they’ve already been working with you and your organization.

But, perhaps most importantly, the legal content marketing professional you hire should understand and embrace your core values, which, hopefully, you’ve already spent time refining and have communicated across all of your teams. In other words, your legal content marketing professional should understand multiple aspects of you — your law firm’s marketing goals, your law firm’s challenges, and you personally. You see, your story, i.e., how you got to where you are (the good, the bad, and the ugly) and where you see yourself going personally and professionally, can be leveraged in multiple ways.

Take the law mom who transitioned from Biglaw to solopreneurship to have more control over integrating work and life, so she could still be a class mom, head the PTO committee for the spring carnival, and chaperone the occasional school trip, even if it means returning to her home office at 9 p.m. each night once the kids are bathed, read to, and asleep. Or the law mom who decided with her spouse that she would pursue partnership — and eventually made partner! — at the law firm where she worked while her husband agreed he would field, at least for the foreseeable future, more of the daytime responsibilities at home because his creative career allowed him that flexibility.

These are the stories that matter, the ones that help others make important decisions in their own lives as they stand at their personal crossroads. They’re the stories that draw people — colleagues and clients alike — to you.

Whatever the details, [integrating your personal story into your content marketing strategy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/crafting-compelling-legal-content-your-personal-narratives-role/) takes vulnerability, guts, and commitment. Commitment not only to yourself and your goals but also to your legal marketing professional, to whom you’re paying your hard-earned money so they can partner with you in your legal content marketing efforts. That means it’s in your best interests for them to succeed. But to reach new heights, you need to support your legal content marketing professional in a few pointed ways, not work against them, which sometimes happens unknowingly.

Your legal content writer knows you’re busy. But as your partner in up-leveling your exposure through the world of legal content marketing, they will inevitably have a few simple and logical requests of you to do the job you’ve brought them on to do. Those requests are to …

Create A Teamlike Environment

If you have a marketing team performing numerous functions, consider including your content writer in regularly scheduled teamwide marketing meetings. This creates cohesiveness between the content writer and the rest of the marketing team. It also allows the content writer to witness and participate in the idea flow, infusing their expertise.

Often, these conversations spark topic ideas. They can also help point to subjects in the law firm’s arsenal of client resources that could benefit from further elaboration or updating by the legal content writer. Lastly, the legal content writer is likely not privy to all of the law firm’s marketing department’s data, which, when discussed openly with the content marketer, can help focus marketing initiatives even more.

Keep A Running List Of Ideas

Creating a central location where you can jot down ideas for future content is a huge asset when working with a legal content marketer/content writer. That brilliant idea you had a moment ago may be gone in a moment if you’re not careful.

If you’re digitally minded, take advantage of the notepad on your phone, which also allows you to use the microphone to dictate. If you’re a pen-and-paper person, set aside space in your daily planner. Even better is if you take your notes and transfer them to a document you and your content writer share. That way, when you need to put your heads together and choose upcoming topics, you have a running list from which you can cull. Speaking of putting your heads together …

Meet One-On-One Regularly

As the founder or leader of your law firm, meeting with your legal content writer regularly, at least once a month, will increase the quality of your content many times over. God, as the saying goes, is in the details, and only the individual with the experiences can communicate them with the nuance needed for a skilled legal content writer to communicate them to the public with any authenticity.

Regardless of the type of content you task your legal content writer to create — a law firm blog post, newsletter, ebook, thought leadership piece, pitch letter, social media post with accompanying engagement, etc. — the overarching reason behind why, as a law firm leader or as a law firm, you’re creating it matters. It’s the people, places, and objects in each communication, like ingredients in a recipe, that help to get your message across, reinforce it, and make it memorable. Content writers need you to talk to them one-on-one to do that.

Honor Your Meetings

Of course, emergencies come up. That said, do your best to stick to the schedule you create with your content marketing professional. If they’re worth their weight in salt, they’ll come to those meetings prepared. Again, your content marketing professional knows you’re busy, and they respect that your time is valuable.

But so is theirs, and they’re working on a timetable just as you are. Like you, legal content writers have deadlines they must honor regarding their own workflow. Those deadlines could very well affect you, such as when they’re working with an outside publication on your behalf. In the same vein …

Respond To Inquiries Promptly

If your content writer is reaching out to you with a suggestion or for a quote, clarification, approval, or any request of that nature, understand they’re doing so for a reason that is in furtherance of your legal marketing goals. Content marketers are hard at work behind the scenes researching trends, finding publications where they can pitch your content, establishing relationships with editors, writing and tailoring pitch letters, and multipurposing existing content so you can get the most bang for your buck.

Often, the requests from your content marketing professional come to you with time constraints built into them because of their editorial calendar, a publication’s, or a combination of both. Therefore, your content marketing professional depends on you to answer them promptly, for your benefit and their own.

Your content writer will try to make those inquiries of you as clear, concise — and, hopefully — as painless as possible. When your content writer must make repeated inquiries to obtain the information they need to move forward with a project or get the final go-ahead from you even after you said you were engaging, and the content writer held time on their calendar for you, it becomes painful for everyone involved, not to mention uncomfortable. Ghosting is disrespectful and unprofessional.

Provide Feedback

Legal content marketers like me have chosen this career. Even though it’s not our names in the byline, not our names in lights, and the brand recognition you receive — the credibility you get from the exposure we provide that can become the tipping point for a client choosing you over someone else — is not ours, we feel the thrill as if it is. This feeling means we’re doing our job, a job that takes time, skill, experience, and attention to detail — your details. But to continue doing that job well, we not only need your feedback, we want it.

We take immense pride in the work we do and every “win” — a blog post that goes viral or earns a first-page Google ranking for a commonly used search term, or a thought leadership piece we created with you that results in you seeing your name (either as an author or a quoted expert) in a publication you were once just a reader of — is yours as much as it is ours. But to continue the streak, we need your head and heart in the game, too.

The Baudinet quintuplets (Photo via WTVR)

What could possibly be more stressful than being a Biglaw associate with a newborn? Being a Biglaw associate with five newborns.

Meet [Michael Baudinet](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/People/B/Michael-A-Baudinet.aspx#overview). He’s a 2012 graduate of Harvard Law School and an associate in the white-collar defense practice at McGuireWoods in Richmond, Virginia. He’s also the proud new father of quintuplets: Ava Louise, Clara Catherine, Camile Whitney, Isabelle Francis, and Luke Thomas. In case you were wondering, parents have about a one in 60 million chance of having quintuplets.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The Baudinet quints, who are now six months old, made their public debut last week in a large conference room at McGuireWoods, each wearing a tiny McGuireWoods onesie. “Getting up in the morning is hard because I don’t want to leave these guys, but then, you know, they got to get fed,” Michael said during an interview with local CBS affiliate [WTVR](http://wtvr.com/2017/05/16/four-girls-one-boy-goochland-quintuplets-make-their-debut/). “It’s pretty crazy, our quiet house has turned into a train station.” Here are some additional details from WTVR:

[Michael and Margaret Baudinet] had been trying to have children for more than 18 months and experienced miscarriages and other setbacks. That’s when they sought fertility treatment.

When word finally came that Margaret was pregnant, the doctors originally told the Baudinet’s they were having quadruplets. That was obviously incorrect.

“You know I was terrified. But at least I was able to talk, unlike this guy,” Margaret said pointing at Michael.

“I didn’t talk for about a month after finding out. Literally, a little bit of shock going on,” he said.

McGuireWoods offers new fathers six weeks of paid parental leave, and they may participate in a six-month “return-to-work ramp-up” where they will receive a 20 percent reduction in their billable-hour target with no change in their pay after returning from family leave.

Congratulations to Michael Baudinet on the birth of his quintuplets, and to McGuireWoods for being so supportive of its associate’s dive into parenthood.
