# Biglaw Chair On What It Takes To Weather The COVID-19 Storm Without Layoffs Or Salary Cuts

What will Biglaw look like in a post COVID-19 world? That’s the question on everyone’s mind as we, hopefully, move closer to a new normal. In a new [interview with Law.com](https://www.law.com/2020/05/12/cooley-resists-cuts-as-ceo-peers-into-a-post-pandemic-future/), CEO and chairman of Cooley Joe Conroy breaks down how he sees his firm positioned post pandemic.

The big headline is that Conroy said Cooley has no plans to cut associate salaries or do any layoffs. Conroy said that the firm’s travel and meetings budget — obviously going unused — is providing sufficient cost-savings. But don’t think that Conroy expects no changes in the legal industry. Conroy predicts demand for legal services will be down in a big way because of coronavirus, and that collections will also be down because of the economic conditions:

Our board and I certainly think that we are going to face to reduced demand in 2020. I also think that we’re going to be in an environment where we are going to get lower realization. That’s what happens when economies worsen. That having been said, we haven’t seen it as of yet. We’ve been, with respect to all the metrics that we measure our business, on or over plan. And that has even held up through 11 days this month on cash collections. Trying to figure out what the baseline to plan for is a little TBD. I hope I’m wrong. I don’t think I am. But my guess is that when the book is written on 2020, I will look back and say, “OK, we experienced 10% less demand than we thought we would, 15%, whatever it’s going to be.”

Though these predictions might seem like a downer (though very realistic), Conroy says he is an optimist. His take on the outlook of Cooley certainly reflects that, and he also noted that Cooley is positioned to come out of this in a better position than most:

[A]lthough this is a terrible set of circumstances for all of us and we’ve got to buckle down and do some things differently during this period, we think there will be some law firms that emerge from this circumstance better than others, and we think we’re going to be one of them.

Part of the reason why Conroy believes this is due to the firm’s partnership structure. The firm eschews income partners and Conroy says that means business development is an essential part of the firm’s makeup:

One of the things we’ve always said about our partnership that gives us a higher likelihood of performing well in a down market is we don’t have service partners, we don’t have nonequity partners, and we’ve got business development in the genes of our partners across practices.

You’ve beaten the odds, and obtained one of the relatively few, highly desirable offers to work at a Biglaw firm as a summer associate.  Congratulations!  Now, it’s important to understand [why the program exists](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/summer-associate-programs-part-i-why-they-exist-and-firms-different-approaches/), what you should expect from the program, what attorneys at Biglaw firms expect from you as a summer associate, and how to succeed.

Before the comprehensive, “tell all” guide book [Big Law Confidential](https://amzn.to/3Ky6OkT) (affiliate link), the only ways law students could find out what to expect from summer associate programs were to speak with their more experienced law student classmates, or read accounts such as on Above the Law. However, every summer associate’s experience can, and frequently does, differ — even within the same Biglaw firm, depending on a variety of factors including the practice area and office in which the summer associate works.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
What can a law student expect from a Biglaw summer associate program?  And what do Biglaw firms expect, in terms of job performance, conduct, and more, from their summer associates?  Answers follow, some of which are excerpted from the book Big Law Confidential.

What to Expect from a Summer Associate Program

Summer associates can generally expect the following from almost any Biglaw firm’s summer associate program:

1. The best possible version of the Biglaw experience, that bears little resemblance to what your life would look like as a full-time associate.  The Biglaw summer associate experience is a watered-down, intentionally curated version of — not an accurate recreation of — the Biglaw associate experience. Biglaw firms intentionally expose summer associates to the best aspects of the associate experience, and shield them from many of the worst, to entice them to want to work for the firm and get them in the door.  For example, Biglaw firm management may instruct its attorneys to give the summer associates the most interesting assignments possible and delegate the menial assignments to junior associates, who the firm has already got on the hook.

2. Trainings, meetings, lunches, and events galore!  Summer associates are invited to and expected to attend numerous trainings, meetings, lunches, and other events, which often add up to one to six hours each day, almost every day of the summer program, leaving little time to do actual client work. Summer associates who are determined to do all they can to obtain an offer to join the firm after graduation will usually come in to the office quite early and/or come back to the office after normal business hours to ensure they have enough time to complete all assignments and turn in high-quality work product before any deadlines.
3. One long interview.  Summer associate programs are one weeks-long interview, and they’re a test of mental and physical endurance and resilience.  This partially prepares summer associates for the Biglaw associate experience to come, except that associates typically spend the vast majority of their time working on billable matters as opposed to attending events.  You are always expected to be “on” (i.e., to exhibit an engaged, interested, positive, can-do team player attitude at all times and under any circumstances).

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In no particular order, attorneys in Biglaw firms generally expect the following from summer associates:

(i) Perfect work product.  Attorneys won’t expect you to know much, if anything, about substantive law, but they will expect you to turn in work product that gets right the facts and details within your control (e.g., the name of the client, if you’re told that) and that is free of obvious and avoidable errors such as misspellings and typos.
(ii) No complaints and a positive, “can-do” team player attitude.  The surest way to end of your summer associate program without a full-time job offer is to be a jerk, complainer, or constant pessimist.
(iii) Efficiency.  Even if your Biglaw firm isn’t going to bill any clients for your time, or there isn’t a stated budget for a matter, the firm wants to see that you can efficiently produce a large quantity of high-quality work.  Efficient attorneys make more money for their Biglaw firm, and firm management loves that.  When associates are inefficient, it often means that the firm loses money (e.g., having to write off time that exceeded the client’s budget), and firm management is not in the business of losing money.  Ask for time estimates/budgets at the start of every assignment and ensure that you do your best to meet or beat those.  If you’re unsure how to tackle an assignment, or are part-way done and don’t think you’ll complete the assignment in the estimated/allotted time, ask a more experienced associate mentor/friend for tips or help, and flag any potential delay or issue in meeting the deadline before you blow past it.
(iv) Availability and ability to work/participate in the program.  Frequently, a time-sensitive need for work product will arise (e.g., a research summary on a discrete legal issue in advance of a call with a client scheduled for later the same day), or there will be a last-minute opportunity to participate in an event such as an emergency hearing.  At least during typical business hours (i.e., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays), summer associates should be available and able to help and dressed appropriately for a court hearing or client meeting, or have a change of clothes at the office that would be appropriate to wear that they can quickly change into for the event.
(v) Prompt responsiveness to requests and questions from attorneys or clients.  Every firm, office, and practice group will have its own job performance expectations regarding responsiveness (and more).  You can be pretty sure, though, that at least during typical business hours, you’re expected to respond to emails at least same-day, and potentially within a few minutes to no more than an hour or two, depending on the situation.
(vi) Professionalism.  Be professional in terms of your actions and your appearance, i.e., someone who attorneys would not hesitate to put in front of the firm’s largest client.  This is not the time for emojis in emails, potentially offensive jokes, dressing too casually, getting too drunk, etc.  (See the numerous articles on Above the Law about summer associates who failed to act professionally, and as a result, failed to receive full-time job offers.)  As a fictional character once said, “respect is earned, not bestowed.” Act like and be someone who commands the respect of your colleagues.
Summer associate programs are often pretty formulaic.  If you know the game, what is expected of the players, how to play by the rules, and play that game well for the entirety of the program, you’ll win the prize at the end: a full-time job offer as an associate.
[Part I of this series](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/summer-associate-programs-part-i-why-they-exist-and-firms-different-approaches/) covered why summer associate programs exist and Big Law firms’ different approaches to them.

Part III of this series will provide some time-tested and proven tips for success as a summer associate.

Last night, senior White House advisor Kellyanne Conway [announced](https://www.dropbox.com/s/idvi2pijsbv1ku5/KAC.pdf?dl=0) that she would be leaving her position at the end of the month to spend more time with her family.

“Our four children are teens and ‘tweens starting a new academic year, in middle school and high school, remotely from home for at least a few months. As millions of parents nationwide know, kids ‘doing school from home’ requires a level of attention and vigilance that is as unusual as these times,” wrote the person who spent months [inveighing](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/kellyanne-conway-on-school-reopening-and-kamala-harris) against school closures and [pretending](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/07/politics/fact-check-white-house-coronavirus-contained/index.html) that the Trump administration was making great progress against COVID.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
With decades of experience selling candidates, Conway is carefully packaging herself as a relatable mom — “less drama, more mama” — and a Republican stalwart, praising Trump for having “a measurable, positive impact on the peace and prosperity of the nation, and on millions of Americans who feel forgotten no more.”

After five years of “alternative facts” in service of his campaign and presidency, Conway is bailing out right before the Trump train slams smack into that brick wall on November 3. ([In theory, anyway.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/no-sitting-president-was-as-far-behind-as-trump-going-into-the-conventions/))

Conway’s husband George, a litigation Of Counsel at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, spent the day tweeting his usual barrage of attacks on his wife’s employer before abruptly announcing last night that he was withdrawing from the group and going on Twitter hiatus.

“Needless to say, I continue to support the Lincoln Project and its mission. Passionately,” he posted, before going silent.

The catalyst for the Conways’ abrupt exit appears to have been their daughter’s increasingly erratic public behavior, including tweeting last week that she intends to seek legal emancipation after “years of childhood trauma and abuse.” Which we’re not linking to because she’s a child, and we are all adults who know how to work Google.

But whatever the reason, George and Kellyanne Conway are getting out of Dodge just in time to disassociate themselves from the coming conflagration. She’ll still be a viable Republican consultant, and he’ll still be able to show his face at Federalist Society dinners. Pretty convenient timing, huh?

And speaking of convenient timing, we note that the as-yet unknown author of the White House tell-all [A Warning](https://amzn.to/2QiMLev) by “Anonymous” (affiliate link) [deferred](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/anonymous-author-of-trump-resistance-op-ed-to-publish-a-tell-all-book/2019/10/22/b9ea2f42-f45a-11e9-ad8b-85e2aa00b5ce_story.html) his or her compensation until 2021, meaning that it didn’t appear on mandatory financial disclosures for 2020. The publishers of the book made the author available for a Reddit AMA, during which he or she [promised](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/anonymous-author-of-trump-book-promises-to-reveal-identity.html) that “Trump will hear from me, in my own name, before the 2020 election.”

Looks like Kellyanne Conway is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the Republican National Convention. Will we get the usual nasty attacks or … something else?

STAY TUNED.

# Bonus Season Is Not Over: Another Biglaw Firm Hands Out The Big Bucks
## Let the good times roll -- there's still bonus money to be distributed.

The holidays may be over and the calendar is continuing its steady march with destiny/the end of the world (or as some may know it, the Trump inauguration), but that doesn’t mean all the good times have been sucked dry like the cookies that are still left out for Santa. Naw, there is still bonus money to be distributed. And Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman just dropped its bonus scale on grateful associates.

There isn’t too much surprising in the memo — Kasowitz has met the market scale [established back in November](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/) by Cravath:

Class of 2016: $15,000
Class of 2015: $15,000
Class of 2014: $25,000
Class of 2013: $50,000
Class of 2012: $65,000
Class of 2011: $80,000
Class of 2010: $90,000
Class of 2009: $100,000
Class of 2008: $100,000
Class of 2007 and above and special counsel: determined on an individual basis

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Like lots of firms, there is an hours requirement in order to cash in on the payday, and superstars will see a little something extra in their stocking:

Associates who are in good standing as of the date bonuses will be paid, who worked 2150 hours during 2016 (12/1/2015 through 11/30/2016), and performed in 2016 at a level of quality expected for his/her class year, will receive a full bonus. Attorneys who have made extraordinary contributions during 2016 will receive bonus awards above the benchmark levels.

So, Kasowitz attorneys, how do you feel about the bonuses? Feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). A fun or insightful response — we’ll keep you anonymous — could find its way into an update to this story.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Am Law 100 Firm Jumps Into Spring 2021 Special Bonus War
## This is on top of the thousands of dollars of reward bucks the firm announced just two weeks ago.

Spring is in the air, and a new Biglaw bonus war is upon us. Willkie Farr got the ball rolling last Friday when the firm announced that it would be [offering bonuses of up to $40,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) to its associates, half this spring, and half in the fall. Davis Polk one-upped Willkie just yesterday, offering [special bonuses of up to $64,000](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) to both associates and staff, again in two separate payments (with a larger payment in the fall).

And now… we have our first match!

Fenwick & West announced special bonuses today in the range of $12,000 to $64,000, depending on class year, matching the DPW scale (including counsel). Bonuses will be paid to those on track to bill 1,950 creditable hours or more for 2021, measured pro rata as of April 30 and August 31, for May and September payments. Here’s the Fenwick bonus scale (flip to the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/fenwick-spring-bonus-2021/2) to see the memo):

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


These special bonuses come in addition to the rest, relaxation, and recreation rewards the firm announced about two weeks ago. Here’s a bit more on that (and the full memo is available on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/fenwick-spring-bonus-2021/2)):



Fenwick suggests that these reward monies be used on rest (vacations, hotels, airfare (when safe), car rentals), recreation (bicycles, paddleboards, hot-tubs, gaming systems), and relaxation (spa visits, skin care, new mattresses, luxury bedding). The firm is trying to keep associates from burning out and leadership is “working hard to reduce the pace of work to levels that are sustainable for [employees’] long-term enjoyment of work and life.”

Sad news in the world of Biglaw: Davis Polk partner [Kirtee Kapoor](https://www.davispolk.com/news/memoriam-kirtee-kapoor-1971-2017/) died yesterday, after being struck by a train in San Mateo, California.

“Early reports indicate this was an intentional act,” Caltrain spokesperson Tasha Bartholomew said in a [statement](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2017/06/05/caltrain-fatality-reported-at-menlo-park-crossing). Kapoor was trespassing near the Watkins Avenue train and was in the train’s right-of-way, according to Bartholomew.

The firm has released a [statement](https://www.davispolk.com/news/memoriam-kirtee-kapoor-1971-2017/) celebrating Kapoor’s legacy as a lawyer and as a person:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Kirtee was a truly wonderful man. His optimism, warmth, honesty and wisdom were inspiring. He will be remembered as a great partner of the firm, a beloved colleague and adviser, and a steadfast friend to so many….

We will miss Kirtee tremendously. Our deepest sympathies go to his wife and daughter, and we extend our most heartfelt condolences to all of his family, colleagues, friends and clients.

Kapoor was born in India and earned his LL.B. from the University of Delhi Faculty of Law and his B.C.L. from Balliol College, University of Oxford, before going to NYU Law to get his LL.M. He began working as an associate in the New York office of Davis Polk in 1999, and was elevated to partner in 2007.

In 2015, Kapoor moved to join the firm’s Northern California office. His work focused on advising clients on mergers & acquisitions and other corporate matters, and he was head of the firm’s India practice. He was a prominent practitioner in the space, and his passing was noted in Indian legal publications such as [Bar & Bench](https://barandbench.com/davis-polk-kirtee-kapoor-passes-away/) and [Legally India](http://www.legallyindia.com/home/rip-kirtee-kapoor-pathbreaking-india-head-of-elite-us-firm-davis-polk-passes-away-20170606-8562). He was 46 at the time of his death.

Our thoughts are with Kapoor’s family, friends and colleagues.

# Another Day, Another Firm Announcing An Office Return Instead Of A Milbank Match
## Associates would be happier to return to the office if they had more money in their wallets....

‘Where’s my money?’

With a new salary scale on the horizon, is it any wonder that Biglaw is buzzing with news about … *record scratch* … office returns? Associates are watching their inboxes like hawks to find out when their salaries will go up, but with raises apparently on hold, all they’re receiving are updates about when they’ll have to start wearing suits instead of sweatpants.

One of the latest firms to announce plans unreleated to money is Ropes & Gray. As you may recall, the firm decided to employ a phased approach to its eventual return to the office. According to a recent memo (available on the next page), Phase 2 of the Ropes return-to-office plan started on February 7, and lawyers are being encouraged to work from the office one to two days each week. Phase 3 of the firm’s plan will begin on March 1, and at that time, lawyers will be expected to work from the office at least three days each week.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Ropes & Gray has planned for several remote weeks for attorneys in the future: the week of the July 4th holiday (July 5-8), Thanksgiving week (November 21-23), and the Christmas holiday week (December 27-30).

The firm is being generous with its remote work availability, but what about its compensation? Associates at Ropes tell us that they’re eagerly awaiting a Milbank match that they hope will be announced and kick in before Phase 3 of the firm’s RTO plan begins.

As soon as you find out about reopening plans at your firm, please [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Office%20Reopening) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Office Reopening”) or text us at (646) 820-8477. We always keep our sources on stories anonymous. There’s no need to send a memo (if one exists) using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. If a memo has been circulated, please be sure to include it as proof; we like to post complete memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

And Ms. Powell does not disappoint! Yesterday, her exciting new strategy was revealed in a set of [filings](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6186318/Order.pdf) unsealed in the EDVA. Surprise, the real villain is … Flynn’s own lawyers at Covington & Burling who tricked the poor, innocent General into falsely admitting that he’d violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) by failing to disclose his lobbying work for the Turkish government.

It’s always the ones you least expect!

Flynn is — or was — the star witness in the government’s prosecution of  Bijan Rafiekian, AKA Bijan Kian, Flynn’s colleague at the Flynn Intel Group. Together, they lobbied to turn the U.S. government against Turkish cleric Fethullah-Gülen. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is convinced that Gülen, a reclusive 75-year-old who lives in the Poconos and runs a network of charter schools, was responsible for a coup against him in Turkey in 2016.

Flynn and his associates were paid $530,000 during the 2016 election campaign to lobby the American government to extradite Gülen to Turkey, a cunning plan executed with the help of noted “experts” on Islam, like Sebastian Gorka, who were willing to argue with a straight face that Gülen’s ethical modernist version of Islam is exactly the same as both the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood and Iran’s Shiite Ayatollah Khomenei.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


In November of 2017, [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-probes-flynns-role-in-alleged-plan-to-deliver-cleric-to-turkey-1510309982) reported that, during the presidential transition, at the same time Flynn was receiving [classified briefings](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/flynn-attended-intel-briefings-while-taking-money-lobby-turkey-n732041) in preparation for his role as National Security Advisor, Flynn and his [nitwit son](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38231532) were negotiating a fee of up to $15 million to get Gülen into the hands of Turkish authorities by any means necessary.

The discussions allegedly involved the possibility of transporting Mr. Gulen on a private jet to the Turkish prison island of Imrali, according to one of the people who has spoken to the FBI.

The guy was willing to black helicopter a legal U.S. resident out of the country and into the hands of the Turkish government, and he’s pissed about having to admit he violated FARA?

Yes, in fact, now that Sidney Powell is on the case, he is. Because, despite having [admitted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/michael-flynn-special-counsel-sentencing-memo.html?module=inline) to prosecutors he did, in fact, know that he was working on behalf of the Turkish government, his new story is that he actually believed that [Inovo,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-usa-gulen/flynns-former-business-partner-charged-with-secret-lobbying-for-turkey-idUSKBN1OG1T3) the Dutch cutout firm which “hired” him, was the real client. And hocus pocus, there goes his mens rea for violating the FARA.

From Pilot and Above The Law  
Prosecutors have been adamant Mr. Flynn testify that he authorized filing the FARA form knowing and contending that it contain false statements. Mr. Flynn cannot give that testimony because it is not true.

Sure, it might have seemed like Flynn was admitting to a FARA violation all those times he told prosecutors that he knew he was working for the Turkish government. But “with the benefit of hindsight,” he realizes now that he always believed in his heart that some random Dutch corporation was just fixated on snatching up a hermit imam from the Poconos and locking him in a Turkish prison. And now that Flynn’s given it some more thought, he remembered that it was all his lawyers’ fault. Also Obama’s Deep State National Security Division goons were in on it.



Why would Powell blow up Flynn’s carefully negotiated plea agreement over a defective FARA filing which her client isn’t even being charged for? Unclear!

Needless to say, the government was not amused. Despite Ms. Powell’s dogged insistence that her client is still cooperating, prosecutors have now ditched plans to call Flynn to testify against his former colleague, filing a Notice of Correction to the Record on July 3, reclassifying Flynn as a co-conspirator and announcing their plan to introduce his prior statements at trial, rather than calling him to testify.

Rafiekian’s lawyers at Akin Gump immediately objected, rightly pointing out that government is now basing their case on the prior statements of witness whom they themselves don’t find credible enough to put on the stand.



And Judge Emmet Sullivan, who already postponed Flynn’s sentencing and sent him back to [cooperate a whole lot more](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/after-judge-brings-up-treason-will-michael-flynn-be-getting-jail-time/) in the Rafiekian case, issued a minute order demanding to be told what the hell is going on right now.



He sounds a little mad.

The government’s [brief](https://www.usatoday.com/documents/6188029-Reply-to-non-motion-Document/) yesterday strongly suggests that they consider Flynn in breach of his plea agreement.

At this time the government cannot speculate on how specifically the aforementioned records will impact the government’s sentencing position in the proceedings before this Court. Although the records raise numerous issues, the Rafiekian trial may still impact the government’s position.

God only knows what Powell’s going to drop in her response. But if she’s betting that Flynn can blow up his plea deal because he’s going to get pardoned by Donald Trump anyway, well … relying on a guy who went broke running a casino may be a risky bet.

Another day, another Biglaw firm that’s taking a cue from Davis Polk and increasing the size of its bonus pool.

Last week, Hogan Lovells — a firm that brought home $2,308,401,000 in gross revenue last year, putting it in 9th place on the most recent Am Law 100 ranking — [announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/holove-bonus-year-end/) its Cravath match towards the end of last week. Since then, the prevailing market standard for bonuses has changed, and now includes one-time special bonuses. Never fear, because this elite Biglaw firm won’t be letting its associates down. Here’s what the special bonus match looks like at Hogan Lovells:

 
Special Bonus

 

2020	$4,000
2019	$6,000
2018	$11,500
2017	$15,000

2015	$21,000
2014
(and above)

Per Richard C. Lorenzo, the firm’s regional managing partner for the Americas, to be eligible for these special bonuses, associates must meet a minimum of 1850 billable hours (including firm-approved matters that are billable, such as first-year integration hours and certain types of pro bono matters), as well as up to 150 other pro bono hours and 50 diversity & inclusion hours.

Congratulations to everyone at Hogan Lovells!

# Biglaw Firm Breaks The Secrecy Over Partnership Decisions Revealing Just How Many Billable Hours It Takes
## Sure, it's a lot of hours but at least the firm is upfront about it.

Let’s call this one a victory for transparency.

According to an internal memo circulated in May, the Biglaw firm of Hogan Lovells has come clean about exactly how many hours it takes if you want the brass ring of partnership. Drumroll, please. It’s 2,400.

Yes, that’s a lot of hours, but it’s not as bad as it seems at first blush. A partner at the firm [told Law.com](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/16/hogan-lovells-sets-out-hours-requirements-to-make-partner-at-the-firm-405-104526/) that’s an “all in” number, which comprises a whole lot more than just billable hours. But another partner did share the firm’s billable target as well:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“When it comes to chargeable hours, about 1,700 is what we like our people to work towards. The rest of the contribution is things like lots of training, knowledge management, pastoral care, pro bono and DEI work as well as other contributions to the firm’s culture.”

And the illuminating memo from HoLove CEO Miguel Zaldivar is meant to demystify the process. As insiders at the were quick to point out:

“We’re really trying to have that clarity as an organization,” they continued. “Times have changed and we want to be in keeping with that. Even just 10 years ago if someone said to you what it takes to be a partner, it would have been a gentle tap on the shoulder from a more senior mentor to ‘join the club.’”

Points to the Biglaw firm for its honesty.

# Big Money Ahead At Yet Another Biglaw Firm
## Money is a great way to keep associates happy!

If a Biglaw firm wants to stay competitive in a white-hot lateral associate market, they’re going to have to step up and pay like the top of the market. So, it isn’t surprising that O’Melveny, a firm that took in $835,097,000 in gross revenue in 2020 — making it 54th on the Am Law 100 — has decided to raise salaries.

According to the voicemail associates received last night, O’Melveny is doing a full match of the prevailing market rate as set by the combination of Milbank and Davis Polk.

For those who have not yet memorized the scale, this is the new compensation grid at OMM (and a whole bunch of other firms):

Class of 2021	$215,000
Class of 2020	$225,000
Class of 2019	$250,000
Class of 2018	$293,500
Class of 2017	$335,000
Class of 2016	$360,500
Class of 2015	$381,000
Class of 2014	$396,500
And like many of their peer firms, the raises will be retroactive to January 1 and paid on March 15th.

# Is Marc Kasowitz Drunk On His Own Power?
## Just because you can call the ""Predisent"" a client, doesn't mean you get to say this.

“[Predisent](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/marc-kasowitz-takes-break-from-partying-at-trump-hotel-to-talk-to-the-press/)” Trump’s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz is advising White House staff that they don’t need to hire their own lawyers.

It’s hard to overstate how inappropriate this is.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Technically, the [New York Times report](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/11/us/politics/trump-lawyer-marc-kasowitz.html) sourced by multiple anonymous White House sources said that Kasowitz informed “aides gathered in one meeting” who asked about hiring their own attorneys that “it was not yet necessary.” I’m sure that’s what a lot of lawyers would like to tell potential witnesses against their clients. Because, of course, once they get their own lawyers, Kasowitz can’t talk to them directly.

For the record, the appropriate response is, “I’m not your attorney and cannot tell you whether or not you need your own lawyer.” Even if Kasowitz tries to spin it as “I never said they couldn’t get their own lawyers,” the way these sources claim he spoke about it sounds like he left them with the impression that they were being instructed that they shouldn’t hire their own lawyers — something that would naturally flow from an attorney taking on airs that being Trump’s private lawyer makes him an official government lawyer, which he’s not.

By the way, everyone in the White House needs their own lawyer — as [any former White House staffer would tell you](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/why-everyone-in-the-west-wing-will-need-to-lawyer-up).

“The president’s private lawyer is representing only his interests, not the interests of the United States government or the individual interests of the White House staff,” said Robert F. Bauer, who was White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

Hell, regardless of his answer, why is he fielding questions from staff at a meeting? According to one of the NYT’s sources, these meetings “bypassed the White House Counsel’s Office,” which makes you wonder how little self-respect Don McGahn must have to stay in a job where’s he’s treated like this.

McGahn doesn’t need this garbage — [he has a rock band!](http://www.npr.org/2017/06/06/531337749/the-quiet-man-the-powerful-conservative-white-house-lawyer-in-the-middle-of-it-a)

A spokesman for Mr. Kasowitz called the characterizations of his conversations with staff members “inaccurate,” but would not specify how.

Sometimes a story throws in a little something that requires that little extra effort from the reader. When the reporters say “would not specify how,” that means they asked the spokesperson a follow up and got no response. They took the time to call out the superficial denial and found…

Nothing underneath it.

# Trial Lawyers Take The Time To Win

Most litigation clients are understandably frustrated by the slow speed at which litigation can proceed. Good lawyers not only show understanding for this, they try to make up for it by not tarrying in the work they do. This is especially particular in following up with clients (trust me, the smartest, most interested client may never appreciate how well your litigation tactic worked, or how that brief really was a marvel, but they will remember if you didn’t call them back when you said you would).

But, sometimes, speed is not the answer. Litigation takes too damned long, yes. But that observation doesn’t mean everything needs to speed up.

For one thing, you need to appreciate how we think. I wonder at times if I’m really using the word as it’s meant to be used, but I frequently discuss topics or ideas with colleagues at [my firm](https://balestrierefariello.com/) days or weeks before we need to decide or address something because I think our minds cogitate (that was the word) in the background. If we force the idea in our heads and give it some attention, our brains seem to work on it when we are not conscious of it, and we end up being more thoughtful in the end.

For another thing, sometimes a given topic, work, or task just requires more time. I’ve more than once been hustling from one meeting to another and want to resolve something in a call with a client or colleague or adversary. But as I’m discussing the issue, I can feel the need for more time. When that happens, I try my best to slow down: maybe we need to keep this call going longer, or we need to speak later; it may just require more time. The same can go with preparation: you have a sense that a court conference won’t take more than 15 minutes of preparation, but then when you get into the documents you realize there’s a lot you don’t know, or you just read something relevant you need to go back to. In any event, sometimes things simply need more time devoted to them.

Attend to your clients’ and your colleagues’ and your courts’ desires to move things along. But to win for your clients, give your work the time it needs — by planning and, sometimes, by simply devoting more time to your work.

Welcome back to [The Pink Ghetto](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/the-pink-ghetto/), a series where we take a look at some of the most appalling stories from one of the most sexist industries in the world: the legal profession. Today, we have a story about a woman who endured a Biglaw partner’s relentless sexual harassment for a decade. These are real emails that we’ve received from real readers.

When you see things like this happening, say something. Together, we can inspire the change necessary to stop this disturbing behavior from being so prevalent in the law. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations of women in the law.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Eleven years ago, I joined a prestigious law firm right out of law school. I was newly divorced and a single mom, and I was proud that I had put myself through law school, was on law review, and had competing job offers. During my first year at the firm, I was assigned to work exclusively with this one partner, who I thought was genuinely interested in mentoring me as an associate. After traveling out of state with him to take depositions for a couple of days (my first one ever), we went to dinner one night. He kept ordering me drinks and talking about his marital problems. He said how he wished he didn’t have a wife and kids because they were so much responsibility, and he talked about how much more money he would have without them. All of this made me very uncomfortable. We left the restaurant, and instead of going back to the hotel, he insisted we go to a bar where he tried to kiss me. The funny part about this is that this man has no game. I didn’t even realize that he tried to kiss me. When I got up to leave, he said, “But wait! I just tried to kiss you.” I was horrified and said no. On the way back to the hotel, he essentially professed his love for me. I was completely shocked. I guess I should’ve paid attention to the red flag earlier in the day when he said he wanted to buy me a Louis Vuitton purse because he “just wanted me to be happy.” I declined and said I was already happy.

The next day, he asked me if I was mad, and I told him I was furious because I’m not that kind of girl. I’m not about to throw away my new career for any guy, much less this creep (and he was a very unhandsome guy with chronic bad breath that couldn’t be masked by the gallon of Axe cologne he doused on himself everyday). He refused to apologize and said he meant every word he said he night before. He was willing to leave his family! I knew “no” wasn’t enough for this guy, so I was forced to tell him that I was not attracted to him physically and then lied and said I had a boyfriend. The most incredible part is that he seriously thought I had feelings for him, too, and it never crossed his mind that I would say no. He accused me of flirting with him — for months! Not true at all, and anyone who knows me knows I am not a flirtatious person (plus, see bad breath and Axe comment above, ew!). The man made my skin CRAWL.

After we got back from that trip, he sent a long email to our managing partner praising my work ethic, work product, and professionalism. He sent me a copy of that email, too. Like any good abuser, he wanted to do something to make up for his bad acts. Even though everything in that email about my work was 100% true, it made me very sad to read it because I knew that my good work was clouded by his sexual advances. His motive in sending that email was not pure, and I deserved much better treatment.

For the next four months after that trip, he would tell me how good I looked (but would look over his shoulder first to be sure no one could hear) or how he liked what I was wearing, while creepily raising his eyebrows. I would always dismiss and redirect those unwanted comments by saying, “we don’t have time for that, so let’s talk about this case…” or something along those lines.

One weekend he insisted I go into the office on a Saturday to work – without my kid. I went into the office, but because I was suspicious of his motives, I brought my kid, much to his disappointment. Once I got my child settled in my office, I re-entered the conference room to discover that this partner had an alcoholic mixed drink waiting for me – it was 11am on a Saturday. He kept insisting I drink it, so I had to secretly pour a little out every time I left the room to grab something off the printer so that it appeared I was drinking it. I don’t know if he had something more sinister planned for that day, but I highly suspect he did. Luckily, I escaped that day without ever finding out – probably because I kept talking about my fake boyfriend! Thereafter, to my surprise, he abruptly stopped with all of his unwanted advances.

After that work weekend didn’t go his way, however, he spent the next three years retaliating against me by inundating me with incredibly unfair amounts of work with some very unrealistic timelines. When this man doesn’t get what he wants, he pitches emotional and physical fits that often involves stomping his feet, pounding the desk, and throwing objects around. And my rejection of him was no different.

For the first time, he started telling other lawyers at my firm that he questioned my capabilities or was otherwise bad mouthing me (when he had previously said I was bright and very capable). I considered reporting him. The stress was getting to me, but he was a rainmaker, and I wasn’t. Who was the firm going to believe? And even if the firm believed me, they weren’t going to get rid of this guy because he was putting money in their pockets. He was bringing in the big clients, and I was a lowly associate who had just bought a house and had a kid to feed. At some point the work was so overwhelming, but I just thought to myself, “BRING IT.” This man was trying to break me and make me quit or turn in bad work — and I WAS NOT GOING TO LET HIM. I dug in my heels, and somehow, I survived. I did report the workload issue and that he kept talking to me about his marital problems, and those issues got better. But I never reported his sexual advances.

Ten years later, and that son of a bitch just left the firm. Good riddance.

It should also go without saying that we have preemptively Crisco’d all vertical surfaces in the office.

— [Dilworth Paxson](https://www.dilworthlaw.com/Home) CEO [Ajay Raju](https://www.dilworthlaw.com/Lawyers/AjayRaju), notifying attorneys shortly after the Eagles won the Super Bowl that the firm’s Philadelphia office would be [closed on parade day](https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/sites/thelegalintelligencer/2018/02/07/eagles-parade-prompts-mass-shutdown-for-philly-law-firms/). Raju sent his email before the city had even announced when a parade would happen. The firm also allowed attorneys and staff members to wear Eagles apparel after the team won the NFC Championship.

# New Discrimination Lawsuit Against Jones Day Is Already Getting Messy

Jones Day (Photo by David Lat)

If you thought the[ explosive lawsuit filed against Jones Day](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/08/lawsuit-alleges-jones-day-doctored-firm-picture-to-make-attorney-look-more-caucasian/?rf=1) by former associates Julia Sheketoff and Mark Savignac was going to be boring once the initial shock of the allegations wore off, you’re in for more surprises. It was only last week that we told you about Sheketoff and Savignac’s case (not to be confused with the [class-action gender discrimination lawsuit](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/amended-gender-discrimination-case-brings-the-real-scoop-on-jones-day-compensation/) the firm is also facing), where they allege the firm’s non-gender neutral parental leave policy is discriminatory, the firm’s black box compensation system results in unequal pay, and the firm has a practice of altering firm photos to make their women attorneys more attractive/white, but the litigation machinations have already begun.

Shortly after the allegations in the complaint became public, Jones Day hit back at the plaintiffs, issuing a[ lengthy statement](https://www.jonesday.com/en/news/2019/08/jones-day-responds-to-litigation) disputing the claims, calling the allegations at various points “legally indefensible,” “sensationalized,” “frivolous[],” and “gratuitous.” But now the plaintiffs are using that statement against Jones Day.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Jones Day partners Mary Ellen Powers and Traci Lovitt entered their appearances in the case, and asked for a 30-day extension to respond, citing their hectic schedules. Plaintiffs oppose the extension, arguing Jones Day should not be granted additional time to answer the complaint as their public statements reflect the firm has already investigated the claims, which they say the firm has known about for months. As [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/08/20/jones-days-social-media-attacks-prove-no-delay-is-needed-ex-associates-say/) Law.com:

Jones Day’s contention that Sheketoff’s claims are frivolous is ”an extremely serious allegation against Julia as an officer of this court that surely would not have been made by a world-class law firm absent an exhaustive investigation,” the plaintiffs said.

The firm’s statement also provides “an inaccurate and misleading statement from (managing partner) Stephen Brogan discussing plaintiffs’ claims and smearing their reputations,” the pair asserted. “Defendants’ tactic of putting off litigation in court even as they attack plaintiffs on Facebook and Twitter also undermines the civil rights laws by deterring others from speaking out against discrimination at Jones Day.”

Plaintiffs also say that while Powers and Lovitt may have a lot on their plates, the firm still has a “small army” of lawyers to respond.

We’ll definitely be paying attention to all the twists and turns of this case as they develop.

# A 'Secret' To Success
## To be successful, you need to consider what success looks like.

By no means would I ever compare my 4’10” nerdy self to an athlete of any kind — but there is at least one thing professional athletes and I have in common. And that is — having a coach. This is one of my “secrets” to success. I have worked with my professional coach since late 2018, and while I know how this may sound to most lawyers (aka skeptics), the experience has been transformational for me, both personally and professionally.

For those skeptics out there, I feel you. Before I worked with my professional coach, I, too, was a skeptic. I had no idea what a professional coach did. On one hand, the vague term conjured distorted images of a swindler promising to make me C-suite ready with their equivalent of snake oil — mental mumbo-jumbo. On the other hand, if legitimate, I also questioned what a coach could do that I couldn’t find on my own in any number of self-help books lining the shelves of the airport bookstore.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But within a few sessions, and certainly over the years, I became a convert. My coach has helped me polish my executive presence, develop my conflict-resolution skills, gain self-awareness and confidence in my unique abilities, and provide accountability for my goals. In fact, we just had a session this week, and I left the meeting with even more clarity on what I wanted to work on this year — and importantly, the how. And while his advice may be found in bits and pieces of any number of books and is backed by neuroscience, I get his expertise tailored to me in one-hour sessions instead of reading and studying numerous books on my own.

For those who are curious, or perhaps, who have given a coach a shot and it didn’t work for you but you want to try again, here are a couple of thoughts to consider.

Make A List Of What You Want To Work On

While my first thought was to suggest that you need to know your why — and get clarity on what you want to gain from a coaching relationship — that may be too vague if you have never thought about this before. I think back to when I reached out to my coach initially, and I was a stressed-out, anxious mess who felt like she was drowning between work and being a new mom of two and reaching out to a coach was a Hail Mary. I, did, however, have one ask — and that was for him to help me come up with a tangible plan on implementing the feedback I received from my manager from my performance review.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Ultimately, to be successful, you need to consider what success looks like — what you want to achieve. In other words, you may set yourself up for failure if you just go to a coach with an unrealistic expectation of “make me better” without knowing what better looks like.

An extra perk to the list is that you can use it to “vet” your prospective coaches and ask them about their experience with clients with similar asks and what their methods are. It is important to find the right fit — someone who you find credible, that you trust — to give you what you’re looking for. For example, I chose my coach because I love StrengthsFinder, and he is StrengthsFinder-certified. I also don’t feel like I get value unless I get tangible takeaways and homework, which he provides to me in every session.

Be Ready And Willing To Invest The Time And Resources

Just like an athlete with their coach, it is unrealistic to presume that one session will be effective in unleashing all of your excellence. The process is necessarily iterative. The coaching relationship will only work if you are invested and willing to prioritize your meetings and willing to do the work. This means making the time to prework as needed before sessions, attend sessions, and then work on reflection and action-items that may come out of your sessions. If your work doesn’t cover the cost, you may need to consider investing in yourself.

Investing the time also means taking the time to get referrals from your friends, vetting the prospective coaches, and being open to the possibility that you may need to work with a few coaches before finding the right fit.

Inspired by [Victoria Beckham](http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/victoria-beckham-october-vogue-cover-star), I wrote a letter to my pre-lawyer self, to remind myself of the journey so far and to remind my readers of how far we have all come in such a short span of time in this life and through this career.

Dear Jayne,

I know arriving at University to study law after nine years of emotional upheaval scares you and that once again you are the new person, but this time you’re on a level footing because everyone is new and you’ve left home, which is extremely liberating for you. I know that when looking at yourself in the mirror, you feel ashamed of being at least two stone overweight and that you get dressed every day feeling that your clothes don’t look good on you. You will walk around the University campus and wonder what the next three years have in store for you.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
You will walk past the law building, which is grand and takes centre stage in the middle of the campus, and you will have butterflies, a sense of pride even that you’ve clawed your way out of comprehensive school and left behind the backwater beach town where you’ve lived since you were eleven. You will hope beyond all things that the sense of loneliness that’s haunted you since you were nine years old will now subside as you assimilate into this vibrant, young, and stimulating environment. It never will, but that doesn’t matter because later you will learn to harness immeasurable strength from being alone. To the outside world, you will always be an extrovert; only you and less than a handful of people will ever know that you’re an introvert, who has to be alone regularly to recharge.

You will spend the first term missing the person who you will later marry, you will visit home regularly to see him, but it’s time badly invested and eventually you will realise, despairingly, that you need to move on. Following Christmas of Year 1, you won’t return home for almost a year. It will be a powerful decision, one you will take against all emotional callings, however, surprisingly quickly that head over heart decision will start to reap benefits for you. Later in your life, you will wonder if you’re a sociopath, because your emotions have become so deeply buried. Again, this emotional control will actually become a plus for you, but you don’t know this yet. In weathering a lot of rejection you’ve just become resilient to ordinary levels of stress and your broken home, without siblings to support you, has meant you’ve just become an independent decision maker.

You will think back to times when compartmentalising feelings had caused you to adopt a form of OCD where you would obsessively hold your breath between road signs when in the passenger seat of a car. You will recall how it made traffic jams a life-threatening occurrence for a few years and, to this day, you are still an extremely travel sick person as the result of that odd and dysfunctional behaviour. However, you can rest now knowing that you have overcame your OCD and later it will make you realise how well you’ve learnt to work through issues in your own head, rationalise everything everyone says and commit to your decisions. When you do get married, your husband will have to remind you to talk about things, since working through your problems alone is a habit you find hard to shake off. It’s a trait that actually goes on to make you a star employee, as you never bother your superiors or HR with trivial complaints.

In Year 2 at University, you will head off on a Summer Scheme at a City law firm and it will be a shambles, the head of Graduate Recruitment will have been caught in some indiscretion with a Summer Scheme student from a previous intake and been marched unceremoniously out of the building the day before your scheme begins. Your supervisor in Corporate will be an uptight, gym-obsessed stick insect woman, who will make you feel like something she dragged in on her shoe. She will give you nothing to do all week and will subsequently trawl through your emails and find an email on your system where you have told another Summer Schemer that you are bored to tears. She will print and highlight the email and leave it on your chair for you to discover the following morning. You will feel like a tonne of bricks has collapsed on your dreams, but it will get worse. You will be confronted by an arrogant male trainee on your last day of the placement, who will tell you in no uncertain terms that you are a badly dressed, ill-educated mess who has no hope whatsoever of becoming a City lawyer. He will then try to persuade you to sleep with him. The whole experience will completely put you off the legal profession. The firm will ring you the following week to invite you to interview for a training contract. You will decline and tell them that you will be re-focussing your career on becoming a [holiday rep](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/holiday-rep). Comparing the week you’ve spent in their offices with the prior week in Faliraki, you will be convinced that pouring shots into open mouths in the sunshine for a living would be more fulfilling than paginating and proofreading alongside a circle of self-obsessed monsters. That will remain your position on life for the rest of your time at University.

In Year 3 of being an Undergraduate you will finally discover the gym after hitting a severely low point whilst facing the mirror one day. Combined with eating a diet of jacket potatoes topped by tuna and very little else for weeks on end, you will begin to enjoy being in your skin for the first time in your life. It will be a pivotal time, since you will have learnt so much from the diverse spectrum of people at University, and you will start to get that third-year confidence that will make you believe you could change the world. It will occur to you that changing the world probably won’t happen on the bucking bronco on a Greek island, so you will enroll in a Masters in law at King’s College London. It will be a good decision, although it won’t remove the nagging desire to travel more.

During your Masters, you will attend an open day at the firm where you will go on to train and stay for over a decade of your life and you will realise that being in private practice, having a fast-paced life, and doing work that gets your clients on the front pages of the financial news is exactly what you want for yourself. From that day on, you won’t look back; you will never question whether you’re in the right career. Not a Sunday night will pass where you won’t leap out of bed on Monday to go to work and see what new and exhilarating things will happen that week, you will discover every day is different to the next, and each challenge will mould you into a better lawyer and a more dynamic person. From time to time (although thankfully not often), you will be faced with characters like the arrogant male trainee, but you will have already proved him wrong and so you’ll prove them wrong too.

Keep going; don’t give up.

Lots of love,
Yourself (15 years later)

# Attorney Called Out Over Heated Cross Examination Of Cardi B
## It's the opposite of a masterclass on how to conduct a cross examination.

Singer Cardi B is being sued for $5 million by Kevin Brophy over the photoshopping of Brophy’s tattoo onto an actor’s back on the cover of Cardi’s 2016 mixtape, Gangsta Bitch Music Vol. 1. Testimony in the case got testy yesterday, with Central District of California judge Cormac J. Carney desperately trying to hold the line of decorum in his courtroom.

It began with plaintiff’s counsel, A. Barry Cappello asking Cardi B if she’d read Brophy’s deposition testimony. Brophy testified that he was humiliated that his distinctive tattoo was photoshopped onto the image of a man performing oral sex on Cardi B in the backseat of a car. Cardi said she hadn’t read the testimony and made repeated arguments about the $5 million she’s being sued over. And that’s when the decorum broke down, as [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1541556) Law360:

“Let’s try to get through this. The jury is here for all of us, including you, so let’s respect everyone in the courtroom while we can,” Cappello told Cardi B, who shook her head and turned away, prompting her attorney Peter J. Anderson of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP to object, complaining about Cappello’s line of questioning.

The proceedings quickly spiraled into overlapping arguments by the parties, culminating in Cappello exclaiming, “Canned testimony!” before the jury. Judge Carney then called a break, and outside the presence of the jury turned to Cappello, who was at the podium.

Judge Carney warned Cappello about his behavior, “That totally crossed the line, sir.” Anderson wanted jury instructed about the exchange, but Carney seemed flummoxed at the situation:

“I don’t know what to do,” Judge Carney said, shrugging. “I’m thinking of having Ms. Cardi B finish with her testimony. You’ve gotten a lot of your direct testimony; Cardi B has clearly said what she feels is appropriate. That, or I’m thinking of a mistrial that I’ll do on my own.”

Even before the straw that nearly broke Judge Carney’s back, the testimony has been characterized by argumentative exchanges:

“It’s not Mr. Brophy. It don’t look like Mr. Brophy. You guys been harassing me for the $5 million, the money I worked my ass off with two kids these past years,” Cardi B argued. “It’s really insulting to me as a woman that a man is claiming responsibility in the lawsuit for all the success and work I had done and claiming that my success came from the portion of his tattoo, when it’s my voice that made me famous since 2014!”

Cappello commented that the plaintiffs are seeking relief including punitive damages to set an example, “so celebrities like you don’t invade the privacy of individuals,” but she continued to answer that the man in the photo is a fit, Black model and not Brophy, leading Cappello at one point to throw up his hands and turn from the podium, before Judge Carney stepped in, commenting: “You’re both arguing.”

“I’m looking for serenity,” Cappello said. “What am I supposed to do? Just wait? Is this on my time? That’s my problem.”

After the much needed break, Cardi B’s testimony resumed, with Cappello getting 30 minutes and the defense getting 60 minutes. The “Bodak Yellow” rapper was instructed to answer only “Yes,” “No,” or “I can’t answer that question,” unless asked for further explanation.

“We’re arguing with one another, it’s not productive,” the judge said. “It’s unprofessional, and our brand is being diluted, so please ask questions about the facts, not arguments.”

Which feels like an understatement, if anything.

# Why, I'll Got Y'All Bonuses (Another Firm Match... Do You Get It?)
## Say it fast.

It’s becoming increasingly clear that the market has spoken on bonuses. That’s not particularly surprising given the skittishness surrounding the economy. No one wants to be left behind, but there’s not going to be a broad-based effort to overthrow this grid.

Now the devil is in the details. Who includes stub years? Super-seniors? Counsel? Payout dates? Billable minimums? This is where all the action is.

Weil Gotshal clocks in at 19th in the Am Law 100 and $1,856,219,000 in gross revenue. It’s going to include the new class and clarifies that counsel in their first three years are looped in with the class of 2015. Bonuses will be paid on January 31st.



Congrats, “y’all.”

The full memo is recreated on the next page.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Simpson Thacher Enters The COVID-19 Biglaw Bonus Wars
## This compensation leader doesn't want to be outdone by anyone.

You know what’ll put a little pep in an associate’s step when it’s close to 5 p.m.? A special bonus! Hooray!

Elite firms have been falling all over themselves to match the generous [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/) scale for COVID appreciation bonuses (a trend that was first [started by  Cooley](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cooley-bonuses/)), and one by one, firms like [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/milbank-bonuses/), [Irell](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/irell-bonuses/), [Hueston Hennigan](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/another-elite-firm-affirms-their-commitment-to-the-top-of-the-bonus-scale/), [Sullivan & Cromwell](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/sullivan-cromwell-makes-a-move-in-covid-19-bonus-war/), and [Debevoise](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/debevoise-bonuses/) have opened up their coffers.

Who’s up next to fatten associates’ wallets? Not to be outdone by anyone, the latest firm to show associates the money is Simpson Thacher. We’ve been wondering where you’ve been. Welcome to the party! Simpson will be matching the DPW scale up to the class of 2012, and in a memo (available in full on the [next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/simpson-covid-bonus/2/)), the firm praised associates and counsel. “We are immensely grateful for your hard work and perseverance under these trying circumstances,” chairman [Bill Dougherty](https://www.stblaw.com/our-team/partners/william-r-dougherty) wrote.

- Class of 2018: $10,000
- Class of 2017: $20,000
- Class of 2016: $27,500
- Class of 2015: $32,500
- Class of 2014: $37,000
- Class of 2013: $40,000
- Class of 2012: $40,000
Simpson associates in good standing across the world will receive these special bonuses on October 15. Not to worry, because it’s unlikely the special bonuses will have an impact on year-end bonuses at the firm. (Specifically, Dougherty wrote, “We do not anticipate this special bonus will impact year-end bonus levels, which we expect to be at least consistent with last year’s amounts.”)

Congratulations to everyone at the firm.

P.S. In case you’re wondering where Cravath’s special bonus money is… so are we. Is the prestigious firm planning to come over the top or [pull a Kirkland](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/)? We suppose we’ll have to wait and see.

Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Stat Of The Week: Remote Work Or More Money?

We recently set out to gauge how our readers feel about office reentry, specifically asking whether different levels of salary bump would be preferable to permanent work-from-home flexibility.

According to our survey, it would take a 30% increase to get over half of our readers to choose to forgo the ability to work remotely. 

A combined 357 of our 600-plus respondents said a 10%, 20%, or 30% salary increase would be their choice over permanent remote flexibility. (Not all respondents completed the full survey.) 

See the breakdown below. 

Which is more appealing to you?



Which is more appealing to you?

Asked only of those who reported they would prefer permanent work from home flexibility over a 10% pay raise.



Which is more appealing to you?

Asked only of those who reported they would prefer permanent work from home flexibility over a 20% pay raise.

Stay tuned for a full report on how our readers feel about returning to the office, including frequent reactions like “Noooooooooooooooooooooo” — along with a handful of positive ones as well.

# Want To Hire Your First-Choice Candidate? Don’t Delay!
## As the saying goes, 'time kills all deals,' and this rings especially true in the world of legal hiring.

Relative to 2021’s unprecedented level of lateral hiring, the market has cooled somewhat this year.  But it would be a mistake to conclude that law firms now have the upper hand.  By historical standards, we are still in a supply-constrained market, and there remains imperative for firms to optimize their hiring processes to avoid self-inflicted errors.  The biggest culprit in this category is unnecessary delay: the longer and more drawn out the interview process is, the less likely a firm is to hire its preferred candidate.  As the saying goes, “time kills all deals,” and this rings especially true in the world of legal hiring.

The consequences of delay

Law firms don’t intentionally design an inefficient hiring funnel.  But unless the process is managed with exceptional focus and discipline, it’s all too easy to end up in a bad place.  Small decisions that individually seem reasonable can collectively accumulate into a bloated process that alienates candidates.  Moreover, the longer the process, the greater the risk of losing a top candidate to your competition. 

A good example is the number of interviewers.  Firms have an understandable tendency to solicit input from a large cross-section of the candidate’s potential future colleagues.  On the surface, allowing more lawyers to weigh in seems perfectly reasonable, and even good for the candidate, as it theoretically provides greater insight into firm culture.  But by adding one more interviewer here and another one there, the firm can inadvertently end up with a daunting process that places an excessive burden on the candidate’s time.  Moreover, the larger the group of interviewers, the more difficult it is to compile feedback internally, and the greater the potential for delay.  

Firms tend to underestimate candidates’ propensity to abandon a slow hiring process.  But we at Lateral Link see this happen routinely.  The vast majority of candidates we work with tell us that the most frustrating part of their job search is the long wait after interviews to obtain feedback from a prospective new employer.  If a candidate does not receive feedback within a week or two, they question a firm’s continued interest, and in turn, they lose interest in the firm.  I recently worked with an attorney who was so offended by a firm’s long drawn-out process that they wrote the firm off completely and pursued other opportunities.  By the time the firm got back to me expressing continued interest, I had to sadly let them know the candidate had accepted another role and was off the market.  You snooze, you lose!

The consequences of a poorly managed process tend to extend beyond the individual candidate who goes through it.  Lawyers talk to their friends about their experiences, and firms that drag out the hiring process risk reputational damage.  It’s bad enough losing a candidate in the context of one particular search, but inadvertently dissuading potential future candidates from applying is even worse.  What’s more, a firm is losing money with every hour that goes by with a job vacancy.  As we all know, law firm attorneys are profit generators, so a limited number of attorneys doing the work translates to a ceiling on revenue.  And with attorneys’ hourly rates where they are, that’s literally thousands of dollars in lost revenue every day.  There’s also the negative impact a job vacancy has on a firm’s current employees. When a vacancy has been open for an extended period of time, the extra workload inevitably falls on others within the team.  This added responsibility can lead to burnout, stress, and low morale. That in turn has a direct impact on retention rates as the burned out team members look for greener pastures with increasing urgency.

Tips for improving efficiency

So what can firms do to improve their efficiency and make it more likely that they’re able to hire their first-choice candidate?  It isn’t rocket science.  Think ahead.  Stick to the plan.   Be efficient.  Communicate frequently.  And quickly make the offer.

Sometimes long hiring processes are the result of misalignment in the firm about the type of candidate desired, or even about whether to hire at all.  Any such disagreements must be resolved before launching the recruitment process.  If there isn’t alignment among all relevant stakeholders about what it is the firm needs, don’t post a vacancy as a means of forcing the conversation.  Have the debate internally and come to a collective decision.  Only then should you solicit applications.

At the beginning of the process, map out precisely who the candidate is to meet with and book all interview slots in the interviewers’ calendars.  If there is a high risk of an interviewer not being available in the necessary window, find a substitute interviewer ahead of time.  Don’t let foreseeable delays derail the process.  In addition, avoid the temptation to add extra interviewers partway through.  Sometimes the logic for doing so really is compelling, but this should be an exceptional situation.  Have the discussion upfront about who needs to participate, and stick to the plan.  Then solicit feedback from the interviewers immediately after the interview while the conversations are fresh in their minds. 

If the process is unreasonably long, the firm will lose candidates.  But at the margin, proactive communication can be highly effective in keeping a candidate engaged.  Tell candidates upfront what the process entails and how long it’s expected to take.  If an unexpected complication arises, inform the candidate and/or recruiter promptly.  Give a real explanation for the delay, along with assurances that the firm remains interested, and be sure to check in regularly to keep the candidate warm.  But by no means should you string a candidate along.  Job seekers strongly dislike that, and it can really sour the relationship before it even starts.

Finally, once the interviewers have collectively identified a first-choice candidate, make an offer as soon as you possibly can.  It’s not a problem if the offer has various contingencies, such as conflicts and background checks.  But a fast offer is a critical signal to the candidate that the firm is serious about making the hire.

Take advantage of what you can control

Many elements of the hiring process fall outside a firm’s control.  At the height of the boom in 2021, when mid-level corporate lawyers seemed almost impossible to find, there was no magic wand a firm could wave to increase candidate supply.  But firms do control the efficiency of their hiring process, and making an active effort to improve it can lead to a material improvement in the firm’s recruiting success. One law firm we work with regularly has mastered this process and typically makes associate hiring decisions within a matter of two to three weeks.  They know what they want in a new hire, and when they find it, they don’t delay.  Everyone is busy and no one has time to waste, so fast-tracking the hiring process and making it as efficient as possible will go a long way with prospective employees.  

If your firm or law department has questions about how to improve the lateral hiring process and eliminate some pain points, please don’t hesitate to contact me or any of my Lateral Link colleagues.

# Law Firm Mentoring Trip Heads To Amsterdam Sex Show
## This story is going exactly where you think it is.

As you might suspect from the title, this is a story about pending sexual harassment litigation.

A 27-year-old newly qualified solicitor says a 49-year-old married senior partner took her and a clutch of other attorneys to an Amsterdam sex show. Because nothing builds cohesion with your female employees than watching live porn… as a team.

Unsurprisingly, the junior attorney — who is nameless as are all parties in this matter per the tribunal’s order — alleges that this [wasn’t an isolated incident](https://www.legalcheek.com/2019/02/newly-qualified-solicitor-claims-married-law-firm-partner-took-her-to-live-amsterdam-sex-show/) and corresponded with a campaign that involved trips to expensive restaurants and unwanted sexual advanced in hotels on business trips.

The complainant also recounted “constant” groping in hotel rooms, as well as being “secretly videoed” and photographed. A said that she put up with the harassment for the sake of her career:

“The way I reacted to the sexual harassment and the touching was, I kept telling myself you have got no choice, you have to put up with this otherwise you’re going to lose your job.”

The attorney claims she was fired from her job for spurning the partner’s advances. For his part, the partner denies everything and says the junior was fired for screwing up her timesheets which is an awkward point for me to plug some of the truly amazing timekeeping software available on the market. His attorney cites some messages she sent friends indicating that she wanted to “f**k up his life” which could suggest an act of revenge but could also be an entirely reasonable response to being harassed and then fired so it may not be the smoking gun the partner thinks it is.

In any event, don’t take your employees to sex clubs. That’s your official Above the Law tip of the day.

Biglaw money is all around us! It’s the most wonderful time of the year in Biglaw, and that means year-end bonuses are making the rounds.

Arnold & Porter, which took in $1,033,000,000 in gross revenue last year making it #46 on the Am Law 100, announced its year-end bonuses. As expected, the firm matched the prevailing market rate for most associates — with extra cash for those that billed a bunch this year.

The bonus grid at the firm is as follows:



On top of these bonus numbers, associates that billed 2,600+ hours will get a 20% bump, 2,500-2,599 hours will get you an additional 15% and 2,400-2499 hours will net you 10% more.

Bonuses will be paid on January 31st. You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/ap-bonus-22/2/)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Firm Getting Busy Opening New Offices
## Biglaw expansion is the name of the game.

Eversheds Sutherland is heating up its U.S. expansion. As you may recall, in 2017, the United Kingdom-based Eversheds merged with the Atlanta-based Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan, and expansion has been on the combined firm’s mind since then.

In May, Eversheds Sutherland opened up a Chicago office. The location was started by a pair of lateral real estate partners — Marc Benjamin from White & Case and Susan Kai from Kirkland & Ellis — and litigation partner Robert Owen who relocated to Chicago from New York. The firm has over 100 clients in the midwest, including Texaco and Mondolez, and as [reported by](https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2019/05/29/eversheds-sutherlands-chicago-office-signals-us-growth-plans-for-transatlantic-firm/) Law.com, the firm intends the office to be a point of focus:

“We needed to be physically on the ground in Chicago,” [Eversheds Sutherland’s co-CEO Mark Wasserman] said. “We plan for it to become a significant focal point for us.”

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
But that’s not the only location the firm is building out. Yesterday, the firm announced they were opening a San Diego outpost, led by a trio of intellectual property partners —  Jose Patino, Nicola Pisano, and Christopher Bolten — they picked up from Foley & Lardner. And, as[ reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/07/17/eversheds-sutherland-announces-san-diego-branch-eyes-more-us-locations/) Law.com, the firm believes that office is ripe to grow even bigger:

Adding the IP group in San Diego “is part of our strategy for U.S. growth,” Wasserman said, adding that he expects additional lawyers and staff from Foley & Lardner to join the trio at Eversheds.

Eversheds is also talking to lawyers with corporate, litigation or tax practices in San Diego, he said. “We think there are other opportunities.”

This bumps the number of U.S. offices up to eight, but don’t think that’s the end of the firm’s American invasion:

In the United States, Eversheds is “very interested” in growing in California, Wasserman said, adding that the firm is also talking to lawyers in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

“We would be happy to add this group wherever they were located,” he said of the Foley & Lardner partners. “And it’s a perfect opportunity to get more of a foothold in California.”

Eversheds also will continue adding lawyers to its existing offices in Texas, New York and Chicago, Wasserman said. “We’re talking to a lot of people in New York, and I expect we will be adding other people in Chicago as well over the next few months.”

It looks like the firm has picked the right time for this growth push — revenue was up 10 percent in 2018. If they keep on adding partners, their revenue is bound to see another upward tick in 2019.

# What Are The Absolute Worst Products Your Firm Makes You Use?
## A survey that associates should drop everything and take right now.

The modern lawyer spends the whole day interfacing through technology. Research is online, partner direction is emailed, meetings are teleconferenced, client relations and documents both have their own management systems, and so on. Technology’s tentacles invade an attorney’s day in ways great and small. Legal tech journalists try to stay on top of what’s out there by [talking to vendors and firm experts](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/schedule-a-meeting-with-your-firms-it-group-this-week/) about the challenges and opportunities they see.

But we rarely ask the associates charged with wielding all this tech how they feel about the products they’re using. [This new survey](https://form.typeform.com/to/bTlqg2gr?utm_source=abovethelaw) focuses on how associates approach technology and it’s asking some blunt questions:

What is the one tool in this category you hate but are forced to use?

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
So many surveys ask lawyers to participate to “tell us what you think” but nothing motivates someone to take the 5 minutes required to fill out a survey more than “tell us what you hate.”

This associate survey is one of four concurrent surveys by [Modernize.legal](https://www.modernize.legal/) seeking legal tech opinions from associates, law firm leaders, the firm-side buyers of the tech, and tech providers to get something of a 360-degree view of the industry.

We want to know how associates really feel about the training and tools available to them, how they feel about the impact of AI on their careers, and the legal tech products they love and hate to use. So we’re going to ask them directly: almost 80,000 associates across 200+ firms.

BUT they can always use more responses and you can always stand to get your opinion out there. Are there tools you hate? Tools you love? Do you have any faith in your firm to figure out how any of it works?

# Biglaw Firm Finally Matches The Cravath Salary Scale
## Some welcome compensation news. Congrats!

This may sound hard to believe, but some Biglaw firms are just now getting around to matching the Cravath compensation scale. If you recall, the latest round of [associate salary wars](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) started way back in January, and almost nine months later, some firms have finally decided to make their salary moves for associates. Which firm is the latest to offer market compensation?

That would be Bracewell LLP, a firm that brought in $289,000,000 gross revenue in 2021, placing it at No. 124 on the most recent Am Law 200 ranking. Sources tell us that the news of salary increases was announced during a meeting on August 30. Announcing a big-money match is certainly one way to get people back into the groove before the Labor Day holiday. The firm’s Cravath salary match is effective for associates at the firm on October 1.

We’ve reached out to the firm for confirmation of these raises, but have yet to hear back. If and when we do, we will provide an update here. UPDATE (11:26 a.m.): A spokesperson from the firm has officially confirmed the raises.

Congratulations to everyone at Bracewell on their new market salaries! Sure, associates are receiving the news later than their peers at other firms, but when it comes to cash like this, it’s better late than never.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# This Biglaw Firm Is Ready To Go Back To The Office -- Next Week
## Many firms are delaying their plans to reopen their offices... but not this one.

Many law firms have decided to slow down their plans for the 2021 reopening of their offices amid the ongoing pandemic. While some have opted to cancel their previous plans without announcing a specific return-to-office date, others have given up on going back this year altogether, announcing return dates in 2022. Others still are clinging to their hopes for a successful reopening en masse in 2021 — as soon as next week.

One of those firms is Kelley Drye & Warren, a firm that once encouraged lawyers and staff members to do their best to [come to the office from time to time](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/biglaw-firms-easy-breezy-approach-to-office-reopening/) this past summer, before it would move to a “fuller return to the office with flexibility for remote work” after Labor Day. That “fuller return” starts on Monday.

“We understand that you may be anxious about the return,” [Robert Steiner](https://www.kelleydrye.com/Our-People/Robert-I-Steiner), the firm’s New York managing partner wrote in an office-wide email earlier this week. “We have taken and will continue to take steps to make the office as safe as possible for all.” Some of those steps include:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- The use of an employee screening app to track attendance;
- Following CDC guidance on the use of masks;
- Requiring all visitors to complete a vaccination verification form; and
- Cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces throughout the office.
Steiner finished off his message by thanking all employees, and letting them know that although they may be anxious, there is still flexibility as the firm tries to achieve this new success as a team:

On behalf of the partners, I want to thank you once again for all that you have done to serve our clients and keep the firm running smoothly over the last eighteen months.  As much as the return to the office signals that we are moving forward and past the worst of the pandemic in New York, there will be some added and unexpected pressures and challenges as we get used to new and changed routines. Please reach out to your practice group leader, your manager, to HR, or to me if you need some additional flexibility.

What has your firm announced as far as a reopening plan is concerned? The more information is out there, the more likely it is that firms will be able to establish a market standard for a return to work.

# Some (Tentative) Good News For Alan Dershowitz... And Some More Bad News
## His motion is back on the docket... some of his letters aren't.

It took awhile, but Professor Alan Dershowitz has finally gotten some good news, however tentative, in the looming defamation case brought against him by a sex trafficking victim of Dershowitz’s buddy and former client Jeffrey Epstein.

To recap, a few of Epstein’s underaged victims claim that Epstein directed them to have sex with Dershowitz. Dershowitz strenuously denies the claim and goes on television demanding that his accusers take him to court if they really believe these claims. [So one of his accusers has taken him to court](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/dershowitz-wanted-a-trial-over-sex-trafficking-accusations-hes-getting-one/).

Dershowitz kicked off the proceedings by immediately [moving to have Boies Schiller, the pro bono attorneys for the now-adult woman, disqualified](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/harvard-law-schools-dershowitz-moves-to-disqualify-boies-schiller-in-sex-trafficking-case/). This move took her attorneys aback since the filing [violated all manner of Judge Preska’s individual rules](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/dershowitz-harvard-law-school-motion-to-disqualify-boies-schiller-immediately-dumped-for-hilarious-reason/) and was promptly struck from the docket.

But Dershowitz’s attorneys wrote a letter in an effort to cure the situation, asking for a pre-motion conference to get the motion heard. Upon hearing from Boies Schiller, Judge Preska has determined that a pre-motion conference would be a waste of her time given the clearly unresolvable conflict and asked the parties to set up a briefing schedule.

So, the good news is that Dershowitz will have his disqualification motion heard. The bad news is that there’s no guarantee how Judge Preska will take it. The original motion was 28 pages long — exceeding Judge Preska’s page limit, naturally — but BSF’s initial response (not even a full brief) clocked in at 3 pages and seemed fairly compelling in that short span. You can check out the [original motion here](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/harvard-law-schools-dershowitz-moves-to-disqualify-boies-schiller-in-sex-trafficking-case/2/) and [BSF’s response here](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/some-tentative-good-news-for-harvard-law-school-alan-dershowitz-and-some-more-bad-news/2/) for comparison.

We’ll see how this turns out.

In the meantime, the Second Circuit also got in on the act yesterday, filing a curt:

Appellant Alan M. Dershowitz’s submission of a letter does not comply with the Court’s prescribed filing requirements. Despite due notice, the defect has not been cured.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the said letter is stricken from the docket.

When it rains, it pours a never-ending stream of misfilings apparently.

Ji-In Lee Houck

Steptoe & Johnson has now joined the ranks of [Chadbourne & Parke](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1), [Proskauer Rose](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/inside-the-50-million-gender-discrimination-case-a-partner-filed-against-proskauer-rose/), [LeClairRyan](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-alleges-sexism-derailed-her-career-in-a-new-lawsuit/?rf=1), and [Sedgwick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-male-dominated-culture/) as a defendant in a gender discrimination lawsuit. The suit against Steptoe, filed yesterday in a Los Angeles federal court by Ji-In Lee Houck, a former contract attorney and associate at Steptoe, alleges a pay disparity for women associates, as Law.com [reports:](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/06/27/steptoe-johnson-accused-of-discriminating-against-female-lawyers/)

“Despite paying lip-service to diversity in its workforce, and even counseling the firm’s own clients on policies to avoid pay discrimination, defendant Steptoe & Johnson LLP … subjects its female attorneys to unequal pay,” Houck’s lawyer, Lori Andrus of Andrus Anderson, wrote in the complaint.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Houck, who is now a litigator at [Stalwart Law Group](http://stalwartlaw.com/profiles/ji-in-lee-houck/), alleges that when she started at the firm in 2013 as a contract attorney, her $85,000 salary was below that of others doing similar work at the firm, despite getting stellar annual performance reviews. By 2014, Houck was moved to an official associate position, but she says that did not rectify the pay disparity:

Houck’s salary did increase as she stayed longer at Steptoe—in June 2014, the firm officially designated her as an associate and raised her pay to $130,000, and she received another bump up to $160,000 in January 2015. But, the complaint said, that still left her short of male counterparts who at that point would have been making $210,000. Shortly before she left Steptoe in March 2016, the firm gave her another raise to $200,000, which was retroactive back to the start of 2016.

The complaint also references at least one other woman at the firm who was also allegedly paid less than male counterparts.

The firm disputes the claims in the complaint:

Steptoe issued a statement on Tuesday responding to the lawsuit, saying the firm “is a strong supporter of women lawyers and professionals,” and noting that in 2016 its new partner class was 50 percent women and, in 2017, 80 percent of new partners were women.
….

“The allegations of associate pay discrimination in this lawsuit by a former junior associate who was hired as a contract attorney and stayed with the firm for less than three years are completely without merit, and we will vigorously defend ourselves against such baseless claims,” Steptoe’s statement said.

We’ll be following the lawsuit with interest.

# Are Good Law Firms 'Woke'?

Shoot!

I wrote a book that was fast asleep.

[The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](https://www.amazon.com/Curmudgeons-Guide-Practicing-Law-Second/dp/1641054344) argues that you should do your very best on every project (and that may not be good enough), you should be responsible, you should be diligent, you should be responsive. (I frequently defend those ideas in this column, too.) If you don’t care to do those things, then don’t expect to succeed at a good law firm. (You might succeed at a bad law firm. You might succeed in a career other than law. But you won’t succeed at a good law firm. Been there; done that. It’s not how it works.)

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
A few weeks ago, I took a test to measure my leadership style and assess whether I had unconscious biases.

I was startled to see questions asking whether I believed in “pursuing perfection” in my work, whether I valued “standard writing” in communications, and whether I thought “timeliness” mattered.

It turns out that if you believe in those things, you’re a less “inclusive” leader.

Indeed, I learned, articles now [insist](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_bias_of_professionalism_standards) that aiming for perfection — or as close to it as mortals can come — is no longer politically correct.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
If this is political incorrectness, then Biglaw is surely guilty.

I worked for a couple of decades at one of the world’s leading law firms.  Believe you me, that law firm pursued perfection. It insisted on using standard English writing in communications. And timeliness mattered.

It’s all a matter of self-protection. Partners are both expensive and busy. If partners receive top-quality work from associates, this saves partners time and clients money. Partners thus prefer to work with good associates.

Think of things from the partner’s perspective:

If you give me a draft brief that isn’t any good, then I have to rewrite the thing.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I’m not going to ask you to help with the next project. I’d rather make my life easier.

If I ask you to think through a legal project, and you miss the key issues, then either I must identify the issues myself or the client loses.

I’m not going to ask you to help with the next project. My clients prefer to win.

If you say that you’re going to get me a draft on Wednesday, and you don’t deliver it until Friday, then I’ll be crunched for time.

You lose. I’m not going to work with you again.

You might be allowed to produce poor-quality work once or twice. Partners understand that junior people are junior, and it takes time to learn. But partners will not be forgiving for very long.

Law firms are vicious, but they’re vicious in precisely the way a free market for associates dictates that they’ll be vicious.

When associates are up for partnership, the existing partners ask: “Is the associate a great lawyer?” and “Does the associate have the potential to bring in new business?”

If the answers are yes, the associate is invited into the partnership. If the answers are no, the associate is told to move on.

If this is not being woke, then every good law firm in America is asleep.

I suspect that every good management consulting firm, and investment bank, and accounting firm is asleep in this way, too.

If you want to do mediocre work, then go right ahead — but not in today’s great institutions.

If this is improper, then it is going to take many, many generations to break great law firms of that culture.

I don’t deny that large law firms have been backward in the more traditional, — and nastier — senses. Until the 1960s, the white-shoe law firms didn’t hire women or Jews or African-Americans or other “undesirables.” Everyone now agrees that this was wrong. Even today, partners prefer to hire, and mentor, and have lunch with people who resemble themselves, and that perpetuates sexism and racism. We must overcome that.

But the standards of quality for succeeding in a professional services firm apply equally to everyone — to associates who are male or female; white, black, brown, red, or yellow. Indeed, not so long ago, this was considered to be the preferred standard — the standard that eliminated racism and sexism.  Professors should read law school exams that are identified only by number; this avoids bias grounded in the sex or race of the student. Audition for an orchestra from behind a screen; this avoids bias grounded in the sex or race of the musician.

Historically, institutions tried to eliminate bias by concealing the identity of the applicant. Are we really saying that now we cannot judge the quality of the work without knowing the identity of the person who produced it?

Standards of excellence have applied equally through time.

Beethoven and Rembrandt didn’t aim for “good enough.” They aimed for perfection.

Booker T. Washington and Toni Morrison didn’t aim for “good enough.” They aimed for perfection.

Hokusai and Kenzaburō Ōe didn’t aim for “good enough.” They aimed for perfection.

If this is improper, then it’s absolutely entrenched; it permeates good law firms to the core.

It will take an awful long time to overcome it.

And you’ll have to convince many people that society will be improved for having defeated it.

# Older Attorneys And Younger Lawyers Practice Law Very Differently
## Veteran attorneys are usually more rigid in how they approach the practice of law, while younger attorneys typically embrace flexibility.

This column has already discussed how there is a generational divide in the practice of law.  Some veteran lawyers [do not understand what it’s like to live with student loans](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/advice-for-parents-of-student-loan-borrowers-introduction/) and might have antiquated notions about law school and other subjects.  From my own personal experience, older attorneys also approach [practicing law in very different ways from younger lawyers](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/how-to-talk-with-older-people-about-law-school-loans/).

One way that older attorneys practice law differently from newer practitioners is that veteran lawyers are more risk averse than younger attorneys.  Just like your investments are supposed to get less risky as you approach retirement, some older attorneys seem less willing to take risks that can potentially have a major windfall for them and their law firms.

At several points in my career, I have seen older attorneys refusing to pursue work that might be lucrative, but could be risky because of conflicts, malpractice liability, or other issues.  Older attorneys might want to take less risk because they are closer to retirement and don’t want to endanger what they have built over the course of their careers.

However, younger lawyers are usually a lot hungrier than older attorneys when it comes to originating business.  Newer attorneys usually have more of a need to make a name for themselves, [and are more likely to originate lucrative business despite the risk](https://studentdebtdiaries.com/extra-money-main-job/).  Of course, if you have more time before retirement to recover from a setback, you are going to be willing to put more on the line for a bigger payday.  In any case, people naturally have different outlooks depending on how far they are in their careers, and this affects how attorneys practice law.

From my own personal experience, some older lawyers also might not see the value of electronic discovery and social media information as much as younger attorneys.  Of course, this was more of an issue at he beginning of my career, when electronic discovery and social media case law was in its infancy.  However, some older attorneys don’t have much of a presence on social media, and still might not see the value of electronic discovery.

I once worked for a seasoned partner who was well into his 60s.  We had a case that could have benefited from social media discovery, since the plaintiff claimed injuries that couldn’t possibly be so serious if you judged him by the images on social media.  It was difficult to convince my boss to demand social media discovery, and he kept calling Facebook “MyFace,” even though MySpace was long dead by this point! We eventually obtained some very valuable social media discovery, and I was happy I was persistent on obtaining these really helpful materials.

Older attorneys also have more traditional views about practicing law that younger practitioners typically have.  Older attorneys, for instance. usually value having a fixed office that they can use to meet clients and out of which they base their practice.  Of course, it is typically a good idea to have some fixed place where you can base your practice, and you definitely earn a certain amount of “cred” if you have an office.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
However, many younger attorneys I know do not have a permanent office out of which they work.  Indeed, many (mostly younger) attorneys use work-share environments and other similar arrangements to have a workspace without the burdens of traditional offices.  As I have seen firsthand during my career, law firms can get into big trouble because of real estate issues, but some more traditional attorneys are less willing to forgo having a permanent office.

In additional, many older attorneys at firms where I worked valued traditional work relationships, in which employees come to work at a set time and leave at a set time.  These attorneys value office face time and collaboration, and do not want to institute nontraditional work arrangements.  I can understand why certain veteran lawyers sometimes institute more rigid work relationships, since some corporate clients require that attorneys be in their offices during business hours, and this is the way things have always been done.

However, working “9 to 5” is so 20th century!  Many younger attorneys I know have instituted nontraditional work arrangements in which attorneys can arrive at an office and leave as they please, so long as they bill a set number of hours.  In addition, many younger attorneys I know work from home and don’t even have a traditional office out of which they base their practice.

Still other younger attorneys I know have taken full advantage of the “gig economy” and don’t work for a traditional employer.  Rather, these attorneys get paid for each assignment they complete and they can finish the work wherever they want.  Working at one firm for an entire career was the trajectory of attorneys a generation ago, and now, younger attorneys tend to have more flexibility in their practice.

In the end, I am far from the first person to discuss the generational divide in the legal profession, and of course it is not fair to overgeneralize older and younger attorneys too much.  However it is important to keep in mind that older attorneys think differently than younger lawyers, and newer attorneys should remember this when interacting with older managers.  In any case, it is fair to say that veteran attorneys are usually more rigid in how they approach the practice of law, while younger attorneys typically embrace flexibility in how they practice.

# Biglaw Firms Stepping Up In The Fight For Reproductive Freedom
## Biglaw is fighting back.

Don’t think the spate of questionably (read: not) constitutional abortion restrictions — often styled as “heartbeat” bills — has gone ignored in the halls of Biglaw. Sure, your M&A deals and securities litigations are what’s bringing in the big bucks, but elite lawyers aren’t going to let current events pass them by, especially not if they have pro bono hours to throw at the problem.

As [reported by](https://biglawbusiness.com/big-law-pro-bono-takes-on-heartbeat-abortion-restrictions) Big Law Business, quite a few prominent firms have gotten involved in the legal battle to protect Roe v. Wade. Take a look at some of the important legal battles Biglaw has been fighting for reproductive freedom.

Paul Weiss partner[ Claudia Hammerman ](https://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/claudia-hammerman)has been working on challenging the restrictive laws of Mississippi:

“I jumped at the opportunity to protect the last abortion clinic in Mississippi and support the courageous doctors who fly in from out-of-state to provide abortion care to the women of Mississippi,” the New York-based Paul Weiss partner said.

At Morrison & Foerster, [Jamie Levitt](https://www.mofo.com/people/jamie-levitt.html), former chair of the firm’s pro bono committee, said the firm has been working on contraception and abortion-related legal matters for over 25 years, noting, “We look at it as a human rights issue and a health issue.”

O’Melveny partner [Leah Godesky](https://www.omm.com/professionals/leah-godesky/) says on reproductive freedom issues, “Every day we’re putting out new fires.” And they firm is certainly keeping busy in pro bono:

For instance, it recently helped the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project block an restrictive abortion law in Kentucky, and won a temporary restraining order against the state’s six-week abortion ban.

The firm also is litigating alongside the Center for Reproductive Rights, ACLU, and Planned Parenthood to block a slew of targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP laws) in Virginia.

“It’s been a really discovery heavy case, the kind of thing that O’Melveny loves to sink our teeth into,” said Godesky.

[Shannon Rose Selden](https://www.debevoise.com/shannonselden) of Debevoise said, in addition to a healthy amicus schedule on related issues, her firm is also working on a challenge to outpatient facility licensing laws in Louisiana:

“I’m happy to litigate these cases,” said Selden. “I wish we didn’t have to. But the ability to choose whether and when to have children and with whom is essential to so many of the other choices that women and girls make in their lives.”

Big Law Business also notes that Covington & Burling, Stinson, Simpson Thatcher, and Skadden have also taken on various pro bono projects to protect abortion rights over the last few years.

The attack on a woman’s right to choose is currently coming from a multitude of directions, so it’s good to see Biglaw stepping up to fight back.

40 years ago, Johnny Paycheck (seriously!) sang:

Take this job and shove it
I ain’t working here no more . . .
You better not try to stand in my way
‘Cause I’m walkin’ out the door

Johnny Paycheck’s reasons were romantically driven, but his sentiment perfectly sums up the legal market today.  Searching for growth, firms across the nation (and the world) have embraced a lateral hiring strategy at the both the partner and associate levels that, in a word, is failing.  Why do firms do it, why doesn’t it work, and what can change for the better?

The Lateral Craze

According to Altman Weil’s report, “2017 – Law Firms in Transition,” nearly all law firms (95.6%) said they would pursue lateral hiring as a growth strategy.  For 250+ lawyer firms, 99% of firms responded that lateral hiring is a growth strategy.  Simply, every large firm in America uses lateral hiring to grow. The Altman-Weil report further notes that two-thirds of firms will also “seek to acquire lateral groups.”

Despite this universal attraction to lateral hiring as a growth driver, the Altman-Weil report confirms a widely cited statistic in the industry — namely, “that half of laterals do not meet expectations in terms of books of business brought in and/or personal productivity.” More on that later.

So, with results that don’t justify all the lateral action, why do firms do it?  Back in May, in our [first column together](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/diversity-in-the-legal-profession-the-more-things-change-the-more-they-stay-the-same-until-they-dont/), we talked about this year’s Am Law 100 report, and what it really told us about revenue in Biglaw.

As a refresher, revenue per lawyer is up, but the distribution of that increase is uneven, and year-to-year results are highly volatile.  As we noted, there is significant and growing revenue stratification between the 50 highest grossing firms, and the next 50 firms, with the top half growing 3.6% and the bottom half declining 1.3%.  In other words, half the firms are up and half are down, making annual profit growth (PPP) that much harder for those “bottom 50” firms.  And volatility is increasing.  According to the American Lawyer, “In 2016, 44 percent of firms who report financial data to the bank [Citi] had a reversal in their rate of PPP growth from the year prior. . ..  In pre-recession times, only about 25 percent of firms on average saw a change in direction in their PPP from year-to-year . . ..”  Thus, the inability to create organic growth is driving firms to try to acquire growth, via lateral hiring.

And the Winners Are . . .

Based on the stats we’ve read, few firms are winning with a lateral strategy.  In fact, most firms don’t even think they’re winning!  According to an ALM Report, only 28% of firms view their lateral hiring strategy as “very effective.” According to that same ALM report, half of all lateral hires will fail within five years.  From a revenue perspective, over half (51%) of lateral hires won’t produce three-quarters of the expected first year book of business.  Worse, 30% of laterals won’t produce even half of the expected book of business.  (See ALM’s report: “Minimizing Risk in Lateral Partner Hiring – Effective Due Diligence.”)  In the last six months, two Am Law 50 law firms reported directly to us that each had to remove two laterals hired in the prior year because of those laterals’ failure to bring in even 30% of the revenue on which they negotiated their compensation, and in some cases also because of a cultural misfit — the old firm let time entry slide to mid-month or even month-end; the new firm thrives on the discipline of time entered by end of next business day.

And the cost?  According to Decipher,[[1]](#_ftn1) an independent corporate intelligence provider that helps law firms reduce the risk of a bad executive-level hire, the cost of replacing a partner hired laterally is 200%-400% of that partner’s annual compensation.  In the aggregate, the 400 largest U.S. law firms lose over $9 billion annually due to “partner mobility,” according to Howard Rosenberg, CEO of Decipher.

Stop, Look, and Listen

With the risks (and costs) of lateral hiring failure so high, the best advice we’ve heard mimics the street safety advice all learned years ago:  Stop, Look, and Listen.

First, firms should slow down, and not rush to make a hire that may well turn out to be a misfit.  Firms should consider cultural fit, past moves, client durability, and why a prospect is moving.  Culturally, firms need to understand the differences between firm cultures and be honest about how much someone deep into their career can really make a cultural shift.  Rosenberg told us of clients that won’t run even a basic background check until after a lateral partner questionnaire (LPQ) has been completed and an offer letter issued.  He described numerous circumstances where the post-LPQ (sometimes post-offer) investigation turned up disqualifying and/or troubling information that was easily known in advance, and would have precluded an offer in the first place.

Second, firms should review the extensive materials available to them, including information in court filings, deal databases, press clippings, and through simple Internet searches, including social media.  Obviously, firms must comply with HR policies and the law.  But too often firms don’t want to scare off prospects by asking about screening, or miss out on the opportunity to review materials that are readily available, or that can be obtained from or through third party companies.

Finally, firms should listen — to a lateral prospect’s clients, to colleagues at a lateral prospect’s current and past firms, and to colleagues in that prospect’s industry specialty.  And there are at least a handful of third-party companies that now specialize in helping firms screen and de-risk lateral hiring.  For firms concerned about the process, how a candidate may react to being screened, or even the compliance issues involved, using a third party may offer a simpler and faster solution.

As we head into the end of another year of transition in the legal industry, where lateral hiring is now a near universal “growth strategy,” we expect to see at least some firms adapt to the challenges of that strategy.  Barring that, we could be hearing a lot more of Johnny Paycheck’s lyrics.

Money, money, money, and much more money: That seems to be the theme this week throughout Biglaw, as bonus announcements are made one after the other, ad infinitum, in the wake of Davis Polk’s [Cravath match](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/) with the addition of [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/12/davis-polk-bonuses-21/) for all associates. This is now the new market bonus standard, and law firms are quickly lining up to make their matches. After all, this lateral market is still hot like fire, so firms need to prove that they’re up to snuff — and fast.

The latest firm to speak up on bonuses is Shearman & Sterling, which made its announcement just before 6 p.m. last night. Of course the firm matched market, and here’s the 2021 bonus scale, in case you’ve forgotten what it looks like:

David J. Beveridge, the firm’s senior partner, noted in his memo that Shearman’s counsel are “very important,” and that while their bonuses are more individualized, they would be in line with the market. (Speaking of counsel, how is your firm handling bonuses for these attorneys? Please get in touch with us and let us know.)

Everyone at the firm will receive their bonuses on December 22. Congratulations!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Shearman & Sterling.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Mo#h3rf*ck3r. Don’t worry, it doesn’t sting because they call themselves MoFo. Even though it is late in the day (at least on the East Coast), it’s official! Morrison & Foerster has moved over to the Cravath scale for all U.S. associates.

The effective date of the increases is July 1, as has been the industry standard, and the classes of 2015 and 2016 will both be bumped to $180,000.

Maybe now these associates won’t be saddled with the kind of debt [some former Jenner & Block partners carry](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/solicitor-general-don-verrilli-to-step-down-perhaps-before-all-scotus-opinions-are-announced/).

# Will Biglaw Firms Be Forced Into 2022 Office Reopenings?
## Many firms are hoping to be back in the office by mid-fall, but that may not work out as planned.

Will your law firm be reopening its offices in 2021? For the majority of firms, that’s certainly the hope, but given the fact that the pandemic has taken a turn for the worse in the U.S., those plans may have to be put on hold yet again.

This summer, when things were still looking up, many firms targeted post-Labor Day returns, expecting attorneys and staff to return to the office in some capacity on September 7 or September 8. At many firms, those dates were pushed back to September 21. Quite a few firms are holding fast to that late September date, while others have already moved their expected return date to October 21. On the flip side of the coin, some firms haven’t committed to a date at all, but have told employees that they’ll provide 30 days’ notice before setting a date. Scant few firms have already committed to keeping their offices closed for a full return until January 2022.

So, are these fall return dates unrealistic? Signs may be pointing to yes, depending on who you ask.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Baker Hostetler, for example, delayed its proposed September 8 office return, but has yet to set another proposed return date.  Here’s what the firm is thinking, as noted in the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/09/07/with-office-returns-delayed-law-firms-may-not-get-back-till-2022/):

[Chairman Paul Schmidt] said if the firm wants to try another return, mid-to-late October or early November could still be plausible targets, “but it almost is a bit of a binary choice.”

“If you wait much longer, you run into Thanksgiving and the December holidays, with people in and out and around, and you just really wonder if it makes sense if you wait too long into the year,” Schmidt said. “We would be very disappointed if we don’t open in 2021, and we are still hopeful that we’ll be able to do that. But I think the window is pretty finite with us not coming back in September. It’s got to be sometime in the middle of the fall if we’d like to do that.”

Steven Di Fiore, chief operating officer of Epstein Becker & Green, said that the firm is hoping to return to the office on October 6. Am Law has the details:

He said October made sense as a target because it gave them a chance to assess school re-openings, and gave parents time to adjust to those routines.

“That’s one of the things that keeps some away from the office. So we already thought that was a nice cushion of time to have people come in, and it looks like a lot of other firms are moving to October,” he said. “But you don’t know what’s going to come next. But so far, so good.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Bill Bice, CEO of nQ Zebraworks, said that most firms he’s spoken with have said that their mid-fall return dates are likely to be pused back. In the alternative, if those dates remain in place, firms will probably alter their in-office expectations, requiring less face time.

Help us help you. Let us know what your firm is doing to protect employees and adjust to the new normal during this unprecedented moment in time.

# Black Twin Brothers Working Together As Partners At Quinn Emanuel
## These brothers are truly one-of-a-kind in the Biglaw world.

Twins have a very special bond, and some of them can’t help themselves but to go through all of life’s journeys together. Take Justin and Asher Griffin, of New Jersey, for example. Their father was Black and their mother was white, and as mixed-race children, they said they had a hard time fitting in. But from high school to college to law school to Biglaw, they were inseparable, following in each other’s footsteps — sometimes at the same time, sometimes separated by a few years.

The Griffins both attended Princeton at the same time, but diverged before law school because Justin had been recruited by the Cleveland Indians to play minor league baseball. He gave himself two years to get into the major leagues, but later joined his brother Asher at Stanford Law. Justin started working as an associate for Quinn Emanuel after graduation in 2004, but Asher turned down his offer even though he’d interned there as a 1L. Instead, he moved to Texas to join Baker Botts.

Asher later left Baker Botts for litigation boutique Scott Douglas & McConnico, where he became partner in 2008. Justin remained at Quinn Emanuel, where he made partner in 2013. It wasn’t until 2020 that the brothers would finally have the opportunity to be reunited in law practice.

Thanks to the firm’s success with remote work during the pandemic, two partners moved to Austin to work, and Justin quickly tried to bring his brother on board. In January, the firm announced it would be opening an office there, and Asher would be one of its founding members.

The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/02/10/brothers-in-law-twins-reunite-as-quinn-emanuel-partners/) has some details on the rarity of the Griffins’ situation:

It is rare for anybody, but especially a Black attorney, to reach the ranks of Big Law partnership. Less than 2% of Am Law 200 partners are Black. For twin brothers to do so—and at the same firm, within the Am Law 50—is perhaps one-of-a-kind.

“We can’t wait to be in a hearing together,” said Justin.

Congratulations to the Griffin brothers. Finally, Biglaw’s got Quinns — errr… twins!

# Biglaw's Last Hope For Better Bonuses Just Let Associates Down
## Maybe next year this firm will stop following the leader?

Sorry, associates, but you can uncross your fingers now. For some reason, associates were pining away and hoping against hope that Sullivan & Cromwell would rescue the market from the same bonuses that have been handed out year after year — and perhaps even offer spring bonuses like back in the day — but today, they’re being let down. After weeks of waiting, SullCrom’s black bonus box has been smashed open, and the firm is matching market bonuses.

Based on the deluge of tips we received, it looks like S&C has done exactly what the rest of the Biglaw market has done, matching the bonus scale set by Cravath last month. Needless to say, associates at the firm are a bit miffed. This seems to be representative of the comments we’ve received from associates at the firm:

They are not paying out until December 31, as opposed to December 21. Everyone is a little pissed that the firm jerked everyone around for 4-5 weeks and then simply matched AND is paying after Xmas. People are wondering why they aren’t paying on the schedule that they have in the past.

No extra bonus cash for the upcoming holiday? This doesn’t seem like the SullCrom we all know and love. What’s going on over there?

If you still have something to say about your S&C bonus, feel free to sound off [by email](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus), by text message (646-820-8477), or by tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). All complaints (or praise) will be kept anonymous — and could find its way into an update to this story.

Remember: as soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus)(subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”). We always keep our sources on bonus stories anonymous. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. You can also text us if you prefer, at 646-820-8477.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts, please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish. Thanks!

Do you like money? Of course you do, you’ve got student loans to pay off. Do you like prestige? Obviously, you’re a Type A law student. If you’re like the majority of your colleagues and you’d like to embark upon upon a career path that’ll pad your wallet and get you in on the ground floor at a prestigious firm, then you’ll probably want to compete for a job at a large firm.

[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2019/05/08/law-grads-hiring-report-job-stats-for-the-class-of-2018/) produced several helpful charts based on law school employment data for the class of 2018. Today, we will take a look at one of the more interesting charts, the law schools that sent the highest percentage of their most recent graduating class into large firms with 100 or more lawyers. On this list, you’ll find a dazzling array of law schools from the T14, but we’re not here to tell you what you already know — that graduates of top law schools get top jobs. That being said, we’re going to dive a little deeper into the list and highlight the schools you may not realize are some of the top large-firm contenders. Here they are for your viewing pleasure:

In our continuing effort to dive ever deeper into the various[ nooks and crannies](https://www.factsnfiguresinc.com/post/do-you-know-how-thomas-the-english-muffins-slogan-nooks-crannies-came-to-life) of legal tech, we’ve taken up list creation by category.  

This approach allows us to explore the topics lurking deep in the dark recesses of this world — you know,[ the sort you don’t talk about at parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FnO3igOkOk).

To introduce the Above the Law “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” today I’m sharing “The 10 People You Will Meet at a Legal Tech Trade Show.” 

Stay tuned for our tour of all aspects of the legal tech world in the coming months.  

1. The Glutton 

Like most business conferences, legal tech conferences feature lots of free food. I have definitely seen a woman shove an entire plate of food into her purse at a conference, and then there was the dude who dropped a bunch of bacon-wrapped scallops into his pockets. Look, some people come to these shows just for the food. 

2. The Swag Gobbler

What’s better than free food? Swag! There is all manner of swag available at legal tech conferences, and it’s all there for the taking. Open up them purses, because this is better than grabbing 50 small hotel shampoo bottles before you head out to board your Delta flight. Let me tell you: I’ve never smelled fresher than when I’ve applied my official Above the Law underarm deodorant. Never.

3. The Noob

There are always people at legal tech conferences who’ve never been to legal tech conferences and whose expectations are wholly unaffiliated with reality. Oh, you thought this was going to be like[ SXSW](https://www.sxsw.com/), but for legal? Nope, we’re still trying to wean people off of WordPerfect. So, sidle up to an empty hotel chair, grab some passed hors d’oeuvres, and think about what you’ve done. Maybe next year, you’ll just get to[ Burning Man](https://burningman.org/) instead.

4. The Nuzzler

As the COVID pandemic continues to recede into the rearview mirror of daily life, people are getting closer. Like, literally. Remember[ the “close talker”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRZ5RpsytRA) ([Judge Reinhold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS7bpVsNQ9M)) from “[Seinfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld)” — there are lots of folks at legal tech conferences who are going to be replicating that model of speech. Nuzzlers are also known to hug — even if you don’t like to be touched. The best remedy: Never leave your hotel room. You’ve got cable there, providing light and warmth, without any of the physical intimacy.  

5. The Luggage Luggers

It’s not always possible to align your checkout time with the time in which you should be heading to the airport to catch your flight. Now, you’ve got to drag all your luggage around[ Branson](https://www.branson.com/) for the rest of the afternoon. You can check it with the bell desk for several hours, but you still gotta go pick it back up later. So, maybe you just get another seat at lunch for your American Tourister, you[ American Tourister](https://shop.americantourister.com/), you. 

6. The Expert

You know, it’s bonkers — you wouldn’t think some dude running a solo practice off of spreadsheets would know everything there is to know about legal technology. And, yet, here we are. He told me he’s using “ChatTPG” to write all his legal briefs for him now. My dude — how are you not speaking at this event???

7. The Pitchman

Everybody’s got something to sell. I get it. But, do you have to sell it to me, like right now — while I’m trying to pee, here at this low-flow urinal. But, yeah: I would love to hear more about how your product — which is oddly similar to about 17 other softwares I’ve been pitched today — is really the one that’s gonna revolutionize law practice. 

8. The ‘Positive Vibes’ Apostle

Good vibes, only. Right? Well, you know: It’s true that not every aspect of every conference is great. Some of the after parties are lame — just like some of the during-parties are lame. Some of the speakers are boring, and some of the presenters are redundant. Sometimes, your hotel room floods (not that that’s ever happened to me). Sometimes somebody brings a pangolin, and it gets loose during the keynote address … things happen. But, the positive vibes apostle is always chill. BTW — this person will write almost all of the conference recaps you’ll ever read.

9. The Ghoster

Quick, you’re at a lame conference event — what do you do? You just ghost. And, let me tell you: It’s the most freeing thing you can do. Just bounce; don’t even look back. Before you know it, you’ll be back in your hotel watching “[History’s Mysteries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229946/characters/nm0000559)” (not that I have any experience in doing this).  

10. The Reply Guy

Everybody’s gotta post social media proof of conference attendance. Hey, bro — check out our booth, which looks suspiciously like every single other booth at this show! (Wow.) We’re not talking about inspiring social media content here — I mean, no one is[ ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ2ifmkGGus)literally curing blindness. So, why is this dude all up in my mentions? Commenting, hashtagging, sharing. Yeah, I want engagement, but not like this. Not … like … this.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# It's April And This Firm Is Showering Associates With Cash
## Get out the umbrellas, because this firm is making it rain.

It’s been more than a month since [Cravath entered the scene](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) to announce a bigger and better salary scale, and one by one by one by one, Biglaw and boutique firms alike have adopted the generous compensation package for their own associates.

The latest to do so is [Seward & Kissel,](https://www.sewkis.com/) a firm that’s existed for more than 130 years. Management informed associates this past Thursday that they would be receiving raises on the Cravath scale — and based on the tips we’ve received, they seem to be pretty excited about it. Here’s the firm’s new salary scale:

Class of 2021: $215,000
Class of 2020: $225,000
Class of 2019: $250,000
Class of 2018: $295,000
Class of 2017: $345,000
Class of 2016: $370,000
Class of 2015: $400,000
Class of 2014+: $415,000

The new salaries took effect on April 1, and there was no foolin’ about it. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to read the full memo from Seward & Kissel.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we’ll also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

According to a [ 2022 ATL survey](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/what-do-associates-think-of-the-new-normal/), just 28% of associates expect to remain at their current firms to become partners, while 10% would stay even if partnership weren’t an option. More than 40% plan to leave their firms within the next couple of years.

Is firm “loyalty” a meaningful concept for young attorneys? As the path to partnership seems less fixed than ever, how do millennial lawyers envision their future?

Last week, we launched a series of surveys in partnership with Major, Lindsey & Africa to gauge the impact of the millennial generation on law firm culture. The first installment addressed lawyers’ priorities.

With [ this second installment](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8GHW7taR6ULBLb8), we want to know about your goals.

Please take a few minutes to [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8GHW7taR6ULBLb8). As always, the survey is anonymous. (And please note that we are not only interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take the survey!)

# Another Round Of Raises For Hardworking Associates
## Yay money!

One raise is good news, but two is even better! When[ Cravath came over the top](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/cravath-raises-22/) of the Davis Polk scale — after several firms had matched those numbers — we knew the elite of Biglaw would have to react.

Akin Gump is the latest firm to [re-raise salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/akin-raises-22/). Of course the firm, with its $1,208,738,000 in gross revenue and fancy 33rd Am Law ranking, would have to match the new salary scale sweeping Biglaw.

That means some pretty big salary numbers for Akin associates, as per the salary grid below:

Class Year	2022 Salary
2021	$        215,000
2020	$        225,000
2019	$        250,000
2018	$        295,000
2017	$        345,000
2016	$        370,000
2015	$        400,000
2014+	$        415,000
The increases are retroactive to January 1 and will hit associates’ bank accounts with their March 31 paycheck.

You can read the [full memo on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/03/akin-re-raises-22/2/)

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](http://www.laterallink.com) team of expert contributors. [Wendy Boone Jaikaran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendy-boone-jaikaran-467942a/) is the Managing Director of Associate Recruiting in Texas where she focuses on associate, counsel, and partner placements in the Texas market with leading AmLaw firms and high-end boutiques. Prior to joining the company, Wendy was a Senior Partner with a national recruiting firm. Wendy started her career as an IP litigation associate at a well-respected IP boutique in Houston. She received her J.D. from Thurgood Marshall School of Law and her B.S. in advertising from The University of Texas at Austin.

Texas has some stereotypes attached to it, but it’s not all steak, big hair, and cowboy boots. Texas has four major, bustling, and diverse big city centers, is home to many Am Law 100s and Fortune 100s, and has a booming technology hub in Austin. Texas has great associate talent, but the number of associates in Texas has not kept up with the recent growth, which is why we see attorneys flocking here from both coasts. If that’s not enough to wet your whistle for Texas, here are five solid reasons to consider Texas.

1. Flurry of New Office Openings
Texas has attracted unprecedented growth in the form of Am Law ranked firms planting flags. Over the last five years, over 40 Am Law 200 firms have opened offices in Dallas, Austin, or Houston. Some of the newest firms to the Texas market include Womble Bond Dickinson, White & Case, Kirkland & Ellis, and Shearman & Sterling (to name a few).

2. Top Compensation and NO State Income Taxes
In an effort to compete with talent on the east and west coasts, most national and international firms in Texas pay “Cravath” salaries (or very close to it). Since the cost of living in Texas is extremely low, you’ll get more bang for your buck. Imagine it with me: muuuuuccch lower mortgage/rent, lower childcare costs, lower energy and food staples, and NO STATE INCOME TAXES. You can funnel all the extra money to paying off your student loans or buying a yacht. It’s your life!

3. Thriving Market
Have I mentioned the Texas legal market is super busy? Dozens of companies have relocated their headquarters to Texas during the past couple years which means more sophisticated legal work for attorneys here. In 2018, firms made approximately 560 associate hires. Firms that did the most hiring included Kirkland & Ellis, DLA Piper, and Vinson & Elkins. The busiest practice areas should come to no surprise — corporate/mergers and acquisitions, finance, and energy.

4. Abundance of Affordable Real Estate
Your family can live in a GIGANTIC house or a cool spacious loft in Midtown. You can have a lawn, maybe a dog, perhaps a llama or two. You can have a king-size bed in your guest room. Dream big!

5. People and Community
Texans are amazing. Well, most of them. Several counties in Texas (around major cities) are some of the most diverse in the country. Texas is full of world-class museums, theatres, art, and festivals. We have AMAZING food from every corner of the world. There are wineries, breweries, state parks, deserts, mountains, hills, oceans. It’s all here!

In summary, the Texas legal market is flourishing, with available positions for associates of all practices and seniority levels. Law firms are very open and HAPPY to relocate candidates.

Corporate law departments underwent a period of rapid change during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

This ongoing crisis looms large, even as the world progresses into a new, post-pandemic era.

As corporations’ responses continue to evolve, there is appetite and readiness for even greater transformation.

The most successful law departments will be those that leverage the momentum of the pandemic era to actively embrace transformative change.

In this report, our friends at Thomson Reuters focus on two key priorities: safeguarding the business and conducting operations as efficiently as possible.

Download it for insights that will help you:

- Benchmark legal spend and team size against the latest peer data
- Optimize systems and processes to drive greater efficiency by learning from others
- Innovate for the future by understanding how other law departments are implementing transformational change

[Steptoe & Johnson LLP](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/another-biglaw-firm-gets-hit-with-a-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/), [Chadbourne & Parke](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/biglaw-firm-hit-with-100-million-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/?rf=1), [Proskauer Rose](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/inside-the-50-million-gender-discrimination-case-a-partner-filed-against-proskauer-rose/), [LeClairRyan](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/biglaw-partner-alleges-sexism-derailed-her-career-in-a-new-lawsuit/?rf=1), [Sedgwick](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/biglaw-partner-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-male-dominated-culture/) and now Winston & Strawn. All Biglaw firms that have be accused by former attorneys of gender discrimination.

The most recent case was brought by[ Constance Ramos](https://akira-ip.com/background-%26-experience) against her former firm and filed last month in San Francisco County Superior Court. As [reported by](http://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2017/09/25/big-laws-latest-gender-bias-plaintiff-is-a-former-obama-classmate/) Law.com, the complaint alleges Ramos was never treated as a lawyer and partner in her own right, but as “an appendage of a male superior” that the firm sought to be rid of when the equity partners that Ramos joined the firm with ultimately left Winston.

Ramos joined Winston as part of a group of lateral IP partners that moved from Hogan Lovells, but she alleges when the other two partners she lateraled with — Korula “Sunny” Cherian and R. Scott Wales, who joined as equity partners while Ramos was an “income partner” — left the firm, she was robbed of opportunities to develop her business, had her salary slashed,  bonuses denied, and was ultimately forced out:

“I did not expect that a law partnership with Winston’s reputation would engage in discriminatory practices … I am especially devastated by the increasingly hostile work environment that this firm created in its bias against me, namely, the notion that my capabilities and worthiness as a lawyer depend solely upon whether certain male equity partners remain at Winston,” Ramos wrote in an excerpt from the letter included in her complaint. “When I came to Winston, I expected to be evaluated on my own merits, assessed by my own accomplishments, and treated as an individual, not as an appendage of a male superior.”

The complaint indicates she was directed to stop working on client matters in January 2015, and asked to find new employment. Additionally, despite billing 2,250 hours on the primarily piece of litigation she arrived at the firm with, she did not receive any bonus. Instead of finding a new job, Ramos claims she hoped to maintain her career at Winston:

During the next month, Ramos engaged in a variety of conversations—via email, interoffice mail, letters and the phone—with [Thomas Fitzgerald, chairman of Winston & Strawn’s executive committee] in which she stated that she was committed to building a career at Winston & Strawn and had no desire to leave the firm. Ramos’ complaint accuses Fitzgerald of belittling her and threatening to reduce her annual compensation if she “refused to obey his demand and withdraw from the firm.”

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
According to her complaint, Ramos repeatedly got the runaround on which matrices her compensation would be based on. She alleges that despite being told that income partners would be primarily paid on hours worked and despite exceeding the billable hour threshold threshold at which bonuses usually attach, in April 2016 her compensation actually declined 33 percent from $450,000 to $300,000.

At this point, Ramos maintains she redoubled her efforts to be integrated as a member of the firm, all to no avail:

But Ramos alleges that was left out of pitch meetings and excluded from other cases in favor of less qualified male lawyers, according to her complaint, which notes that on one matter where Ramos was allowed to participate, she was denied an origination credit in favor of a male colleague. Efforts to expand her practice into transactional work met similar internal business development obstacles.

In April 2017 Ramos again saw her compensation slashed, this time to $200,000. A few months later, she determined she could no longer continue to work at the firm. She filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and received a “right to sue” letter. She filed the complaint August 30th.

We know Ramos isn’t the first woman partner to take on Biglaw alleging gender discrimination. Smart money says she won’t be the last.

# Biglaw Firm Gets Sad News It Won't Be Raising Associate Compensation
## Check out the update to the story for more details on the firm's plans.

The wave of raises and special summer bonuses sweeping through Biglaw this summer only started last month. That means even though lots of associates have already received their money, hope springs eternal in the hearts of associates at other firms that they too will be seeing a big payday in their future.

That hope is especially poignant for associates at [firms that matched the market rate in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/salary-wars-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-raises/?rf=1), the last time raises came to Biglaw. Let’s not forget, though the raises may sound like big, splashy numbers, they [really work out to little more than a cost-of-living adjustment.](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/) So, if a firm that raised salaries in 2016 suddenly doesn’t have the cash flow to issue raises in 2018… well, that signals they probably jumped the gun on making the 2016 raises.

In any event, associates at McKool Smith (which did [raise salaries in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/a-member-of-the-160k-plus-club-raises-associate-salaries-nationwide/)) had their hopes for market-base compensation dashed yesterday. The firm delivered the news in an associate meeting — no raises and no summer bonuses will be forthcoming. Though they did hold out hope that high billers may receive merit-based “catch-up” payments at end of year.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
And the reaction from sources at the firm is disappointed, but not shocked:

This is the sort of cheap thing that the firm would do given that they require approximately 2200 hours to get market bonuses….

UPDATE: We spoke with a firm source who clarified that first year associates WILL be receiving market base salaries of $190,000. Additionally, the firm says they don’t have a hard hours requirement in order to get market bonuses, rather it’s based on an overall performance review. The source was also able to confirm that all associates in good standing at the end of the year will receive the catch-up payments to put their salary at market rates.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Ed. note: This is the latest installment in a series of posts from [Lateral Link’s](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) team of expert contributors. [Cordell Parvin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellparvin/) is a Senior Director with [Lateral Link](https://www.mainspringlegal.com/laterallink/) based in the Dallas, Texas office. Prior to coaching and recruiting lawyers, Cordell built a national construction law practice at an Am Law 100 law firm. Cordell is a well-known speaker, writer and blogger on career development and client development. He has made presentations to law firms and bar associations throughout the US and Canada. Cordell has published four books on career and client development. You can subscribe to his blog at [http://www.cordellblog.com/](http://www.cordellblog.com/), connect with him on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellparvin), join his [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cordell-Parvin-Lawyer-Coaching/222291473905?ref=ts), and follow him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cordellparvin).

I have spent a lifetime studying why some people are very successful and why others are not. Interestingly, many of the people who are truly successful also have a great personal life and are very family oriented.  How can this be so?  Put simply they understand their priorities and use their time wisely.

I am coaching two junior partners. They are both women. They are both in about the same size firms. They both bill about the same number of hours. Christy, who has two children is incredibly successful and will become even more successful. Samantha is incredibly bright. She is a graduate of an Ivy League school. Yet, she feels overwhelmed and like she is burning out. What are these two people doing differently and how can you apply it to make 2019 your best year ever?

Attitude

It begins with attitude. We all talk to ourselves and we sometimes convey our attitude about things when we talk to others. When I meet with young lawyers I am listening to what they say to learn what they are likely saying to themselves. To borrow a quote from Winston Churchill, less successful lawyers see the problem in every opportunity and successful lawyers see the opportunity in every problem.

- Less successful lawyers frequently say: “Yes, but.” Successful lawyers say: “Sure how.”
- Less successful lawyers say: “My problem is.” More successful lawyers say: “My opportunity is.”
- Less successful lawyers say: “I need to…” More successful lawyers say: “I want to…”
- Less successful lawyers say: “I am not willing to be successful if it means…” More successful lawyers say: “I can be successful and….”
- Less successful lawyers say: “I will try my best to….” More successful lawyers say: “I will achieve…”
- Less successful lawyers find something wrong with any new idea. More successful lawyers figure out how they can use the new idea.
So, the first step to making 2019 your best year ever is to listen to your self talk and if necessary consciously make a change in what you are telling yourself.

Clear Idea of What You Want

Second, successful lawyers like Christy have a very clear idea of what they want to accomplish. They know where they want to be five years from now, maybe even 20 years from now. Having clarity on what you want to accomplish with your career actually enables you to have more time for your family. How do you suppose that happens? Put simply, lawyers with clarity on what they want to do with their career do not waste lots of time. Lawyers without clarity do waste time and frequently are spinning their wheels and frustrated by it. Clarity about what you want also gives you energy.

In my case, in 1978, I decided I wanted to be the best transportation construction lawyer in the United States. In Christy’s case, she wants to become the best long care attorney in the United States. She also has a very clear idea of what she wants to do in her personal life. One way to gain clarity on what you want is to write down what you are doing and what your life is like in five years from now.

Setting Goals

Really successful people set goals and have a plan to achieve them. Years ago, I was giving a presentation at my firm’s orientation for new partners. I was teaching them how to prepare a Business Plan. I asked how many had set goals for that year. Not one of them had set goals. It caused me to wonder why young lawyers do not set goals. Here are four reasons:

- They don’t see the value in it
- They don’t know how
- They are afraid of being criticized by someone
- They are afraid of not achieving them.
There is a quote I like. It is: Most people aim at nothing and hit it with amazing accuracy.

There are scientific studies showing that people who have written goals achieve far more than those who do not and they are happier with their careers and life. Why is that? I think it is in part because they feel they have more control of their destiny. They also are going after something. Some of you have already set goals for 2019. For those of you who have not, let me show you how to set goals you will actually achieve.

Over the next two minutes list 10 things you want to achieve in 2019. Leave some space in between each item. They should be specific and measurable, so you will know if you achieved them. They might be:

- Bill ____ hours
- Originate $____
- Obtain ____ new clients
- Expand existing business with ______
- Speak at ____ industry meetings
- Write ______ articles and get them published
- Contact_____ law school classmates
- Meet with ____ contacts
- Add_____ to my web page bio
Here are some goals I had in 1999:

- Originate $3 Million in business
- Bill 1800 hours
- Speak at 6 construction industry meetings
- Visit 8 construction clients
- Write the second edition of my Transportation Construction Claims Book
- Conduct 4 in-house client workshops
- Conduct 3 workshops on Innovative Contracting
- Have a client roundtable meeting in Dallas
Now that you have written down 10 goals, go back through and prioritize them. In other words, decide which is the most important and so forth. Next, I want you to answer why achieving each goal is important to you. Here is the reason to do that. If you do not have a good answer to the why question, then your goal will be like a New Years resolution that you give up on achieving the first time there is a roadblock You have to have a good answer to the why question to motivate you, energize you and cause you to have the discipline and commitment to achieve the goal.

Now that you have answered the why question, write down any obstacles you have to achieving the goal. The obstacles can be internal or external. In my experience most of them are internal. In other words, I have to do something different than I have been doing. My greatest obstacle was usually staying focused and not wasting time.

Now that you have identified obstacles, identify any people who can help you achieve your goal. Here is an interesting thing to consider. When you are not taking responsibility for your career success, no one wants to help you. But, when you are taking responsibility for your success, you will find people who do want to help you, both inside and outside your firm.

Now, I want you to write down as many actions as you can think of to achieve your goal.

Using one of my goals as an example, For my goal of conducting 4 in-house workshops I needed to:

- Determine which clients
- Identify a topic that would give them value
- Prepare written materials
- Prepare presentation materials
- Establish dates and locations (at client’s facility or elsewhere)
- Conduct the workshops
Okay, so make your list of activities you will do to achieve your goal.

Now, that you have your list, I want you to write down for each goal something you can do in the next week to get started. We need for the train to get out of the station.

Let’s stop there for a minute. I urge you to write down your goals and develop a plan of activities to achieve them, If you do, I can tell you from first-hand experience, you will more likely achieve them. So, you have made the first step to achieving your own definition of success.

Getting Better

Really successful people are constantly getting better. Tiger Woods was, and maybe is again, a great example.

Several years ago, he was interviewed by Ed Bradley on 60 Minutes. Ed Bradley asked Tiger Woods why he had completely changed his golf swing when he was the number one golfer in the world. Tiger Woods answered: “I knew I could get better.”  There is a commonly heard phrase that if you are not getting better, you are actually getting worse.

That has never been more true for lawyers than it is today because there are so many changes going on in our profession. In my top 10 tips I suggest that you take one area of your practice to focus on getting better. It might be communication skills, drafting skills, a particular legal topic. When I pick that one area I find every book I can on the topic, read articles, attend CLEs, listen to CDs and actually practice what I am trying to learn.

So, what do want to do in 2019 to improve your skill? What is the one area that you want to focus on?

Reading Books/Articles on Success, Client Development

In addition to improving my skills as a lawyer, I have always been an avid reader of books I thought would improve my skills on client development, help me use my time more effectively, leadership, teamwork and a variety of other topics. At my old firm, we had a group who would read the same book and we had people assigned to discuss chapters and give practical examples of how what was in the chapter could be applied.

I learned long ago a way to read business books. I first skim the book. In that process I decide what is important that I want to go back and read in detail.

Use Your Time More Effectively

Time is our most valuable resource and we cannot afford to waste it. If you have a clear idea of what you want in your career, have goals and have decided what you want to learn in 2019, you are well on your way to not wasting time because you can see whether a potential activity advances you towards your goals or not.

Look at the circle in your handout materials. It has 168 in the middle. That represents the number of hours in a week. I want you to make a rough sketch pie chart. The first piece of the pie is how many hours you sleep. If you sleep 8 hours a night, that would be 56. I sleep less than that and you may as well. The next piece of the pie is the number of hours you work a week that are billable. You might record 40 billable hours a week. If so fill in that number. If it takes you longer because you have to write off time, then put down the higher number. The next piece of the pie is your non-billable time you are using to invest in your career. This could be firm administrative activities, time you plan to spend for your development, time you plan to spend for client development.

When I was a young lawyer, I tried to spend at least 10 hours a week investing in my career. So, I would have 10 on my pie chart. If I slept 56 hours a week, billed 40 hours a week, spent 10 hours a week on my career, that would leave 62 waking hours for my personal life including being a good father, husband and son, exercising, being involved in my church and community and any other personal activity. I like to tell lawyers that how well they plan and execute the 10 hours a week they invest in their career will determine the quality of their career and how well they plan and execute the 62 waking hours of personal time will determine the quality of their life.

Stephen Covey suggests that we have four quadrants of activities:

- Urgent and Important
- Not Urgent, but Important
- Urgent, but not Important
- Not Urgent and Not Important
The real key for a successful career and for a fulfilling life is to focus on the quadrant 2 activities.

Christy is doing that. She plans based on her priorities and she plans her personal time, and her career investment time the same way she plans her billable time.

Let’s look at her calendar for December.

Keep in mind that you have to make choices both in your non-billable investment activities and in your personal time.

Pareto’s Principle-The 80/20 Rule

I coached many outstanding young partners and associates. Some worked to a frazzle on client development activities and did not determine what were the important activities.

‘Focus, focus, focus” and take my word that “less can be more.”

In the early 1900s a gentleman by the name of Pareto did a study in Italy and found that 20 percent of the people owned 80 percent of the wealth. That led to many others finding the same principle applied to their own field. There are a variety of ways this might apply to us. It might be that 20 percent of our clients produce 80 percent of our fees. It might be that 20 percent of our time spent on client development might produce 80 percent of our business. The point is simple

Face Time

Don’t let email, text, and social media replace face time. Get out from behind your desk and go visit your clients and referral sources.

Why Should I Hire You

I want you to pretend for the moment that I can refer business to you. I want you to provide me with the information I need to recommend you to a potential client. In 25 words or less tell me about you, your practice, what makes you unique, and why a client should hire you.

How to Stand Out in Any Crowd

When I practiced law, I subscribed to a magazine “Selling Power.” As you would expect, it is for salesmen and sales managers. Yet, in each and every issue, I found something of value to lawyers.

In an issue I read years ago, the cover story was “How to Stand Out in Any Crowd.” Seth Godin talks about marketing, change and work. I was fascinated by the article and plan to apply some of Godin’s points myself.

According to the article Seth Godin likes to give things away and has built his career on it. I have long advocated that lawyers find things of value to give away. Whenever I write an article, I am anxious to give it away.

When Godin wrote his first book, he offered a third of its contents online at no charge. He got 175,000 responses requesting the free third of the book. Most of the 175,000 who received the free third of the book clicked the link built into the page and bought it, making it a year long best seller. Guess what I am planning to do with the three books I have written.

Later in the article, Godin talks about three kinds of people. I will put it in the context of clients:

- Clients who don’t need the services you or your firm offer.
- Clients who need the services you or your firm offer, but are using another lawyer or firm.
- Clients who are ignoring you.
Godin says you can’t market directly to the second and third group. “Instead, have them come to you.” How do you suppose you can get them to come to you? Godin suggests you have to create something “remarkable.”

I like to tell young lawyers that I owe a great deal of my success to one sales principle. I frequently created something remarkable, was first to market and I gave it away. For example, I have two books on my law firm web page that potential clients can download at no charge.

I urge you to implement some of the ideas and let me know what you are doing to make 2019 your best year ever.

He’s entitled to his day in court. I think the level of attention the case has garnered, for him, in some ways has been unfair. And I look forward to adjudicating the manner in a courtroom.

— [Matthew Adams](http://www.foxrothschild.com/matthew-s-adams/), co-chair of Fox Rothschild’s white-collar compliance and defense practice, offering comments on his client [Thomas Tramaglini](https://heavy.com/news/2018/05/thomas-tramaglini/), whose case has received national attention. Tramaglini, a New Jersey high-school superintendent whose alleged conduct earned him the nickname “Mystery Pooper,” is accused of [repeatedly defecating](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2018/05/18/fox-rothschild-practice-leader-steps-up-to-defend-alleged-defecator/) on the school’s football field. After surveillance was set up due to his alleged daily dumps, local sources claim that Tramaglini was “caught in the act.”

How does one achieve nirvana in one’s job as a lawyer? It is incredibly easy – and at the same time kind of hard for most people – to do this. In a nutshell, it is as follows:

Make your job your hobby.

That is all there is to it.

I guess I could end this article here – but I will go a little further into this and explain what I mean.

There is an old saying that “if you love what you do, you never have to work a day in your life.”

Let me give an example. Have you ever gone to a pizza parlor where the guy is making pizza? It sounds dull to tears, doesn’t it? Making dough, rolling it up, and stuffing it with some sauce into a hot oven. And doing the same thing day after day after day…..

But then you see the guy rolling it around – throwing it in the air – twirling it around – bowing to the audience – with the little kids staring up in awe and cheering and clapping – and you see that this guy is “in a zone.” He is loving every minute of it. And you yourself – a grownup – if you look at your face you are, to your surprise, smiling. Nay, you are grinning. You are loving every minute of it too. Not only how good he is at throwing the pizza up in the air, but how much fun the little kiddies are having watching it. Perhaps this is all because you are being brought back to the fun and innocence of when you were a kid yourself and so easily amused.

All of this – all of it – is because the pizza guy loves his job and is taking something that many of us would look at as a chore, and turning it into something that is fun for him and those around him. He is having a ball. And you know, the more he does it, the more tricks he adds to his repertoire, the cooler it gets, the more positive it is, and the more it feeds on itself. Maybe one of the other guys joins in and gets pizza dough slapped in his face. Maybe it is a comedy routine after a while. Maybe it is even, dare I say, a show. Maybe people line up every day at 5:00 to watch them do their thing.

There is a concept in the Tao called “wu wei,” which is the cultivation of a mental state in which our actions are quite effortlessly in alignment with the flow of life. There are a lot of definitions of this that I have trouble translating, and they include:

- Effortless doing
- Action without action
- The Tao of letting go…..
I am not 100% sure what is the right definition, but for me it is a kind of thrilling feeling that I get when I am doing my job – doing what I do best – and it just feels right – it just flows – it is truly effortless.

I am sure that if you are reading this article, you have experienced the incredible thrill of wu wei. Perhaps intellectually – perhaps in sports – perhaps in something else. It is an utterly awesome feeling.

If you get to this in practicing law, you have achieved lawyer nirvana.

How do you do it? It is pretty easy actually, but it absolutely requires the correct mental state to allow it to happen. You just fall in love with what you do. Remember the first day you took up violin? I’ll bet that was a pretty awful day. But if you decided you wanted to play a beautiful etude more than anything else in the world, then it started out hard – and maybe even terribly awful – but then one day, after years of hard work consisting of breakthroughs and breakdowns, there you are with your violin and the two of you are in love with each other. And you don’t have to even try to play it any more – it is just pure enjoyment – it is wu wei.

You definitely can do this in practicing law. The first step is just to let yourself fall in love with what you do.

# One Set Of Raises Isn't Enough At This Biglaw Firm
## The West Coast firm has come to play.

Big money is spreading like wild fire in Biglaw. And firms are excited to demonstrate their willingness to pay the top of the market.

The latest firm to announce raises — their second round of them — is Irell & Manella. The firm made $132,903,000 in gross revenue in 2020 making it 183rd in the Am Law 200, and is happy to share with the associates who made it all possible.

Of course, Irell[ previously announced ](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/west-coast-biglaw-firm-joins-milbank-scale/)raises, back when the Milbank scale was the top of the market. This week, Davis Polk increased that scale for midlevel and senior associates. And Irell will not be left behind! Today, the West Coast mainstay announced they too will be matching this new-and-improved compensation scale.

That means associates at the firm will be paid on the following grid:

Class	Base Compensation
1st year	$215,000
2nd year	$225,000
3rd year	$250,000
4th year	$293,500
5th year	$335,000
6th year	$360,500
7th year	$381,000
8th year	$396,500
You can read the full memo [on the next page.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/irell-re-raises-22/2/)

C. Allen Parker (via Cravath, Swaine & Moore)

Where does one go after serving as presiding partner of [Cravath, Swaine & Moore?](https://abovethelaw.com/law-firms/cravath/) If Biglaw managing partners form the College of Cardinals, then Cravath’s presiding partner is the Pope — so moving to a rival firm would be heresy. One could return to the ranks of the Cravath partnership — as [Evan Chesler](https://www.cravath.com/echesler/) did, for example — but that might be anticlimactic.

So while surprising, it was not shocking to learn yesterday about [C. Allen Parker’s](https://www.cravath.com/aparker/) new job. From the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-names-cravath-partner-as-new-top-lawyer-1488827101):

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
Wells Fargo & Co. named a new top lawyer Monday, ending a monthslong search for a new general counsel who will be tasked with helping the bank recover from its recent sales practices scandal.

Allen Parker, the recent former head of white-shoe law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP, is slated to begin his new role March 27, succeeding James Strother who the bank said will retire after 30 years at Wells Fargo.

Mr. Parker, 62 and a current Cravath partner, will be based out of the bank’s headquarters in San Francisco and become a member of its operating committee. He’ll join Wells Fargo at one of its most difficult points as it continues to remain in the spotlight after paying a $185 million fine in September over opening accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information.

Parker enjoyed an incredibly successful turn at Cravath’s presiding partner. Under his watch, the firm experienced [record M&A volume](https://www.cravath.com/cravath-recognized-for-its-lead-in-2015-ma-yearend-league-tables-01-07-2016/), sky-high partner profits, a [return to the #1 spot](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/move-over-wachtell-theres-a-new-firm-at-the-top-vault-top-100-firms-2017/) in the Vault 100 rankings, progress in [diversifying its partnership](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/cravath-names-new-partners-and-all-three-are-women/), and — last but definitely not least — the celebrated [associate pay raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/). So why take on the task of cleaning up the stables befouled by those [Wells Fargo stagecoach](https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/stagecoach/) horses? Note that the bank has been [trying to fill this job](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-on-the-hunt-for-its-next-legal-leader-1469629460) for months.

The dire straits that Wells Fargo finds itself in, due to the scandal over the [millions of phony accounts](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/09/5300-fired-for-creating-millions-of-phony-accounts-um-where-was-compliance/), make Parker’s decision to take the job perfectly logical. Why? It’s a no-lose situation: if he can right the WF ship, then he’ll be hailed as a hero; but if he can’t, he can blame it on the sheer scale of the mess he inherited.

And hiring Parker is a coup for Wells Fargo as well. As CEO Tim Sloan put it, “Allen is well known throughout the legal and financial services industries not only for advising some of the world’s largest companies on their most complex legal matters, but also for his strong character, integrity, and high ethical standards.” A reputation for integrity and ethics is, of course, just what the doctor has ordered for Wells Fargo.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

But there are other reasons Parker is a great pick as well. Having overseen a firm of 1,200 employees, he’s an experienced and talented manager — and a big part of running a legal department with 965 people is about management skills rather than substantive legal knowledge. At the same time, as a banking lawyer by training, Parker has the legal chops as well. As noted by his [successor as presiding partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/07/cravath-elects-its-next-presiding-partner-ma-star-faiza-saeed/), Faiza Saeed, Parker happens to be “one of the most respected banking lawyers in the United States.”

So congratulations to Allen Parker on his new job, and congratulations to Wells Fargo on its new GC. If anyone can steer the giant bank out of its giant legal crisis, Parker can.

P.S. In other (and very sad) Cravath news, our condolences [once again](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/non-sequiturs-02-28-17/) to the friends, family, and former colleagues of Andrew R. Thompson, the CSM partner who [passed away](https://www.cravath.com/In-memory-of-Andrew-R-Thompson-02-28-2017/) on February 25.

# Biglaw Salary Reports Aren't A Celebration Of Greed -- It's Kind Of The Opposite
## The money's got to go somewhere.

Whenever we enter a raise cycle or bonus season, we get at least one concerned reader bemoaning that Above the Law’s core editorial staff takes a partial hiatus from unraveling law school gossip and clowning on lawyer meltdowns to report on the furious stream of associate compensation news. A stream that got so hot this year that [the new payscale](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/milbank-raises-21/) didn’t even last 24 hours [before getting topped](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/)!

Then compensation/bonus season arrives. I suddenly remember why most people fucking hate lawyers. I’ll see you guys again sometime in late August, when your site isn’t a gross celebration of greed.

Thankfully, this reader is coming at it recognizing that it’s not a news development we can just ignore since the majority of the audience very much relies on these stories. But it’s a valid concern and one that hits a lot of our readers — in particular the counsel and staff that rarely get corresponding raises — harder than others.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)

However, [emptying the stock image library of money pictures](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/the-23-sexiest-stock-images-of-money/6/) aside, are we contributing to a culture of greed when we celebrate salary hikes? I don’t think so, and in fact I think it’s the opposite.

Obviously a $205K starting salary is nothing to take for granted. It’s a big haul and immediately places an associate in the upper classes of American society. That said, what are firms really paying first-years? When all is said and done, attending law school puts students back upwards of $350K depending on the financial package, and that’s before considering the costs of just not working for three years. Then they begin jobs working 2200+ hours/year — and that’s working, not billing because even lower-end billing probably lands a lawyer in the office for 2200 or so — taking home something like $80-$90/hour. That’s not unheard of for a trained professional. Electricians or plumbers often bill out at more.

Which of course brings us to the fact that associates are billing out higher. The [Wall Street Journal reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/entry-level-lawyers-are-now-making-200-000-a-year-11623499201), “Large law firms charge clients between $371 and $665 an hour for lawyers straight out of law school, according to Bodhala, a market-intelligence firm.” That generally tracks what my in-house sources tell me too. We’re not so deliberately obtuse to think law firms can’t charge more than cost for legal services, but there’s a hefty delta when it comes to first-year work and that holds even after all the discounts and write-downs that everyone expects out of Biglaw.

Because even though we’re talking about decent-sized numbers, the alternative is for partners to just pocket somewhere between $300 and $500 per hour in profit. And we’re not begrudging partners for leading the teams that get the job done, but if there’s an argument that Biglaw business models run on greed, it feels as though letting partner profits grow ad infinitum on the back of increased leverage would be a better fit.

# Don’t Freak Out About The Bar Exam Or AI … Yet
## AI is something, but hysteria doesn’t help.

With the bar exam fast approaching, it’s time for my semi-annual admonishment. After it’s over or even before it’s completely over, do not, I repeat, do not discuss your answers with anyone, and I mean anyone, study partners especially. When you do that, it’s crazy-making. You fret, worry, obsess about the answers of others, whether they saw issues you didn’t or the reverse. You don’t know whether their answers are right and yours aren’t. It’s a huge wallow in self-doubt. You don’t need that.

Just walk away from any conversation, be it about the MBE, performance test, essays, whatever. If you must get up and leave, then do so politely, but do not torture yourself about the “shoulda, woulda, coulda” aspect of taking the bar exam. Trust me on this. I didn’t follow my own advice. I spent some time freaking out. Don’t make my mistake. Yes, you can thank me later.

As you study furiously for the bar exam, some people question whether they have made the right career decision by first going to law school and now sitting for a grueling exam that takes no prisoners. And if studying for the bar exam is not stressful enough, [one bar review provider has had problems with its website](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/themis-is-still-going-down-as-grads-enter-bar-exam-home-stretch/?utm_campaign=ATL%20Weekly&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=265713204&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-91ykjXC8WYWiouAHoQeCMuqS1DWpuzoAHTXMpgrdaaIWh0DZDPiAjUEhBLlDpFoJYLd6q3aZ6yMKlhrz97WpXv2M1KLw&utm_content=265713204&utm_source=hs_email). However, the old-style written materials are still available.

In dinosaur days, we didn’t have the internet (!) and so in studying for the bar exam, we had to attend bar review courses in person. (What a concept.) The written materials were precisely that, written. The bar review course I took all those years ago (now long gone) had excellent materials and a plethora of practice exams. No laptops, so we typed our practice essay answers on typewriters (remember them, dinosaurs?) or wrote them out by hand, mailed them (remember mail?), and waited for their return. Antiquated, yes, but it worked. I remember a con law practice exam that I wrote shortly before the bar exam and almost the precise question was on the exam. Yippee! That was an easy one to write.

This is not a bar exam question, but an existential one: whether the decision to go to law school was indeed the right decision. Fine time to raise that question right before the bar exam. It’s a brave new world that newbie lawyers will enter, facing cutbacks in lawyer staffing due to slowdowns in various practice areas, the rise of AI and ChatGPT, not to mention massive student debt loads. Is practicing law something that you want to do? For some people, going to law school after college has been a good way to delay making decisions about what you want to do with your life and how to do it. Long ago, postponing the inevitability of adult life seemed like a good idea at the time, but then there wasn’t any AI, except for HAL in the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.”

However, as Jonathan Wolf correctly points out, there are some things that AI will never be able to do, at least not in my lifetime. AI is exactly that, artificial (the term says so) intelligence, and so it won’t have the ability (again, at least in my lifetime) to make those connections that are an essential part of the attorney-client relationship. Sometimes, it’s just lending an ear, sometimes it’s comforting someone in distress, sometimes it’s advocating for someone who doesn’t have a voice, who doesn’t know which way to turn, sometimes it’s wresting the shovel from a client’s hand to prevent further digging of a metaphorical grave.

Yes, AI can draft documents; yes, it can draft pleadings; yes, it can research the law (maybe not, on second thought, given what’s happened recently to lawyers who relied to their detriment on AI; I doubt AI has any allowance to pay sanctions nor would it ever have to pony up). But the human, emotional component of practice is something that I don’t think it can ever replace. Until AI has emotional intelligence, [at least part of what we do remains intact](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/do-ai-large-language-models-like-chatgpt-make-law-school-less-worth-it-as-an-investment/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20Weekly%20Roundup:%20Legal%20Dive:%20Daily%20Dive%2007-08-2023&utm_term=Legal%20Dive%20Weekender).

What is existentially scary about AI? As the head of Google said in a recent interview, those most likely to be negatively impacted (a polite way of saying “sacked”) are [the knowledge workers](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/17/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-warns-society-to-brace-for-impact-of-ai-acceleration.html). There was no specific mention of lawyers in the group that will be so impacted (writers, software engineers, accountants, architects) but it’s no stretch to include lawyers in that group. AI can [already pass a bar exam](https://www.reuters.com/technology/bar-exam-score-shows-ai-can-keep-up-with-human-lawyers-researchers-say-2023-03-15/), but there’s no need for it to pass any ethics exam, since ChatGPT doesn’t have any ethical obligations. It is still all on us.

Everyone seems to say that AI is coming for the lawyers, at least [one fund manager thinks so](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/do-not-go-to-law-school-this-fund-manager-thinks-ai-is-coming-for-the-legal-profession/). How big a risk is AI for lawyers? Some predict that as much as three-quarters of legal work can be done more quickly by AI; notice “quickly” as opposed to “correctly.”

But it’s premature to revise the lyrics to the old Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson song, “[Mammas, Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys](https://video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?ei=UTF-8&hsimp=yhs-att_001&hspart=att&p=song+didn%27t+grow+up+to+be+cowboys&type=E211US0G0#id=3&vid=8a6ab456a107eb731b3e819c313448f3&action=click)” by replacing the word “cowboys” with “lawyers.”

It’s not [much ado about nothing](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/lawyers-high-risk-losing-jobs-artificial-intelligence/), as AI is something, but hysteria doesn’t help. It’s all about how to use technology, not let it destroy us.

# The Value Of Writing Your Own Lottery Number (Versus Having A Computer Randomly Generate A Number For You)

People like to make their own decisions.

Academics have studied the value of writing your own lottery number (maybe you’ll choose your kid’s birthday) versus having a machine assign you a randomly generated number.

Thus: Choose your own lottery number. How much must I pay you to buy the ticket from you before the lottery?

Alternatively: Have a computer randomly generate a number for you. How much must I pay you to buy the ticket from you before the lottery?

In a rational world, of course, both numbers are worth the same amount. If you have a one in a million chance of winning the lottery, then you should demand one dollar as the price for any ticket before the result is known.

But most people don’t see it this way. On average, people [demand five times as much money for the ticket where they picked their own number](https://hbr.org/2012/04/increase-your-teams-motivation) than for the randomly generated number.

People may be crazy, but they seemingly like to make their own decisions.

(I think I’m an outlier. I want to go into Starbucks and order a “[cup o’ Joe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cup_of_joe).” Really. But the barista asks if I want a double-shot-decaf-chai-latte-with-some-froth. I want to go into Subway and order a “number 7.” But the guy behind the counter asks if I want it on white or whole wheat. With tomato, or lettuce, or onions, or pickles? And do I want mustard or mayo or ketchup or oil and vinegar? But I really, really don’t want any of that stuff; I just want a number 7. You guys are the professionals at making subs. Just make me a number 7. I’m sure it’s a wise decision on the part of Starbucks and Subway to give customers choice. Customers apparently enjoy their coffee or sub more when they have a say in how the product is made. But not me. Like I said, I’m an outlier.)

Anyway, how can you use the fact that people like to make their own decisions in running a corporate law department (or, for that matter, a law firm)?

Heck if I know.

(Nah. I’m just kidding. You hoped knew I’d get around to a relevant point eventually.)

Let people pick their own goals.

What do you think you should achieve next year as an in-house litigator? How many cases should you handle? How many training courses should you teach people in the business? How should we handle reporting on your cases? Whatever.

Or, in a law firm, let people pick their measures for personal development (or, in the case of partners, their compensation).

For associates: How many depositions should you take next year? How many courses should you teach (or articles should you write) to help the firm attract business? How many lunches should you have with clients or prospects? What steps should you take to make those things happen?

Or, for partners: How much client work should you do next year? How much firm work? How much business should you bring in? What are the concrete steps you should take to increase the odds that you bring in that much business?

For the most part, people will naturally pick goals that resemble the ones you would set for them. And, of course, if the self-selected goals don’t naturally meet your institutional objectives, you can discuss the goals and guide people gently in the direction that you prefer.

Once people have set their own goals, they have far less reason to complain at the end of the year, when the results are in, the goals met (or not), and the firm reacts in the promised way.

This gives people control over their lives and is seemingly worth five times as much as institutionally generated goals. That benefits both the individual and the institution.

Why not maximize value for both sides?

# Cravath Alternative: $150K Now... Much, Much More At Bonus Time

Your base on the left, your bonus on the right.

For a Biglaw player, there’s really no excuse at this point for lagging behind the market in compensation. It’s just throwing up a white flag to be hemming and hawing about compensation — at least in the top markets — at this point.

But what about firms that don’t follow the Biglaw path? Some mid-sized firms have offered a discounted Cravath scale. Others have raised young associates to $180K and compressed salaries beyond that.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Way outside the box is Edelson PC, the plaintiffs’ side tech/privacy class-action firm. Given the firm’s business model, based largely on contingency fees, it doesn’t really make sense to pay associates in lockstep with Cravath. On the other hand, Edelson thrives on enticing top talent away from the Biglaw path. With Biglaw jumping salaries, Edelson had to respond.

And the firm’s response was classically unorthodox: $150K base salaries — regardless of seniority — and bonuses, bonuses, bonuses!

Starting effective July 1, 2016, all associates — regardless of year — will make $150,000. This will be the base salary. We will still provide aggressive bonuses with the idea that most people will outpace big law and for those that truly kill it, there will be no ceiling whatsoever. (Yes, the rumors are true: one previous summer associate got a significant six figure bonus — though in fairness s/he worked during the school year as well.)

I’m assuming it wasn’t [this awful Edelson summer associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/08/this-firm-hired-an-actor-to-play-the-worlds-worst-summer-associate/).

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
From an outsider perspective, this model sounds ideal for Edelson’s practice. Associates make enough guaranteed money to live comfortably, if not extravagantly, throughout the year, knowing that their ultimate compensation is tied to the firm’s contingency fee-based business model.

Moreover, with firms routinely [screwing over counsel](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/whats-up-with-counsel-salaries/) or [laying off staff](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/bad-timing-alert-layoffs-follow-raises/), Edelson believes in sharing the Cravath-inspired prosperity around the firm:

Because we recognize that everybody contributes to the success we have at the firm, we will be giving across the board raises. To wit:

* Summer associate salaries will go up $2,800/wk and — like before — those accepting full time offers will get signing bonuses of between $5k and $25k (our average has been around $15k).
* Our staff attorney salaries are increasing over 20%.
* Our alternative track summer salaries are increasing 20%.
* Our administrative staff will receive raises between 15 and 25 percent.
* Our computer forensic engineering team will receive raises between 15 and 20 percent.
* Our interns will receive raises of approximately 10%.

This isn’t completely set in stone. Edelson’s memo asks for further input from associates — or as Edelson writes in his characteristically amusing manner, “If you think we fucked this up, tell us.” Despite the offer to haggle, we suspect this is a fairly popular proposal for a firm where associates joined up expecting lower base compensation supplemented by windfalls of successful bonuses.

The rather lengthy memo from Jay Edelson describing the firm’s proposed new policy is reproduced on the next page.

# 5 Things To Remember As A New Law School Graduate
## Remember, there is no singular piece of advice that will fit every attorney. Much of your career will be reacting to new information with little notice.

It’s been 15 years since I stood on the steps of Langdell Hall as a newly minted Harvard Law School graduate. Along with 500 of my classmates, I naturally assumed we would launch our careers, rise through the ranks, and then make partner — all at the same firm where we started. Little did I realize that the path to success is not a linear one, but rather a series of well-intentioned moves in a complex landscape where legal expertise is only one facet.

Here are my suggestions for recent graduates as they navigate the next decade of their legal careers:

- Build Your Network. Though I am no longer a practicing attorney, the network of friends and peers I built in my short stint in Biglaw pays dividends even outside the practice of law. For attorneys, the payoff is even greater; attorneys live and die by their reputation and maintaining a group of advocates, mentors, and friends will both embed your reputation in the legal community — for better or worse, so be careful — and open new opportunities to you from lateral movement, referrals, career advice, or even just moral support.
- Keeping On Climbing. Perhaps the most apt metaphor I’ve heard to describe a Biglaw career is that it is akin to climbing a mountain. It is a constant uphill battle that becomes steeper the higher up you climb. While attempting to climb the ranks in Biglaw, you will get outpaced by your coworkers if you fail to recognize that steady endurance and constant commitment are the keys to success. Our clients measure attorneys based on their future expected performance, which is often demonstrated by tangible benchmarks from their past, such as originations and hours. Try to maintain an even pace that allows you to hit both the quantity and quality requisites for working in Biglaw.
- Death of a Salesman. Young lawyers often think of sales and marketing as ignoble and would rather devote their time strictly to the practice of the law. While an endearing sentiment, the reality is that any partner worth his or her salt has developed sales prowess. In my dealings with rainmakers, the one thing they all possess is the ability to communicate with clarity and act with authenticity. It takes a track record of expertise to get in front of a client, but once you’re there, you have to close the deal and pass up when you cannot deliver. Look for partners with a demonstrated record of procuring large clients, and see if they are willing to mentor you — then ride their coat tails.
- Play Chess, Not Checkers. Navigating your legal career requires finesse and foresight. From elementary school to law school, your path has likely been fairly linear. The game of law is not so much — it requires a deft touch to get you where you want to go. You may have to sacrifice short-term happiness for long-term gains. For instance, though you may be enamored with your overly leveraged firm, you have few opportunities for servicing meaningful work and practicing your client development skills. Come your eighth year, the firm is not going to make you partner just because you love the firm so much. We have had clients that lateral away from their dream firm to gain the requisite experience at another firm to later come return to that firm as a partner. Think three moves ahead, not just one.
- Always Explore Your Options. The days of the lifer are pretty much over. Staying with one firm for eight years in hopes of becoming a partner won’t boost your chances as much as you might hope. In making your career plan, remember that there are always opportunities for more substantial work, higher pay, and better mentorship. It never hurts to be aware of your career options and check in on the marketplace from time to time. Worst-case scenario, you stay at your firm if the current opportunities are not quite the right fit.
As you embark on your law careers, remember there is no singular piece of advice that will fit every attorney. Much of your career will be reacting to new information with little notice. We counsel our candidates based on each individual’s current situation and goals, and we invite you to explore your options with us.

# Biglaw Partner Under Fire For 'Abusive' Deposition
## Is this a case of a partner behaving badly or an overly sensitive expert?

Lawyers are supposed to be aggressive. That’s the trope most in the profession — and those outside of it as well — buy into, and that’s supercharged during the adversarial process. But is it possible to go over the line?

That’s what toxicology expert William Sawyer says happened during a deposition in a case against Lumber Liquidators about formaldehyde exposure. Sawyer, plaintiffs’ expert, said in an affidavit that defense attorney, [Robert Redmond](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/People/R/Robert-F-Redmond.aspx) — a partner at McGuireWoods, “became abusive,” leaning into his face with “an outstretched neck.” Sawyer withdrew from the case, saying Redmond’s behavior exacerbated an existing medical condition. As Law.com[ reports](https://www.law.com/2018/10/18/top-plaintiffs-expert-says-mcguirewoods-partners-abusive-deposition-threatened-his-health/) on the contents of Sawyer’s affidavit:

“I felt like a prisoner before a Nazi-administered trial and became seriously concerned and stressed about what was happening,” [Sawyer] said in the affidavit. “I could feel/hear my heart echoing within my ears and simultaneously could feel my heart pounding with palpitations within the chest. At this time I realized that I was at risk of another serious cardiac arrhythmia.”

Sawyer, who has testified in over 200 depositions, also called Redmond “aggressively malicious” and said, “I truly believe that corrective discipline should be administered with respect to Mr. Redmond’s unprofessional courtroom conduct.”

The magistrate in the case has allowed the plaintiffs to replace their expert, but ordered them to pay Lumber Liquidators the costs associated with the deposition without even reviewing the videotape of the deposition. While plaintiffs’ have agreed to pay some costs, they dispute the full amount, arguing the witness’s withdrawal was unpredictable.

In a statement to Law.com, Redmond denied that his behavior in the deposition was inappropriate saying, “There’s absolutely no evidence that I did anything untoward in the deposition other than ask him questions that he was uncomfortable with.” He also went on to speculate that the real reason Sawyer withdrew was pointed questions about his credentials.

In his interview with Law.com, Redmond suggested that Sawyer wanted to avoid questions about his credentials. According to an Oct. 10 filing by Lumber Liquidators in support of its fees, Sawyer had failed the American Board of Toxicology exam, and his certification came from the American Board of Forensic Medicine, a “certification mill of questionable viability.”

“Frankly, I think the deposition probed into areas he hasn’t had probed into—namely, his certifications,” Redmond told Law.com. “And I think he was uncomfortable with that, and he was uncomfortable with the level of scrutiny of his qualifications that I was giving during the deposition.”

Weird that in 200 depos Sawyer’s quals haven’t come up before.

So, what do you think — is this a case of a partner behaving badly or an overly sensitive expert? Your take might just depend on which side of the table you’re used to being on.

# Above The Law's 8th Annual Holiday Card Contest
## We look forward to [your submissions](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday Card Contest). Thank you, and happy holidays!

It’s the most wonderful time of the year. Amid balmy “winter” weather mixed with a bonanza of [bonus news](https://abovethelaw.com/bonuses/), the holiday season is off to a great start. Jolly Old Saint Cravath was very kind this year, stuffing associates’ stockings with good cheer and [wads of cash](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2016-associate-bonuses/). The law firm holiday parties are starting to kick into gear, but the parties and paychecks pale in comparison to what’s about to get underway: Above the Law’s eighth annual holiday card contest. We’ve already received several emails asking about when this year’s contest would start. The answer: It starts today.

We are a legal website, so of course there are some rules to follow:

1. Because we are committed to the environment here at [Breaking Media](http://breakingmedia.com/), we will consider ONLY E-CARDS. You can certainly send us paper holiday cards via snail mail — our address is Above the Law / Breaking Media, 611 Broadway, Suite 907D, New York, NY 10012 — but they won’t be considered for this contest.

2. To submit an e-card, please email either a link to the card or the card itself (as an attachment) — but note that WE PREFER LINKS, if available — to [tips@abovethelaw.com](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=Holiday%20Card%20Contest), subject line: “Holiday Card Contest.” The subject line is very important because it’s how we will comb through our inbox to collect the entries when picking finalists. If you don’t use the correct subject line, expect a lump of coal in your stocking.

3. Please limit submissions to holiday / Christmas cards that you view as WORTHY CONTENDERS. We’re looking for cards that are unusually clever, funny, or cool; we’re not interested in cards that are safe or boring (e.g., a beautiful winter landscape, a “Happy Holidays 2016,” and the law firm name). We’re seeking cards with some attitude, with that extra je ne sais quoi. If you send us a banal card, don’t be surprised if we [make fun of it](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/01/atl-holiday-card-contest-honorable-and-dishonorable-mentions/).

4. In your email, please include a BRIEF EXPLANATION of why this card is compelling — an explanation that we MIGHT QUOTE FROM if your nominee makes the finals (if you want to be anonymous, let us know). If you can’t offer an explanation, please rethink whether the card is a worthy contender (see rule #3, supra).

5. The deadline for submissions is two weeks from today: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, at 11:59 p.m. (New York time). No exceptions. If you’re reading this post after the deadline, then you don’t read Above the Law frequently enough.

# Post-Pandemic Parents' Survival Skills Can Help Us Become The Next Generation Of Law Firm Leaders
## As a Virginia-based, fully remote shareholder for a Maine-based law firm, and a practice group leader to a mostly remote team located across three time zones, I have seen the opportunity in traditional law firms willing to leverage technology and communication to build innovative practices.

As we pass the three-year anniversary of the pandemic, the legal industry is in a panic about “quit quitting,” the return to in-person networking, and the inevitable impact of AI on the profession. But while some firms are expressing a desire to return to “normal,” others recognize that many lawyers are thriving without the trappings of the “normal” law firm life of a few years ago.

For some, business development and mentorship might still mean post-work happy hour, but many lawyers have also come out of the pandemic building robust practices with little, if any, physical infrastructure or in-person networking. These attorneys are utilizing vast virtual networks and technology to develop real client relationships and manage successful teams — sometimes with individuals that they have never met in person.

This shift presents a significant leadership opportunity for post-pandemic lawyer parents. In fact, many lawyer parents and caregivers have spent the past three years building the skills that will permit us to embrace change and lead the innovative law firms of the next generation. While some leaders in the profession have conveyed a fear that this work-from-home environment permitted lawyers to “get off easy,” many of us who found ourselves in the position of working and parenting simultaneously during the pandemic know that we learned to develop new systems for generating quality work; to better communicate deadlines, expectations, and boundaries; to shift our networks to virtual platforms; to creatively coordinate schedules and priorities; and to approach our colleagues and clients as empathetic partners. Those adaptations served us and our families well in a time of necessity, yet they also permitted us to adapt with our clients and, at times, provide more cost-effective and innovative solutions.

The resilient systems parents and caregivers built in recent years were a survival mode, but as we shift to a new “normal,” firms should also see the potential of these lessons to impact future law firm leadership. The change presents opportunities for law firms to tap into an underutilized segment of the profession — lawyer parents — and develop diverse teams using approaches unheard of in the pre-2020 legal landscape. What’s more, many of these same changes that will permit parents to serve in leadership roles will also help firms implement the technology, efficiencies, and communications practices to weather future industry disruption.

And it’s not only virtual law firms that can tap into the potential of the new legal landscape to build more diverse leadership teams. As a Virginia-based, fully remote shareholder for a Maine-based law firm, and a practice group leader to a mostly remote team located across three time zones, I have seen the opportunity in traditional law firms willing to leverage technology and communication to build innovative practices. I have also seen how the adoption of these innovative practices has helped me grow as a leader — while also raising young children — and build a strong team in which many members are parents themselves.

Now, as I look back on years of constant disruption, I believe that post-pandemic parents have learned three lessons that can help us shape the law firms of the future:

- Efficient problem solving can replace long hours. Female parents have always been a small percentage of equity partners in law firms. This is due, in part, to the fact that many find the number of hours typically billed to achieve this status incompatible with family life. But as the legal profession reels at the notion that technology may someday eliminate routine legal tasks, it’s clear that most lawyers will need to adapt to focus on creative problem-solving rather than less efficient (and often more time-consuming) tasks. This shift could provide an alternate pathway to leadership, creating opportunities for those who can develop an area of expertise, solve unique problems, and communicate and relate with our clients, without spending as many late nights at the office. Moreover, while client demands (and corresponding career advancement for attorneys) used to require hopping on a plane for important meetings, our recent comfort level with virtual practice permits us to travel less and the client to save on costs. These are wins for parents and for the client’s bottom line.
- Communication and connection can replace physical proximity. Thanks to our new Zoom proficiency, our opportunities for personal connection are expanded, rather than limited. While building a practice over the course of the pandemic in the specialized field of higher education investigations, my team has been able to recruit talent from around the country to join us — and those lawyers have not been required to uproot their families to take on a new role. This has had the added benefit of helping us build a nationwide practice, as we use the same virtual methods to stay in touch as a team that we use to connect with our clients.
- Intentionality can replace facetime. Many large law firms have already found that the days of ever-present, in-office associates are gone following the pandemic. I believe that in-person connection can strengthen teams and relationships. But this connection must now be more deliberate, rather than found at the water cooler. Post-pandemic lawyer parents have learned to set boundaries by necessity, and we should carry these with us as we work to manage teams intentionally and empathetically. My team has learned that the virtual world requires more conscious use of our time and communications, and we are always working to find new avenues for meaningful mentorship and team collaboration. I believe that these ongoing efforts will be necessary to build and retain legal teams in the post-pandemic era, and many working parents will thrive in this more structured environment.
Lastly, with these new opportunities for leadership, lawyer parents must also raise the bar for all parents in the industry. The pandemic has only further hobbled our country’s already inadequate childcare system and exposed the need for a safety net for those who become ill or become unexpected caregivers. And while a structural solution — requiring support from all levels of government — is necessary to fix the problem, lawyer parents in leadership roles must simultaneously advocate for these programs within our own profession.

As we look back on the past three years, post-pandemic lawyer parents know that our legal practice has irreparably changed. But we can use lessons learned in a stressful and chaotic period to advance our careers and tomorrow’s legal industry.

# The Clock Is Ticking
## If we have learned anything from the past 18 months (and counting), it’s that life is precious and finite.

Time’s Up.

Do you know that the [average life expectancy](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/VSRR10-508.pdf) of American men is 77 years, and the average life expectancy of American women is 80 years? Do you care? You should.

In his new book, “[Four Thousand Weeks, Time Management for Mortals](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Management-Mortals-ebook/dp/B08FGV64B1/ref=sr_1_1?crid=4EK5OHCTVPEJ&dchild=1&keywords=time+management+for+mortals&qid=1628627430&s=books&sprefix=time+m%2Caps%2C262&sr=1-1),” Oliver Burkeman reminds us that we are mortal and that we have a finite time in which to live, love, play, work, and do all the things that matter.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Time to freak out, at least I did. Figure out how many weeks you have left. OMG, you say, but those numbers are the average life expectancies. You could fall victim to less than the average or you could prevail and live more than the average. My crystal ball is in the shop, and I trust yours is as well. Regardless of where you are on the lifeline of the 4,000 weeks, the realization of time limits is disconcerting.

Why even mention this book? Because we lawyers are enmeshed in the cult of “busyness,”  not just “business,” and we all know that there’s a world of difference between the two. How many times has a friend or colleague called (I know, so old-fashioned), emailed (also old-fashioned), reached out to you on social media or texted you to ask how you are? And the reply is almost invariably, “I’m busy, I’m swamped,” “I’ll get back to you,” or whatever response you choose. Are we really that busy? Are we really that swamped? How efficient do we really need to be? Burkeman says that we are caught in an “efficiency trap.”

We are, Burkeman says, hamsters on a wheel, spinning those wheels in attempt to do more and more. As if we needed reminding, Burkeman uses the example of the billable hour. The prevailing view, unfortunately, is that if that hour is not billed, it’s wasted. Not true. We are too shackled to productivity that can be measured and counted and valued in dollars and cents,  too invested in the future to live life today. However, as we all know, time is finite, Burkeman says; there are only 24 hours in a day no matter how many ways lawyers may try to bill for more than those 24 hours. (I have seen that happen.)

We are on a conveyor belt: the more we do, the more we have to do since the more people see us as being so efficient, the more work piles on. Does anyone remember the “I Love Lucy” episode where she and Ethel are [working at a conveyor belt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkQ58I53mjk) in a candy factory? If you have never seen it, I think it’s prescient, so stop for three minutes and click on the link. Ever felt like that? I have, and I’m sure many others feel likewise.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Like many of us, I have read so many time management books over the years, gone through so many planners of various types and methods, wrote so many to-do lists that didn’t get done, that the thought of reading one more was not something I wanted to do. I thought it would be a waste of whatever time I do have. However, the title of this one brought me up short.

This book is different because it clarifies, at least for me, that time is indeed a finite resource, that there is no way we can do everything we want to do or should do, that we have to rid ourselves of FOMO because there will always be things we want to do and just simply can’t for whatever the reasons. However, Burkeman says that there’s also JOMO, the joy of missing out, ditching another boring bar association meeting, dinner, or networking event, and instead spending time doing what you want to do and not being compelled to do otherwise. Saying “no” is liberating.

There’s nothing wrong with using time to do the things and live the life we most want. Granted, we must earn livings, take care of our families, and perform other obligations, but we don’t need to say “yes” to everything that comes along. We may be flattered, honored, or pleased, but is this something we really want to do? That’s a question we all need to answer for ourselves, and everyone’s answer will be different, depending upon priorities and what and who matter most.

We pride ourselves on being overcommitted with a resume of professional and personal activities and achievements that are pages long. How many of those are meaningful or just activities that look impressive, at least to others, even if you know they’re just eye candy?

Burkeman has some suggestions for how to gain control (or regain control) of your life. They include setting time limits for your work, focusing on one project at a time (no multitasking), embracing strategic underachievement (synonymous with “you can’t do it all”), focusing on what you’ve already completed, consolidating your caring (don’t spread yourself too thin), using single purpose and boring technology like an e-reader as opposed to a tablet, enjoying the mundane, being curious, acting on generous impulses right away, and practicing doing … absolutely nothing. How hard is the last suggestion? The hardest for us overachievers, although I am not sure that the others are all that much easier.

The poet Mary Oliver asked the question: “What do you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” If we have learned anything from the past 18 months (and counting), it’s that life is precious and finite, and that we all have the same finish line. How you spend your life before you cross it is up to you.

# A Career Is A Marathon, Not A Sprint
## Run, Lawyer! Run! But pace yourself!

I had a mentor about a decade ago who told me that a career is a marathon and not a sprint and that I should act accordingly. I’ve heard the expression “X is a marathon and not a sprint” numerous times in my life, and I generally understood this phrase to mean that people need to think of certain matters in the long term and not focus on excelling in short time horizons. A few weeks ago, I ran the New York City Marathon for the second time, which was an amazing experience, although I still have pain when I walk because of the effort needed to complete the marathon! Strategizing for the marathon, and being involved in this long test of endurance, validated for me that people do indeed need to treat their careers as marathons and not sprints to achieve the best results.

Burnout

Each time I run a long race, I have issues with pacing and burnout. I usually run relatively fast for the first part of the race, and then find that I cannot sustain that pace. At marathons, I am usually doing a fair bit of walking toward the end, which never feels good. When I look at the mile splits of friends who had more success at marathons it is clear that they usually kept a better pace throughout the race. Keeping a solid pace prevented those runners from burning out and ensured that they did not sustain significant impact on their bodies too early in the race.

This strategy can also apply to careers within the legal industry. Many people graduate from law school and take jobs in Biglaw in which they may be expected to toil for long hours under less than ideal conditions. Some people might justify this existence by relating that the money earned from Biglaw can help pay student loans and set people up for the next phase of their careers. However, I have also met attorneys who were completely burned out by their experiences in Biglaw, and they exited the legal profession altogether because of the time pressures and stress associated with a Biglaw job. Attorneys should try to pace themselves as well to ensure they do not suffer any issues at the beginning of their careers that can make it difficult to continue in the legal profession for the long haul.

Have A Plan

One important thing about running a marathon versus other races is that you should have a plan so that you can perform at your best. During a 5K or another short race, you probably do not need to think too much about hydration strategies, consuming food, or any of the other matters you need to consider while running for hours in a marathon. Indeed, at this most recent marathon, I did not give too much consideration to how much fluid I should consume, how I would deal with excessive sunshine, or other matters that had a negative impact on my running.

Most people do not give too much thought to careers, and they simply take the first job that pays a set amount of money. However, lawyers should be more deliberate with how they move through their careers and think about how each job might impact their ability to get another job, among other facts. It can be tough to think more generally about a career when attorneys are in the thick of things, but this can ensure that lawyers have the most success at landing fulfilling opportunities.

One solid strategy for marathon running is to try to keep pace with someone in front of you. This helps motivate people to keep running and can give runners inspiration to continue when they might think about quitting. In careers, it often makes sense to model behavior off of people who are doing well in workplaces and in other settings. For instance, I once worked at a shop where there was a solid associate who had a great mastery of his files without sacrificing work-life balance. He implemented a number of systems to stay apprised of his cases, and he was very generous in sharing his methods. I definitely modeled my practices around this associate, and this had a positive impact on my career.

In any event, experiences we have in our own lives can model behaviors that can make us more successful in our careers. And by understanding that careers are a marathon rather than a sprint, lawyers can implement strategies to improve their chances of vocational success.

If you’re reading this, I’ll bet a stack of Hamiltons you’re feeling the jitters about an impending recession. Given that recessions are [generally defined](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-recession) retroactively by two successive quarters of decline in GDP, real income, and consumer spending, it’s possible we’re in one right now and don’t even know it yet.

There are plenty of reasons people are expecting the economy to continue slowing down for the foreseeable future. On the consumer side of the economy, [inflation is at 8.6%](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-faces-unacceptable-levels-inflation-yellen-tells-senators-2022-06-07/), and consumers are responding by cutting down on their discretionary spending. Gas prices are going through the roof, [topping $8 at one California station](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/428772).

With Federal Reserve Chairman [Jerome Powell announcing a .75-point rate hike](https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-fed-chief-powells-postmeeting-press-conference-11655326563) to the fed funds rate, consumer loan and [mortgage rates will likely continue to rise](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/business/economy/fed-rate-increase-mortgage.html). Even before Powell’s announcement, mortgage loan application activity recently hit a [22-year low](https://money.yahoo.com/mortgage-application-index-sinks-to-more-than-two-decade-low-amid-rising-rates-142215038.html). And while the jobless rate has been relatively low over the past year, even that took [a gigantic leap upward last week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-09/us-jobless-claims-rose-last-week-by-most-since-july-2021).

All of this is rippling through the markets. Yesterday, the Dow [fell below 30,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/16/theres-no-bottom-in-sight-yet-says-top-chart-analyst-as-the-dow-breaks-below-30000.html#:~:text=On%20Thursday%2C%20the%20Dow%20Jones,%25%20and%203.5%25%2C%20respectively.), and the S&P 500 is down 20% over the past six months — moving it into “[bear market territory](https://www.investopedia.com/s-and-p500-bear-market-2022-5410266).” Investors are feeling pain. Workers are concerned about their 401(k)s and retirement dates.

The boom of the roaring 2020s seems to have come to a grinding halt. Nobody, nobody, can say precisely where this is going. The stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions, as the [old joke goes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briandomitrovic/2018/11/22/the-stock-market-has-predicted-nine-of-the-past-five-recessions/?sh=274678d03d74). But recessions can be self-fulfilling prophecies, fueled by expectation, and large swaths of the American economy, including [85% of its CFOs](https://fortune.com/2022/06/09/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-a-possible-recession/), are buckling down for a coming storm.

Now What?

Even if fears of an overall economic recession turn out to be overblown, there’s still every reason to prepare your practice and your firm to weather a downturn in business. Our industry still faces all the same headwinds it’s been facing for the past decade, including increased competition from nontraditional legal service providers and decreasing client appetite for outside counsel. It was recently reported that, for the first time in known legal history, [over 50% of in-house counsel](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/06/14/in-house-spending-eclipses-outside-spending-in-new-legal-department-benchmarking-survey/?kw=In-House%20Spending%20Eclipses%20Outside%20Spending%20in%20New%20Legal%20Department%20Benchmarking%20Survey&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=newsroomupdate&utm_content=20220614&utm_term=tal&slreturn=20220515125733) spending has been remaining in-house, rather than being spent on outside counsel. That’s a drastic downturn from prior norms of 30%-40% remaining in-house and the rest going to firms like ours. Biglaw practices need to have game plans in place if their client bases dwindle or fall away. So what is a law firm executive committee to do to make sure their firm comes out the other side not just intact, but better than ever?

Understand Your Vulnerable Areas

The first step is understanding where you can get hurt the most, and how much any one blow can hurt you. Robust companies can handle setbacks without being at risk of going under, but that’s not always how businesses work, especially in the legal field.

Does your book of business rely heavily on one client? Is there a single practice group that’s responsible for most of your firm’s profitability? Figure out right now where your firm can least afford to take a hit, and then do some forecasting and planning. Prepare a budget that assumes your biggest client drops you, or carves off half its matters to send somewhere else. If losing your biggest client still leaves you in good shape, assume the next-biggest leaves, too. Model what would need to happen if your most successful practice group’s productivity plummets. Keep pulling pieces out of the hypothetical Jenga tower until it falls over. When you’re done, you’ll have a drastically better understanding of what really keeps the lights on in your office, what you need to prioritize, and what you can do to stop the bleeding if things get ugly.

Diversify

Once you have your arms around what it is your firm relies on, you’ll naturally start seeing the gaps in your portfolio of work that you can start to plug. If your firm relies heavily on practices that ebb and flow with the business cycle, such as M&A or real estate, try to find countercyclical or evergreen practices to fold in or build up. Rainmaking bankruptcy attorneys turn into rock stars during downturns, and less flashy but steady practices like tax law are the ones that make sure a firm always stays afloat. Not every practice in a healthy, robust firm is going to be teeming with work all the time, and that’s okay. Value those steady relievers that you know will step up when conditions change. Balance your firm’s practice mix and those speed bumps in the economy will feel a lot less impactful.

Master Your Overhead

The real problem of a recession isn’t just that your firm’s revenue drops; it’s that your overhead stays steady. Preventing overhead from creeping up over time is the perpetual task of every law firm leader. Keeping a rein on overhead today is essential to surviving tomorrow’s troubles.

I’ve written before in this space about the[ Tragedy of the Law Firm Commons](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/05/the-tragedy-of-the-law-firm-commons/), a problem that arises when the benefits of an overhead expense are enjoyed by a single partner or practice group, but the cost of that overhead is split evenly across the partnership. Take a firm with 100 partners where all overhead is split evenly. Imagine now that you’re one of those partners, and you’re wondering whether to take on a new paralegal, but you’re not sure you have enough work to keep the new hire fully occupied. If it turns out that paralegal is unprofitable, with a shared overhead you’ll only have to pay 1% of their potential loss because your other partners will pay for the rest. Having your partners subsidize 99% of a loss in exchange for a little relief or ability to cut out early on a Friday is a smokin’ deal for you, right? But your other partners have the same incentives to drive up overhead to their personal benefit as you do. This sort of system can leave a firm with 100 partners, 1,000 paralegals, and 0 profit.

The way to avoid this sort of problem is to allocate overhead as best the firm can based on major resources a partner actually uses. If an associate works 50% with a partner, that partner should take on 50% of that associate’s overhead. It’ll never be a perfect system, and many budget line items like office supplies should remain evenly split; it’s not worth tracking individual paperclips and pens. Similarly, most administrative expenses should be shared evenly because the firm can’t function without HR, finance, and IS departments — even if individual utilization varies. But if you make partners accountable for major aberrational expenses, there will be more dollars left over to keep everyone if that recession materializes.

Think Carefully About Dragging People Onsite

Speaking of overhead, there’s one component of it that warrants its own discussion: real estate. Next to staff, it’s usually a firm’s biggest expense. Law firms have a golden opportunity to keep those costs low going forward as remote work becomes more prevalent. Embracing remote work can reduce a firm’s need for expensive physical space, while also encouraging teams to use efficient electronic tools instead of expensive and slow paper-based workflows. Onsite workers also tend to lead to increased meal and meeting expenses.

Embracing remote work is also great from a retention standpoint. [Study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2022/05/05/remote-work-increases-employee-happiness-by-20-new-study-finds/?sh=6a8acc7e3183) after [study](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/nearly-half-of-workers-are-definitely-looking-to-work-remotely.aspx) after [study](https://www.businessinsider.com/study-says-remote-workers-are-happier-stay-in-jobs-longer-2019-9) shows that workers want flexibility. In fact, remote work is increasingly seen as a standard, not a perk. As the American Lawyer recently put it, if you want to thin your firm’s headcount,[ just mandate your attorneys spend three or more days a week in-office](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/05/want-to-thin-your-law-firms-head-count-mandate-3-or-more-days-of-office-attendance/). If that sounds like it could be an effective strategy in a volatile economy where you’re looking to reduce cost, think again. Because it will probably be your highest performers that bolt — leaving you with lots of expensive space and the future of your firm gone.

Start Leading Today

Like I said earlier, recessions are in many ways creatures of expectation. That applies to your firm just as much as it does the economy at large. Your partners and teammates are likely sharing the same concerns you are, so get out in front of the issue and make sure they know you’re proactively planning for this. Be up front about the strategizing and analysis you’re going through on a firm-wide basis, and ask your partners to do the same for their individual practices. Having a prepared, coordinated partnership that’s ready to make bold decisions in the face of adversity will set your firm up to not just survive an economic downturn, but to come out the other side stronger than ever.

The competition can sit and wait for the economic winds to push them somewhere new, but by being a strong and active leader today, your firm can be united in charting its own course.

# Name Partner Of Elite Litigation Powerhouse Leaves To Start New Firm
## For now, he has to play it 'kool' when it comes to the client he left the firm for.

Everything’s bigger in Texas, including the headlines when a litigation power player leaves the firm that bears his name.

Mike McKool of McKool Smith — the Texas-based complex trial firm that’s been handing out money to associates hand over fist for years — recently announced his resignation from the firm he founded more than 30 years ago because of a “compelling” client opportunity. “It was something that I really thought was the best thing I ever had been offered,” McKool said. “We tried to do it with the firm. It didn’t work out.” The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/18/mike-mckool-has-departed-mckool-smith-to-form-new-firm/) has more:

Declining to provide specifics about the parties involved, McKool Smith managing partner David Sochia explained that the firm had agreed to represent the client in question on the potential litigation matter, and the board approved it, but while they were trying to work out a fee arrangement, a business conflict arose. That happened about three weeks ago, he said.

“Because we couldn’t solve it, that led Mike’s potential client to say they couldn’t wait around,” Sochia said. “This happens from time to time in the legal field.”

McKool will be opening his new firm sometime soon, and has been speaking to several of his colleagues about potentially joining him. McKool said there’s “no animosity” involved, and that he’s been “very open” about who he’s spoken to because he in no way wants to “hurt the organization.” The trial lawyer went on to say that the firm is in good hands with Sochia leading the way.

McKool Smith will not be changing its name.

— [Theodore Boutrous Jr.](http://gibsondunn.com/lawyer/boutrous-jr-theodore-j/), global co-chairman of Gibson Dunn’s litigation group, commenting on his [pandemic plans for his perfectly coiffed hair](https://www.law.com/2020/04/22/from-the-covid-19-bunker-ted-boutrous-on-his-anti-trump-tweets-poetry-and-hair/), which has become an “indelible part of [his] brand.”

As the new year dawns, Above the Law would like to look back on those we lost in 2017. Specifically, the law firms we lost in the past year. Firms meet their end (or announce they’re about to) in all manner of ways. We remember them always.


Cellino & Barnes is, of course, not so much dead as the world’s most successful zombie firm, having pulled down millions since the legal battle between its named partners began and showing no signs of slowing down until this is all resolved.

# More About Making Partner At Sullivan & Cromwell (Part 2)
## Is the partner track getting longer at the elite firm?

We’ve written [quite a bit](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/) about [partnership prospects for women](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/more-about-making-partner-at-sullivan-cromwell-part-1/) at Sullivan & Cromwell. It’s a controversial subject, and S&C has both its critics and its defenders (note the multiple UPDATES to Wednesday’s story).

But some readers feel that we’ve missed the boat on the S&C partnership track. Here’s what one reader wrote to us:

A bit disappointed by your coverage of S&C partner announcements (where I’m an associate). The diversity line is an easy cudgel and clickbait, I get it, but there’s actually something more interesting going on here.

Only one of [five partners made](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/) were in the traditional 8/9th year associate to partner track characteristic of traditional Biglaw. While that model is dead at most firms (two-tier partnership, de-equitizations, etc), the stalwart NYC firms (Cravath, Wachtell, Cleary, Davis Polk, Paul Weiss, Debevoise, etc) have managed to hang on and retain it. I wonder whether this year’s announcement at S&C signals the end of this era for the firm or is simply an aberration (one cannot generalize too greatly from a single year, of course).

Ultimately, in a world of $5MM profits per partner it probably makes sense to give eighth-year associates a couple years as special counsel to see if they are equity partnership material before bestowing upon them a lifetime membership, but it would be great if the firm were a bit more transparent in how it was thinking about these type of questions.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
The traditional model is, in my opinion, the classiest way to run a partnership. It typically involves a single-tier partnership, with all partners as equity partners, and most promotions from the associate ranks, within a fairly standard (and not ridiculously long) period of time. It often involves lockstep or mostly lockstep pay for partners (although there are exceptions, such as S&C). For a detailed look at this model, see our prior post, [Biglaw: It’s Not All About the Benjamins](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/biglaw-its-not-all-about-the-benjamins/).

Alas, this model has grown less prevalent over the years. In 1995, about two-thirds of law firms had a single-tier partnership structure. By 2009, that basically flipped (and then some), with about 75 percent of firms with 100 or more lawyers having a two-tier system (equity and non-equity). In 2016, it appears that [just 18 of the Am Law 100 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/stats-of-the-week-the-last-of-the-true-biglaw-partnerships/?rf=1) have single-tier partnerships.

Is the partnership model evolving at S&C? Back to our tipster:

S&C’s “special counsel” role traditionally included two categories of people — specialists for whom partner track didn’t make sense (ERISA, antitrust, environmental, etc) and laterals, whom the firm would refuse to make full partners (my impression is that their comp is similar, but they aren’t involved in firm management).

This has broken down in recent years. First, we’ve made some notable exceptions and hired true lateral partners (examples include [Nader Mousavi](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/NaderA-Mousavi) [from WilmerHale] and [Michael Torkin](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/MichaelH-Torkin) [from Shearman & Sterling]). Second, we’ve increasingly made special counsels in core practice areas (examples include [John Anselmi](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/JohnJ-Anselmi), [Matthew Peller](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/MatthewA-Peller), [Brian O’Reilly](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/BrianP-OReilly), [Tracey Russell](https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/TraceyR-Seraydarian), and others).

So from where I sit, the partner model of 8/9 years associate to equity is changing too. The firm has said nothing on this, but it’s hard to read our partnership class (making a bunch of special counsels partner and only one true associate to partner) otherwise. This would in many ways bring us in line with the market, but would be a meaningful change for S&C….

On the one hand, “traditional Biglaw business model is dying” isn’t a particularly novel story. But on the other hand, when firms like S&C begin to structure themselves more as traditional businesses and less like simple, single-tiered professional partnerships with an associate class, that is interesting. And it’s interesting at S&C because I doubt that simplistic concerns about money or PPP optics are driving it in the way they would at another firm.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
At this point, it’s too early to say that S&C is changing its model for partnership promotion. It’s fairly typical, at both S&C and other firms, to put lateral hires — such as lawyers coming from other firms where they weren’t partners, or lawyers coming out of government — in the “special counsel” holding pen for a little while (even if they’ve been out of law school for a decade or more). This makes sense; it’s a way for both the lawyer and the firm to see how they like each other before making the long-term commitment of partnership. For lawyers who have never worked at S&C or who haven’t worked at S&C for years (such as lawyers who started as associates at S&C, left for government, and returned much later), such a trial period makes sense.

So the focus should really be on “homegrown” Sullivan & Cromwell associates who started their careers at the firm, rose through the ranks, and went up for partner. As to these folks, it seems there hasn’t been any major change, at least if you take a longer view (looking beyond this latest class). A source at the firm said that — excluding laterals, both “true” laterals and lawyers who left S&C for other opportunities (like government) and returned — if you look at S&C’s new partners from the past ten years, their average time at the firm is between eight and nine years. That fairly short period suggests that most partners are coming from the associate rather than special-counsel ranks (because eight to nine years isn’t a long enough period to make special counsel and hang out in that role for a while).

Still, it’s striking that the most recent S&C partner class featured [four special counsel and just one associate](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/sullivan-cromwells-new-partners-impressive-yes-diverse-not-so-much/2/). Is this an outlier, or the start of a trend? Time will tell.

UPDATE (6/10/16 4:06 p.m.): Associates abroad are a little confused about this memo. Read on.
UPDATE (6/10/16 5:09 p.m.): We now know a little more about what’s happening with those U.S. associates outside of New York. See below.

White & Case knows what side their bread is buttered on. The ninth-largest law firm in the United States has joined the ranks of MoneyLaw in bringing the dollars to its New York associates.

The pay scale is the one we’ve all become familiar with, [originated by Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/breaking-ny-to-180k-cravath-raises-associate-base-salaries/) on Monday.

The twist with this one is the same thing we [saw with Proskauer](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/game-set-match-in-this-biglaw-firms-major-offices/): those associates in offices that weren’t on the $160K pay scale in the first place aren’t getting the full salary bump. Or at least not as a matter of course — their new salaries will be set by their respective offices.




A tipster notes:

That was an extremely deceptive way to announce it considering they sent that email to all associates including those of [us] working New York hours in other markets.

Another has little faith in those individual offices:

Associates off the NYC base salary scale are expecting the worst.

UPDATE: It appears that White & Case Miami is the big loser here. From what we’ve heard they were the only U.S. office not on the New York scale. Which kind of begs the question, why not just say “all offices except Miami” for clarity’s sake?

UPDATE: We’re hearing that US associates in the NY pay scale in White & Case’s foreign offices did not receive the memo and are in the dark as to whether or not they’re getting raises. On the one hand, they are on the scale. On the other hand the memo is pretty specific about “U.S. offices.”

Not too much surprise that White & Case met the scale for its New York (and New York-esque) associates, but stopped short of being overly generous. They [tend](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/12/associate-bonus-watch-more-market-matches/?rf=1) to match the market bonuses, even when firms come over the top, so this move is in line with their practice.

Over the weekend, a reader asked us to shine a light on the relatively slow pace of the Bay Area firms when it comes to matching the new salary normal. Not that it’d been entirely quiet on the Western Front, but the action was coming primarily from [Bay Area firms with a national presence](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/west-coast-represents-in-the-salary-wars/).

For those of us wondering if this would be the raise that would inspire firms outside of the hyper-competitive NY recruiting market to [reconsider the mad dash to match top dollar](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/why-the-milbank-raise-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal-and-why-it-is/), this delay raised some eyebrows. It’s one thing for the Dallas market to pump the brakes on salaries… but the Bay Area?

And now, it looks like the dam has finally broken out West. A bevy of California firms just matched, including San Francisco-based Keker. Everyone in the Golden State can resume their vigorous chillaxation.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Tipsters report that Keker, the American Lawyer’s inaugural [Litigation Boutique of the Year](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=900005541738/Litigation-Boutique-of-the-Year-Keker--Van-Nest), will join the prevailing salary scale. UPDATE: For clarity, this means they are matching the salary scale but not paying the summer bonuses many are distributing.

It’s one more reminder that in a world where the gap between the haves and have-nots in Biglaw continues to grow, the high-powered boutiques are the big winners, capitalizing on the work clients don’t want to send to the Biglaw elite, but can’t bring themselves to take to a high-overhead, Biglaw mid-tier firm.

Congrats Keker associates. And congratulations to the rest of the Bay Area firms that have to feel like raises are finally on their way.

We depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Pay more; work less.

— An anonymous Am Law 100 associate’s response to a question found in the [American Lawyer Midlevel Associates Survey](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/22/associates-say-the-darndest-things-2023-edition/) about what they’d change about their current firm. Despite a round of[ raises last year](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) resulting in [record high](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/check-out-the-record-breaking-starting-salaries-for-recent-law-school-grads/) starting salaries and [record low billable hours](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/08/biglaw-firms-have-too-many-lawyers-with-attorney-productivity-at-an-historic-low/), this associate still isn’t satisfied.

# What To Do In A World Where Nobody Remembers Anything
## In-house lawyers, your listeners may not remember anything about your issue. Be nice; give them some hints.

In a law firm, people sometimes remember things.

Folks are focused on deal or cases; folks are providing advice; folks may well remember what they said before (or what was said to them).

That’s far less likely to be true in a corporate environment.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
If you’re talking to lower-level people, who handle one issue at a time, those lower-level folks may remember what they’re working on.

But if you’re talking to upper-level people, whose role is to make decisions and keep things moving, those upper-level people are far less likely to remember the issue that you spoke to them about three months ago.

(When I talk to former law firm partners who have gone in-house, they all have the same first reaction: “At my firm, we really thought about stuff. At the corporation, we’re handling many issues, and we’re often making decisions based on incomplete information. I’m asked to opine on many different things without having the chance to really get to the bottom of stuff.” Right. That’s corporate life.)

What should you conclude? First, what I’ve just written is true. Do not make the mistake of assuming that a senior person has any clue what you’re talking about, even if you talked to the senior person three months ago on this very subject. The senior person has handled many, many different issues since you last spoke about your topic; the senior person does not remember the issue.

Second, that’s no problem. Just gently remind the senior person what you’re talking about.

Introduce every new subject with a sentence that reminds the senior-level listener about the issue. This is not hard to do, and it’s worth a great deal to you.

At the quarterly meeting of the senior-most people who look after ethics complaints, you could introduce a subject the moron’s way: “You remember Bulgaria.”

They don’t.

Is that Romania? What the hell is Bulgaria? What’s this guy talking about? What happened in Bulgaria, and why’s he raising the subject?

Or you could introduce the subject the intelligent way: “As you recall [they don’t, but you can be nice], we had an employee in Bulgaria who bribed a government official to give us business. We decided . . . . ”

And your audience is thinking: “Oh, yeah. I remember that one! What’s the status of it?”

When you’re talking to the Board of Directors, you could say: “We discussed the Smorgasbord issue at our last meeting.”

That could be true, but no one remembers it. So they have no clue what you’re talking about.

Instead, you should say: “We discussed at our last meeting the performance of our Smorgasbord unit. It sold more burgers than dogs, and we were concerned about this. In the past quarter . . . . ”

And everyone’s thinking: “Oh, yeah. Right! That’s what we’re talking about.”

When you get up to argue a motion or an appeal, you can assume that the judge remembers your case and just wade into the argument.

Or you can say, in a sentence or two: “The facts, briefly, are these . . . .” And go on not to describe the facts in detail, but just to permit the judge to think: “Oh, right! The breach of real estate contract case!”

Give your listener a chance.

You’re working on one thing at a time.

Your listener may be worrying about hundreds or thousands of things at a time.

Don’t assume that your listener remembers anything about your issue. So give the listener a hint what you’re talking about. That can’t hurt (so long as the hint is brief), and it could win you a motion or friends in high places.

# Younger Lawyers: Tell Us About Your Career Goals
## Career goals today are more individualized and self-defined. Tell us about it.

Once upon a time, not so long ago, the “career path” for newly minted lawyers entering a large law firm practice was fairly well-defined. Put your nose to the grindstone for a set period of years, absorb as much legal know-how and build as strong a network as you can. Eventually, get tapped for partnership and you’re set for life. In the alternative, perhaps you might transition over to the legal department of one of the firm’s clients. In any event, such was the extent of most people’s career goals as they entered Biglaw.

Today, the longstanding social compact between firms and incoming associates has largely withered away. Today, we are all more mercenary and the number of possible career paths is nearly as varied as the number of careerists. Of course, the brass ring of partnership is still the goal for a select few, but for most, career goals are more individualized and self-defined.

In partnership with our friends at [Major Lindsey & Africa](https://www.mlaglobal.com/), we wanted to dig deeper into the dynamics of this apparent cultural change in law firms. We are running a series of (very brief) surveys designed to capture the perspective of lawyers in various stages of their careers. What differentiates them from both their generational peers and their older colleagues? Today’s survey (the second of four) concerns “[Goals](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eIZoQTAhgmDDcXj).” Please take a couple of minutes and [share your thoughts here](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eIZoQTAhgmDDcXj). (Please note we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take [the survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eIZoQTAhgmDDcXj).)

If you have not taken the first survey in our series, “[Priorities](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_4OzUN8zptWf6EQd),” please feel free to do so here.

Drinks are on your buddies from Cleary tonight (or [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-cravath-announces-its-2017-associate-bonuses/) or [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-first-cravath-match-is-here/) or [Paul, Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-the-next-big-player-makes-their-move/) or [STB](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/biglaw-firm-matches-cravath-but-are-they-cutting-associate-compensation-while-no-ones-looking/) or [Debevoise](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/associate-bonus-watch-candy-is-dandy-but-bonuses-are-better/)). While you wait around to find out if your firm is going to match the industry standard announced yesterday by Cravath, the good folks at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton have just made their move.

This doesn’t come as a tremendous shock, of course. The first six firms to announce their 2017 bonus structure were the first to[ announce in 2016](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/associate-compensation-scorecard-which-firms-have-announced-bonuses/) as well. It may not be collusion by the legal definition, but a definite pattern of behavior has been established.

For those that need a refresher, the Biglaw gold standard is as follows:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Class of 2017 — $15,000 (pro-rated)
Class of 2016 — $15,000
Class of 2015 — $25,000
Class of 2014 — $50,000
Class of 2013 — $65,000
Class of 2012 — $80,000
Class of 2011 — $90,000
Class of 2010 — $100,000
Class of 2009 — $100,000

Cleary’s memo noted associates in older classes than 2009 would also receive the top of the scale ($100,000) and their bonuses will be paid out on December 22nd.

So far Biglaw Bonus Season has gone… exactly as expected. But that doesn’t mean you have to be happy about it. If you have something to say about the Cleary bonuses [email ](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus)us and let your thoughts be known!

So what about the bonuses everywhere else? Please help us help you when it comes to bonus news at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text (646-820-8477), or tweet ([@ATLblog](https://twitter.com/atlblog)). We always keep our sources anonymous — and that includes our sources for bonus stories. There’s no need to send the memo using your firm email account; your personal email account is fine. Please be sure to include the memo as proof; we like to post complete bonus memos as a service to our readers. You can take a photo of the memo and attach as a picture if you are worried about metadata in a PDF or Word file. Thanks for your help.

If you enter 25 hours or more of billable time on the last day of the month at Goldberg Segalla, I suggest you get your act together before the Golden Scimitar of Revenue Realization cleaves your shiftless associate body in twain.

A senior partner sent an all hands email calling out timekeepers who routinely shove their time into the system at the last second and mess up the monthly close. And while the email is chuckle-worthy in its over-the-top tone, the fact of the matter is…

He’s absolutely right.

Though there’s probably a better way of sorting this out. Let’s break it down:

I am writing this email to all attorneys, paralegals or anyone responsible to assist them with entering billable time charges.

This is the last email that I will send to “All Enterprise” on the topic of entering billable time.

That seems like wishful thinking.

As you are aware, we continue to have a problem with a select group of timekeepers who insist on entering the majority of their time charges on the last day. Almost without fail, this practice has caused Expert Time to crash, directly impacted the members of our IT, Billing, and Finance Teams and caused the firm to delay its month closing process.

On the one hand, this is very much a tech problem. The system shouldn’t be crashing just because a handful of users enter a lot of hours at once. Theoretically — if fancifully — everyone in the firm enters hours every day so if the system can’t handle a lot of users logged in at once it speaks to a much deeper problem.

But it’s true that there are folks relying on lawyers to get time entered on schedule so the firm can go out and get the money it needs to keep paying everyone. Realization is always a sticking point for firms, why contribute to making the problem worse?

Over the past few months, I have urged folks to change their practice habits, to enter their time each week, and not to overload the system on the last day. Unfortunately, my requests over the past few months have been ignored by some and we now have to address the situation directly with those who are putting themselves above above the firm and showing little respect for our community.

This misdiagnoses at least some of the problem. There may well be laziness afoot here and there, but attorneys often blow off entering time because they’re simply too busy. It’s a chore that takes them away from the job they’re supposed to be doing all day.

Preaching more personal responsibility is great and all, but the firm really needs to consider more automation. There are a whole range of products out there leveraging new technology to automate these processes so firms don’t have to rely on hundreds of people doing everything by the book. A study found that a plurality of associates think they [waste upwards of 35 percent of their days on non-billable administrative stuff](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/10/saving-law-firm-billables-begins-with-automation/). Instead of demanding they do non-billable work in a more timely manner, focus on taking as much of it as possible out of their hands entirely.

I have been tracking late time entries for past several months particularly focusing on the timekeepers that are entering more than 25 hours of time on the last day (and usually in the last few hours before the deadline). In many cases these folks are entering 50 or even 100 hours of time on the last day. I will be sending this group a separate email so they know who they are. I am not playing favorites here so if you have regularly entered more than 25 hours of billable time on the last day of the month, you will receive an email.

Speaking of attorneys wasting time on non-billable work, consider that this partner tracked timekeepers for months. Do something so he doesn’t have to keep doing this.

I will receive a report on February 2nd listing all of the timekeepers who entered more than 25 hours of time on February 1st. I will publish this list to the Facilitation Committee and Practice Group Leaders. If you are on the list, I will also reach out to you directly to discuss the situation and will involve Practice Group Leaders and the Facilitation Committee as necessary until we can finally resolve this situation.

I can’t speak to this firm, but in my experience some of the worst timekeepers I’ve encountered ARE practice group leaders.

I cannot tell you how much I really hoped it would not come to this. But I cannot tolerate this situation any further when I know how much it is negatively impacting our community.

Did this need to be an all firm callout? No. But entering time is important and everyone involved needs to do a better job, and that includes the firm taking the steps necessary to build a better process that avoids this problem in the first place.

You know, it was kind of cute when, a week after Cravath kicked this all off, Vedder Price told all its associates to meet for an important announcement and celebratory drinks and then… announced they were [promoting new partners and said nothing about raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/law-firm-fakes-out-its-associates-over-pay-raises/). Sure it was tone deaf and lame to toy with associates like that — and make no mistake, the firm deserved its shaming — but this was all so new that no one really thought about the significance of the boneheaded move.

Though that must have been an amazing party. There are wakes at Southampton estates that involve less cocktail chatter drenched in passive aggression over the fate of fortunes.

But to do the exact same thing after Vedder already publicly took its lumps, that’s just signaling almost superhuman negligence of what’s going on in the NY market or profound disrespect for associates. In either event, it’s something Kasowitz Benson shouldn’t have done… twice.

Yes, according to tipsters, Kasowitz Benson has announced partnership promotions twice since the salary storm began with nary an acknowledgment of associate salaries from the firm. Kasowitz has nine offices, and perhaps there are a lot of sticking points when it comes to raising salaries. Fine. No one would have a problem with that. It’s also perfectly acceptable to announce that the firm isn’t prepared to match Cravath — there’s no shame in being in the second-tier of compensation as long as a firm is upfront about it. But to stay silent while parading in front of associates that a number of their colleagues are about to get life-altering raises is tremendously gauche.

# Early Mover In Biglaw Bonus War Makes Another Announcement

There is a risk associated with being an early mover in the Biglaw bonus game. Because if a competitor comes over the top of your announced bonus number [cough, Davis Polk, cough cough] , well, suddenly you’re offering associates below-market compensation. Not a good look in a tight lateral market.

Fortunately, this is easily rectified by a second bonus announcement. Cadwalader [previously announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/cadwalader-bonus-2021/) year-end bonuses, which included some nice extra cash for high billers. Now the firm has added special bonuses to the mix, bringing them in line with the market bonuses:

* Australian law firm Slater & Gordon, the biggest firm Down Under and the world’s first law firm to be publicly traded, narrowly avoided [going under after a $700 million loss](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/03/a-700-million-loss-puts-a-law-firm-on-the-ropes/) thanks to a deal with its bankers. Beware, stock market bidders, because the firm still remains a “high-risk investment” due to its “uncertainty.” [[Sydney Morning Herald](http://www.smh.com.au/business/legal/slater--gordon-reaches-deal-with-bankers-20160429-goiab8.html)]

* The University of Tulsa John Rogers Hall College of Law is deciding whether or not it should change its name to remove a founder who had ties to the Ku Klux Klan. Law school administrators have already recommended that Rogers’s name be removed, and after some discussion, trustees will vote on the proposal later today.
