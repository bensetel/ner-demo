Taylor Swift (Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage)

Earlier this month, country crossover pop superstar Taylor Swift put on quite the show at a six-day federal trial, where she gave incredibly strong testimony about the radio disc jockey who “grabbed [her] bare ass” during a pre-concert meet-and-greet session in 2013.

David Mueller, the DJ who allegedly groped Swift, lost his job over the incident, and sued her (and her mother and radio promotions director Frank Bell) for $3 million in a suit with claims of interference with contractual obligations and tortious interference with business relations. Swift countersued for assault and battery, asking for a symbolic $1 in damages. Thanks to her incredibly powerful testimony in court, Swift won her case and Mueller’s claims against the singer were dismissed.

Standing behind Swift and guiding her through the litigation process was her lawyer, Venable partner [J. Douglas Baldridge](https://www.venable.com/j-douglas-baldridge/), an unlikely choice to represent one of the most popular recording artists in the world. Although his claim to legal fame resulted from winning complex, bet-the-company, pay-for-delay pharmaceutical cases, Baldridge refers to himself as a “garbage man” because he “[does] a little bit of everything” — and he loves being in court.

He first met Swift in 2014 when she was sued for trademark infringement, and has been by her side ever since. Here’s more from his interview with [Law.com](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202795984407/Taylor-Swifts-Lawyer-Tells-All?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=2&curpage=ALL):

He has nothing but praise for the singer, who he described as one of the most genuine people he has ever met. “She’s a principled person, and I’m not just saying that because she’s my client,” he said. “She has an incredibly low ego for someone so famous. She listens, she’s a very quick study … She contributed to the defense.”

And that’s exactly how the case was won. Baldridge knew how important it was to Swift “to be who she is,” so he encouraged her to be herself on the stand and testify with blunt honesty, which led to brilliant exchanges like this:

One key piece of evidence was a photo snapped at the meet-and-greet where Mueller’s hand, while not actually visible, appears to be suspiciously low on Swift’s backside.

Mueller’s attorney, Gabe McFarland, conceded the photo was “awkward” but said there was nothing visibly inappropriate happening.

Addressing him by first name, Swift on the stand responded, “Gabe, this is a photo of him with his hand up my skirt—with his hand on my ass. You can ask me a million questions—I’m never going to say anything different. I never have said anything different.”

As Baldridge correctly stated in court, “Grabbing a woman’s rear end is an assault, and it’s always wrong. Any woman—rich, poor, famous, or not—is entitled to have that not happen.” Congratulations to both Taylor Swift and J. Douglas Baldridge on winning the case, and forcefully and effectively setting the record straight for celebrities who must litigate sexual assault claims in court.

# How Can Law Firms Meet Needs Of 21st Century Legal Clients?
## Change is upon us and it’s time for lawyers to seize the day and take advantage of the unique opportunities presented by technology.

I just left [a presentation](https://www.mcba.org/calendar/register/?eventno=5394) at my local bar association focused on the state of the legal market in 2017 and how lawyers can compete. During the seminar, one of the speakers discussed the findings of  [a recent report](http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/solutions/peer-monitor/complimentary-reports) released by Thomson Reuters Legal Executive Institute and Georgetown Law on the state of the legal market in 2017.

After listening to the economic data from the report, I’ve got client service on my mind since one of the main themes gleaned from the report, as explained in [this blog post](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2017/january/2017-report-on-the-state-of-the-legal-market.html), is that in 2017, “the changing market dynamics present opportunities for firms that are willing to challenge conventional thinking, take risks and innovate new approaches to the delivery of legal services.”

A lot has changed since I graduated from law school in 1995. One of the primary drivers of change has been the rapid advancement of technology, which has affected every aspect of our day-to-day lives, from how we communicate and interact with others, to how we shop, cook, travel, and conduct business.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Technology has affected all aspects of our culture, including consumer expectations and the way that business is conducted. Because of the mobile and cloud revolutions, we now have instantaneous access to information, resulting in consumers who are more knowledgeable, more selective, and more demanding. Online payments are now the norm and consumers have come to expect more for their money, fast response times, and quick answers.

Rest assured that when “consumers” suddenly encounter legal problems and thus become “legal consumers,” their expectations do not suddenly change. Instead, 21st century legal consumers expect just as much from their attorneys as they do from other non-legal service providers.

This sudden shift in expectations has dramatically increased competition in the legal services space and has had an astounding effect on the delivery of legal services. For evidence of this, you need look no further than the huge success of LegalZoom, Rocket Lawyer, and similar services.

And yet, according to [a recent study](http://www.altmanweil.com/LFiT2017/) conducted by Altman Weil, many lawyers in larger firms are refusing to change the way that they do business despite finally acknowledging that the legal profession is undergoing an industry-wide paradigm shift in ways never before seen. As explained in the Altman Weil report, when it comes to adapting to change and meeting client demands by increasing efficiencies in the delivery of legal services, most firms are all talk, with little action:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Ninety-four percent of respondent’s in this year’s survey said that a focus on improving efficiency will be a permanent trend going forward. But only 49% of law firms said that they have significantly changed their approach to the efficiency of legal service delivery. This represents a frightening disconnect.”

Why the disconnect? It’s because change doesn’t come easy. Even so, overwhelming evidence indicates that in 2017, it’s necessary.

The lesson to be learned is that in order to stay competitive, lawyers must pay attention to the legal marketplace and the needs of 21st century legal consumers. Change is upon us and it’s time for lawyers to seize the day and take advantage of the unique opportunities presented by this shift. Innovate in the delivery of legal services and meet consumer demands by implementing new ways of serving the needs of your firm’s legal clients, whether it’s using alternative fee arrangements, [securely collaborating and communicating online](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/new-aba-email-guidelines-how-can-lawyers-comply/), sharing documents and case-related information in a client portal, or accepting online payments.

In other words, although technology is undoubtedly one of the biggest drivers of change — it’s also the solution. The innovative use of technology can drive down overhead and increase efficiency for law firms big and small.

Embracing technology not only helps lawyers to meet the demands of their clients, it allows them to thrive in an increasingly competitive legal marketplace. By wisely and selectively using technology, law firms can more efficiently provide legal services to their clients. Reducing redundancies and implementing workflows that streamline processes can reduce the costs associated with running a law firm, and simultaneously increase profits.

And that’s the lesson to be learned: chart your law firm’s path based on client feedback and current trends in the legal landscape. Buck tradition and run your law firm with an eye toward the future, not the past. Your firm’s bottom line — and your clients — will thank you.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Asia Becomes Ground Zero In Big 4 Effort To Take Over The Legal Market
## What's going on in Asia could be a roadmap for the future of legal services.

As the gap between the haves and the “have-not-nearly-as-muches” continues to grow in the American legal landscape, the global outlook for law firms turns dim as mid-tier international players, and for that matter the elite players, come to grips with the threat posed by the Big 4 accounting firms rolling into the legal market and pushing out the competition. Nowhere is this threat more palpable than in Asia, where the Big 4 are making their most aggressive push, leveraging client connections on the auditing side to drive complementary work to their growing legal services wings. And it’s only a matter of time before they come for the rest of the world.

In a [report for International](https://www.law.com/2018/08/03/law-firms-uneasy-as-the-big-four-make-their-big-push-in-asia/), John Kang and Anna Zhang check in on the Big 4’s expanding legal foothold in Asia and the ominous advantages the accounting firms bring to the table. Back in February, [we flagged Asia as the market to watch for this trend](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/02/twilight-of-the-law-firms-the-big-4-are-poised-to-conquer-the-legal-landscape/), with the Big 4 keying in on its preexisting client relationships in these booming markets as a prime entry point for global legal dominance. The accounting firms have more resources — roughly 10 times more revenue than the biggest global law firms — and strong brand recognition among the Asian companies that will, eventually, want a partner to counsel them on moving into other markets.

But, as the International piece points out, there are some Biglaw attorneys who see some dirty pool at play:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“There are serious questions of fair competition and ethics when the Big Four audit most of the Am Law 200 law firms and then directly compete against us for client engagements,” said David Tang, Asia managing partner for K&L Gates.

“They know our finances and our financial arrangements with clients; they then compete directly for the same engagements with the same clients and compete on fees, knowing what we have done,” Tang said. “Law firms are used to competing in the market, but not when the new entrants are competing unfairly.”

A more cynical person might point out here that this is what you get when you allow a market to shrink to a global oligopoly, but there’s no use crying over spilled milk when you could write it off. But lawyers and lobbyists around the world have done their part to keep the Big 4 free of the sort of regulatory scrutiny that could bring back some needed competition and now they’re getting beaten back by behemoths of their own making.

At least at this point, the Big 4 don’t seem interested in fully supplanting the Biglaw firms:

Stefanie Yuen Thio, joint managing partner of Singapore-based TSMP Law Corp., said the Big Four’s legal offering is often an add-on to their accounting and tax work. “It is to defend their client base and prevent work from leaking to other firms,” she said. “They are not planning to be the very best law firms. They want to be the most seamless accounting firm.”

KPMG’s Wolfers said its planned law firms do not seek to be full service. “We’re a specialist firm in the areas that are directly complementary with KPMG’s businesses and services.”

That should make some litigators happy. But how does a full-service Biglaw firm compete when it’s getting outmuscled on highly profitable transactional work. It’s all well and good to stay out of certain practices, but if the practices they choose to enter wind up undermining the Biglaw financial model as a whole, it’s no better.

For now, Biglaw firms seem content to lean on the fact that the Big 4 can’t practice law in the United States. Can lawyers really rely on that in the long-term? In 10 years, when PwC represents a gaggle of China’s richest countries seeking to acquire American companies, will the gatekeepers of American law still be willing to shut them out?

This is phenomenal news. Putting race and gender aside, Tiffany [Cunningham] is a fantastic lawyer and will be an excellent addition to this bench given her trial litigation experience and her commitment to the rule of law. As a Black female trial lawyer, it is nice to see another glass ceiling cracked knowing that it took nearly 40 years to do so.

— Jeanne Gills, an intellectual property partner at Foley & Lardner, commenting on the [recent confirmation](https://www.law.com/2021/07/19/confirmed-cunningham-will-be-federal-circuits-first-black-judge/) of [Tiffany Cunningham](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/professionals/tiffany-p-cunningham.html), a Perkins Coie partner, to the Federal Circuit. She will be the first African American judge in the court’s 39-year history.

# Last Year Was Great And All, But Biglaw's Second Hundred Better Not Get Used To It
## Industry experts are preaching caution.

The Biglaw ranking-fest that is the Am Law 200 is [out today](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/24/the-2022-am-law-200-ranked-by-gross-revenue/). While the [top 100 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/all-the-billion-dollar-biglaw-firms-a-look-at-the-am-law-100/) were previously released, today’s spotlight is on the second hundred firms — that is, those ranked 101 to 200.

Let’s start with the good news — because there’s a lot positive in the numbers.  Overall gross revenue for the second hundred is up 9.1 percent as is headcount, up 1.3 percent. Other health indicators had a strong performance last year, with revenue per lawyer up (7.7 percent), and profits per equity partner is up too (11.8 percent).

But as ALM [reports](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/05/24/the-am-law-200-excelled-but-their-future-hinges-on-how-they-use-profits/), there are cracks to be seen:

The industry continues to consolidate as the Am Law 100 distances itself from the Second Hundred. The gap between the largest Am Law 200 firm and the smallest is also increasing. Economies of scale will become more important as costs continue to rise, such as increased marketing expenses, sustained salary increases for associates and staff, and rising demands by clients for law firms of all sizes to maintain cutting-edge cybersecurity and data infrastructure.

And when the crunch is on, well, expect to see partners who feel like they aren’t getting what they deserve hit that lateral market:

“We will certainly see some disgruntled partners and an increased level of movement from firms,” says law firm consultant Marcie Borgal Shunk, president and founder of The Tilt Institute. “This isn’t going to be a blanket scenario where all firms are hit equally. The firms that didn’t cut expenses down to the bone, who used the extra capital to invest rather than distribute to partners, will be better-positioned coming out of this high-flying market than the firms that chose to give all of the money to their partners.”

But just because that’s future Biglaw’s problem doesn’t mean some fissures aren’t showing. Like stratification — which is getting worse. The revenue gap between the firms ranked 101 and 200 grew to $299 million, up from $261 million the year before.

So which firms are the big winners? The firms with the greatest increase in revenue last year are: FisherBroyles; Pryor Cashman; Foley Hoag; Spencer Fane; and Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff.

And when there are winners, there are losers. While most firms saw an increase in revenue, that was not universally true. Though there are at least some explanations as to why these firms struggled:

Among the handful of firms that saw their revenue decline in 2021, the bottom five were mostly focused on litigation and other countercyclical work. High-end litigation shops like Robins Kaplan and Boies Schiller Flexner led the losses, shedding lawyers and dropping revenue by 10% and 8%, respectively.

Eckert Seamans Cherin & Mellott also struggled, shrinking its revenue by 6.6%. Sources told The American Lawyer affiliate The Legal Intelligencer that the firm had struggled to institutionalize corporate relationships. Kobre & Kim, a firm that prides itself on litigating adverse to banks, was down 3.4% on revenue. Lathrop GPM, a more balanced firm that grew substantially in a January 2020 merger, lost 4.8% of its lawyers and 14.8% of its equity tier in 2021, leading to a 2.4% decline in revenue.

Overall, it is hard to be concerned in the face of strong numbers like what we saw in 2021. But caution? [That’s certainly warranted.](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/biglaw-business-is-booming-obviously-its-time-to-talk-about-layoffs/)

# Am Law Top 50 Firm Cuts Partner Compensation In Half Over COVID-19 Concerns
## Partners at this firm are doing what they can to save salaries and jobs for associates and staff.

The economic upheaval that’s been caused by the novel coronavirus continues to leave its mark on Biglaw. We reported earlier on the high likelihood that more and more Biglaw partners would be forced to cut their draws and distributions in the coming months. Specifically, law firm management consultant Patrick McKenna said he’d be surprised if [at least 80 percent of the top 200 firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/04/more-biglaw-firms-to-cut-partner-draws-before-resorting-to-layoffs-furloughs/) in the country hadn’t made such a move by the middle of April, noting that “a typical reduction is in the range of 30 percent.”

Today, we have news on yet another law firm where partners are feeling the pinch.

Winston & Strawn, a firm ranked within the Top 50 in both the Am Law 100 and Vault 100, recently made a move on its partner pay. Numerous sources tell us that the firm held a town hall meeting yesterday afternoon where it was announced that partners would be taking a 50 percent reduction in their distributions for the next three months. At last check, [profit per partner](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=333&name=Winston-%26-Strawn-LLP) at the firm was $2,162,000. At the moment, no changes have been made to associate or senior staff compensation, but one observer said “the message was very clear that compensation is a large cost and so they are continuing to evaluate the issue.”

We reached out to Winston & Strawn for a statement on the changes to its partners’ compensation in light of the coronavirus but the firm declined to comment.

Let’s hope that the partner’s proactive measures can save associates and staff members from coming up short when it comes to their own salaries.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

Does the concept of associates sleeping at their desk to meet deadlines seem strange to you? Well, maybe it should. Mega Australian law firm King & Wood Mallesons is under investigation for overworking their attorneys, who are allegedly being subjected to grueling conditions.

In a first for Australian law firms, the occupational health and safety regulator, WorkSafe Victoria, sent King & Wood Mallesons a notice for improvement based on the working conditions for attorneys at the firm. As Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/2018/10/15/king-wood-mallesons-under-investigation-for-overworking-lawyers-in-australia/), a public inquiry into misconduct in the financial sector has led to an increased workload for the firm:

The high volume of work has led junior lawyers at King & Wood Mallesons’ Melbourne office to be subject to grueling work conditions, with some employees sleeping in the office so they could deal with tight deadlines and the huge volume of work, according to claims cited by the[ Australian Financial Review](https://www.afr.com/business/king--wood-mallesons-investigated-for-overworking-employees-20181010-h16hei). The firm has until mid-November to respond to the WorkSafe investigations.

The firm’s chief executive, Berkeley Cox, said the firm is staffing up, creating a shift schedule and getting additional work from paralegals and clerks. Additionally, King & Wood Mallesons is reviewing their procedures to ensure the health and safety of their employees:

After receiving the WorkSafe notice, Cox said the firm is “undertaking a comprehensive review of what else we can do to better identify and prevent high-pressure situations for our people … [and] ensure our people are supported and are given regular and proper opportunities to rest and recover.”

Though the investigation is firm-specific, Michael Tooma, Australia managing partner of Clyde & Co., said it’s a wake-up call for the entire legal industry:

“This is a wake-up call for the legal industry that we need to tackle this head-on,” Tooma said. “It’s a significant development. There will be potentially a precedent created for others.”

Magic Circle firm Linklaters has announced to U.S. associates that they’ll be seeing salary bumps and special summer bonuses just like the rest of their Biglaw peers. The firm sent out an email letting associates know that market raises and bonuses were on the way, though they opted not to reveal a specific scale.

The firm has decided to communicate the specifics of the salary increases and bonus amounts directly to associates. Most folks haven’t yet received their new salary info from the powers that be, but they expect a full match. And bonuses will be given to all associates in good standing, with no specific hours requirement attached.


Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Raises%20Salaries) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Raises Salaries”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Beginning The Biglaw Lateral Process: A Guide For Associates
## The current Biglaw lateral market is overwhelming. Consider these factors, and a quality recruiter will view each as an opportunity to maximize the likelihood of attractive offers.

The current Biglaw lateral market is overwhelming.  There are more variables influencing associates’ career planning and strategic decisionmaking than ever before.  A byproduct is that getting started on a lateral search can be intimidating.  My goal here is to advise you on how to take the first few steps, because the way in which you target and contact firms can hugely influence your ability to make a change.  Below is a list of factors I encourage you to consider, and a quality recruiter will view each as an opportunity to maximize the likelihood of attractive offers.

Timing

Take advantage of active markets like this one to at least do your diligence.  It’s frustrating when you’d like to talk to a firm and they’re simply not hiring or unable to give you the kind of attractive offer you’d need to make the jump.  Also realize that offers have expiration dates and if you receive an offer from firm X, but wish you were able to talk to firm Y, it may be too late.  Do what you can up front to minimize the risk that timing negatively influences your options.

Who reaches out on your behalf

The best way to maximize options and ensure a successful process is by choosing a recruiter you trust and then leveraging contacts at other firms after your recruiter connects directly with each firm.  Yes, this will take away a friend’s referral bonus, but a good recruiter can effectively manage a comprehensive and targeted search, bump your resume to the top of a pile, and negotiate terms in a way that friends simply can’t.  When evaluating recruiters, pick someone who is an expert with respect to the space in which you operate so that they appreciate your practice and what could make it better in both a micro and macro sense.

Which firms you target

This alone depends on a ton of factors and personal preference, but it’s worth taking the time up front to think about what elements of your current practice you want to maintain and where there is room for improvement.  Your recruiter should discuss this with you and in turn provide insight into which platforms will check certain boxes on paper (e.g., bonuses, remote flex, substantive pivot, change in location, elevation of title, etc.).  Cultural fit is crucial, but it’s impossible to get a true sense for the people and environment before starting the dialogue.

Whom your recruiter contacts

Most firms have generic submission emails and/or online portals.  A quality recruiter should have personal contacts at the firms you’re interested in and the ability to sidestep the normal process to make sure your materials get in front of the right people as opposed to lost in the ether.

Marketing

Success in the recruiting process largely depends on your ability to package and relay a clear and authentic narrative that aligns with what other firms are looking for.  If your materials and initial outreach don’t reflect that approach, you risk squandering opportunities.  Be thoughtful about what differentiates you from other candidates even if it’s not directly related to your practice.  Things like entrepreneurship, interesting work experience, and excelling at a sport or other activity can help endear you to partners.

Mental state

Take the process one step at a time.  Making a move is a big deal and you can’t understate the importance of doing so thoughtfully, but it’s important to think of interviews as casual conversations that allow you to explore fit and value.  A Zoom call costs nothing and having an open mind is the only way to truly evaluate the opportunity in front of you.  At the outset of the process, be open to introductions and save the real decisionmaking for when an offer is sitting in front of you.

# Is This Why Some Women Lawyers Have Drinking Problems?

Most women don’t complain. Only about 8 to 10 percent of women [who’ve experienced harassment] file a complaint. They see what happens to other people who do; they’re cut off socially and professionally. What pushes people to complain is that they think the situation is so bad that they have nothing to lose. Most will quit or ask to be transferred. Or they’ll drink a lot.

— Professor [Joanna Grossman](http://www.law.smu.edu/professor-profiles/grossman) of Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, commenting on why so few [female attorneys who have experienced sexual harassment at law firms](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202792705157/Sexual-Harassment-Is-Thriving-in-Big-Law?mcode=1202615731542&curindex=1&curpage=ALL) file complaints, in an all-encompassing interview with [Vivia Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivia-chen-b0a9412/) of The Careerist.

Tick, tock, tick, tock. Do you hear that sound, associates? All throughout Biglaw, it’s now bonus o’clock. You can expect your own firm’s bonus announcement to come any time now, but for the moment, the spotlight is on one of the highest-ranked Biglaw firms in the country.

Simpson Thacher & Barlett — a firm that brought in $1,844,627,000 gross revenue in 2020, placed it at No. 14 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking —  announced year-end bonuses a short time ago, and, of course, it’s a match.

Class of 2020	$20,000	$4,000
Class of 2019	$30,000	$6,000
Class of 2018	$57,500	$11,500

# The Biggest Biglaw Firms With The Most Women Lawyers (2022)
## An important ranking to show which firms are helping women achieve successful careers in the law.

Yesterday, thanks to the recently released National Law Journal 500 ranking, we found out which U.S.-centric Biglaw firms were the biggest of them all in terms of headcount. As a companion piece to the NLJ 500, we’ll now delve into the NLJ Women’s Scorecard, a ranking of the percentage of female attorneys and percentage of female partners at the largest 350 firms in the country.

For the purposes of this ranking, equity and nonequity partners were counted as partners, while nonpartner or “other” figures include special counsel, of counsel, and staff attorneys. Temporary and contract attorneys aren’t included in the count. For a tie, the higher rank is awarded to the firm with more female equity partners.

As noted by the [National Law Journal](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2022/06/21/the-nlj-500-our-2022-survey-of-the-nations-largest-law-firms/), women thrived at law firms in 2021:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Pandemic aside, 2021 was a boom year for the legal industry, and that played out in the form of talent wars just as much as it resulted in increased profits. While head count remained relatively steady toward the top of the NLJ 500, career mobility continued to be highly dynamic across partner and associate ranks. In the end, overall head count at NLJ 500 firms rose modestly by 1.8% compared with the previous year. …

And there are other positive trends, as our Women Scorecard and LGBTQ Scorecard show: diverse representation at NLJ 500 firms continues to rise, with female lawyers more frequently taking a front-row seat across law firm ranks and diverse attorneys more often making partner or moving into leadership roles.

Without further ado, here is the NLJ Women’s Scorecard Top 10 for 2022:

- Berry Appleman & Leiden
- Fragomen
- Kubicki Draper
- Kaufman Borgeest & Ryan
- Littler Mendelson
- Manning Gross + Massenburg
- Hanson Bridgett
- Cole Scott & Kissane
- Wood Smith Henning & Berman
- Constangy Brooks Smith & Prophete
You may be wondering where the largest, namebrand Biglaw firms appear on this list. While the majority of the top 30 firms on the scorecard have a headcount of about 300 or less, there were some exceptions, with Fragomen, Littler, Jackson Lewis, Ogletree, Norton Rose Fulbright, Davis Wright Tremaine, Ropes & Gray, Gordon Rees, and Baker McKenzie all making an appearance in the top 30.

President Donald Trump (by Ali Shaker/VOA)

As any pollster or Super Bowl broadcaster could tell you these days, [predictions](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/predictions/) are dangerous business. Identifying the practice groups that are going to benefit most from the new administration in D.C., then, is a tall task indeed. The only thing I’m certain of myself is that uncertainty tends to create business for lawyers, and the new administration has, and will, introduce a lot of uncertainty for clients of major law firms.

Picking the brains of a few [subject-matter experts at Bloomberg Law](https://www.bna.com/2017-outlook) helped in honing my predictions about which practice areas might pick up the most over the next four years. I’ve identified some of my key consultants below, so that they may serve as scapegoats if any of my predictions go awry.

Winning Practice Groups

Labor & Employment

The new administration is in the process of taking action to reverse key policies of the Obama Administration, in turn creating compliance questions for employers. Already, the administration has frozen several regulations in the labor and employment law space, including the Labor Department’s overtime rule and a regulation requiring employers to provide information on union-busting “persuader” activities. Victoria Roberts, Bloomberg Law’s Vice President and General Manager for Labor & Employment, tells me that management-side attorneys can also expect plenty of calls from employers making use of immigrant labor; they likely will face increased enforcement in the form of more rigorous I-9 employment verifications and even, potentially, workplace raids. Not to mention all the work being created by the administration’s recent attempts to temporarily suspend immigration from a number of countries. And as the administration takes steps to ease federal compliance requirements on employers, states and municipalities may jump into the fray, creating a pop in labor and employment legislative activity and need for counsel on developments on the state and local level.

Counsel for health insurers, hospitals and health systems, and drug companies will have their hands full tracking the Republicans’ effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. Scott Falk, Bloomberg Law’s Vice President and General Manager of Health and Litigation, believes hospitals will be particularly concerned about any attempt to reverse the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid. If they occur, cuts to Medicaid and Medicare will place financial pressure on industry participants, further fueling consolidation and joint ventures between industry participants, such as medical service providers and payers. That has many analysts picking healthcare M&A as a hot area in 2017. Additionally, healthcare regulatory and compliance counsel will be busy as ever answering questions due to the ongoing policy uncertainty created by a new head of HHS and changing regulatory enforcement priorities.

Project Finance

Based on campaign promises and its actions thus far, the administration is highly likely to drive an uptick in construction and building, ranging from large infrastructure projects and improvements to a wall being built along the Mexican border. Reportedly, the administration has assembled a list of 50 projects requiring $137 billion in investment. With half of the projects to be privately funded [according to a McClatchy report](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article128492164.html), that’s enough work to keep project finance and infrastructure attorneys occupied for quite a while.

Privacy and Data Protection

This is an area that simply has too much activity, and too many open questions, to be anything but hot over the next four (or maybe forty) years. On the basis of my discussions with Alex Butler, Bloomberg Law’s Vice President and General Manager of Privacy & Data Security, some of the key issues that privacy lawyers are grappling with include: the EU’s sweeping General Data Protection Regulations, which go into effect in May 2018; the potential fallout from litigation challenging the FTC’s authority to regulate in the data security area; the potential for privacy and data protection enforcement to supplement trade negotiations; and, until clarity comes from the Supreme Court, murkiness over the threshold standard for bringing class actions over data breaches. And that’s before the new administration even lifts a finger.

M&A/Transactional

A number of factors should fuel an increase in M&A and transactional activity. The administration is encouraging companies to bring cash that they have stockpiled overseas back to the United States. Large technology companies and others are likely to respond by using some of that capital for buybacks, dividends, and M&A deals. Other key drivers are the strong equity markets and what feels like a more flexible and less strict approach to regulatory enforcement, particularly antitrust. That said, rising multiples and rising interest rates could create some friction slowing down volume of deals.

While I feel confident that the practice areas mentioned above will experience strong growth over the next few years, the reality is that given the uncertainty now prevailing in Washington, it’s hard to imagine any informed lawyer not being in high demand. A big challenge for firms is given how many strong lawyers there are out there, how can they differentiate their practices in these areas to bring in a disproportionate amount of the available engagements? Here’s one idea that is a bit of a teaser for my next column: the daily media flare ups and tweetapalooza coming from the White House should provide significant opportunities for lawyers to establish themselves as go-to experts in their relevant areas by being quoted in earned media. Firms that are nimble and engage in “newsjacking” activities will be well positioned to set themselves apart and ultimately drive more business.

# Sidley Associate's Journey To Become A Chess Master
## First-year associate has goals beyond Biglaw.

You might think being a first year associate at a major Biglaw firm like Sidley Austin would be more than enough to keep someone busy. But Rochelle Ballantyne has bigger plans. The NYU Law grad is currently ranked by the U.S. Chess Federation as an expert, but she has her sights set on the master rank.

As Ballantyne [told](https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/checkmate-big-firm-associate-seeks-chess-master-status) the ABA Journal, the world of Biglaw litigation and competitive chess aren’t as different as you may think.

“Chess is a combative sport, and so is litigation,” Ballantyne says. “There’s a winner and a loser, and I like to win.”

Since she was a child, Ballantyne competed in chess tournaments throughout the country, and on a few occasions, she competed abroad—learning skills that she says help her in her legal career.

“In chess, you have to have the ability to think steps ahead of your opponent,” Ballantyne says. “As a litigator, you are not just thinking about the opposing argument but the arguments and responses that come after that. You have to be able to anticipate what’s going to happen far ahead.”

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This isn’t the first time Ballantyne has garnered attention for her chess exploits — she appeared in the 2012 documentary [Brooklyn Castle](https://brooklyncastle.com/) about the chess program at I.S. 318.

“My junior high school team was really good, one of the best in the nation,” says Ballantyne, who attributes in part her academic success to the experiences that she had playing chess.

If she achieves her goal of master rank, she’ll be the first Black woman to do so.

“My achieving this goal would I hope show Black girls that someone who looks likes like them can achieve in male-dominated sports like chess,” says Ballantyne, who is on the board of directors of the Gift of Chess. The organization focuses on donating 1 million chess sets globally by 2030 to make the game accessible and affordable worldwide.

“I’m proud to be part of this organization because I know how much chess has meant to me, and I want to share that with more people that look like me and come from my background,” Ballantyne says.

# I Did Not Have Mississippi Creating Whites-Only Courts On My Black History Month Bingo Card

The thing about representative democracy is that it is supposed to be… you know… representative. Mississippi, through processes like gerrymandering, has gone out of of its way to make the democratic process look more like white people appointing other white people. Now, they’ve decided to just skip the foreplay of Black agency not only in voting, but in the legal system too. From Mississippi Today:

Mississippi’s capital city is 80% Black and home to a higher percentage of Black residents than any major American city. Mississippi’s Legislature is thoroughly controlled by white Republicans, who have redrawn districts over the past 30 years to ensure they can pass any bill without a single Democratic vote. Every legislative Republican is white, and most Democrats are Black.

A white supermajority of the Mississippi House voted after an intense, four-plus hour debate to create a separate court system and an expanded police force within the city of Jackson — the Blackest city in America — that would be appointed completely by white state officials.

Usually there is some silver lining after something like this gets dropped — you know, the traditional good/bad/good sandwiching we’ve all come to know and love when receiving anti-democratic news. Not this time. It just gets worse.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
If [House Bill 1020](http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2023/pdf/history/HB/HB1020.xml) becomes law later this session, the white chief justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court would appoint two judges to oversee a new district within the city — one that includes all of the city’s majority-white neighborhoods, among other areas. The white state attorney general would appoint four prosecutors, a court clerk, and four public defenders for the new district. The white state public safety commissioner would oversee an expanded Capitol Police force, run currently by a white chief.

The appointments by state officials would occur in lieu of judges and prosecutors being elected by the local residents of Jackson and Hinds County — as is the case in every other municipality and county in the state.

That is a very heavy “if.” To any prospective jurisprudence professors writing a book on how democratic practices can give rise to anti-democratic ends, this is an easy chapter. To everyone else who cares about democracy, you should also be very interested in how this plays out. With the Supreme Court [giving radio silence after South Carolina’s functional exclusion of Black voters](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/01/if-you-had-the-supreme-court-supporting-fair-and-non-discriminatory-elections-as-a-wish-this-year-i-have-bad-news/), I do not have high hopes that SCOTUS will be willing to offer any help if House Bill 1020 passes.

The short of it is that the Mississippi House of Representatives is going out of its way to put the “history” back in Black History Month:

For most of the debate, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba — who has been publicly chided by the white Republicans who lead the Legislature — looked down on the House chamber from the gallery. Lumumba accused the Legislature [earlier this year](https://mississippitoday.org/2023/01/30/lumumba-likens-legislation-aimed-at-jackson-to-apartheid/) of practicing “plantation politics” in terms of its treatment of Jackson, and of the bill that passed Tuesday, he said: “It reminds me of apartheid.”

Rep. Blackmon, a civil rights leader who has a decades-long history of championing voting issues, equated the current legislation to the Jim Crow-era 1890 Constitution that was written to strip voting rights from Black Mississippians.

“This is just like the 1890 Constitution all over again,” Blackmon said from the floor. “We are doing exactly what they said they were doing back then: ‘Helping those people because they can’t govern themselves.’”

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Let’s also take the time to not just get bogged down in what a horrible intervention to the democratic process it would be. House Bill 1020 would also double down on the policing of these vote-voided communities:

Opponents of the legislation, dozens of whom have protested at the Capitol several days this year, accused the authors of carving out mostly white, affluent areas of the city to be put in the new district.

The bill would double the funding for the district to $20 million in order to increase the size of the [existing Capitol Police force](https://mississippitoday.org/2021/07/14/tate-reeves-state-officers-fight-jackson-crime/), which has received broad criticism from Jacksonians for shooting several people in recent months with little accountability.

The new court system laid out in House Bill 1020 is estimated to cost $1.6 million annually.

I really hope that this doesn’t pass — best believe this will be adopted in other states if it does. My money will be that it will start slow in other former members of the Confederacy like Arkansas and Georgia, and from then on, who knows? I’d say get out there and vote but that clearly isn’t efficacious at the moment. Thoughts and prayers? May God help us all.

🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨 After nearly 5 hours of debating House Bill 1020 passes. “I was surprised they came half dressed, because they forgot to wear their hoods.” Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba reacts to the bill applauding those who fought for it to die, and those who didn’t.

# Why Haven't More Biglaw Firms Announced Raises?

It’s starting to feel like crickets out here. When [Milbank raised associate salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) last month, we pretty much expected the matches to come fast and furious. Especially since it [wasn’t totally shocking](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/these-biglaw-salary-raises-were-inevitable-so-when-will-the-first-firm-match/) that raises were in the offing. But now, [weeks later](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/time-to-pay-up-these-am-law-top-50-firms-havent-announced-raises-yet/), the [bulk of the market has not matched](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/). And it’s not like the lateral market has suddenly slowed down. So. What gives?

A few big firms have told associates to[ sit tight as they monitor](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/norton-rose-no-match/) exactly where the market settles. Because that’s the big X factor. How will the other market leaders — namely Cravath and Davis Polk — react to Milbank? Both[ Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) and [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/davis-polk-salary-21/) have a history of raining on Milbank’s compensation leadership, coming over the top.

So perhaps there will be another round of re-raising in store for 2022. But maybe it’s more than that.

We’ve talked about the stratification of the industry before. Sure the top of the Am Law 100 can likely afford these raises, but Biglaw is a lot bigger than that. Plus, while these are only rumors… Above the Law hears some firms — big names, too — are gaming the system to avoid paying full classes of associates this new market salary. Not that this is the first time we heard reports of [firms docking attorneys back whole class years on pay](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/02/stealth-layoffs-and-shortchanging-associates/).

In the meanwhile, we’ll wait and see.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
I’m sharing an email I recently received from a senior associate at a Biglaw firm. This individual encouraged me to publish it, in the hope of starting a conversation, but asked to remain anonymous.

What do you think? Is this person an insightful truth-teller, or an entitled whiner? Please sound off, in the comments.

And if you have some thoughts of your own on a current topic that you’d like me to consider for Notice and Comment fodder in the future, please email me: davidlat@substack.com. Thanks!

FROM AN ASSOCIATE AT AN AM LAW 100 FIRM:

Ode to the Biglaw life. Been in the grind for seven to ten years at a top firm in a big city, after graduating from a T14 law school. Sound familiar? There’s a lot of us out here — although based on LinkedIn, it seems there are fewer of us by the day.

I’m sure you also see the status updates of former classmates who just jumped to in-house positions at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or some cool-looking fund named after some obscure Greek god. Surely these people have much better gigs than we do — they have escaped!

And here we are, continuing to slosh through the Biglaw mud. Maybe it’s the job security. Maybe it’s the golden handcuffs of knowing that as bad as it gets, we’ll get some money thrown our way at the end of the year, which will put us at ease for a few months until the cycle begins again. Those of us who have stuck it out in Biglaw are likely more risk-averse than those who left, or perhaps we really think that the Biglaw lifestyle is ideal for us and our families.

But speaking of that lifestyle, does it make any sense to always be checking emails? To always be working, ready to dart out of a Saturday morning Costco shopping outing with our kids in order to join some call that certainly could have waited until Monday morning? Surely our buddies at those in-house gigs also work hard, but they somehow seem to exist in an environment that respects personal time. (I’m sure this falls into the “grass is always greener” fallacy, but so be it, I’m just sharing how so many of us feel.)

Now, don’t get me wrong. We Biglaw veterans are lucky in many ways. We came of age professionally in the post-recession age, we were lucky enough to land summer associate positions, and we didn’t have to survive mass associate purges to keep our jobs. We make good money. We kept our jobs in COVID — and many of us earned even more during COVID, thanks to [special bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/special-bonus-tracker-2021/?rf=1), while our expenses went down. So we should just shut up, keep our heads down, and enjoy our gigs, right?

These are all fair points, and ones that I try to keep in mind when the grind gets me down. But still, is our existence normal? I’ll never forget when I took the train to the city and sat next to a well-known CEO of a startup. He noted how rigid and antiquated the law firm system is, and his words have stuck with me over the years. Getting an email from a partner at 10:30 p.m. on a Friday, ordering me to handle an insignificant task that the partner knew about literally two weeks earlier — is this normal? Is this how you treat anyone else in your personal or professional lives?

Perhaps the time has come for law firms and their leaders to sit down and realize that the world isn’t going to end if associates are treated with respect and their personal lives are valued as well. This doesn’t seem like too much to ask, and it’s surely a conversation worth having. I don’t need another Zoom webinar about work-life balance. I just need partners and other senior attorneys to treat us as you would like to be treated.

The world won’t end if certain tasks are handled during the business day as opposed to after hours. If we’re at a Mets game on a beautiful summer evening, surely we shouldn’t have to check our email literally every five minutes, forever dreading an email from a partner that will instantaneously turn over our evening. How about we act like normal people and tell the partner in advance where we’re going and, of course, we’ll be jumping back in when we get back home?

Because we always jump back in — that’s how we’ve made it this far. Now it’s time to let us, with ease and respect, sometimes jump out for a bit. Life is too short, so let’s remember that as important as we think we are, we’re far from saving anyone’s lives (or even really making people’s lives much better, in the vast majority of cases).

We’re in the service industry to help people make a buck — and that’s fine. So let’s still keep things in perspective and maintain proper order and balance in our lives.

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Law School Students Are Boycotting Gibson Dunn
## Mandatory arbitration agreements are proving quite controversial.

The pressure is on at Gibson Dunn. The firm finds itself in the middle of a controversy surrounding its use of mandatory arbitration agreements as a condition of employment. Fourteen LGBTQ+ student organizations at 13 different law schools[ have announced](https://www.peoplesparity.org/lgbtqlawstudents/) they will no longer accept money from or otherwise promote firms that have mandatory arbitration agreements. As part of this campaign, they’re targeting Gibson Dunn’s arbitration policy (though summer and first-year associates are not subject to mandatory arbitration, the firm still uses it for non-attorney staff).

The open letter, written by Harvard Law School Lambda and the [People’s Parity Project](https://www.peoplesparity.org/coercivecontracts/) (student activists that have kept the heat on Biglaw firms over their use of mandatory arbitration agreements), was signed by the following organizations: [Queer Caucus at Berkeley Law School](https://callink.berkeley.edu/organization/QC), [University of Chicago Law School OutLaw](https://uchicagooutlaw.weebly.com/), [Columbia Law School Outlaws](https://orgs.law.columbia.edu/outlaws/), [Cornell Law Lambda](https://www.facebook.com/Cornell.Lambda/), [Georgetown University Law Center OutLaw](https://www.facebook.com/OutlawGULC/), [Harvard Law School Lambda](https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/lambda/), [Harvard Law School Queer & Trans People of Color](https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/qtpoc/), [Michigan Law Outlaws](http://www.mlawoutlaws.org/), [New York University School of Law OUTLaw](https://www.law.nyu.edu/studentorganizations/outlaw), [Northwestern Pritzker School of Law OUTLaw](https://nlawoutlaw.tumblr.com/), [Stanford Law School OutLaw](https://law.stanford.edu/outlaw/), [UCLA School of Law OUTLaw](https://law.ucla.edu/student-life/student-organizations/outlaw/), [University of Pennsylvania Law School Lambda Law](https://www.pennlawlambda.com/), and [Yale Law School OutLaws](https://law.yale.edu/student-life/student-journals-organizations/student-organizations/outlaws). Additionally, Harvard Law School Lambda, Michigan OUTLaws, UCLA OUTLaw, and Yale Law School OUTLaws are ending their existing partnerships with Gibson Dunn over the practice.

“Workplace discrimination remains alive and well in the legal profession—and we cannot in good conscience promote employers as LGBTQ+ friendly when they are using forced arbitration to sweep discrimination, harassment, and other workplace misconduct under the rug. The reality is that as long as Gibson Dunn or any other firm subjects its employees to forced arbitration, we simply do not know whether they are safe and equitable workplaces for queer and trans workers,” said Sejal Singh, a founding co-director of the People’s Parity Project and member of Harvard Law School Lambda.

Additionally, the People’s Parity Project announced that as a result of this campaign, Williams & Connolly will end their mandatory arbitration practice.

The practice of mandatory arbitration agreements in Biglaw first came under fire when Munger Tolles was [called out on social media for the practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/biglaw-firm-tries-to-force-summer-associates-to-arbitrate-sexual-harassment-claims/) last year. That firm changed their policy as a result, and other firms [voluntarily did away](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/this-biglaw-firm-is-the-first-to-step-forward-and-do-away-with-mandatory-arbitration-for-all-employees/) with the [practice](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/another-biglaw-firm-kicks-mandatory-arbitration-to-the-curb/). Others [required some good, old-fashioned pressure](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/law-school-students-stand-up-to-biglaw-firm-win/), but eventually eliminated the agreements. But, of course, there have been some firms that have [held fast](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/11/one-biglaw-firm-refuses-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration-agreements/), despite complaints and [bad press](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/10/kamala-harris-gets-dragged-into-dla-piper-sexual-assault-controversy/).

The firm’s match is unlimited. We wanted that feeling of participation across our firm. Notwithstanding that this is a strong place to be now, people’s lives are complicated, they have husbands and wives and kids. Our strong performance allows us to help people individually and collectively.

Paul Hastings will match all contributions to the fund made firmwide.

# Wind Down Of Bankrupt Biglaw Firm Gets Messy
## The end of a Biglaw firm isn't pretty.

We told you [this was bound to happen](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/09/leclairryan-unsurprisingly-declares-bankruptcy/). Way back in September of 2019, when former Biglaw firm LeClairRyan’s[ process of dissolution ](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/leclairryan-begins-the-process-of-dissolution/)turned to Chapter 11 bankruptcy after reports the firm was [having issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/07/problems-pile-on-for-struggling-biglaw-firm/) paying [monies owed](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/biglaw-firm-prohibited-by-lender-from-returning-former-partners-capital-contributions/), we noted that bumps in the road were likely. And that’s what has happened.

Earlier this week, a lawsuit was filed by a trustee for the now defunct firm, Lynn Tavenner, against UnitedLex and ULX Partners. UnitedLex, an alternative legal service provider, and LeClairRyan teamed up in 2019 to create ULX Partners which [they claimed was “law firm 2.0”](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/02/the-biglaw-firm-that-keep-losing-partners-is-revamping-their-leadership-structure/) aimed at providing nonlegal operations for law firms. However, that partnership was unable to change the downward spiral, and, indeed, the lawsuit claims the venture “only served to plunge LeClairRyan further into insolvency.”

As[ reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/leclairryan-bankruptcy-trustee-claims-unitedlex-misused-funds) Bloomberg Law, the complaint alleges they misused funds:

But, according to the complaint, UnitedLex and ULX Partners, along with LeClairRyan officers and directors, “prioritized their own desires for financial gain and prolonged the Debtor’s lifespan, enabling the Defendants and others to improperly and unfairly extract millions of dollars from the Estate, to the detriment of LeClairRyan’s creditors.”

The trustee claims that ULX Partners has insider status in the bankruptcy proceedings due to its heavy ownership share in the joint venture, amounting to 99%, as well as the joint venture’s control over many essential functions at LeClairRyan, including marketing, accounting, conflict management, and business development.

The complaint alleges damages of no less than ~$42.8 million, saying they delayed the wind down process and also alleging damages from the liquidation of the retirement plan, the conversion from a professional corporation to a professional limited liability corporation (as part of the joint venture), and an increase in trade payables and accounts receivable. It further alleges more than $1 million in damages based on ULX’s “misappropriation of funds tendered by clients for specific expenses, which were used by the ULX Entities for improper purposes.”

The complaint also says there were legal maneuvers designed to elevate ULX’s claims in LeClairRyan’s bankruptcy:

Last September as LeClairRyan filed for bankruptcy, Bloomberg Law reported the firm had entered into an outstanding deferred loan promissory note by which it agreed to pay ULX Partners $8 million for outstanding fees owed under the joint venture agreement. As of the firm’s bankruptcy filing, that loan had not been paid back.

However, according to the complaint, ULX Entities sought to elevate ULX Partners’ priority over other unsecured creditors through the promissory note, which they claim was “an equity infusion.”

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Stacey Yonkus, director of communications at UnitedLex, said this about the complaint:

“We believe the allegations being raised through the bankruptcy of LeClairRyan have no merit. As a major creditor of LeClairRyan, we fully expect the bankruptcy process to fairly resolve this matter. We eagerly await the resolution process and the opportunity to highlight our client commitment.”

We’ll be following along, whatever happens.

# Davis Polk Hit With Racial Discrimination Lawsuit
## He alleges the firm retaliated against him when he complained about the discrimination.

A new lawsuit filed against the white-shoe firm of Davis Polk alleges the firm participated in racial discrimination and then retaliated against the associate who complained.

The plaintiff is former associate Kaloma Cardwell, who began at the firm in 2012 as a summer associate and then was a lawyer at the firm from 2014 to 2018 and worked in various corporate groups during his time there. According to the complaint, as an African-American, Cardwell was concerned about the firm’s lack of diversity before he began at Davis Polk, but new initiatives at the firm and assurances from leadership that black associates would have opportunities to excel at the firm convinced him to accept the job. However, Cardwell alleges a firm culture that allowed implicit biases to flourish, and minimized opportunities for black associates to advance at Davis Polk. Cardwell alleges that as an associate at the firm, he was regularly left off of team emails for deals he was assigned to and was not invited to participate in conference calls. He also says that more experienced attorneys at the firm would ignore diverse associates, even avoiding eye contact with them.

Cardwell says he complained about the discrimination and implicit bias at the firm on numerous occasions, but rather than fix the problem, it made it worse. Cardwell alleges that the firm actually doctored performance reviews — in the words of the complaint, they were “retroactively created after Plaintiff engaged litigation” — to manufacture a reason to fire him after he complained about the alleged discrimination. Cardwell says that in addition to these negative performance reviews that were inconsistent with the feedback he received in real time, he was increasingly isolated, and not given any work, which the complaint describes as a “barrage of direct and indirect forms of harassment and humiliation.”

Ed. note: Welcome to our daily feature, [Quote of the Day](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/quote-of-the-day/).

Some of the lateral partners we’ve spoken to … have told us that one of the important things to them is people are in the office and we’re collaborating in-person whereas the firms they came from may have had less office attendance. We believe in a hybrid work model but we believe there’s a purpose to being in the office.

— [Jonathan Stott](https://www.dechert.com/people/s/jonathan-stott.html), managing partner of Dechert’s San Francisco office, in comments given to [The Recorder](https://www.law.com/therecorder/2024/03/06/we-believe-theres-a-purpose-to-being-in-the-office-dechert-grows-san-francisco-footprint-via-sublease/) on the firm’s new office, which has 2,000 more square feet of space than its old office. Dechert’s lawyers are expected to come into the office three days each week, and its new office not only has more space, but it also has “enhanced amenities” designed to encourage lawyers to work from the office.

If the legal profession is ever going to become meaningfully diverse, it has got to be everyone’s issue. Not just women or people of color, but everyone that wants a more diverse profession has to make it a priority.

That’s the attitude Mayer Brown partner [Chris Arnold](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/people/a/arnold-chris?tab=overview) has. The capital markets and derivatives partner was recently placed on the Chambers UK 2020 ranking of solicitors as one of the best in the practice area. The only problem? He was one of 17 men on the list, with only one woman cracking the ranking. So Arnold [took to social media](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6589461696874627073/) (LinkedIn, because, lawyers, whatcha gonna do?) putting Chambers on blast for the lack of diversity in the rankings. He also attached an open letter (below) to Chambers asking that his name get pulled from the ranking and letting them know he wouldn’t be included until the list was at least 25 percent women.

As [reported by](https://www.legalcheek.com/2019/10/city-lawyers-viral-letter-slams-lack-of-women-in-chambers-lawyer-rankings/) Legal Cheek, Chambers has responded to the debacle and will, in the future, include diversity information in their rankings submissions:

Chambers and Partners has also released a [detailed statement on its diversity and inclusion work](https://diversity.chambers.com/articles-media/diversity-inclusion-statement-from-our-ceo/). CEO Tim Noble said that, looking over the past ten years worth of rankings, 30.6% of those featured at partner level in the UK were women.

He added that “Chambers will be requesting D&I-related information as part of the submissions process from the 2020/2021 research cycles and this data will now be assessed as part of the overall Chambers research and editorial. This will apply to all of our guides and include all strands of diversity”.

This is a super important lesson for the venerable ranking — you can’t just cross your fingers and hope diversity works out. It takes everyone working to see real results.

# The Hot New Location For Biglaw?
## Not a bad place to work...

That Milbank Tweed — one of the stalwarts of downtown Manhattan since just after the Civil War — will draw up stakes and move would always generate news. However, the decision to forego another location in its rebuilding, familiar Wall Street environs as well as the traditional Midtown corridor where Biglaw firms huddle together above New York’s primary commuter transportation hubs adds another layer to the story.

Chelsea is where you go for brunch if your idea of brunch is being a pretentious douchewhistle, guzzling 10 Mimosas, and then throwing up on the High Line. In other words… brunch.

In joining Boies Schiller in the new Hudson Yards project, Milbank challenges the conventional wisdom in Biglaw real estate. Even Skadden’s decision to move to 1 Manhattan West (at Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street) — an area that David Lat described as “[‘unorthodox,’ perhaps downright icky](https://abovethelaw.com/2014/10/lawyerly-lairs-skadden-makes-a-major-move/)” — isn’t as bold as Milbank’s move to 11th Avenue. The psychological toll of trudging avenue blocks adds up quickly. On Ninth, Skadden is only a couple blocks from Herald Square. At Hudson Yards, Milbank is only a couple of blocks from Weehawken.

Then again, people probably said the same thing when [the first firm moved to Midtown](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-first-law-firm-to-move-to-midtown/) six decades ago. I’m sure they were also asked how the firm would survive being so far from the courthouses and the bulk of their clients. But it all seems to have worked out.

And to some extent, this move lets Milbank chart a new course — or perhaps to better reflect the course they’ve been charting in recent years — by designing a whole new office to project their image to the world. Assuming they’ve gambled correctly, Hudson Yards is the new up-and-coming neighborhood. A number of tech, media, and financial services companies are planning to move into the area making it a hotbed for certain categories of clients. If Milbank opts to style its new digs with the sort of “modern, collaborative, entrepreneurial” design, it could find itself right at home with its new neighbors. We’ll have to see in a future “Lawyerly Lairs: Office Edition.”

Still, the big losers in this deal are any partners — or even senior associates — who made real estate decisions based on the 150 years Milbank spent downtown. If some partner plopped down big bucks on some Brooklyn Heights brownstone or an associate got a good deal by buying something looking out over the southern reaches of Prospect Park, their commute just became an unholy crucible or whatever worse phrase describes having to transfer at least once.

There seem to be three other big winners in this deal. First is Queens, who can finally fill up their riverside luxury condos with freshly minted associates excited to jump on the 7 train — the only train that stops reasonably close to Hudson Yards. Good for them… the world needs Mets fans. Beyond that, Long Island and New Jersey — both run out of Penn Station — take over from Westchester as the ideal locales for those with an eye on pulling [the full Snake Pilssken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_New_York). If you’re a law student heading to Milbank, instruct your real estate broker accordingly.

# Trump's Latest Circuit Nominee Graduated Law School In 2007

Allison Jones Rushing has a sterling academic record, high-profile clerkship experience, and doubtless a solid vote for protecting the rights of fetuses as, based on her résumé, she still is one. Rushing graduated from Wake Forest in 2004 and Duke Law School in 2007. After three clerkships — with then-Judge Gorsuch, Judge Sentelle, and Justice Thomas — she joined the ranks of Williams & Connolly where she’s practiced actual law for a mere seven years.

Doesn’t anyone think we’re, forgive me, “rushing” this? She could go to her 10-year Gorsuch clerkship anniversary already a federal appellate judge herself. Before this administration is over, a 3L serving as FedSoc Treasurer at Ole Miss could get a district court nod and not a single goddamned one of you will be shocked.

Obviously, Rushing’s clerkships speak to her academic acumen and her work at as a rising star at Williams & Connolly are nothing to sneeze at. Certainly a far cry from the last mid-thirties nominee the administration tried to stuff into an adult-sized robe in the form of [ghost hunter](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/trump-judicial-nominee-is-a-ghost-hunter-proving-the-bar-can-always-go-a-little-lower/) and [KKK enthusiast](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/11/judicial-nominee-brett-talley-loves-ghosts-so-much-he-apparently-thinks-the-kkk-were-kind-of-cool/) Brett Talley. But the operative word in the phrase “rising star” is “rising.” Rushing was building a résumé that could very well earn her a place on the bench after another 10 or 20 years of practice. But the grifters holding the White House despite losing the popular vote by millions know they’re likely not getting another crack at this for a decade and are ready to throw anyone into these seats who’ll still be on the bench in 2056 when Tomi Lahren’s as-yet-unborn son is ready to serve as Barron Trump’s running mate.

Is it unfair that an accomplished young lawyer is going to be stuck with this belittling image as a baby judge? No. It is, however, unfortunate and that’s on the administration for putting her in this position even after they saw what happened to Talley’s nomination, which, people may forget, was already going to hell on the youth issue before we learned about his bizarre habits.

The irony is, despite her dearth of practical experience, Rushing is potentially one of the better selections in Trump’s cavalcade of mostly laughable judicial nominations. Beyond the aforementioned Talley, we’ve had [Jeff “Satan Boy” Mateer](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/09/another-day-another-comically-unfit-judicial-nominee/), [Matthew “the dog ate my homework” Petersen](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/12/if-your-problem-with-a-judicial-nominee-is-a-lack-of-trial-experience-youre-missing-the-point/), and [Ryan “what I meant when I said minorities were whiny ethnics was…” Bounds](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/07/law-school-students-just-saw-a-radical-shift-in-the-pathway-to-success/). At least she’s not in any danger of getting an ABA “not-qualified” tag like now confirmed [Judge L. Steven Grasz](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/senate_confirms_appeals_nominee_grasz_who_was_rated_not_qualified_by_aba_co) and her appellate practice is certainly a better résumé line item than “anti-gay blogger” like confirmed [Judge John Bush](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2017/07/20/senate_confirms_john_k_bush_anti_gay_blogger_to_the_6th_circuit.html). When your expectations are so low, the little things matter.

It seems as though Trump’s circuit court nominations largely fall into three categories: comically inexperienced, so embarrassingly ideological that [even conservatives blush](https://twitter.com/orinkerr/status/987016941461098496?lang=en), or both. Rushing seems to fit the first category. Whether or not she fits into the third remains to be seen, but with the joint Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation vetting process, it’s hard to imagine they picked the next David Souter.

# The 20 Best Law Schools For Getting Biglaw Jobs
## We hope your law school made the cut.

If you’re in law school, it’s highly likely that when you graduate, you’ll have up to six figures of student loan debt. To service that huge debt load, you’ll need to find a job with a high salary. That’s why law students strive to nab jobs in Biglaw firms, where the starting salary for first-year associates is generally $160,000 (and [might be heading higher](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/ny-to-190/)).

But will your law school pedigree (or lack thereof) allow you to get an offer at one of these firms? Let’s find out. The [National Law Journal](http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202757867513/Law-Grad-Employment-Rates-Up-But-Class-Size-Is-Smaller?mcode=1202617074964&curindex=0&slreturn=20160418110320) produced several helpful charts based on employment data for the class of 2015, and one of them lists the 20 law schools that sent the highest percentage of their most recent graduating class into Biglaw jobs.

On this list, you’ll find every single law school from the T14 (with Columbia in first place, as usual, with 73.61 percent employed in Biglaw firms), but we’re not here to tell you what you already know — that graduates of top law schools get top jobs at Biglaw firms. As we did with the [federal clerkship rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-20-best-law-schools-for-getting-federal-clerkships/), we’re going to dive a little deeper into the list and highlight the schools you may not realize are some of the top Biglaw contenders:

# A Supreme Court First!
## History was made this week...

Supreme Court history was made this week when the justices heard arguments in Venezuela v. Helmerich and, for the first time ever, more women participated than men.

[Catherine Stetson](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/cate-stetson) of Hogan Lovells and [Catherine Carroll](https://www.wilmerhale.com/Catherine_Carroll/) of WilmerHale represented the parties in the dispute, while [Elaine Goldberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-goldenberg-abb91556) argued for the United States as amicus curiae. Counting Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, that meant the argument featured six women to only five men.

Despite the historical achievement, Empirical SCOTUS reminds us that [this argument remains an outlier](https://empiricalscotus.com/2016/11/02/gender-balance/).

Outside of this case, however, the gender balance was more standard for the Supreme Court where ten of the other eleven attorneys that argued this week were men (the other woman to argue this week was [Kathleen Sullivan](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/sullivan-kathleen-m) in [State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States, ex rel. Rigsby](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/15-513_k5fm.pdf)).

Still, it’s a sign of things to come.

# Biglaw Firms Ranked On How Much Their Work Contributes To Climate Change (2023)
## The majority of Biglaw firms did quite poorly in this new ranking.

Students who graduate from our nation’s top law schools are too often faced with a choice between morality and prestige when making decisions about their career paths. When the best law schools facilitate a job search that feeds into the “Biglaw or bust” mentality, success is measured by the number of graduates who have secured positions at firms serving clients that represent the worst of the worst when it comes to our planet’s ongoing climate crisis.

A new report from [Law Students for Climate Accountability](https://www.ls4ca.org/) set out to answer a simple question: how much do the Vault 100 firms contribute to climate change? The answer is, as you might imagine, a lot.

Biglaw firms continue to be a “hotbed of fossil fuel activity.” Here’s a breakdown of what that means: per LSCA, Vault 100 firms conducted 502 representations in cases exacerbating climate change, facilitated $3.05 trillion of fossil fuel transactions, and received millions upon millions in compensation for fossil fuel lobbying between 2017 and 2021.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“There will always be firms that represent Exxon, Shell or Chevron. “Stopping that is not our end goal,” second-year NYU Law student Nathaniel Waldman, a member of the LSCA leadership committee, told the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/08/01/we-want-to-stigmatize-that-work-report-focuses-on-big-laws-ties-to-fossil-fuel-industry/). “What we do want to do is stigmatize that work because it is adding to the global disasters we see every day. We want people to be aware of the work these firms are doing and not let them sweep it under the rug.”

LSCA’s work has not been in vain — this year, in the group’s fourth annual Climate Scorecard, a record number of Biglaw firms received “A” scores. Of course, the majority of other Vault 100 firms received scores of “D” and “F,” but let’s concentrate on the positive news. So, which firms performed the best compared to their peers? Take a look at the firms that did the best in LSCA’s latest scorecard.

Congratulations to Cooley; Foley Hoag; Schulte Roth & Zabel; Sheppard Mullin; and Wilson Sonsini. None of these firms represented a single fossil fuel company, earning them the top spot in LSCA’s ranking.

LSCA’s full report and 2023 Climate Scorecard can be found [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/646e3b899493ae261720e957/t/64c98973e8d5b85caa58d71c/1690929539797/aug1-report-finalpreview_compressed+%283%29.pdf).

“We want to work with firms,” Waldman told Am Law. “We want to have firms come to us and talk to us about what they can do better. That is the point of this. To do better. More renewable energy, less fossil fuel work.”

Good luck to Law Students for Climate Accountability as they do their best to make Biglaw do better, to make the future better for all of us.

# 'Legal Tech Lists': 5 Lawyer Tropes That Were Upended By Legal Tech
## These common fictitious scenarios would be solved by technology.

Editor’s note: This is an installment in the “Reference Manual of Legal Tech Lists,” an eBook set for release this spring. [Read the prior installments here](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/wolters-kluwer-lists/), and feel free to pre-register for your copy of the complete eBook using the form below.

There are lots of tropes related to lawyers and law firms that frequently show up in works of fiction. 

The thing is, those tropes are tropes because they’re sort of old; they’ve been around for a long time.

Now, however, modern technology can solve a heck of a lot of those issues.

So, for this edition of the “Reference Manual of Lists,” we’re going to relay a trope, offer an example, and talk about how legal tech actually fixes the problem today.

Let’s hope we don’t [jump the shark.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahxG3iPeVcU)

Trope 1: Piling On

In every lawyer movie ever, there’s that scene where the big law firm dumps a metric ton of documentation on the smaller law firm/solo attorney. 

And (oh my God), it’s impossible for us to get through all of this information — we’re so screwed! (Of course, the “David” firm inevitably overcomes the “Goliath” firm’s attempt to sink its case — even though it’s wholly unrealistic that they would have, in reality.)

Exemplary Scene: In [Season 2, Episode 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqRvZRLg1Xk) of [“Silicon Valley” on HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)), there’s a “[classic document dump”](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/576d7fc8-2169-4c21-a9f5-1e5760f41a44) during a binding arbitration that actual humans must rifle through and review, pitting perseverance against manpower.

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: eDiscovery tools can help law firms to review massive reams of virtual documents using machine learning and AI tools.

Trope 2: Search Party

Then there’s the classic “Uh oh, we actually can’t find the document/information we need in our files!”  

There’s a scramble, and somebody gets lucky, locating the subject document . . . just in the nick of time. That is, unless nefarious parties intervene, to further the plot.

Exemplary Scene: This is not really related to law practice, or documents, but, I always enjoyed the scene where a drunken Uncle Billy misplaces the money intended for deposit in “[It’s a Wonderful Life.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_a_Wonderful_Life)“

Despite all those strings being tied around his fingers, he never even realizes that he left it on Mr. Potter’s lap. And, [George Bailey absolutely browbeats him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MqhUTdqleQ), on his way to the breaking point.

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: In a law firm, you can keep track of your documents, using document management tools and cloud repositories, which can also be connected, via the cloud, to law practice management software and case management software. 

Plus, case management softwares and accounting softwares allow law firms to effectively manage their finances (including trust accounting reports) via reporting and dashboard tools.

Trope 3: Signing Off

In the world of entertainment, signatures need to take place, apparently, insanely fast, in every possible scenario. (And yet, here I am, just chillin’ – waitin’ for people to sign contracts and NDAs for God knows how long.) 

But, in the movies, and on TV, if that contract doesn’t get signed, like – “Before you eat lunch, Wilma! Don’t you DARE take a bite of that grilled cheese sandwich!” — the deal is lost, forever.

Exemplary Scene: This [recent Adobe Acrobat commercial (for Adobe Sign)](https://www.ispot.tv/ad/A_Yh/adobe-sign-signing-a-billion-dollar-contract) shows an athlete getting impatient with a traditional signature process and signing a *billion* dollar contract with another team. 

For sure, sports franchises are deciding to spend a BILLION dollars on a whim — but, I suppose that’s just as realistic as the instant signature trope.

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: Of course, you can get your clients and related parties to sign documents electronically, quickly and easily.

There are standalone eSignature solutions, and lots of other softwares, like law practice management and customer relationship management tools, that include proprietary eSignature tools, or can integrate with those standalone tools, including as part of automated workflows.

Trope 4: The Courtroom Surprise

Perhaps the most famous legal trope in popular culture is the surprising courtroom twist, in which one attorney catches another lawyer off-guard, with a sleight-of-hand maneuver that turns the whole case around.

Exemplary Scene: In “[Reversal of Fortune”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversal_of_Fortune) (the [Claus von Bulow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_B%25C3%25BClow) movie), [there’s a courtroom scene where there’s a lot going on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B13fDbQ75Sk), during which, apparently, no one is doing research at all, except for the Alan Dershowitz character.  The judge apparently hasn’t read his own caselaw, and the prosecutor is totally suckered into making the wrong argument, like a total dope. Great movie stuff, totally divorced from real life.

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: Legal research tools are pretty darned advanced, at this stage. You can even plug opposing counsel’s brief into a research engine, and it will spot errors in the brief, as well as suggest counterarguments. 

You don’t even need to think, anymore! Plus, electronic trial notebooks and apps can help you better organize your presentation.

Trope 5: Courting Disaster

There’s also the common trope, where the attorney is late (oftentimes to court), and can’t get there for a whole host of reasons — just lots of obstacles being placed in her way.

Exemplary Scene: [This scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDy41hvdq4s) from [the iconic Jim Carrey movie, “Liar, Liar”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Liar) (where Carrey plays a lawyer — a shady one, of course), includes police involvement, thus carrying on a fine tradition of [Jim Carrey-related interactions with the fuzz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGu0B6kL9eM).

The Modern, LegalTech Solution: Pretty much every pre-internet/pre-smartphone movie arrival timing issue can be resolved via smartphone. Car trouble?  Just call an Uber, bro.

Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee for president in the upcoming election, is facing a number of civil and criminal lawsuits containing a variety of claims. His legal fees are likely to be yuge but they may reduce his tax bill to his [usual $750](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/trump-750-taxes.html). So let’s look at the most publicized lawsuits and criminal indictments involving Trump and whether the associated legal fees are tax deductible.

Since Trump is a very divisive topic, I should add disclaimers. First, I have no direct knowledge of any of these cases other than what is publicly available. There may be nonpublic facts that could change the outcome of the analysis. Second, I have no opinion on the merits of any of these lawsuits, and my conclusions do not imply a position one way or another.

General Rules On The Deductibility of Legal Fees

Whether legal fees are deductible generally depends on the nature of the matter. Legal fees connected to business activities are deductible as a business expense. If the fees are connected to the acquisition of capital assets or real estate, the legal fees are not fully deductible but must be depreciated over a number of years. If the legal fees are personal in nature, such as personal injury or divorce, the legal fees are not deductible. But there are exceptions to these rules so it may be best to consult a tax professional before forking over the large retainer.

But what if the legal fees are connected to personal and business issues? To address this, courts use the “origin of the claim” test to determine deductibility. As the name suggests, the courts look at the origin and character of the claim that necessitated the payment of legal fees. This test does not care about the outcome of the dispute. For example, legal fees paid for divorce are not deductible even though the proceedings may involve splitting of jointly owned business assets or division of business income between the soon to be exes.

Lastly, a person must actually pay the legal fees to be deductible. While this sounds obvious, in Trumps’s case, the Republican National Committee has paid a significant portion of his legal fees. So Trump cannot claim the deduction if the RNC paid it.

New York Civil Fraud Lawsuit

Attorney General of New York Letitia James sued Trump and the Trump Organization alleging that they engaged in financial fraud. Specifically, Trump and his business inflated the value of his properties to obtain loans at lower interest rates and other financial benefits. After the trial, the judge ordered Trump to pay $355 million plus interest calling it a disgorgement of profits.

In this case, Trump’s attorney’s fees are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses. The attorney’s fees are related to defending Trump’s business activities.

Election Interference And Classified Information

Currently, there are two lawsuits that accuse Trump of interfering with a presidential election. The first is at the federal level where Trump is accused of inciting riots on January 6, 2021, with the goal of preventing the certification of the 2020 election results. It also accuses then President Trump of enlisting fake electors, and pressuring Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress to not certify the results of the 2020 election.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The second lawsuit comes from the state of Georgia where Trump is accused of pressuring Georgia’s secretary of state to overturn the election results.

Another federal lawsuit accuses Trump of willfully retaining classified documents, obstructing justice, and making false statements.

These lawsuits are related to Trump’s conduct while he was president and running for re-election. The president is a government employee and not a business owner or independent contractor. Therefore, his attorneys’ fees are considered employment-related expenses which used to be an itemized deduction. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) disallowed the employment-related expense deductions from 2018 to 2025.

Even if the pre-TCJA tax laws were to apply, Trump’s supposedly huge income would have subjected him to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) which adds back most itemized deductions to taxable income. Indeed, when Trump’s tax returns were leaked, it showed that a sizable portion of taxes paid were due to the AMT.

Defamation Lawsuits

E. Jean Carroll sued Trump twice for defamation. In the first lawsuit filed while Trump was president, Carroll claims that she was defamed when Trump made a [statement](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-assault-allegation-e-jean-carroll) denying her sexual assault claims and accusing her of trying to publicize her book.

In the second lawsuit filed after Trump’s presidency ended, Carroll claims she was defamed due to Trump’s statements on Truth Social in addition to battery.

Trump lost both cases at the trial level. The jury awarded Carroll $5 million on the first lawsuit and $83.3 million on the second. Trump is appealing both decisions.

In the first lawsuit, Trump had no attorney fees because he was represented by Department of Justice lawyers while he was president.

The second defamation lawsuit is a little trickier because Trump may argue that protecting his reputation against a defamation allegation is connected to the production of income both as a businessman and as the Republican nominee for president.

But because the defamation lawsuit originates from claims of sexual assault, Trump’s legal fees to defend the defamation lawsuit is not likely to be tax deductible.

Hush Money Lawsuit

In 2023, Trump was indicted in New York for paying hush money to adult actresses Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal to prevent them from publicizing their past extramarital affairs with him. Trump is accused of falsifying business records in order to cover up the payments.

It may be argued that since the indictments involve falsifying business records, the lawsuit is business related and so the legal fees are tax deductible. But on the other hand, these payments were made in connection with personal activities that had no connection to Trump’s businesses. Since the origin of this indictment involve Trump’s personal activities, the legal fees are not likely to be tax deductible.

# This Biglaw Partner May Soon Become The First Ever 'Second Gentleman'

Earlier this week, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, announced that he’d [chosen Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/08/kamala-harris-is-joe-bidens-pick-for-vice-president/) for the 2020 election. This is a historic choice for quite a few reasons. Harris is the first African American and South Asian American woman to be nominated for vice president by a major political party. If Biden wins the election, then Harris will be the first woman to ever assume the role of vice president.

But that’s not the only potentially historic thing about Harris being on the Democratic ticket. Her husband, DLA Piper partner [Doug Emhoff](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/people/e/emhoff-douglas-c/), would become America’s first ever second gentleman.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Emhoff, 55, is an entertainment lawyer at the elite firm, which raked in more then $3 billion in gross revenue last year, landing it in third place on the annual Am Law 100 ranking. He isn’t hurting for cash, either, with equity partners at the firm taking in $1.951 million in profits in 2019.

Emhoff, a graduate of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, has stood by his wife’s side as she became a political superstar. The two met on a blind date. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/first-second-gentleman-meet-kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff-n1236554) has the details on the start of their romance:

“I was just a dude, a lawyer, and then I met Kamala on a blind date, set up by legendary filmmaker Reginald Hudlin, who did ‘House Party,'” and his wife, Emhoff said.

Emhoff recalled that, at a business meeting with Hudlin and his wife Chrisette, a close friend of Harris, Chrisette said she wanted to set him up with her pal. Emhoff said that as soon as Hudlin mentioned Harris’ name, he remembered she was the attorney general and responded, “Oh my god, she’s hot.”

Emhoff texted Harris and called her, a rarity in the dating world that led the prospective Veep to call the move “endearing” in her 2019 memoir. He’s endeared himself to the public as well, supporting his wife through thick and thin on social media through tweets and retweets, like this one, a retweet from Biden:

— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) [August 13, 2020](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1293735273201770496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Take note, everyone: this litigator goes by “Dougey” at home. So cute!

We look forward to seeing Emhoff on the campaign trail. Here’s to making history.

# Donald Trump Will Make The Legal Profession Great Again

President Donald Trump (by Ali Shaker/VOA)

Donald Trump will not deliver an economic boon for flyover people who want their twentieth-century economy back. His looming trade war will be bad for American business. His wall that Mexico will never, ever pay for will be bad for the national coffers.

But lawyers are fittin’ to get paid, son. Donald Trump is generating so much legal work that I’m picking out bathroom remodels, just because I expect to be paid for simply writing about it all.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
[NBC reports](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-named-more-50-lawsuits-inauguration-n716191) that Trump has been named in over 50 lawsuits, since the inauguration. That’s over 50 lawsuits in two weeks. To put that in context:

Since being sworn in Jan. 20, Trump has been named in 52 federal cases in 17 different states, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Comparatively, Barack Obama was named in three and George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were each named in four cases between Jan. 20 and Feb. 1.

This is going to be the most litigated presidency of all time.

Remember, we’re only talking about cases where Trump has been named, so it’s mainly state attorneys general taking on Trump’s executive orders. We haven’t even begun with the private causes of actions people will have against the government as the Trumpkins violate due process. We’re not talking about the slew of civil-rights cases coming even as the Supreme Court tries to hold the line.

And don’t forget the corruption inquires that should be coming soon to Trump, his family, and his crony cabinet. Don’t forget the abuse-of-power trials that are surely in our future. Chris Christie’s career imploded over a traffic jam. What do you think is going to happen when the “time for some wildfires in California” emails leak?

Notice I haven’t mentioned the personal stuff, yet? Yeah, Republicans are going to rue the day they decided that it was good political theater to subject Bill Clinton to civil lawsuits for personal behavior. How many people are just waiting for @realDonaldTrump to defame them so they can start piercing the goddamn veil? If Trump thought he could grope women when he was just a celebrity, imagine what he thinks he can do now that he’s president? Even if you don’t think Trump was absolutely corrupt before, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABSOLUTE POWER WILL DO TO HIM?

Plus, PLUS:

* There’s going to be all the legal work generated when Trump orders Jeff Sessions to get him a bagel and sue his enemies.

* He’s going to f**k up the SEC so securities lawyers will be pulling all-nighters trying to figure out what they can get away with now.

* HIS TAX PLAN! Lol. IT WON’T EVEN MAKE SENSE, but tax lawyers are going to have a field day trying to explain it to desperate, confused businesses.

Maybe Trump will bring good, low-skilled jobs back. Redweld is going to have to open up new factories to make folders for all this paper we’re about to be see.

It is a glorious time to be a lawyer. Or at least it will be, until he orders all of them exterminated for “Un-American argle-bargle.”

Doreen Zankowski

Duane Morris partner [Doreen Zankowski](https://www.duanemorris.com/attorneys/doreenmzankowski.html) has been suspended for six months from the Massachusetts bar for overbilling while she was a partner at Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr. Zankowski, a litigator who handles complex litigation, construction and corporate matters, said that her billing errors were not intentional but merely a result of “inadequate, careless, rushed and error-prone” billing practices.

In question were Zankowski’s billable hours for 2015. That year she made equity partner at Saul Ewing, and billed 3,173 hours and worked more than 720 non-billable hours. The ethics opinion notes the firm became concerned with Zankowski’s hours during compensation review:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
“The litigation department chair was struck by what he described as the respondent’s ‘extraordinary billable numbers,’ as well as a ‘premium’ in earnings resulting from the fact that the respondent’s overall actual amount billed was more than the original value entered.”

She also reportedly edited associates’ timesheets to add entries to associate level work that Zankowski says she actually did herself. Zankowski left Saul Ewing in 2016 and joined Duane Morris, but as [reported by](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2019/12/13/duane-morris-partner-suspended-6-months-for-overbilling-at-former-firm-saul-ewing/) Law.com, that didn’t end the investigation into her billing practices:

Saul Ewing continued to investigate her billing practices after her departure and ultimately gave money back to clients, totaling about $260,000, for what it believed was the amount Zankowski had overbilled, the opinion said. The firm did not inform those clients about the reason for overbilling, and most of them ultimately followed Zankowski to Duane Morris, the opinion said.

According to the ethics opinion, Zankowski “falsely inflated the number of hours on final bills sent to several clients, improperly entered her time as work by her associates, and knowingly billed clients for taking depositions that she did not attend.” And though the board of bar overseers recommended a two-year suspension, Associate Justice Frank Gaziano felt that was “too severe” and knocked it down to six months, beginning on December 18th. In justifying the shorter suspension, Gaziano also noted even absent the billing irregularities, Zankowski was a significant revenue generator and that her evidence that the overbilling was unintentional was compelling.

Zankowski is appealing her suspension, and Saul Ewing indicated they have no comment while the appeal is pending. Duane Morris offered this statement:

“As this matter has been appealed by the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers, the firm has no comment other than to note that the conduct at issue, which involved certain billing practices, all occurred entirely prior to Ms. Zankowski joining Duane Morris and that two of the three clients in question had actually presented testimony in support of Ms. Zankowski.”

# Former Biglaw General Counsel Disbarred Amid Allegations He Misappropriated $2.5 Million
## He called the money 'discretionary bonuses.'

Former general counsel of the now-defunct [LeClairRyan](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/leclairryan/) firm is no longer a licensed attorney after allegations that he misappropriated $2.5 million in funds, according to an announcement from the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board.

[Bruce Matson](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/bruce-matson/) had previously served as trustee for the bankruptcy of LandAmerica Financial Group (LFG), and when the Chapter 11 closed in 2015, he was selected as the court-appointed trust fiduciary to oversee the wind-down. As part of those responsibilities, he was prohibited from making any distributions to himself until 2021, when wind-down would be complete. However, as [reported by](https://www.law360.com/articles/1330095) Law360, Matson has now admitted to transferring $1 million to himself, $1.5 million to attorney Robert Smith, and an additional $341,000 to an escrow account in his name. He described those million-dollar payments as “discretionary bonuses.”

Matson and Smith later told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin R. Huennekens that the trust had wound up with far more money than expected, a windfall Matson attributed to “cost savings and unexpected recoveries[.]”

Smith also said he was holding $1.5 million, separate from the funds held by Matson, “to decrease the concentration risk in any one person or bank.” At one point, Matson asked to donate the $2.8 million to charity, saying the money likely wouldn’t be needed by the LFG trust going forward.

At an Oct. 16, 2019, hearing, Matson admitted that all of the money had been deposited in personal accounts controlled by himself, Smith and their wives, according to a transcript obtained by local business journal Richmond BizSense.

When asked why he had pulled out the funds, Matson said he had a lot going on “personally and professionally” in late 2018 and wanted to “simplify the situation.”

The disbursements were discovered in 2019, when LFG’s financial adviser found the trust’s funds were gone. Matson has said the money he disbursed to himself and Smith has now been returned. The consent disbarment was signed on November 13th.

I’m going to open one of these and there’s going to be a Trump inside, right?

Alex van der Zwaan, an associate who worked in Skadden’s London office, was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for lying to investigators.

Van der Zwann is the son-in-law of Russian oligarch German Khan. He was accused of lying about his communications with Paul Manafort associate, Rick Gates. [If we go by the book](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/quotes/qt0454909), van der Zwann told Khan that the Enterprise wouldn’t have auxiliary power for for two days, when really repairs only took two hours.

Sorry, I couldn’t resist. The investigation is getting hard to follow. Skadden lawyers are now lying to the FBI? Facebook is telling me to vote for Bernie Sanders because it helps the Russians destabilize America? Donald Trump admitted to obstructing justice on live television, but we’re still “investigating” whether he did what we know he did for the reasons he said he did it? “German Khan” is the name of a real person?

How is this real life, but Wakanda is the fantasy world?

Anyway, he’s already pleaded guilty:

Alex van der Zwaan just entered his guilty plea. Sentencing is set for April 3 – they asked to expedite so he could get back to London, where his wife is (she is having a difficult pregnancy, per his lawyer) [https://t.co/dEZRvmXRKB](https://t.co/dEZRvmXRKB)

More [from BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/the-special-counsels-office-has-charged-a-lawyer-working?utm_term=.jqXp4a1GBB#.cmxqDN0WRR) because Zoe Tillman is keeping up with all of these Russian connections almost as if a major plot to destroy American democracy is unfurling in front of our eyes:

According to the criminal information filed by special counsel Robert Mueller’s office, which is dated Feb. 16, investigators asked van der Zwaan in November about his work in 2012 for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice preparing a report on the trial of Yulia Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister.

Van der Zwaan is accused of falsely telling investigators that his last communication with Gates was an “innocuous text message” in mid-August 2016, when he had spoken with Gates in September 2016 about the Tymoshenko report.

[Skadden says they fired van der Zwann in 2017](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/sites/nationallawjournal/2018/02/20/former-skadden-associate-charged-in-mueller-probe/) and that the firm has been cooperating with authorities in their investigation.

We have reached a place where no further Russia revelations would surprise me. Robert Mueller could walk into this office and tell me that I’ve been a Manchurian blogger, working for Putin to destabilize the American legal system since 2010, and I’d be like, “Oh. Okay. That makes sense.”

I wouldn’t lie to the FBI, though. That’s just freaking stupid.

## * President Donald Trump has hired his longtime lawyer, Marc Kasowitz of Kasowitz Benson, to represent him as his independent counsel in the investigation of claims that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. Is anyone really surprised that Trump chose to hire Kasowitz? Moreover, is anyone really surprised that he'd further complicate hiring Joe Lieberman as FBI director by doing so? [[FOX Business](http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/05/23/trump-hires-uber-litigator-marc-kasowitz-to-handle-independent-counsel.html)] * In somewhat related news, despite having worked as a partner at WilmerHale -- a firm that represents former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort as well as Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- Robert Mueller has been approved by ethics experts at the Justice Department to go ahead as special counsel in the Trump/Russia investigation, as he did not participate in those matters. Things are about to start heating up. [[NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/05/23/529684535/mueller-approved-by-justice-dept-ethics-team-despite-former-law-firms-ties)] * President Donald Trump's proposed 2018 fiscal budget includes a $1.1 billion cut in funding for the Department of Justice. The $27.7 billion request for the DOJ represents a 3.8 percent decrease from its current funding level, while the antitrust division's funding will remain the same, at just under $165 million. It makes you wonder which initiatives will be discontinued. [[Big Law Business](https://bol.bna.com/flat-funding-for-justice-dept-antitrust-division-in-budget-proposal/)] * Speaking of the Trump budget, American Bar Association President Linda A. Klein has spoken out against it, criticizing its ""egregious cuts to the Constitution’s promise of a fair legal process."" Funding for the Legal Services Corporation and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program have been completely eliminated, and if the money is not reinstated, ""severe damage [could be done] to the most vulnerable people in our society."" [[ABA Journal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/aba_president_criticizes_egregious_cuts_to_lsc_loan_forgiveness_in_trump_bu)] * Convicted killer Dylann Roof, who was found guilty of 33 federal charges, including hate crimes and religious rights violations, has appealed his conviction and his death sentence to the Fourth Circuit. According to his lawyers, Roof wanted to appeal to drag the case on as long as possible, since he thinks white supremacists will eventually take over the country and pardon him. Wow.

Together with our friends at Wolters Kluwer, we are studying the role technology plays in the business of law. Our [2021 survey of law firm decision makers](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/what-biglaw-decision-makers-want-from-their-tech/) underscored the relationship between technology and profitability and highlighted aspects in which lawyers think their firms’ tech is lagging.

We want to know whether the landscape has changed in the last year. Have more firms effectively integrated technology into their practice?

What role does technology play in your firm’s success?

In what areas is your firm’s tech ready for an upgrade?

Whether your firm is an innovator or a straggler, we want to hear from you. If you work at a large or midsize law firm, please take this [brief, anonymous survey](https://breakingmedia.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2uIDxIzmTn7aAU6), and tell us how technology affects your business. All participants are eligible to win a $250 gift card!

# It's Time For Yet Another Raise At This Biglaw Firm
## It's cash o'clock!

Money, money, money, and more money: that’s what associates at leading Biglaw and boutique firms can expect to see in their paychecks later this month, all thanks to the new Cravath salary scale. Ranging from $215,000 to $415,000, hardworking associates can expect to be generously paid for their work, and firms that wish to remain elite have adopted the prevailing compensation system as their own. Which is the latest firm send associate salaries skyrocketing?

It’s Stroock! Co-managing partners Alan Klinger and Jeff Keitelman kept their message short and sweet, announcing a Cravath match earlier this afternoon. If you recall, the firm had previously [matched the Davis Polk scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/whats-more-important-than-matching-socks-matching-salaries/) at the end of February. This is what the new salary scale looks like at the firm’s New York and DC offices:

Class of 2021: $215,000
Class of 2020: $225,000
Class of 2019: $250,000
Class of 2018: $295,000
Class of 2017: $345,000
Class of 2016: $370,000
Class of 2015: $400,000
Class of 2014+: $415,000

According to Klinger and Keitelman, “[s]alary increases for Los Angeles, Miami, special counsel and off-track associates will be communicated to each attorney on an individualized basis consistent with past practice.”

Stroock associates will see their raises reflected in their March 31st paychecks, retroactive to January 1. Congratulations to everyone at the firm!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Stroock.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Biglaw Associate Out At Firm After Misconduct Allegations At A Karaoke Bar
## The associate reportedly groped coworkers.

According to [reporting at Roll on Friday](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-hogan-lovells-boots-associate-who-got-gropey-karaoke), an unnamed Hogan Lovell’s associate was suspended from the firm back [in February ](https://www.rollonfriday.com/news-content/exclusive-hogan-lovells-associate-suspended-alleged-serious-misconduct)after allegations of misconduct at a karaoke bar. The firm said they’d “been made aware of an alleged conduct issue that has arisen in our London office.”

Now that the investigation is complete, Roll on Friday has revealed the associate has been asked to leave the firm. And there are more details of exactly what happened:

Details of the incident have also emerged. In the course of a Hogan Lovells junior lawyers’ departmental drinks evening which ended up at the K Box karaoke bar in Smithfield, three attendees reported witnessing “highly inappropriate behaviour” from Rover [not his real name] towards two other members of their team, which included putting his hand up a lawyer’s skirt, according to sources.

Rover was the most senior lawyer at the event, suggesting that firms might benefit from a sober partner-level chaperone to keep a beady eye on social gatherings, at least until the excitement of irl parties dies down.

As for the firm statement, they had a rather bland, “Our internal processes have concluded and the matter is now closed.” But at least the firm actually seems to have done something in the face of wild associate behavior.

# Partner Praises Associates Willing To Buck Biglaw's 'Miserable' Work-Life Balance Trends

[I] spent a lot of miserable years [as an associate at a Magic Circle firm] without ever having the guts or initiatives to reflect what those hours were having on my family life, and relationships. I don’t look back on those years with fondness at all, in fact they were quite hellish. When you hear associates now having the confidence to refuse that, I think ‘good on them.’

— An anonymous London Biglaw partner commenting on their work-life balance regrets in a survey conducted by [Law.com International](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2022/10/18/regrets-maybe-a-few-say-older-partners-looking-back-at-their-work-life-balance/), and praising the courage and bravery that the current generation of associates has when it comes to standing up for themselves and their mental health in the workplace. About 20% of respondents said their Biglaw careers had caused problems in their personal lives (less time to date; marital problems, including divorce), while around 20% said their careers had adversely affected their physical health.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The litigation powerhouse — which came in 25th place in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings, with $1.25 billion in revenue in 2019 — just announced its special bonus matrix, and while they’re matching the generous Davis Polk scale, there are some hefty rewards in store for heavy billers based on the 12 months looking back from March 31 and September 30. Here’s the bonus scale at the firm:



Associates who billed 1900 hours will receive a bonus equal to half the market rate; those who billed 2000 hours will receive a bonus equal to 3/4 the market rate; those who billed 2100 hours will receive a market bonus; and those who billed 2200 hours or more will receive a bonus equal to 125% of the market bonus. Big billers start raking in more cash at 2400 hours. Depending on class year, those who billed 2200 hours or more will receive from $3,000 to $16,000 more than market.

This is the second of special bonuses Quinn has doled out this year, and it comes in addition to the firm’s recent payment of its associate profit-sharing bonuses. On average, those bonuses were about $38,000 for 2020.

# This Biglaw Firm Has A Presidential Medal Of Freedom Winning History

Everyone’s still talking about Joe Biden receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom yesterday — and remembering [the Supreme Court justice who also won it with distinction](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/01/just-how-rare-is-the-presidential-medal-of-freedom-with-distinction/) — but what Biglaw firm was founded by a Medal of Freedom Winner?

Hint: The founder was the very second jurist (and first not on the Supreme Court) to win the award.

See the answer on the next page.

# Cravath Files 8-Year Late Foreign Agent Disclosure Over Burisma... Prepare For The Conspiracy Theories

Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP (Photo by David Lat)

Cravath represented Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, in a limited matter eight years ago. The work netted the firm a few hundred grand — a rounding error for Cravath. However, it involved meeting with U.S. government officials, which triggers foreign agent reporting requirements that Cravath never bothered to file until just now.

Oops.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
There’s nothing necessarily wrong with representing a foreign entity. But since Hunter Biden once served on the board of Burisma and the company holds crucial importance to all the conspiracies that Joe Biden ran an influence-peddling regime, any headline involving the company is going to cause a lot of, well, [this](https://patriotmomdigest.com/law-firm-cravath-swaine-moore-retroactively-files-as-foreign-agent-for-burisma-raising-more-questions-about-hunter-biden/):



It does not raise any more questions.

But this headline from the spectacularly named “Patriot Mom Digest” provides a peek into the Burisma effect. It doesn’t even make sense within its own fever dream. If the fix was in for Burisma to walk, why did they have to pay one of the world’s best law firms? Seems like they coulda beaten a case like that for a quarter of the cost with a bargain basement firm.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
From [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/law-firm-cravath-registers-foreign-agent-8-years-after-burisma-work-2024-01-05/):

Cravath’s filings said the firm was hired in January 2016 to represent Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky — a multimillionaire former Ukrainian minister of ecology and natural resources — “in connection with possible investigations by governmental authorities in the United States.” The work was expanded to include Burisma, the firm said.

The filings said Buretta’s work included meeting with three U.S. government officials in March 2016 and sending one letter to an official later that year.

Cravath reported receiving nearly $350,000 for its legal work between March 2016 and August 2017, one of the new filings showed.

Not only did Cravath perform a relatively small amount of work, unlike the typical foreign agent case, its work was pretty transparent. When folks are lobbying elected officials without any indication that they’ve been collecting fees from a foreign government — that’s the sort of opacity disclosure is designed to clear up. Buretta is a litigator who interacted with government officials in response to an investigation into a foreign client. No one was getting fooled here.

In fact, Cravath doesn’t seem to have imagined that the lobbying rules would extend to writing officials to lay out the lack of a case. But the government is trying to expand the scope of these disclosures — [potentially further than ever intended](https://apnews.com/article/business-china-lawsuits-beijing-lobbying-ad7d6b41b9005071ddc1c827d905e7e9) — and Cravath came to the conclusion amidst all the smoke to go ahead and report litigation work as if it were lobbying for a foreign agent.

Technically the law carries some hefty penalties for failing to disclose, but applying them here wouldn’t seem to make much sense.

# Biglaw Firm Accused Of Maintaining A 'Black List' Of Minorities To Push Out Was Actually Predicting Departures Of All Sorts Of Associates
## List maintained by one professional development person is now kind of embarrassing the whole firm.

Last week, [a post popped up on Top Law Schools](http://www.top-law-schools.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=296866&sid=33a4a9cae5af5459125e5b7265ab95b6) accusing Debevoise & Plimpton of what would have to be the dumbest form of racism you could hope to see out of a Biglaw firm.

I just wrapped up my summer at Debevoise and things started out great. But unlike other SAs, I guess I was really focused on trying to use the summer to find out if Debevoise was the right place for me. I used the summer lunches to ask questions and also reached out to folks in the diversity group. I really felt like folks were candid about alot of things except one area — race. There is a clear difference in the experience the black associates get at Debevoise in contrast to white associates. And I don’t mean “oh there’s only a handful of us so we’re underrepresented”. I mean a clear difference in work, opportunities for growth, firm committee involvement, & even speaking opportunities… I didn’t hear any bad things about Debevoise before. Except this thread makes me now realize perhaps the firm and the online platforms it sponsors, help to avoid bad news by quieting any dissenting remarks…

This thread was locked but its actually an off-brand reference to the Debevoise Black List, which ACTUALLY EXISTS. So the Debevoise Black List (DBL) was some Excel chart that was created, which basically charts target termination/departure dates for black associates at the firm, BEFORE any of these individuals had even said they were interested in leaving. The list definitely exists. An associate shared it with me a few weeks ago and it threw me into a tailspin. How did this not get out? Well it kind of did if you consider the thread above. But here’s the backstory of how Debevoise squashed the news from getting out? This was confirmed by several associates (black and white): The firm’s managing partner asked/forced all the black associates to meet in a conference room so he could explain away the list and the rationale behind it, despite the clear-as-day references on the chart. The associates could really do nothing. But that didn’t help things or stop Debevoise apparently because they still forced out many associates according to the schedule on the DBL. Seriously. Starting this Monday, Debevoise will not have any black senior associates either in their corporate or litigation groups. That was according to the DBL timeline. The last remaining senior associate, in corporate, leaves tomorrow and by most accounts, he was forced out. It was really demoralizing to read the news of the associate’s upcoming departure since it feels like confirmation of what I feared — Debevoise brings in black associates for the numbers but then gradually forces them out by not giving them good work or simply asking them to leave.

Now, FULL DISCLOSURE: I was an associate at Debevoise & Plimpton, a long time ago, and my personal experiences do not track with the original post. I felt I received a fair combination of “good” work and “I would stab out my eyes to avoid this work, but they’d probably just make me learn braille instead of putting me on disability” work. Certainly, there was no white colleague in my class year who I thought was getting a materially better deal than I was, especially because somewhere north of 2400 hours, every additional piece of work just made me want to vomit anyway.

So, I’m biased. But I’m also biased because maintaining a “black list” of minority associates would be colossally stupid. Nobody I met at Debevoise was such a drooling idiot that they’d… write down a timeline for when to push minority associates out of the firm. I mean, damn. That just doesn’t pass the smell test of something a major law firm would do in 2018.

We reached out to [Michael Blair](https://www.debevoise.com/michaelblair), the managing partner at Debevoise & Plimption. Blair acknowledged the existence of a “list,” but not of the kind contemplated by the poster.

He said that a single person in professional development created a list, on her own accord, to “organize her thoughts” on associate headcount and associate attrition for recruiting purposes. Her list helped her think through how many summers or 3Ls or clerks or laterals would need to be hired. This list contained no racial classifications, but did list, by name, associates in the department she was responsible for. The list was organized into different categories of potential associate departures. Some were obvious, like associates who would be transferring to other offices.

But some of the categories were predictive: her list included her own predictions of who would be asked to leave the firm due to performance issues.

Blair emphasized that those predictions about who would make partner and who would be asked to leave were “largely inaccurate.” He said that the list was never shared with any partner, and that he himself had not seen the list until 2017.

It’s not like the original poster here is making it up. He or she saw something that included the names of people, and their expected departures, made by a person involved in management. Moreover, Blair points out that the 2017 list did in fact have a disproportionaite number of African-American associates in the “performance issue” category, though most of those people were not in fact asked to leave because, again, Blair emphasized that the professional development person’s predictions were not all that reliable. Blair also said that in previous versions of the list, no African-American associates were listed as having performance issues.

So then you have to ask how did this, let’s call it personal spit-balling, from a professional development person make it all the way down into the hands of a summer associate? Blair says that when the firm changed its document management system, way back in 2014, some documents previously labeled “restricted” lost that designation. Blair became aware of the list in 2017 when he learned this document had its confidentiality breached as part of the systems changeover.

That means anybody, for years, could have played around in the system and seen one person’s predictions of who would be pushed out of the firm, without the context that this was a person with no authority to actually throw anybody overboard.

It’s not a good look and, at least in my opinion, Blair sounded suitably embarrassed by the whole thing.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
But the explanation does sound credible to me. As I’ve been kicking the tires on this story, I’ve heard from current and former associates of the firm who simply can’t believe that the alternative reading — that Debevoise is actually keeping a secret list of minority associates to fire — could possibly be true. Hell, I’ve heard from a white partner who said, “Come on, if we did this kind of thing I wouldn’t work here.”

Moreover, I’ve heard from people, both white and black, who are angry at the summer associate. I personally think the anger is misplaced; the student saw what they saw and if you see a bunch of black associates listed to be pushed out on a document that comes from a person who appears to be in a position of authority, what were they supposed to think? Trust me on this, the chance that a major law firm is secretly racist is waaaaay more likely than the chance that a major law firm hasn’t updated its document restrictions since 2014. So I don’t fault the kid as much as others.

Still, the word that kept coming back to me from Debevoise people was “demoralizing.” There’s a perception in the legal community that Debevoise is doing a good job, relatively speaking, with minority hiring and retention. This story has been a body blow to associates who felt like they had made the right choice.

Blair told me that his job now is to reassure those associates that Debevoise is as committed to minority hiring and retention now as it has been since he took over in 2012. He listed some stats from his tenure:

The percentage of our associates who are African-American has increased from 4.9 percent to 6.8 percent, which is a 39 percent increase. The percentage of our associates of color has increased from 22 percent to 36 percent. The percentage of our partners of color has increased from 6.2 percent to 12.8 percent. And 40 percent of our internal partnership promotions over the past twelve years have been women. We are working on this, and we have a long way to go… but we’re moving the needle in a significant way.

Blair said that he intends to address the issue of this “list” with the whole firm, later this week. “It ain’t easy, but people here have been running up the mountain.”

# Associates: You Are Not Your Billable Hours
## This is not a healthy way to survive as an attorney.

I think lawyers, generally speaking, are used to being graded all the way through high school and college and law school. They feel they need the feedback of ‘tell me I’m doing well.’ When you get to a lot of firms, that feedback is often how many hours you’re billing. It’s a tough line to walk and make sure you’re successful at many law firms. You feel like you’re competing with other associates. You want to send everybody the message that you work hard and should be valued. I think the culture is a product of the business model, and I don’t think it’s going away soon.

— Darwin Conner, chief diversity officer at Eversheds Sutherland and former attorney at Boston-based firm Sullivan & Worcester, commenting on associates and firms that [use billable hours as a “yardstick” for measuring success](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/23/us-lawyers-agree-please-stop-bragging-about-how-busy-you-are/) on the partnership track.

# You're Not Really Surprised Kamala Harris Is Getting Big Bucks From Biglaw, Are You?
## But will this help her in the polls?

It really shouldn’t be much of a surprise that the Democratic presidential candidate who is running the hardest on their accomplishments as a lawyer is winning in the category of Biglaw donations. Kamala Harris is leaning heavily into her time as a prosecutor — despite some progressives believing her time prosecuting the parents of truant children and then laughing about it is disqualifying — claiming she is the candidate “who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years.” Sure, there are other Dems in the field who are lawyers — some even [spent time in Biglaw themselves](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/06/the-biglaw-firm-with-2-dogs-in-the-hunt-for-the-democratic-nomination/) — but Harris’s theme of returning to the rule of law appears to be striking a chord in lawyers interested in contributing to a campaign this election season.

As [reported by](https://www.law.com/2019/08/07/how-kamala-harris-is-driving-big-law-campaign-donations/) Law.com, Harris has brought in almost $675,000 in donations from folks at Am Law 100 firms with Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, and Elizabeth Warren also cracking six figures from top law firms:

Between his campaign launch in April and the end of June, Biden, the former vice president and the leading candidate in national polls, raised $575,000 from the 2019 Am Law 100, an annual ranking of firms based on gross revenue. Biden’s haul was about $100,000 less than what Harris pulled in during the first six months of the year, according to a National Law Journal review of campaign contributions.

South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in more than $450,000 in the first half of the year from those same 100 law firms. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts raised about $125,000 from top law firms, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders pulled in more than $30,000.

While Harris’s messaging of law and order is likely appealing to lawyers, her husband has a lot of Biglaw connections, what with him being a Biglaw partner himself (Doug Emhoff is a partner in the Los Angeles office of DLA Piper) — and that helps:

“Her husband, a good friend of mine, is a highly regarded Big Law partner in L.A. So he’s got a good network of his own,” said Daniel Shallman, a partner in the Los Angeles office of Covington & Burling.

And she’s getting money from Biglaw attorneys with a background in political circles:

Her backers include Obama-era Justice Department veterans such as Ronald Machen, who served from 2010 to 2015 as U.S. attorney in Washington. Machen, now a partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, contributed $2,800 to the Harris campaign in March.

Harris also received contributions from law firm partners who worked closely with her sister Maya’s husband, Tony West, a former Obama-era associate U.S. attorney general who is now Uber’s general counsel. Jenner & Block partner Thomas Perrelli, who preceded West in the Justice Department’s third-ranking role, donated $2,800 to Harris in February. West’s successor, Stuart Delery, now a Gibson Dunn partner in Washington, gave $1,000 to Harris in March.

This all might be good news for Harris in the short term, but the actual primaries are months away. It remains to be seen if support in Biglaw can translate into a lead in the polls.

# Top 5 Reasons Why You Need To Flesh Out Your LinkedIn Bio
## Within 30 seconds of looking at a candidate’s LinkedIn page, you can tell if they are qualified and credible.

If you don’t flesh out your bio on LinkedIn, you should expect others to assume the worst about your background. From pitching for new business to considering job opportunities, the decision maker on the other side is judging your LinkedIn profile before you even show up. Would you show up to a business pitch with a hole in your suit, scuffed up shoes, and toilet paper hanging out of your pants? Then how can you have a bare-bones LinkedIn profile that reflects the same about you, your experience, and presentation?

Have you looked at your LinkedIn recently? What’s it look like? Is your photo professional enough? How about your “About” section? Current experience, education up-to-date? Any recommendation from colleagues? Are you a member of specific clubs and organizations? These are the type of things that decision makers look at in the modern, internet-driven, millennial world we live in today. As important as your physical résumé is, your LinkedIn bio is THAT much more important.

If your LinkedIn bio needs work, you are in luck.  Lateral Link is here to help make sure your LinkedIn doesn’t get in the way of you and your next “yes” moment.

- What does your photo say about you?
The first thing employers see when opening your LinkedIn page is your headshot. Keep in mind that LinkedIn is not Facebook or Instagram.  Even [John Quinn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnbquinn/), whose name really speaks for itself, still fleshes out his bio including a professional headshot. On the other hand, and leaving names aside, those downing shots on your Cabo trip with the Mariachi band, will say the opposite. Make sure your photo is similar to what you would look like the day you walk in for the in-person interview. Also, right below the photo, is your current title. Keep it short and right to the point. Save the detailed information about yourself for the “About” section. Check out Michael Allen’s profile, for example.



- Tell your story in under 200 words.
Do you think it is important for people to know exactly what your title in the above section entails? Of course, it is! The “About” section is what you want people to know about you. Are you a CEO like Michael Allen? Great! CEO of what? What does your current position mean? This section should have a short write-up of you, what you do currently and how people can reach you. Sell yourself and make yourself easily reachable.



- Where have you worked?
This section has the potential to separate you from all other applicants. It is vital that your experience is up-to-date and accurate. List all former employers, the correct duration you were at each job and a brief description of what you did at each job. You might find yourself repeating some of the tasks, but that is okay. Also, I cannot stress enough to list all the jobs where you have worked. [Mary Barra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-barra-29469712/), CEO of General Motors (GM), not only lists all the different positions she has held during her GM career but provides a full description of what each position required. Look at our CEO, Michael Allen, and how he displays, with great detail and accuracy, all he has done in his working career.  For example, here are just his most recent positions.



- Do you come with a recommendation?
LinkedIn has a feature that allows others to toot your horn for you. Self-puffery isn’t credible. I came across a legitimate M&A partner from a Valley firm the other day who was more than generous pounding his chest with his achievements. That’s a turnoff. But, if [Brad Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradsmi/) of Microsoft said the same about the partner, that would go a long way. Letter of recommendations are still important to employers, and LinkedIn makes that process easy. The website has a section at the bottom of your page that displays reviews and recommendations about you and your job skills from credible sources (which requires you to know credible sources).



- How about your accomplishments?
This part might not help everyone, but if you are a member of interesting organizations and have other accomplishments, then list them. Not everyone belongs to country clubs and wine societies, but these kinds of memberships say a lot about a person (where the frequent, who they know, and what they like). For example, if you are a member of the [Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323401904578157141215097954), like our CEO, Michael Allen, then you want to share that in case there are others who also belong and share this affinity. For example, there are more than a few chairman of firms and prominent lawyers in this group, and sharing membership to this society creates a bond. The same applies to non-profits, social organizations, and the like. If you are aiming for that board position, you can really separate yourself from other candidates by listing your outside activities. Take a quick look at the accomplishments of our CEO, Michael Allen. I imagine there are lots of folks reading this article who also share the same ones. That makes use feel closer to one another and creates a warm affinity.



By just going through this short exercise, you know more about Michael Allen’s professional background and accomplishments than probably most of his family members. Most people don’t share these types of things when first meeting in person or over Thanksgiving. That’s crude. But it’s not crude, and in fact, is expected that you broadcast your background on LinkedIn. Decision makers will review your bios. They will pass judgment quickly. Within 30 seconds of looking at a candidate’s LinkedIn page, you can tell if they are qualified and credible. The sad part is when someone who is otherwise qualified is judged incorrectly for not having fleshed out their bio on LinkedIn. It is as important a tool as anything today and you should use it to its fullest potential.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Postpones The Official Reopening Of Its Offices Until 2022
## Is this a trend in the making?

Hour by hour, as billable time ticks away, Biglaw leaders have an important decision to make. Will they further postpone their planned office reopenings due to the hyper-contagious Delta variant of COVID-19? By all accounts, it’s looking more and more like the answer is a resounding “yes.” But just how far out are some firms willing to delay their return to the office?

Maybe things will be better next year.

Perkins Coie, for example, has its sights set on a January 2022 reopening. Attorneys and staff were originally supposed to return to the office on October 4. Instead, the top 50 Am Law firm will join the small handful of other firms that will forgo office life for all of 2021. These firms include Cahill, Cooley, Sanford Heisler, and Willkie.

A spokesman offered the firm’s reasoning to [Bloomberg](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/perkins-coie-says-lawyers-staff-can-stay-home-rest-of-year): “Our goal remains to protect the health and safety of all our attorneys and professional staff, while ensuring continuity of service to our clients.” For the time being, those who do enter any Perkins Coie office must be vaccinated (effective October 1) and masked.

Which firm will be the next to put off its return to the office until next year? With the way things are going, it might be a good idea….

Help us help you. Let us know what your firm is doing to protect employees and adjust to the new normal during this unprecedented moment in time.

# Lawyers Have Done Some Pretty Stupid Things Lately
## Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time for your idiocy, lawyers.

When I was a baby deputy district attorney way before many (or at least a lot) of you were born, our office had a couple of sayings that have just as much application today as 40 years ago. One was “don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.” The other was “felony stupid.”

Not in the criminal category, but definitely in the stupid column was the Utah Bar’s [giant whoops of an email](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/utah-bar-determines-they-werent-hacked-human-error-led-to-boobs-email/) sent to all Utah lawyers. To the bar’s chagrin, the story did make headlines and prompted a [raft of jokes](http://fox13now.com/2018/03/06/lawyers-who-received-accidental-email-of-womans-breasts-speak-out/) about the errant email. And who says that lawyers don’t have a sense of humor?

Here’s a lawyer who fits both the “felony stupid” and the “don’t do the crime” profiles. Although he hasn’t been charged with any crime yet, this dude is looking at more trouble with the Ohio Bar, a feat considering that [he’s already been disbarred](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/disbarred-attorney-got-drinks-played-with-gun-tried-to-delete-video-evidence-after-someone-ended-up-dead-then-snuck-into-jail/). Any jurisdictional issue?    One’s head explodes with all the possible crossover bar exam questions.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
I’m waving the flag for all attorneys who just represent their clients to the best of their abilities, don’t get in trouble with the bar, and honor the oath they took when they were admitted. Novel concepts to some. This guy should never be readmitted.

An example of “don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time” is something that Jeffrey Wertkin has found out. He’s the Akin Gump new partner hire, formerly with the Department of Justice, who was so concerned about his ability to generate business that he [tried to sell copies of sealed DOJ whistleblower complaints](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-lawyer/lawyer-who-stole-u-s-whistleblower-lawsuits-receives-prison-term-idUSKCN1GK04E) to gin up his business development at the firm. Thirty months at Club Fed for Mr. Wertkin.

This case is Exhibit 1 for how not to develop business. We all know that attracting and retaining business is essential, but I think we can all agree (at least I hope we can) that this was the wrong way to do it. It wasn’t the devil that made Wertkin do it; he says stress was the culprit.

Is “stress” is now the excuse du jour? Raise your hand if you’re [under stress](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former_partner_blames_biglaw_stress_for_plot_to_sell_sealed_lawsuits_to_tar/). I see too many hands to count. However, how many of you would engage the conduct that is sending this guy to Club Fed? Hopefully, zero, zip, nada.

Another lawyer off to Club Fed is a former Foley & Lardner partner [convicted of insider trading](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/former_biglaw_partner_gets_prison_time_in_insider_trading_scheme/). Obviously, I’m dumb as a rock since I need someone to explain to me why Biglaw partners need to do the crime and then do the time. Even non-equity partners in Biglaw make way [more than the average American worker](http://www.deptofnumbers.com/income/us/), so I’m clueless as to the circumstances that prompted these former Biglaw partners to cheat.

On trial for allegedly killing his wife and other assorted felonies is former Biglaw partner Claud “Tex” McIver. This should be a fascinating trial to follow, given the [facts and statements](https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/prospective-jurors-quizzed-tex-mciver-murder-case/Xl3fMnVXPAyUOr4bavw5zO/) that McIver has already made. True crime aficionados, of whom there are many, should be drooling. Will he or won’t he take the stand?

How would you like, as part of your sentence, to tell every one of your clients that you are a “crook, cheat, a liar, and a thief?” That’s a condition that the judge imposed back in November 2015 when he sentenced a Wisconsin lawyer to, among other things, five days in jail. However, that mantra didn’t seem to work, for now the suspended lawyer has been charged with [forging a judge’s signature on a plea deal](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer_is_accused_of_forging_judges_signature_to_back_up_his_false_claim_on/?utm_source=maestro&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=daily_email/). And no, I’m not kidding.

When is the term “meatballs” code for a bribe or actually refers to the food that often sits on top of spaghetti or in a sandwich? When it becomes an issue in a [bribery trial](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/pennsylvania_mayor_is_convicted_in_scheme_to_solicit_donations_in_exchange/) involving the Allentown, Pennsylvania, mayor and a lawyer, and I am not making this up. I’m just not that creative.  The mayor was convicted of 47 of the 54 charges against him, while the lawyer was convicted of bribery and conspiracy. The lawyer is now out of a job.

As a mediator, I see lawyers who take a client’s case personally (bad idea) and sometimes unload verbally on opposing counsel. (Worse idea if the goal is to try to settle the case.) However, I have yet to see, and I trust I never will see, a lawyer who unloads on opposing counsel by using a gun. This lawyer, apparently a Marine sniper by training (not the law school kind), is accused of [firing several shots at the office of opposing counsel](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer_said_to_be_a_marine_sniper_is_accused_of_firing_shots_at_office_of_a/) because he was pissed off by the opposing lawyer’s comment about case handling. No one was injured, but bar complaints are already pending against the shooter, and this incident will just be one more.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Do you think that anyone has a filter any more or does everyone just spew out whatever comes to mind without stifling oneself to avoid inappropriate remarks? I guess not, if these two stories are any examples. Why is it now “ready, fire, aim?”

Have social media and the ability to just blurt out whatever [random neural firings](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/judges_explanation_for_denying_no_cost_bail_leads_to_call_for_his_resignati/) occur obviated the need for consideration before speaking? I guess so.

Here’s another example of “ready, fire, aim.” This lawyer says that white people are the chosen people and “….that it doesn’t involve hatred of other races, even of ethnic Jews.”  (What? Jews are a “race”? My parents never told me that I was part of a racial minority; a religious minority, yes.) The [lawyer chastises Jews](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/lawyer_representing_neo_nazis_declares_that_white_people_are_the_chosen_peo/) for their “un-Christian like influence.”  (Thank you for sharing.)

We dinosaurs passed the character and moral fitness test many, many years ago, long before social media and Google. Given those outlets today and given the predilection for incivility and just downright nastiness today, as well as the apparent penchant for some lawyers to break the law, do you wonder whether any of us could pass the character test today? I do.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Why Trump Could Avoid State Criminal Liability If He's Re-Elected President
## Putting Trump behind bars will not be an easy feat to accomplish.

I admit it: I’ve been sitting here fat, dumb, and happy. I assumed that if Donald Trump were re-elected president in 2024, he could then evade federal criminal liability — but he’d still be liable for any convictions under state law. Thus, if Trump were convicted by the Manhattan District Attorney for the charges related to the hush money paid to Stormy Daniels, or if Trump were convicted in the indictment for election interference likely to be handed down shortly by a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, there would be no way for Trump to avoid the punishment in those cases.

But along came the recent article by [Paul Rosenzweig in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-2024-election-candidacy-criminal-appeal/674827/) showing that I haven’t been thinking hard enough. Rosenzweig devotes the bulk of his article to explaining how a re-elected Trump could stop federal criminal prosecutions against him. Even if Trump were convicted in some federal criminal case before Election Day, he probably wouldn’t yet be imprisoned; appeals would be pending. And the instant Trump became president, he’d tell the Department of Justice to dismiss the cases against him. (Alternatively, Trump could try to pardon himself, which might actually work. In any event, a self-pardon would, at a minimum, raise an issue that would linger in the courts for years until the Supreme Court decided if a self-pardon was constitutional.) If re-elected, Trump would never do jail time in a federal case.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Until I read Rosenzweig’s article, however, I hadn’t considered the difficulties in jailing Trump even if he were convicted before Election Day in a state criminal proceeding. Assume that Trump is convicted either in New York or Georgia before Election Day. Appeals would still be pending as of Election Day, and Trump is very unlikely to be imprisoned while those appeals were pending. Prompted by Trump, the Department of Justice would instantly raise constitutional objections to permitting state prosecutors to pursue the president while he was in office. If state prosecutions of a sitting president were permissible, what’s to stop some lunatic state prosecutor from pursuing a criminal case against Joe Biden tomorrow? The state prosecutions might legitimately be shut down because they may be impermissible.

Moreover, if Trump were prosecuted in Georgia, Trump could encourage the Republican-led Georgia state government to pass legislation barring any state prosecutor from pursuing a sitting president while he was in office. Or the state legislature could remove, or limit the power of, the Fulton County District Attorney. Fearing a mean tweet or some other presidential retribution, state legislators might well do Trump’s bidding.

New York, a Democratic-led state, poses a trickier problem for Trump, but perhaps not an insurmountable one. For starters, the charges against Trump in New York may be defeated on legal grounds or, even if Trump were convicted, might not result in jail time. Rosenzweig suggests other things that Trump could do to shut down proceedings — such as withdrawing federal law-enforcement funding from New York or telling the FBI not to assist with cooperative investigative efforts.

But just a few more minutes’ thought suggests a multitude of other things that a vindictive president could do to bludgeon an uncooperative state. For example, why should Trump ever declare an emergency when a storm hits in New York? If a district attorney in New York were prosecuting Trump, then Trump could refuse to authorize disaster-relief funds for New York. New York’s a solidly Democratic state, so the state would never vote Republican in an election anyway. Who cares if New Yorkers come to dislike Trump even more violently than they do now? Screw ’em.

So please don’t rest comfortably, as I was, assuming that Trump can’t evade liability in criminal prosecutions pursued at the state level. I fear that re-election could, indeed, be Trump’s get-out-of-jail free card.

# Biglaw Lawyers Must Return To The Office To Justify Management's Reckless Office Space Leases

After posting record profits with attorneys working from home, Biglaw firms embarked on an effort to force associates back into the physical office that Inspector Javert feels might be over-the-top. Firms have announced [paranoid surveillance initiatives](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/biglaw-firms-three-day-office-workweek-descending-into-paranoid-surveillance/), placed [bonuses in jeopardy](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/simpson-thacher-bonus-attendance/), and even [hinted at threatening job status](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/biglaw-firms-are-coming-for-associate-jobs-bonuses-based-on-office-attendance/).

Working from home proved a success during the pandemic because trained professionals thrive in that environment. They don’t have to commute and they can get their work done without wasting time keeping lonely partners company throughout the day with unnecessary meetings and drop-bys. That said, working from home presented training challenges for younger lawyers that need colleagues down the hall to teach the soft skills of being an attorney. The three- or four-day in-office work week emerged as a viable compromise.

But the key to a reduced in-office presence is reducing office size. That’s where Biglaw firms have [failed spectacularly](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/05/15/us-law-firm-leasing-strengthens-in-q1-outpacing-pandemic-levels/):

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…

U.S. law firm leasing activity in key markets during the first quarter of 2023 was the strongest since before the pandemic, and markedly higher than the fourth quarter of 2022, Savills Legal Tenant found in its latest report.

During Q1, legal sector leases of 20,000 square feet or more totaled 1.6 million square feet, up 45% from 1.1 million square feet in Q4 of 2022, and above the 1.4 million square foot average through the pandemic, according to the Savills U.S. Law Firm Activity Report Q1 2023.

In a similar report, another commercial real estate company, Cushman & Wakefield, reported this month that leasing volume during the first quarter of 2023 was higher than in any previously recorded Q1. That report looked at leases of 10,000 square feet or more.

No, no, no, no, no. The advantage of a three-day office schedule is in cutting back! Instead, law firms have embraced the worst of all possible worlds, opting for a reduced office work week while mandating fixed attendance days requires the firm to maintain a full five-day office and leave it a ghost town for two more days.

The hybrid office opened the door to [hoteling options](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/managing-the-hybrid-office-of-the-future-with-a-couple-clicks/) that encourage smaller offices that are fully utilized throughout the week. Then the firm can slice overhead and potentially pass savings on to the client (or at least maintain current staffing while anticipating the market turnaround). It’s not like the clients are flocking to the office for in-person meetings anymore — those events became the first cost-cutting measures in-house law departments implemented when given an opportunity.

That the hoteling model provides associates with [the flexibility that they crave](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/cravath-backtracks-on-the-flexible-part-of-its-flexible-office-policy/) even more than the number of days working from home is just an added bonus.

Rather than take advantage of this, firms are spending money on offices like drunken sailors so everyone has a place to sit when they unnecessarily force the whole workforce into the same building three days a week.

And lawyers are now paying for these floorplans with their bonuses, just so the management can justify keeping their sweet corner offices.

I suspect I’m dating myself, but does anyone else remember the Peanuts cartoons?  Specifically, that endlessly repeated gag (more like heart-wrenching tragedy) of Lucy offering to hold the football for poor, hapless Charlie Brown so he can kick it?  Of course, she winds up pulling it away just in time for him to miss the kick and fly through the air screaming, then land in a heap, bruised and miserable, furious at himself for placing his trust once again in a faithless so-called friend.

Law firms do that.  I mean, they do the Lucy bit, with the football.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“So… when you say he promised you’d be elevated to partner,” I asked one client just the other day, “do you mean, as in, he actually promise promised to make you partner… or just sort of implied strongly it would happen?”

My client’s response was unequivocal:  “He promised.”

I fumbled for wiggle room. “But can he do that?  How much capital does this guy have at the firm to burn on elevating one of his own?”

My client wasn’t taking wiggle for an answer:  “He’s the managing partner of a smallish firm.  He can elevate whomever he wants.”

Wait.  Hang on… one more question:  “Did he specify when he’d make you partner?”

Now I had him.  Because the unfailing law firm answer to any question regarding something good that’s going to happen to you (i.e., not to them) is:  Not now… but soon.

Promising stuff to you (not now, but soon) is actually a key law firm technique for getting what they want from you (immediately).

The looming temporal gulf between what they offer to you and what they demand from you is acute.  It is stark.  It is striking.

Compare and contrast:

The stuff they offer to you will arrive whenever they please, which seldom means anytime remotely contemporaneous with the current era.  (And, no, don’t bother them about it, or they might change their minds.)

The stuff they require from you, on the other hand, will happen immediately.  This very minute.  As in, I’m aware it’s Saturday night, and no, I don’t care.  I’m not asking — that’s me being polite.  I’ll have it Monday morning or you’re fired.

That kind of right now.  Law firm right now.

Returning for a moment to those lovely, tasty things that they’re promising to you…  It’s worth asking just how long a period of time not now, but soon can be drawn out to occupy, at least in the minds of those who run law firms.

In celebration of American Lawyer’s 40th anniversary, ALM has collected a treasure trove of Biglaw data. What was the average profit per equity partner for the Am Law 50 in 1985?

Hint: In 2019, the PEP for the Am Law 50 is $2,539,220 — but it wasn’t that much back in 1985.

# There's A New Biggest Law Firm (By Gross Revenue) In Town
## The revenue increase was largely driven by the firm growing its headcount to almost two thousand lawyers last year.

Kirkland & Ellis had a helluva 2017. Their gross revenue shot up an impressive 19 percent — to $3.165 billion. This now makes them the world’s largest law firm by gross revenue, taking the top spot away from Latham & Watkins (just what the firm needs, [more bad news](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/03/latham-chiefs-undoing-began-by-offering-christian-reconciliation-help/)), beating them out by over $100 million.

K&E’s profits per equity partner also rose in 2017 — up 15 percent to $4.7 million. As [Law.com reports](https://www.law.com/2018/03/21/kirkland-overtakes-latham-as-worlds-biggest-firm-by-revenue/), the number increases were largely driven by growing its headcount to almost two thousand lawyers last year:

A main driver of Kirkland’s growth was its significant increase in head count, which rose 13.5 percent, to 1,997 lawyers. Even still, the firm’s premium practice groups, including litigation, private equity, public M&A and restructuring were able to keep those bodies busier than in years past, as revenue per lawyer rose 5.2 percent, to $1.585 million.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
It wasn’t that long ago — 2013, to be exact — that K&E crossed over into the $2 billion revenue club. For the math-phobic out there, that’s a 57 percent increase in gross revenue in just four years — and without a major merger to account for the sharp uptick. Instead, K&E offices in London, New York, San Francisco, and Houston have all been steadily growing, largely on the backs of their transactional practice:

Kirkland’s fastest-growing offices include London, which has grown 61 percent since 2013, to 189 lawyers last year; New York, where head count is up 42 percent over the past five years, to 503 lawyers; San Francisco, up 36 percent since 2013, to 126 lawyers; and Houston, where the firm now has 107 lawyers since setting up shop in 2014.

The firm’s decade-long transformation into a transactional powerhouse continued with one of its strongest years in private equity and public company M&A work. Kirkland’s M&A team ranked No. 4 by the value of the deals it advised on in 2017, according to data compiled by Mergermarket. Kirkland also advised on more transactions (489), than any other firm, and saw the largest increase in the value of the deals it advised on from the previous year (up 63.5 percent in 2017, to $432 billion).

Good work to all the lawyers at K&E, and congratulations on all your success.

# The Top Biglaw & Boutique Firms Headed Upmarket In Litigation (2024)

Thanks to a still uncertain economy, corporate practice is down right now but litigation continues to hum along quite nicely. As always, clients want the very best of the best when it comes to the law firms that are handling their litigation matters. According to a ranking from BTI Consulting Group, certain firms seem to be doing better than others in clients’ eyes when it comes to their grasp on novel work. From BTI’s [Mad Clientist](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/58-law-firms-moving-up-market-in-litigation) blog:

Clients are being more selective in who they want to hire — and want evidence beyond the number of cases tried to verdict. Only 58 firms managed to move up market — down from 70 just 2 years ago.

The upmarket firms increased their status as clients’ first choice and preferred provider….

These 58 firms are investing more to outpace clients’ rapidly changing needs. They talk to clients, provide early assessments, and help plan for what’s next. They share their knowledge and insight about new and novel claims they see. They shower their clients with knowledge and strategies.

# Parents In Law Firms: Taking Stock Of Pandemic Burdens And Retention Risks
## Being a parent in Biglaw has always had its challenges, but we saw these challenges rise to new heights during the pandemic, especially for women.

Being a parent in Biglaw has always had its challenges, but we saw these challenges rise to new heights during the pandemic, especially for women.  Even in the best of times, the legal industry has had an uninspiring record of retaining and promoting female lawyers: the National Association of Women Lawyers’ 2020 survey found that just 21% of equity partners were women.  But with many women in law straining to maintain intense practices while bearing the brunt of a pandemic-induced increase in childcare demands, even that modest progress may be in jeopardy.

On a personal level, I experienced these struggles firsthand, and I don’t even practice law anymore.  With two young children at home, two working parents, and little to no outside childcare help (the nanny market is almost as crazy as the lateral attorney market, but that’s another story), I found myself drowning in unchartered waters (hello e-learning)!  Even when splitting the days with my husband so we could both work part-time, it was virtually impossible to get any work done while trying to balance the unreasonable and insatiable demands of my children.  Thankfully, things have normalized a bit since the start of the pandemic, and for the first time in over a year, we are finally in a place where we have somewhat of a routine and the kids are out of the house for most of the day.  But I will never get that 15 months of my life back, and neither will the thousands of other attorney-parents.  It’s hard to quantify the career damage actually caused by COVID-19, but we do have some data which shines some light on this issue.

The toll on careers

A recently released [American Bar Association survey](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/digital-engagement/practice-forward/practice-forward-survey.pdf) gives some indication of the impact of pandemic stress on women and parents.  The survey was administered in October 2020 to over 4200 ABA members, of whom 43% identified as female.  It revealed that female respondents were significantly more likely than men to have taken on additional childcare during the pandemic (on top of the already unequal load that they were bearing pre-pandemic).  Women were also more likely to report that, relative to a year earlier, they found themselves thinking more often that it would be better to work part-time or not at all.  42% of female respondents said they more often or much more often thought it would be better to work part-time, not full-time.  37% more often or much more often thought it would be better to stop working.

These effects were particularly stark for parents of the youngest children.  53% of women with children age 5 or younger reported thinking it might be better to work part-time than full-time.  If these parents are having doubts about maintaining their current practices, the threat to firms’ future gender diversity at the senior levels could be significant.  After all, these women are the future of firm partnerships—if the firms can retain them.

How are law firms responding?

Some firms have stepped up to provide parents with additional resources during the pandemic.  In particular, firms have sought to ease some of the burden of online schooling, with support such as paying for tutoring sessions and loaning hardware for employees’ children to use.  Firms have also bolstered internal peer support networks and sponsored sessions with external well-being coaches.

Going forward, firms may wish to consider making some of those measures permanent.  Respondents to the ABA survey requested assistance such as back-up childcare and tutoring support, stipends to help defray childcare and elder care costs, parental support workshops, and adding more months of paid parental leave that can be taken to cover childcare gaps.

To the extent parents remain on the fence about whether to stick with their legal careers, firms will need to think creatively about retention strategies.  One obvious target for improvement is flex-time and part-time work arrangements.  These are hardly new concepts, but prior implementations have been uneven at best.  Too often, parents—and especially women—receive the implicit message that taking advantage of these programs will permanently damage their career trajectory.  This reduces participation and makes those who do shift to a more flexible schedule stand out even more.  Even in situations where part- or reduced-time schedules are implemented, it’s often the case that these attorneys end up working full-time hours, without the full-time salary, further disincentivizing these types of arrangements.

Law firms need to commit to changing the culture around these programs and demonstrating that careers can thrive both during and after a stint of modified workload.  If the pandemic has taught us one thing about work, it is that there are multiple ways to achieve the necessary output.  Firms should extrapolate from the pandemic experience and embrace a range of flexible models.  Not only is this the humane thing to do, but it’s also a smart competitive move in a tight talent market.  Firms should be eager to continue to capitalize on all of the training they have invested in their female lawyers.  This is a much less expensive path than driving out parents and then trying to replace them with lateral hires.

How can Lateral Link help?

At Lateral Link, we are in constant conversation with partners and associates at Biglaw firms, mid-size firms, and boutiques all over the country, so we have reliable information on which firms are most supportive of parents.  All firms claim to support women and parents, but the reality is that some execute on those promises more effectively than others.  If your firm is not offering the support you need, we encourage you to explore your options.  A long-term law firm career is not for everyone, but if you’re feeling burned out, it’s worth learning about alternatives to your current firm before making a decision to leave the law.  Please feel free to reach out to me or any of my colleagues to discuss your unique situation.

# Two Biglaw Firms Sued Over Diversity Initiatives
## Affirmative action in college was only the first target.

Two major Biglaw firms are facing separate lawsuits over their diversity programs. Edward Blum, who founded Students for Fair Admissions — the plaintiff in the recent Supreme Court case that dismantled college affirmative action — also founded The American Alliance for Equal Rights, the group currently suing Perkins Coie and Morrison Foerster for their efforts to diversify the legal profession.

The case against [Perkins Coie](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/AmericanAllianceforEqualRightsvPerkinsCoieLLPDocketNo323cv01877ND?doc_id=X5M6M083QU69CPPHGG7SAU0P09I) was filed in the Northern District of Texas, while the one against [Morrison Foerster](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/AmericanAllianceforEqualRightsvMorrisonFoersterLLPDocketNo123cv23/1?doc_id=X1Q6OK647V82) was filed in the Southern District of Florida. Both lawsuits take aim at diversity fellowships at the firms, asserting, “This kind of rank discrimination was never lawful, even before SFFA v. Harvard held that colleges cannot use race in admissions.”

The lawsuits come after Senator [Tom Cotton threatened Biglaw firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/tom-cotton-threatens-top-biglaw-firms-over-their-diversity-inclusion-initiatives/) over their DEI initiatives. However, the industry[ hasn’t done much](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-firms-dont-seem-to-care-about-tom-cottons-anti-diversity-legal-threats/) more than shrug in response to that threat.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
As [reported by](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/perkins-coie-morrison-foerster-sued-by-blum-over-dei-programs) Bloomberg Law, Perkins has continued to support its programs following[ the recent Supreme Court case](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/first-they-came-for-affirmative-action-then-they-came-for-legacy-admissions-good-riddance/?amp=1):

Perkins Coie posted on its website “we re-affirm our commitment to building a more diverse and inclusive workplace and legal profession” following the Supreme Court’s decision. The Seattle-founded firm has diversity fellowships for 1L and 2L students from underrepresented backgrounds, according to the firm’s site.

Neither Perkins Coie nor MoFo have yet to respond to the suits.

If you’re looking to pencil in a get together with a London-based Kirkland & Ellis associate, be sure to find someplace with a late night kitchen, because your droog isn’t getting out of the office any time soon.

Our friends at Legal Cheek are in the midst of rolling out a good deal of research they’ve collected over the last several months about the life of London Biglaw solicitors. Their latest finding attempts to answer the burning question: Who is working their associates the hardest?

Sure, everyone knows there are long hours in Biglaw, but we rarely make a concerted effort to track the average times that lawyers clock in and out of work. Here are just the top five firms organized by latest average departure time (the [full list](http://www.legalcheek.com/2016/10/revealed-top-law-firms-average-arrive-and-leave-the-office-times/) is available at Legal Cheek):

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
LAW FIRM	AVG. ARRIVAL TIME	AVG. LEAVE TIME
[Kirkland & Ellis](http://www.legalcheek.com/firm/kirkland-ellis/)	9:44am	9:14pm
[Freshfields](http://www.legalcheek.com/firm/freshfields/)	9:14am	8:57pm
[Clifford Chance](http://www.legalcheek.com/firm/clifford-chance/)	9:27am	8:56pm
[White & Case](http://www.legalcheek.com/firm/white-case/)	9:20am	8:55pm
[Latham & Watkins](http://www.legalcheek.com/firm/latham-watkins/)	9:21am	8:54pm
While Kirkland may be letting the kids out of school the latest, it’s actually Freshfields that’s holding them the longest with an 11 hour 43 minute average workday, which works out to around 3,000 hours over the course of the year.

And that’s all billable too. You know, if associates are dutifully [billing all their bathroom breaks](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/biglaw-firm-tells-lawyers-to-bill-clients-for-time-spent-on-toilet/)…

The majority of Biglaw firms have rolled back their COVID-19 austerity measures the world over, but the coronavirus-related changes are far from over. With employees set to be working from home for the indefinite future, restructuring is now the name of the game, and at some firms, that means layoffs.

That’s what’s happening at Norton Rose Fulbright, a firm that placed just outside the top 10 in the most recent Am Law 100 rankings. NRF is conducting a restructuring in its Europe, Middle East, and Asia (EMEA) offices, and more than 130 jobs will be lost in the process. Most of the cuts will be made in the firm’s London office.

It’s not just staff members who will be feeling the pain of these cuts — some attorneys are affected as well. [Legal Week](https://www.law.com/international-edition/2021/01/15/norton-rose-cuts-132-roles-london-hit-hardest/) has more information:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
In total, the firm has scrapped 24 legal PAs, 19 fee-earners including counsels and associates, and 89 business services functions across the U.K., Europe, Middle East and Asia arm. The arm’s managing partner, Peter Scott, told Law.com International that the individuals affected have been offered a “generous package” as part of the process.

Scott noted that the cuts weren’t a “direct response” to COVID, but came as part of a review into the firm’s business services functions, which just ended in December. “Our new operating model will help us serve our clients as effectively and efficiently as possible,” he said. “Unfortunately, a number of colleagues who have made important contributions will be leaving us. We have followed a process that is as fair, robust and sensitive as possible, to bring a swift resolution.”

Best of luck to all those affected by the layoffs at Norton Rose Fulbright.

If your firm or organization is slashing salaries, closing its doors, or reducing the ranks of its lawyers or staff, whether through open layoffs, stealth layoffs, or voluntary buyouts, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

# Top Biglaw Firm Finally Announces Market Raises, But Not All Associates Will See Market Money

It may be March, but Biglaw still isn’t done with associate salary increases. The latest firm to announce raises is none other than Reed Smith, a firm that brought in $1,417,599,000 gross revenue in 2022, putting it at No. 29 in the most recent Am Law 100 ranking. According to our sources, the firm’s latest scale is… interesting, to say the very least.

Back in 2021, Reed Smith adopted the then-market standard salary for first-year associates, but compensation for the rest of its lawyers was left “unclear” as the firm [restructured salaries](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/reed-smith-raises/) across all of its offices. With the latest round of raises at the firm, effective July 1, 2024, it seems that associates have once again been left “unclear” on their compensation — but this time, it’s as to why they’re being sorted into the A squad and the B squad based on their billable hours. We believe that Reed Smith may be the first top Am Law firm to take such measures.

That being said, here’s what the latest salary scale looks like at Reed Smith. As you can see, it looks like a modified version of the Cravath scale, but it gets a little tricky when hours come into the equation.



Reed Smith’s most junior associates needn’t worry about their hours — they’re receiving straight Cravath matches. All other associates who bill 2,000 hours or more will be placed in Salary Level A — they, too, will receive the standard Cravath match (save for the firm’s most senior associates, who won’t be seeing a $420K or $435K salary). Associates who bill less than 2,000 hours will be placed in Salary Level B, which offers tens of thousands of dollars less in compensation than a standard market salary match. Yikes! On the bright side, if someone in Salary Level B is able to attain 2,000 hours, they’ll receive a bonus equal to the difference between the B scale and the A scale.

What’s been made clear is that Reed Smith wants associates to bill, baby, bill. If they do, they’ll be rewarded with handsome salaries, but if they don’t, they’ll be relegated to the firm’s B squad. Congratulations to those in Salary Level A, and best of luck to those in Salary Level B.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of compensation updates, so when your firm announces or matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus/Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus/Matches”).

# Sorry, Associates, But Fall Bonuses Are Probably Over

Some firms didn’t want or need to give the bonuses so they didn’t. And then, once firms like those three did not give them, it was cover for most firms not to give them if they didn’t want to give them, and most didn’t want to give them.

— Kent Zimmermann, a legal consultant wth the Zeughauser Group, commenting on the recent [dearth of special fall bonuses](https://www.law.com/2020/10/07/as-some-leading-firms-abstain-for-now-are-the-fall-bonus-wars-over/) for associates after [Kirkland & Ellis](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/), [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/cravath-is-not-offering-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-pissed/), and [O’Melveny](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/omelveny-says-no-to-fall-bonuses-are-covid-appreciation-bonuses-over/) declined to match the Davis Polk scale. This week, both [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/paul-weiss-wont-be-offering-fall-bonuses-and-associates-are-angry/) and [Fried Frank](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/fried-frank-no-bonuses/) declined to match as well, with Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp noting that “[p]roviding a special cash reward in direct response to the pandemic does not feel right at this time.”

# The 2017 A-List Arrives To Salve That Itch You Had For Another Law Firm Ranking This Week

On Monday, Law360 ranked the [best law firms for women to make partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/best-biglaw-firms-for-women-who-actually-want-to-make-partner/), and on Tuesday, Working Mother ranked the [best law firms for women](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-50-best-law-firms-for-women-2017/), so obviously we needed another ranking to drop this week or lawyers across America would begin to suffer seizures. It seems like just [last week](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/lawyer-rankings-are-they-out-of-control/) we were having a serious industry conversation about the need to scale back rankings and awards. Life in this business comes at you fast.

Now we have the [2017 A-List](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202793476168/The-2017-AList/) from American Lawyer. Not [familiar with this one](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202793475850/Introducing-the-New-and-Improved-AList/)?

Our annual A-List ranking has always aimed to  highlight the most well-rounded firms—the best of the best, if you will. On this list, profits don’t reign supreme, nor does size.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
That would be the obligatory veiled reference to the [Am Law 200](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/the-2017-am-law-200-keep-calm-and-carry-on/) and the [NLJ 500](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/the-500-largest-law-firms/), two rankings put out by the very same company that produced this ranking. It’s that gentle lampshading that they’re fully aware that it’s ludicrous that they’re just pumping out rankings of the exact same firms because lawyers just can’t help but look at them.

Not that there’s anything wrong with a few rankings. We have a [law firm ranking here at Above the Law](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/2017-power-100-law-firm-rankings/), but that’s our only effort at ranking the overall quality of firms. And there’s nothing wrong with rankings that focus on specific metrics. The two rankings released earlier this week with the narrow focus on women in the law are valuable tools. But the “A-List” is just another attempt at bestowing some fictional “overall quality” measure on law firms by futzing with the methodology. It’s right there in the name!

Oh well. If this A-List isn’t a measure of financial success or headcount — seriously, the NLJ 500 is a counting exercise — then what is the A-List?

Since its inception, the A-List has recognized firms based on a combination of factors, both financial and cultural: [revenue per lawyer](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202784616999), [pro bono](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202791319011) commitment, [associate satisfaction](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202766010757) and racial [diversity,](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202786839599) with RPL and pro bono given double weight.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Sure. So it’s the richest firms tempered by a good citizenship measure.

Not to downplay the importance of pro bono work, but it seems arbitrary to give that double weight over diversity and satisfaction. If the goal is truly to recognize firm culture, their internal practices should matter more than their client representations, right?

This year, the A-List also includes a female equity partnership score, which seems like a natural fit for the philosophy of this ranking. Actually, it’s hard to believe they hadn’t been doing this before. It turns out this had a big impact on the list, pulling Paul Weiss into the top 10 and sending Milbank to the 11th slot.

The [full top-20 firms](http://www.americanlawyer.com/id=1202793476168/The-2017-AList/) and their scores are listed at the American Lawyer. But here’s the top 10 for your insatiable appetite for rankings:

1. Munger, Tolles & Olson
2. Ropes & Gray
3. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
4. Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr
5. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher
6. Debevoise  & Plimpton
7. Paul Hastings
8. Shearman & Sterling
9. Covington & Burling
10. Orrick,  Herrington  & Sutcliffe

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings.

# In-House's Long Kiss Goodbye
## Do in-house lawyers have more leeway to make mistakes than their Biglaw peers -- and if so, is this a good thing?

It is no secret the world of Biglaw can be ruthless. The hours are long, the path to the top is narrow, and a fall from grace can happen on a whim.

A dear Biglaw friend of mine recently informed me he had been summarily terminated from his job for making a mistake on a client’s account and losing their and his firm’s trust.

He was a first-time offender, so surely, I thought, his mistake must have been severe. A disclosure of trade secrets? A breach of privilege? A salacious affair with the client’s spouse?

Hardly.

Rather, my friend had timely filed a draft version of his client’s response rather than the final version the client approved. Never mind that there were only cosmetic differences between the two versions, in the client’s mind, the damage was done. And after reporting this “grave” offense to his firm, he was dismissed.

Was my friend’s error serious?

Sure, as attorneys we are trained to catch errors like his before they go out the door. But even though we like to think otherwise, we are human after all, and mistakes do occur.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Did my friend’s error merit immediate termination?

I contend that is debatable. While such mistakes may rise to the level of termination in the Biglaw world, I can bet that in most in-house operations, my friend would still have his job.

Whether it is due to working with, or sometimes reporting to, non-legal colleagues, I have noticed my in-house colleagues and I may get a bit more slack on a purely legal error than our Biglaw counterparts. Often our explanation of said error is aided in our ability to overstate the complexity of the matter to a non-attorney, but even when that is not the case, we tend to get more deference than we otherwise should.

And even if we make a grievous and seemingly unforgivable error, I have seen and heard of in-house being reassigned to less prominent roles or departments rather than being outright terminated.

In fact, I know of one such attorney who has been reassigned to several different departments in an effort to “find an area that better accommodates his unique skill set.”

He first started in contract negotiation, before it became apparent the basic elements of a contract escaped him. He was then moved to a risk mitigation role, which required him review patient safety reports to identify potential tortious claims, until his inability to spot a tort became a liability in and of itself. His final stop was the credentialing department, which requires little more of him than to verify that a given physician or nurse actually possesses the credentials they claim to have.

In my humble opinion, after the second or third unsuccessful attempt at finding an area more suitable to an in-house lawyer’s skill set, it may be time to recognize a lost cause when you see one and start fresh with a new hire. Clearly Biglaw gets it right in this regard.

But as someone who hopes my present employer never has to “find an area more accommodating of my skill set,” I would be lying if I said I was not thankful for the culture of second chances. This flexibility has allowed me to approve proposals that may make good business sense, even though legally I would rather be more risk-averse.

And besides, if I ever miscalculate and green-light something I should have declined, I know I have zero-tolerance Biglaw waiting in the wings to help.

I admit that I can’t find the quotation online. But I swear I heard this, years ago, about a great violinist:

“What do you want in life?”

“I want to play the violin.”

“Don’t you want to be happy?”

“I want to play the violin. If I play the violin, then I’ll be happy.”

Think about the law.

Years ago, I heard of a law firm that performed skits as part of a holiday party. In one of the skits, a person came out playing the part of the managing partner and wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with “Bill more time!”

That’s not very funny.

In fact, I suspect the law firm had lost its way.

Think again about the violinist.

“What do you want to achieve as a lawyer?”

“I want to win cases.”

“Don’t you want to make money?”

“I want to win cases. If I win cases, I’ll make plenty of money.”

Or perhaps:

“What do you want to achieve as a lawyer?”

“I want to produce top-notch legal work at the lowest possible price.”

“Don’t you want to make money?”

“I want to produce top-notch legal work at the lowest possible price. If I do that, I’ll make plenty of money.”

Which is the better motivation?

Which is the better way to live your life?

Which lawyer would a client prefer to hire?

As for me, I’ll play the violin.

Ed. note: This article is part of the [Introduction to Law School series, powered by Thomson Reuters](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/thomson-reuters-law-school-series/). 

We recently sat down with [Charlotte Rushton](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/author/charlotte-rushton/), Thomson Reuters managing director of large and medium law firms, to discuss trends in female leadership at law firms and ways to improve diversity to benefit today’s law school students.

How long have you been overseeing the Large Law segment at Thomson Reuters?

Two years, since September 2014. I’ve been with Thomson Reuters for nine years; I was previously the head of the Asia Pacific and EMEA Division for our tax and accounting business.

Tell us a little bit about what the Large & Medium Law segment does.

The Large & Medium Law segment is responsible for seeing that Thomson Reuters satisfies the needs of its large and midsize law firm customers. This includes account management, customer service and overseeing a product roadmap to satisfy customer needs, as well as focusing on sales and revenue growth to ensure that Thomson Reuters continues to invest in the products that the large and midsize customers value.

What trends have you seen in recent years with respect to the roles that women are playing at large law firms?

Honestly, there doesn’t seem like there’s been an awful lot of improvement in terms of management roles. Going back to the 1980s, the proportion of women going into law school was under 40 percent; it’s now much closer to 50 percent. Looking back 15 years, it’s been close to 50 percent that whole time — law school enrollment and recruitment have proportionally been about a 50-50 split between men and women. However, if you look into higher levels of the organizations, women make up approximately 18 percent of equity partners in the Am Law 200 and 4 percent of firm-wide managing partners. While these numbers are not unusual in business in general, the situation seems starkly bad in law firms in terms of getting women up the ranks.

Have the leadership numbers changed at all as female law school enrollment has gone up from 40 percent to 50 percent?

It has improved, but only very slightly. If you look at the last 15 years — the percentage of female equity partners was 16 percent in 2001, 17 percent in 2006, 18 percent in 2016 — so it has gone up 2 percent in 15 years. It will be a long time before we ever reach parity at that rate. Recent statistics from analysts looking at similar data in corporations have estimated that, at the current rate, it will take approximately 100 years to get to parity.

Are there other aspects of law firms that are catching up more quickly on the gender equality front?

Clients and general counsel of corporations have started to pay real attention to equality and diversity on the teams they hire. The hope is that this will start to drive change within the law firms. Thomson Reuters has launched an initiative called [Transforming Women’s Leadership in the Law](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/transforming-womens-leadership-in-law/), which strives to connect our clients from both the law firm and the general counsel sides. We run a series of programs to get both sides of the equation together to talk about how they can work together to facilitate change.

Within law firms, we have seen a focus on coaching, mentoring, and flexible working arrangements, which are all valuable — but influence from the clients is what can really help push diversity forward. The initiative has been really well received; the women on the general counsel side really want to help their counterparts on the law firm side bring in their business, and this helps open the door to that.

Where do you think the efforts would be best focused within the firms themselves in order to try to bring about change?

There’s no silver bullet, but in looking at other similar professions like accounting or consulting, the key thing is that they’ve really focused on the issue, through diversity initiatives and getting the whole firm involved to fix the problem. The one thing we’ve been very clear about in our initiatives is that it’s not about fixing the women, it’s about fixing the processes. So shining a light on it is step No. 1. Starting right from the managing partner down through the ranks, the firm needs to be committed to making diversity real.

After that, it’s a matter of adopting programs that can help with that, like flexible working arrangements or alternative career paths that are not seen as taking the easy option, where the possibility of becoming partner is still very real. Firms have to make some structural changes to really make change happen. Perhaps most importantly, it’s crucial to have the men involved — it can’t only be the women leading the women’s initiative.

The gender pay gap has taken center stage in recent months, and the call for equal pay is at an all-time high. Has this had any effect on the availability of leadership roles for women at law firms?

I speak to a lot of managing partners about this issue, and, without exception, they all want to make improvements. I do think it’s a really good time for women in law firms to really step up — they’re in a good position to fight for change because there’s such a spotlight on the issue right now. Firm management knows diversity and equality are good for business because clients are demanding it. And everyone knows that diversity of thought is good for case outcomes and the work you produce for clients.

Why is it important for law firms to have women in upper management roles?

From a business perspective, obviously it’s important because the clients are asking for it. You need to be able to satisfy those client needs. We’re seeing a lot more RFPs now that specifically request a diversity breakdown of the team that will be handling the client’s work.

It’s also necessary to have diversity of thought and approach in terms of how the firm is run and how the cases are run. We’re currently trying to do some work with McKinsey specifically related to law firms, but studies they’ve conducted in corporations have shown higher earnings for companies with more female executives. They saw a 66 percent increase in earnings for companies that were in the top quartile for number of female executives, as opposed to those companies that don’t have female executives.

Finally, it’s important for the younger women coming in to be able to look up and see that it’s possible to get to the top of the firm or be a partner. They need to have role models and sponsors and coaches who can show them how to do it.

With respect to showing a commitment to diversity, what factors should female law school graduates look for in potential employers?

First, look to see if there are senior women in the firm, and how many. Second, look to see if they’re focused on diversity and interested in it — do they have diversity programs, do they talk about diversity, does the managing partner speak about diversity being important? Third, look to see if the men are involved or if it’s just all about the women. If you see the [men supporting and driving advancement](http://legalexecutiveinstitute.com/events/engaging-male-champions/) for everyone in the firm, that’s a real bonus.

What advice would you give to women who are considering law school or are about to graduate and enter the legal market?

Go for it. It’s a tough and demanding career, but it’s really rewarding.

In terms of specific advice, try to be better at self-promotion. Speak in terms of “I” rather than “we;” get out of your comfort zone and talk about yourself. Focus on relationship-building, which is something that I think that starts in law school and continues through your whole career. Being able to bring in a book of business is ultimately how you progress once you’ve proven you’re a good attorney. It’s never too soon to start the networking and business-building part of the job.

Women can polish business development skills and work on developing client relationships right from law school. The connections you make there can become your book of business in the future. Surveys show that there’s a gap between men and women in terms of bringing in business, and it’s important to address that early on.

Most of all, have fun and take some risks!

# Former Associate Hits Biglaw Firm With Racial Discrimination Case After 'Dehumanizing' Email
## The complaint alleges the firm argued that it's not discrimination if the partner treats everyone terribly!

Former Troutman Pepper associate Gita Sankano filed a discrimination claim against her former employer in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The filing alleges Sankano, the D.C. office’s only Black female attorney suffered racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Washington, D.C., Human Rights Act.

The complaint alleges Sankano received positive reviews for her work in the Multifamily Housing Group in 2020 and 2021, but this changed after a senior partner retired and she began working for partner Matthew Bowsher. As [ reported by](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2024/01/17/troutman-pepper-sued-for-racial-discrimination-by-former-associate/) Law.com:

“Almost immediately Ms. Sankano began receiving belittling comments from Mr. Bowsher,” the suit claims, including “aggressive emails questioning her cognitive ability.”

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Sankano alleges that she received an “outrageously demeaning, dehumanizing, and demoralizing email” from Bowsher, and was fired when she complained about the behavior.

The email, included in the complaint, begins: “I’m concerned that you thought you were ‘clear’. In fact, you were the opposite of clear. And the fact that you still don’t see this upon further reflection, even after I’ve taken the time to point it out, is what worries me.”

“This is very basic, elementary communication. This has nothing to do with training, or understanding of multifamily transactional law, this is daily required functioning,” the email reads. “I am taking 20 minutes out of my morning right now to explain to you, in very clear objective detailed analysis, that when I see something like this, where it is so undeniably evident that you’ve made an obvious and surprising error, and you’re saying that you still don’t see the error even after I’ve taken the time to point it out to you, and you’re still saying you’ve done nothing wrong … I really just don’t know what more I can say here.”

After receiving the email, Sankano filed a complaint with HR. The retaliation the plaintiff says she received after complaining about the email from Bowsher forms the backbone of the complaint. The filing alleges the firm took “77 days to ‘investigate’ Mr. Bowsher’s discriminatory email.” The result of said investigation, according to the complaint, was that “while Mr. Bowsher’s email on August 3, 2023, was ‘inappropriate,’ it was not racist … they found that Mr. Bowsher treated people at his prior job in the same way, and thus he was not singling out Ms. Sankano.”

Listen, arguing the partner in question is a nondenominational asshole is certainly one defense, but maybe not the slam dunk you want it to be.

The complaint goes on to claim that the firm dismissed her as retaliation for her complaint.

“The purported basis for Ms. Sankano’s termination was performance, but this is a completely preposterous explanation,” the suit continues, providing multiple examples of Sankano’s positive work reviews garnered throughout her term at Troutman Pepper. “In the weeks leading up to Ms. Sankano’s termination she never received any negative comments regarding her work. In fact, during this time, Ms. Sankano accepted an award on behalf of the firm and even had discussions with firm leadership regarding being out on the ‘partner track.’”

Through a representative, the firm denied the allegations, “Ms. Sankano’s employment was terminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons based solely on her performance. We will defend ourselves vigorously in this case.”

The plaintiff is represented by Wigdor Law. Partner Michael Willemin offered this statement on the case, “It is pathetic that in this day and age law firms and other professional services firms continue to discriminate against Black women and, even more so, that they are unwilling to be the least bit introspective and remedy discrimination where it exists. Instead, firms all too often reflexively retaliate against women of color who, like Ms. Sankano, are brave enough to report discrimination in the workplace.”

Sankano also made a statement about her reasons for filing the case, “I’m filing this lawsuit to bring attention to the discrimination that Black female attorneys at Troutman Pepper, and Black professionals everywhere, continue to experience even now in 2024, as well as the callous disregard with which they are often treated when they push for workplace equality.”

# Will Cravath's Bigger Bonuses Be Big Enough To Make Associates Stay Put?
## And will these bonuses convince them to return to the office?

The annual bonus used to be pretty good at retention, but now breaking it up into seasonal bonuses just makes it all the more difficult for an associate to leave.

Firms are evaluating, ‘How do we keep associates? How do we get them to come back into the office?’ Bonuses could be a factor to that. There are still a significant number, whether it’s a majority or just a strong minority, that are not excited about going to the office.

— [Josh Holt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuarholt/), founder of associate compensation tracker [Biglaw Investor](https://www.biglawinvestor.com/), commenting on the latest [year-end bonus scale](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cravath-to-pay-115-000-bonuses-for-associates-to-start-season), which was announced earlier this week by [Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/first-mover-on-bonus/), and is expected to be followed by many other Biglaw firms.

Earlier this week, Vault released its closely watched rankings of the [nation’s 100 most prestigious law firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/vault-100-rankings-the-most-prestigious-law-firms-in-america-2021/). It was there that we learned Cravath held onto its title as the most prestigious firm in America for the fifth year in a row, and that Skadden had edged out Wachtell from the No. 2 spot for the first time in the history of the rankings — by just 0.010 points.

But what if your firm wasn’t top-ranked in the Vault 100? Perhaps your firm isn’t the most prestigious, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have clout. Some law firms reign supreme when it comes to certain practice areas, and others are known to dominate entire regions of the country.

Which law firms are considered to be at the top of their game by practice area and region? Let’s find out!

For the purposes of the practice area ranking, Vault asked associates to vote for up to three firms they think of as the strongest in their own practice area, and the overall ranking indicates the firms that received the highest percentage of votes. Associates were not allowed to vote for their own firm, which we’re sure made many recovering gunners very, very sad. Current gunners may find this list useful if they know which area they’d prefer to practice in. Pay attention, prospective laterals, because this is useful for you, too.

We’ve picked out a dozen of the practice areas that were ranked by Vault (you can see the full list [here](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-practice-area/antitrust)):

Appellate Litigation: Gibson Dunn

Bankruptcy: Weil Gotshal

Energy, Oil and Gas: Vinson & Elkins

General Commercial Litigation: Quinn Emanuel

General Corporate Practice: Cravath

Intellectual Property: Fish & Richardson

International: White & Case

Labor and Employment: Littler Mendelson

Private Equity: Kirkland & Ellis

Real Estate: Fried Frank

Securities: Davis Polk

Tax: Skadden

Next up, we’ve got a ranking that matters to those who think “location, location, location” is the most important thing in life. Vault’s regional rankings are based on votes tabulated from associates who were asked to rate firms on a 1 to 10 scale based on their prestige within the region.

Here’s the list of prestige by region from Vault (you can see the full list [here](https://www.vault.com/best-companies-to-work-for/law/best-law-firms-in-each-us-region/atlanta)):

Atlanta: King & Spalding

Boston: Ropes & Gray

Chicago: Kirkland & Ellis

Florida: Holland & Knight

Mid-Atlantic: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom

Midwest: Jones Day

Mountain States: Gibson Dunn & Crutcher

New York: Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz

New York – Midsize: Pryor Cashman

Northern California: Morrison & Foerster

Pacific Northwest: Perkins Coie

South Atlantic: King & Spalding

Southern California: Latham & Watkins

Texas: Vinson & Elkins

Texas – Midsize: Susman Godfrey

Washington, DC: Covington & Burling

Congratulations to the firms that moved up in this year’s practice area and regional rankings, and congratulations to all the firms that made the cut in the first place. It must be nice to see which firms associates consider as their peers in prestige, and it must be even nicer for partners to know whose pricing models they need to undercut the next time around.

A whistleblower at Santander alleged that senior bankers went to a strip club and pressured junior colleagues to come along. This is the sort of inappropriate Mad Men-era behavior that law firms stamped out years ago. Banks, on the other hand, keep having allegations like these fall in their laps.

Santander hired Gibson Dunn to investigate the matter in what must have been a nightmare for whoever monitors the “research” billing code over there. In all seriousness, this is an employment discrimination matter when managers put juniors in the position of being rewarded explicitly or implicitly if they’re comfortable with some tawdry bonding and while leaving out those that aren’t.

But did the bank really need Biglaw for this one? It’s a testament to the blinkered thinking in legal departments that when faced with an incredibly mundane — except the subject matter — employment inquiry, the client still went with a top-dollar firm. But this was a golden opportunity to branch out from the existing stable of counsel and find a high-quality mid-sized or boutique firm to deal with the matter at a lower price point. Maybe Gibson Dunn handled this as a courtesy. Though if they did, we’d caution Santander that it’s because of a more lucrative relationship, not because Gibson Dunn is really into you.

Especially since the investigation seems to have fizzled.

The law firm interviewed several people involved in the night out and concluded there had not been explicit pressure exerted on junior staff members, the source added.

Shocking that discrimination didn’t take the form of “okay, everyone who follows me to the club gets promoted!” That’s generally not how that works, which is why most entities put “don’t take people to strip clubs” in their employee handbook to preemptively avoid these issues.

Maybe rewriting the handbook would be a good task for outside counsel.

# Biglaw Associates Are Being Rushed Back To Work In The Office -- But Why?
## What's going to be so different about the office now than before the pandemic?

Aren’t you excited to head back to the office? Oh, you’re not. But don’t you remember all of the super important professional development and mentorship opportunities you had when your the was packed full of associates and partners? Oh, no, you don’t. You must’ve had so much fun though when the office was hopping and full of life, right? Oh, it… it never really was. Aha. Interesting.

Wouldn’t you be surprised to learn that Biglaw offices were never really that full to begin with before the pandemic? It sure sounds like law firm leaders have some explaining to do.

Although many Biglaw firms are now mandating office work to return their highly animated in-person working environments that once pushed occupancy limits, a description like that wasn’t exactly a reality for the average firm. In fact, law firm consultant Kent Zimmerman of the Zeughauser Group [says](https://twitter.com/kentzimmermann/status/1460635670087712776) that “[m]any large US firms actually had less than 50% daily average attendance before the pandemic.”

The good news is that, as firms begin to urge attorneys back to the office for at least part of each week, the smart organizations are recognizing that the goal should not be to get back to normal, but rather to create a new, better normal in which in-person work serves a unique function.

The bad news is that not all of those organizations know what that function should be.

Many firms are trying to make the office a destination for associates in an attempt to “justify the commute.” Some are doing that by providing free meals and snacks and lightening up on their formal dress codes. Needles argues that’s not what justifying the commute for associates should mean.

What it should mean is providing opportunities for young lawyers to get quality facetime with partners and decision-makers, meaningful work and true hands-on training. Even for more senior lawyers, the goal should be have them connect with colleagues in ways that can’t easily be replicated on Zoom.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“The concept is trying to bring people back with a purpose, so you don’t have somebody who makes the commute, then realizes, ‘I could’ve done the exact same thing from home.’ I think that’ll be a challenge, and part of getting used to the return,” [said](https://www.law.com/2021/09/22/firms-will-bring-people-back-to-the-office-but-they-wont-be-the-same/) Joe Krasovec, managing partner at Schiff Hardin. “You’re not just showing up everyday. It’s not just a ritual. It’s, ‘OK, what am I doing today? Who is going to be there? What’s the interaction, and how will that make it better?’”

What is your law firm doing to make sure that when you do arrive to work in the office after all these months, it’ll be worth your while? Please let us know. You can [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com) or text us (646-820-8477). Thanks.

# Top 5 Biglaw Firm Makes It Rain On Associates With $215K Milbank Salary Match
## Money, money, money! Biglaw associates will see lots of it this winter.

Associates at Biglaw firms that weren’t among the first to match [Milbank’s new salary scale](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/alert-milbank-announces-salary-scale-increases-to-kick-off-the-new-year/) certainly had a long weekend — even associates at some of the wealthiest law firms in the country. Luckily, one of our nation’s Biglaw behemoths just came through for its U.S. associates.

Baker McKenzie, a firm that brought in $2,899,834,000 gross revenue in 2020, making it the No. 4 firm in the latest Am Law 100 ranking, announced today that it would be matching the new prevailing salary scale. The firm matched the moment Davis Polk one-upped Milbank during the [last round of raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/06/the-first-biglaw-firm-to-make-it-rain-on-associates-with-a-205k-davis-polk-salary-match/), and this time, took the weekend to let the dust to settle before matching.

Here’s Baker McKenzie’s new salary scale:



The firm’s salary increases are retroactive to January 1, and associates will see more money in their February 11 paychecks. Congratulations to everyone!

(Flip to the next page to see the full memo from Baker McKenzie.)

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Milbank) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Milbank”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

Thursday night is ending with a bang as more firms announce holiday bonuses and solidify the market standard.

This time it’s my old firm, Cleary Gottlieb, informing all associates in good standing on its U.S. pay scale that they will be getting a little extra in their December 23, 2022 paychecks.

In accordance with our usual practice, let’s point out that Cleary brought in $1,418,818,000 for 2021, placing 29th on the Am Law 100.

Without further ado, lets show those numbers!



Full memo on the next page.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of this stuff. So when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

# Be Nice To Your Interns; One Day They Will Be Attorneys
## In a profession where reputation matters so much, small things can make a big difference.

As summer sadly begins to draw to a close, I write to offer a humble reminder to my in-house and Biglaw colleagues alike: be nice to your interns (or externs, summer associates, or whatever you call them in your organization; in my workplace, they’re law clerks).

Sure, on a basic human level, it is the right thing to do. They have likely spent the last few months performing menial tasks with minimum thanks. The least we can do is send them off with a proper good-bye.

But on a more selfish note, your failure to do so could come back to haunt you in the future.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Without a doubt, any law clerk worth their salt has likely let you know they want a job after they graduate. If you are in a Biglaw firm, and the clerk has managed to avoid any catastrophic errors or getting too drunk at an office outing, there is a good choice they will receive an offer of employment and join you as a colleague in a matter of months. Likewise, if you are in-house and grow fond of your clerk, you will probably attempt to hire them after they graduate.

In either scenario, do you really want your former clerk spending his or her first days in the office recounting to his now colleagues just how big of a jerk you were when they were nobodies?

Even if the clerk has proven time and again they are not suited for post-graduation employment with your specific employer, it is still worth your while to be kind to them on their way out the door. While you may not want to hire that particular clerk, you may be interested in hiring a friend of theirs from school.

And if one thing is certain, it is that law students talk. Having a former clerk sing your praises only helps with current and future recruiting efforts. Likewise, having a clerk share horror stories of how you berated them for hours on end for taking a Friday off so they could attend a funeral will likely limit your future applicant pool. While we may think it unfair, the words of a perceived incompetent clerk matter amongst their peers.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Finally, even if you never plan to hire your clerk, or could not care less what they tell their friends back at school, keep in mind that the law clerk will likely be an attorney practicing in your local community in just a few short years.

Receiving a call or email from a former clerk, now turned opposing counsel, is bound to go more smoothly when you both parted amicably. And again, not to beat a dead horse, but that former clerk and now attorney can either choose to share fond or foul memories of their time with you to his new colleagues.

In a profession where your reputation matters, even these small things can make a big difference.

So before those clerks whose names you’ll barely remember return for the fall semester, feed them and thank them. Take them out to lunch, listen to their stories from the summer, and tell them how much you valued their time and their work. Even if you ignored them all summer, there is still time to make a good lasting impression.

Besides, you never know which of them might grow up and become a judge.

I speak with Stacey Breen, Managing Director at Major Lindsay & Africa, about the twists and turns of her career that led her to her role at MLA, and the motivation behind their recent Return to Office Survey. We discuss the most surprising results of the survey, including generational differences in pandemic experiences. Additionally, we talk about some of the challenges women faced during COVID and what the industry can do to fix them as we return to the office.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Happy listening!

Which Biglaw firms are most beloved by general counsel for their superior client service? If that seems like it was a steep hill to climb during the pandemic, that’s because it was. The BTI Consulting Group set to find out which firms handled the task with ease with its latest ranking, the Client Service A-Team. In case you’re unfamiliar with this ranking, it measures the top 30 law firms corporate counsel identify as delivering the very best in terms of client service.

To compile the ranking, BTI Consulting spoke with almost 250 legal decision-makers who were asked to name firms that excelled in 17 different client-service-related activities, seven of which reigned supreme above all overs, including: mobilizing resources quickly, fielding the absolute best team, quickly assessing the situation, a commitment to help, delivering value for the dollar, client focus, and understanding the client’s business.

So, which firms are considered the best of the best when it comes to client service? Per BTI Consulting, the firms that made the latest top 30 ranking performed 9 to 15 times better than the typical firm in terms of client service. The ranking notes, “Each firm earns their performance the hard way: delivering the best.”

To make the [Client Service A-Team](https://bticonsulting.com/bti-client-service-a-team-2021-survey-of-law-firm-client-service-performance), the following 30 Biglaw firms were mentioned most often across all categories:

- Jones Day
- DLA Piper
- Gibson Dunn
- Arnold & Porter
- Sidley
- McGuireWoods
- Littler
- Kirkland & Ellis
- Mayer Brown
- Morgan Lewis
- Faegre Drinker
- King & Spalding
- Latham & Watkins
- Duane Morris
- Jackson Lewis
- Skadden
- Davis Polk
- Dentons
- Ogletree Deakins
- Baker Botts
- Folen & Lardner
- Sheppard Mullin
- Shook Hardy & Bacon
- McDermott Will & Emery
- Covington
- Holland & Knight
- Eversheds Sutherland
- Greenberg Traurig
- Pillsbury
- Seyfarth Shaw
During the course of the pandemic, 70 firms improved their client-service performance at more than twice the rate of all other law firms, ranging from awesome improvement (five stars) to impressive improvement (one star). Out of those 70, only five firms received the awesome improvement ranking. They are:

Putting aside the access to cheesesteaks, these people boo Santa Claus. What can possibly be great about taking your legal talents to Broad Street?

Joe and Elie talked to The Legal Blitz’s Steven Silver about working in the Philadelphia market. We discuss Philadelphia’s appeal for plaintiffs’ firms, it’s key client industries, and the virtues of living in a big city without the costs of Manhattan.

Plus there are more than a couple firms paying New York wages for a cheaper standard of living and that can’t hurt.

Thanks to everyone for entering and then voting in our [craziest travel stories contest](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/your-craziest-travel-tales-the-finalists/). In the end, there was a breakout winner as the wildest tale of legal travel anyone heard.

Capturing 51 percent of the vote — enough to win any election anywhere except the U.S. presidency — the story of David Boies fighting a brutal snowstorm and limping home to Cravath in a wrecked rental car is our champion.

Take a second to consider that this story beat out actually traveling through a war zone.

Sad news from Encino, California, where an adjunct professor at USC Gould School of Law and Pepperdine Law, Dennis Franks, passed away Sunday night after an ancient tree — estimated as at least 500 years old and weighing 100,000 pounds — fell on his home. Franks [previously worked](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisbfranks/) in-house at Twentieth Century Fox and The Walt Disney Corporation. Before moving in-house, Franks was a partner at the Biglaw firm of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips.

His son [said](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2021/11/30/attorney-law-school-professor-dennis-franks-identified-tree-fall-encino-home/) of the family’s loss:

“He’s the rock of our family,” Kevin Franks said. “I want him remembered as like a caretaker — he took care of everyone. We’re going to love him and miss him and think about him forever.”

Franks died while reading in his “man cave,” his “happy place” converted from his son’s old bedroom. Also in the house at the time of the incident were Franks’s wife Maureen, daughter Becca, and dog Parker. They were on the first floor of the house and able to get out safely.

The ancient tree that fell on Franks’s home was protected by regulation and removal requires approval from the LA County planners. Kevin Franks[ said ](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/man-killed-when-massive-tree-crashes-through-encino-home-in-middle-of-night/)the family paid for maintenance of the tree, working with an arborist and using chains to “keep stuff from falling.”

Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Cody Weireter indicated how unusual the incident is:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“I’ve never experienced anything like this … You’re looking at well over 100,000 pounds of a tree falling onto a home in the middle of the night,” Weireter said.

“No wind or rain … obviously unexpected, absolutely tragic tonight,” Weireter said.

Though neighbors said the tree was leaning as much as 30 degrees in recent days.

Our thoughts go out to Franks’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

# Many Lawyers Will Be Getting Screwed This Tax Season

‘Oh no…’

Last year I got a $750 refund. And this year I owe $4,600. I guess that my assumption was that the IRS withholding tables would have been updated to some degree or my company would have done something.

— Ben Williams, a lawyer in New York City, commenting on a situation most lawyers, especially lawyers in blue states, are [dreading encountering this tax season](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-tax-law-refunds_us_5c5b4885e4b00187b557d1fb). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped deductions on state and local tax (SALT) payments to $10,000, and Williams said he usually pays more than three times that amount in SALT expenses. He’d hoped to use his anticipated tax refund for a vacation.

# Individual Bonus Memos At This Firm
## Things are going well at this firm... we guess.

We love a good lockstep bonus memo. It sends a message of collegiality in an increasingly atomized world. But sometimes we can’t all get what we want. And that’s where Perkins Coie comes in.

After our most recent [shame list](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/12/has-your-firm-announced-bonuses-because-these-1m-ppp-firms-havent/), we’ve heard that Perkins Coie has sent around individualized memos to all associates and counsels over the last two days. We don’t have enough data points to opine on the quality of the bonuses, but the fact that people aren’t bombarding our inbox, we feel comfortable assuming they met the market because anything else in either direction would kick up a hornet’s nest.

UPDATE: It sounds like things may not be going well with these bonuses. Tipsters report lower bonuses than in past years and hearing from management that the reason is “overall compensation is up.” If true, that means Perkins Coie is using the summer’s raises to justify shorting associates on bonuses, which is the opposite of paying market.
