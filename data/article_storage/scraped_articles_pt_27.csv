# Disgraced Former Biglaw Chair Pleads Guilty In College Admissions Scandal
## You knew this plea was coming but it's still shocking to see such a prominent lawyer's fall from grace.

Gordon Caplan

Welp, you knew this was coming. As those of us closely following the [college admissions scandal known as operation Varsity Blues were aware](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/willkie-farr-chair-caught-in-college-admissions-scandal/), former Willkie Farr Co-Chair [Gordon Caplan admitted](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/suspended-co-chair-of-biglaw-firm-charged-in-college-admissions-scandal-will-plead-guilty/) last month that he paid $75,000 to have a proctor change his daughter’s ACT exam answers to improve her score, and announced he would be pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Today, Caplan bit the bullet and pleaded guilty in Boston federal court.

As [reported by](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1161618/breaking-ex-willkie-co-chair-pleads-guilty-in-varsity-blues-) Law360, Caplan’s plea deal will see him pay a $40,000 fine. Additionally prosecutors will recommend a jail sentence on the low end of the recommended term of 8 to 14 months based on the agreed upon offense level.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Additionally, in court Caplan sought to distance his family from his actions:

In court Tuesday, when U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani asked Caplan if he disputed the government’s allegations, Caplan said he did not, adding: ​​​​”My daughter had absolutely nothing to do with this. This was all on me.”

Assistant U.S. Attorney Leslie Wright said there was no active investigation into Caplan’s wife or daughter. While Caplan’s wife was not formally granted immunity, Wright said, the government has no intention to bring charges against her.

This isn’t the first negative consequence that has befallen Caplan since the scandal broke. Last month[ Willkie announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/willkie-farr-ditches-gordon-caplan-nabbed-in-varsity-blues-scandal/) they were parting ways with their one time leader, citing his illegal effort to get his daughter into an elite college.

# Latest Firm To Match Offers Small Bumps For Senior Associates

One of the biggest questions we’re getting around here is, “What’s become of counsel and other ‘off-grid’ senior lawyers?” Honestly, we don’t know much. We do know that at least one firm is offering its counsel $335K/$345K/$355K/$360K, corresponding generally to the Class of ’06/’05/’04/’03 and senior. But beyond that, we’re largely in the dark, either because counsel compensation is individualized or the relatively small ranks of counsel are afraid to leak for fear of being exposed. (If we get enough tips, we’ll do a story on comp for counsel.)

One firm that boasts some very, very senior associates offered a peek into what long-in-the-tooth non-partners are getting in its system. Kramer Levin just announced its raises. It matches Cravath up through $325K/’07 in its New York and Silicon Valley offices, but then carries on with its model:

So those super-seniors are getting only a $5,000 raise every year. That’s not a lot to write home about. On the other hand, if you’re hanging around the firm without having made partner, how much can you really complain? Kramer values experience, even if they don’t think a lawyer quite has what it takes to land on the letterhead. Most firms would show an attorney like that the door and rely on younger folks they can leverage better.

The memo is silent on summers, but one presumes they’re receiving a separate communique from the firm. You can read it in full on the next page.

Congratulations to everyone at Kramer Levin, especially those older lawyers still on the job.

Remember, when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches%20Cravath) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches Cravath”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

One thing the pandemic can’t stop is the need for high-end legal advice. As such, elite Biglaw firms are doing pretty well, and rather than just divvy up that money amongst the partners, the hot new trend is sharing that largesse with associates in the form of spring special bonuses.

Goodwin Procter is the latest Biglaw firm to jump on the spring bonus bandwagon. They’re making two payments to associates according to the following schedule:

US/HK Class Year		UK/Lux
Class

Year

July 1 Payment		October 1 Payment	
Trainees		$1,500		$2,500	
NQ		$2,400		$4,000	
2020		1 PQE		$4,500		$7,500	
2019		2 PQE		$6,000		$10,000	
2018		3 PQE		$12,000		$20,000	
2017		4 PQE		$16,500		$27,500	
2016		5 PQE		$19,500		$32,500	
2015		6 PQE		$22,200		$37,000	
2014+		7 PQE+		$24,000		$40,000

They went with July and October disbursements, and larded up the later payment, but, those are just the details. The amount of money on the table remains the same as what peer firms are giving out (thank you Davis Polk for raising that bar) — provided you bill enough. The firm also clarified that to be eligible for these payments, associates must meet an annualized hours threshold of 1,850 hours.

But associates aren’t the only ones getting in on the bonus fun! In a separate announcement the firm declared special counsel would get bonuses, payable at 1,750 annualized hours, as follows:

July 1 Payment		October 1 Payment	
$24,000		$40,000	
And senior attorneys, also at the 1,750 mark, will get bonuses as follows:

Anyone who has spent any time in Biglaw is familiar with the concept of firm-wide events. There’s the requisite bonding/networking/making a good impression on newbies and you’re supposed to leave the event feeling some degree of warm fuzzies for the place where you spend the overwhelming majority of your waking hours. What you aren’t supposed to feel is that you’ve been hoodwinked into forking over a chunk of your valuable vacation time.

Unfortunately for the associates at Quinn Emanuel, the warm fuzzies were hard to come by this year.

Above the Law has been tipped off by firm insiders about a massive snafu following the firm’s annual hike. According to our tipsters, in previous years the firm has allowed associates that attend the event to bill the time to a non-billable client number. When associates attempted to repeat the practice this year however, they were told that time should, instead, be charged to their vacation time. Yup, that’s right, after the fact they were told attending a firm event was really their vacation because attendance wasn’t mandatory.

Associates at Quinn were just as shocked as you are. And, to be clear, vacation time at Quinn is not unlimited, so this is a far cry from a “no harm, no foul” situation.

This policy, in a word, stinks. We know, as a profession, that the legal world has issues with [mental health ](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/mental-health/)and wellness. The right response for a firm to the stresses of Biglaw life is not to take away the limited time attorneys have to unwind and (hopefully) unplug.

We reached out to the firm and they defended the policy since it subsidizes the travel costs associated with the trip:

The firm sponsors an annual hike. It’s always voluntary, but always very popular. In recent years, the hike has been in Switzerland, Japan, Iceland and Italy. Many associates and partners sign up. The firm heavily subsidizes the cost for associates. This year the hike took place in Interlaken, Switzerland. We hiked the “Faulhornweg” trail through some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. The final night of the trip, there was a celebratory group dinner held at the Victoria Jungfrau Les Colonnades & Atrium. Over 250 attorneys attended the hike, which is the biggest turnout the firm has seen. It’s an opportunity to travel, see some of the most beautiful settings in the world, and enjoy time outside the office with one’s colleagues. It is properly treated as vacation time though some associates have recorded it as recruiting time because some summer associates also attend.

While international travel might be a nice perk for associates, it isn’t the same as an actual vacation. However nice the firm trip may be, it is still part of the job. Sharing a drink with your boss does not have the same relaxing properties as not responding to your boss’ emails because you’re lying on a beach somewhere. And changing the policy about how the time gets billed after the associates get home? Well, that just really stinks.

# Federal Judge Rescinds Resignation For Stupidest Possible Reason
## Or maybe he's going to make the next federal judge uproot his whole life to suit the whims of an elderly man.

Judge David Hurd is 85 years old and recently agreed to take senior status. But he’s since withdrawn his resignation after learning that his planned replacement on the bench of the Northern District of New York would be based in Albany as opposed to Utica… a town of around 60,000 people.

In a letter to President Biden dated July 14, Judge Hurd [reversed his previous decision](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Law-Beat-17350929.php) to leave the job he’s held since the last millennium. Because life tenure can give judges a ridiculous sense of entitlement.

“Please be advised that I immediately rescind my decision to take senior status as a United States District Judge for the Northern District of New York,” Hurd told Biden, adding that his successor has not been confirmed. “I will take senior status if a confirmed successor lives in this area and is permanently assigned to the United States Courthouse in Utica, New York. Otherwise, I shall remain on full-time active status until I retire or die.”

Of note, Judge Hurd was selected for his current post to fill a seat… IN ALBANY. But once on the bench he just pulled the rug out from the federal judiciary and opted to stay in Utica. Now he’s threatened to hold up the works to make a petty play for the local legal cartel. This leaves his intended successor, Jorge Rodriguez, out in the cold because diversity on the bench must take a backseat to someone who knows where to order the best Chicken Riggies.

While Rodriguez isn’t on the bench yet, he’s going to be a federal judge and deserves the respect that entails. The idea that Judge Hurd can deny this man his position unless he agrees to uproot his life in Albany to move 90 some odd miles down the road is wildly inappropriate.

I don’t know if Rodriguez has a family — and it doesn’t really change how disrespectful this is one way or the other — but can you imagine having to pull kids out of school and away from their friends because an overly entitled octogenarian decided he’s more important? Because Hurd is saying that he’d be willing to force a nominee to do that.

Look, I understand the towns are far enough away from each other to have different opinions on Steamed Hams…

… but beyond that, it’s entirely reasonable to move federal litigation to Albany since that’s where Judge Hurd was supposed to be all along.

The Times-Union has since updated the story with comment from Senator Gillibrand’s office explaining that [Rodriguez has already “committed” to serving in Utica](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Gillibrand-s-office-says-Biden-pick-committed-17359359.php). Which is lovely for them and hopefully will sway Judge Hurd. Though Hurd is also the moron who struck down New York’s vaccine mandate for health workers so listening to reason isn’t necessarily his strong suit these days.

It would be lovely if Utica was the significant urban center it was at the turn of the 20th century, but that’s not where it is anymore and no amount of judicial gamesmanship is going to change that. Maybe Rodriguez is really willing to be a good sport about this and move.

But that’s not a decision a retiring judge should get to impose on a prospective colleague.

# Not All Distressed Law Firms Screw Associates Out Of Bonuses
## Some law firms going through some tough economic times do not screw over their associates.

If you haven’t already subscribed to Above the Law’s podcast “Thinking Like a Lawyer,” then I highly recommend you subscribe to it as soon as possible. People often are too busy to read all of the articles on Above the Law during the week, and listening to the podcast is a good way to get up to date on the happenings in the legal profession. A recent episode of the podcast recounted how many law firms around the holidays made pathetic excuses to refuse paying bonuses and providing other additional compensation to associates. This was likely because law firms expect that 2023 may be a bad year for many shops. However, listening to the podcast made me think of my own experiences and how some law firms going through some tough economic times do not screw over their associates.

I once worked for a large law firm that employed several hundred attorneys across about a dozen offices. The law firm went through some difficult economic times, as was discussed in detail by articles on this website. Indeed, the law firm completely dissolved around a year or so after I left. Sensing that the shop was headed on a bad path, most of the partners in the office in which I worked decided to spin off our office into a new firm. The associates at the office basically all joined the new firm since they knew that they would be better off at the new shop than sticking around the old firm that was going to experience some difficult economic times.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The large firm I worked at assessed bonuses based on the number of hours an attorney worked in the preceding year, and based on that figure, I was due to be paid out tens of thousands of dollars. I really needed that money since I had just paid off my student loans, and I had used most of my savings to do that. However, for some reason, that law firm paid out bonuses on January 31 of the year following the year for which bonuses were assessed. I guess the law firm wanted to take the month or so between the end of the year and paying the bonuses to make sure that their math was correct and that people were getting the correct amount of extra compensation.

The only problem was that my last day at that firm was going to be January 31. For whatever reason, the bosses who left the large law firm did not want to wait any longer to start their shop, so they made our last day at that firm January 31, and our first day at the new firm February 1. This was a little distressing to me since I thought that my bonus would not be secure. The firm made absolutely certain to say that although bonuses would be based on the amount of hours an associate worked in the preceding year, this was nonetheless entirely discretionary. Indeed, some people would receive more in bonus money than their billable hours reflected based on exemplary work. As such, the large law firm had a lot of cover to deny us bonuses and make up some excuse about how we should not be paid a bonus on our last day of work in order to avoid paying associates hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional compensation.

To my surprise, when I looked at my bank account at the end of the month, I saw that the firm paid me all of the bonus I expected! I was absolutely floored that the firm actually paid the entire bonus, even though it was the right thing to do, because I just expected that law firms will try to screw associates any chance they get. Perhaps the law firm paid the bonuses in order to create goodwill with the shop, not only with the associates, but with the partners who were departing. Maybe the firm did not know how dire their financial situation would be in under a year, so they thought that paying several hundred thousand dollars in bonus money would not substantially impact their bottom line. For whatever reason, I was extremely grateful that the firm decided to do the right thing, and it definitely impacted my perception of the shop and its partners.

All told, when law firms go through tough financial times, they may be tempted to screw associates out of bonuses, and some might justify such actions based on the difficulties faced by the firm. However, not all distressed law firms disappoint their associates, and shops should rethink their positions when it comes to paying out bonuses and other compensation during tough economic times.

Meet Daniel. He’s a 36-year-old Harvard Law graduate who works in New York as an attorney (but lives in New Jersey to avoid NYC taxes). You wouldn’t know it from looking at him because his suits are so threadbare that they’re falling apart, but he makes $270,000 a year. Unlike the rest of his colleagues who work in large law firms, Daniel isn’t exactly fast and loose with his six-figure salary. He survives on a diet of rice and beans and beats himself up when he “splurges” on Chipotle. The most expensive pair of work shoes he owns cost $60, and the rest are from thrift shops. He doesn’t turn on the heat in winter; he just puts on additional layers of clothing. He doesn’t even own a TV.

Daniel’s frugal life may sound incredibly boring and, well, awful, but here’s a little secret about him: He’s saved 70 percent of his salary over the years, his IRA has been maxed out for almost 20 years, and he’s got more than $400,000 ready for the future.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

Daniel plans to retire in the next three years.

How did he save so much money? According to a profile piece in the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2019/10/08/inside-the-strange-secretive-lives-of-rich-millennial-cheapskates/), Daniel subscribes to the financial independence, retire early movement (FI/RE):

The money philosophy — essentially, save fast and early so you can quit working young — is gaining traction among millennials who have had a taste of office drudgery and want nothing to do with it. Followers combine investment hacks with old-fashioned penny pinching to build up enough savings to quit their 9-to-5, well before their 60s. They’re also committed to a monastic existence, even amid NYC’s many social temptations — drinks with co-workers, workout classes and even the odd fast-casual Friday lunch.

Daniel’s stingy lifestyle has been quite detrimental to his social life — or complete lack thereof). He’s single (“My previous ex-girlfriend never really got on board. Her concept of what I was doing was being cheap, and depriving myself and her.”) and has trouble relating to his coworkers (“They talk all the time about the fancy restaurants, bars and Broadway shows they’re going to.”). At least soon he’ll be able to leave the Biglaw life behind and trade his long working hours for more leisurely pursuits.

But for now, the all-consuming FI/RE life is what what keeps him going: “I’m trying to get to a point where nothing besides death can stop me.” Best of luck, Daniel.

# Finally We Have U.S. News Law School Rankings... And They're Weird

Except with a bunch of ties.

After law schools [threw a public tantrum](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/law-schools-dropping-out-of-us-news-rankings/) over the U.S. News and World Report ranking, with several withholding key data required to create a credible list, [the rankings are now out](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/the-2024-u-s-news-law-school-rankings-are-here/) and… they have serious credibility problems. Missing data, important factors glossed over, and shady employment accounting from the schools result in a broken list. Congratulations, boycotting schools! You’ve managed to make it all worse. Meanwhile, in Ohio, a pregnant lawyer sought a continuance after being put on emergency bed rest and got [denied by the state supreme court](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/pregnant-dont-plan-on-practicing-before-ohios-supreme-court-any-time-soon/) because screw your human frailties. Finally, Dechert joins the layoff trend with [a 5 percent global cut](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/05/am-law-top-50-firm-begins-reduction-in-force-will-cut-5-of-global-workforce/). As always, we wonder if this has broader significance or not.

# Say Hello To One Of Biglaw's Openly Nonbinary Lawyers
## 'When someone uses my correct pronouns, it’s always nice to feel that respect,' they say.

I think more representation needs to be out there, and this is a time where I am actually hopeful that representation will be meaningful. I don’t know of any other nonbinary attorneys in Biglaw. I’m aware of nonbinary attorneys at smaller firms and shops. So I think it’s a really big deal that we can break that barrier. Being gender-nonconforming as a litigator is not uncomplicated: litigation is about sharing narratives and stories and presenting the more believable version of the truth by having a story fit together and work.

Part of that story is the lawyer: they’re the narrator putting together a picture of themselves that should support the truth they’re telling. As it stands, being nonbinary has the possibility of distracting from that story, and I’m trying to leverage my position in Biglaw and make it less likely that this will be something a judge may find distracting.

— [Rafael Langer-Osuna](https://www.squirepattonboggs.com/en/professionals/l/langerosuna-rafael-m), a litigation partner in the San Francisco office of Squire Patton Boggs, commenting on their [decision to come out](https://www.law.com/2020/06/26/a-nonbinary-attorneys-journey-i-wanted-to-be-who-i-am-fully-with-people-i-work-with/) as one of Biglaw’s openly nonbinary attorneys. Langer-Osuna uses they/them pronouns, and says of their coming out at the firm, “After recognizing that this is a lifelong journey that I’m working through that is not shared by the majority of people around me, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to be who I am, fully, with people I work with.”

# The Biglaw Firms Where Lawyers Did The Most Pro Bono Work (2021)
## Which law firms were the best at giving back?

Law schools across the country are gearing up for early interview week, and many students have their future careers on their minds. With so many things to take into account when considering their livelihoods, how can law students create meaningful distinction between firms? Perhaps they can take a look at the firms’ pro bono numbers.

Over the course of the last year, members of the legal profession sprang into action to deal with crisis after crisis after crisis, offering their services without cost to those in need. From health and humanitarian aid during the ongoing pandemic to racial justice initiatives to protecting reproductive rights in states where strict abortion laws had been enacted, lawyers in America were inspired to do their very best to help those who needed their assistance the very most.

But which law firms were able to contribute the most to society?

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
The American Lawyer has compiled a ranking of Am Law 200 firms based on their pro bono work in 2021. Half of their scores come from the average number of pro bono hours per lawyer, while the other half represents the percentage of lawyers who performed more than 20 hours of pro bono work.

Here are the top 10 firms for the rocky legal year that was 2021:

- Orrick
- Covington & Burling
- Jenner & Block
- WilmerHale
- Patterson Belknap
- Munger Tolles
- Hogan Lovells
- Paul Hastings
- Dechert
- Arnold & Porter
It should be noted that at [each firm listed](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2022/07/18/distracted-justice-talent-churn-client-demand-pulled-attention-away-from-pro-bono/), the average attorney performed 125 hours or more of pro bono work last year, and the Am Law 200 as a whole contributed about 4.59 million hours of pro bono work. These numbers are down from the hellish year that was 2020 (perhaps due to last year’s rapid lateral churn and perhaps due to remote work coming to an end), but leaders in the pro bono space are hopeful participation will rally. “Even if we were busy, the suffering doesn’t go away,” said Debbie Berman, co-chair of Jenner & Block’s pro bono practice, in an Am Law interview. “The needs don’t go away.”

# Associate Bonus Watch: No Memo, No Problem
## Usually a firm withholding a bonus memo is a bad thing....

Last year, a Cooley LLP tipster [noted](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/associate-bonus-watch-this-firm-went-above-and-beyond-this-year/) that the bonus memo was “fuzzier this year than ever.” Not that any of the associates were complaining about the bonuses they received, just that the memo didn’t provide much clarity as to what an individual associate would receive.

Well, the firm heard that complaint and addressed it this time around:

Hi! As you may know, after discussion with the Associates Committee, Cooley moved to eliminate the bonus memo, instead electing for the partners to be ready to disclose and discuss the bonus at the annual review meeting.

Oh. “Opacity” is a kind of response to “ambiguity.” That said, it’s far more often the precursor to a firm preparing to shortchange associates under the cover of darkness. Thankfully, it looks like Cooley isn’t going that route — they just earnestly wanted to avoid any confusion:

I was wary about this at first, but coming out of my review, I felt the partners were able to give me all the information I needed.

That’s all well and good for the associates, but was no one thinking about our job here at ATL? I guess we’re going to have to try and cobble this together from individual tips. If you are a Cooley associate and want to add to this coverage, scroll down for our contact info.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
- “Third year who received positive reviews and billed just a little over the minimum 1950 and I got Cravath. Was expected and I’m satisfied, especially given the raise last year. Apparently the bonus range for my class was a couple thousand above and below Cravath, with most people at Cravath. Cooley is definitely trying to be competitive with the big boys.”
- “Cooley midlevel here. Market match at 2000 hours. Very strong reviews. I’ve heard of market matches across all levels for associates with good reviews. Bonuses are being delivered in individual review meetings with the goal of providing stronger and more constructive feedback this year.”
- “Very contented senior associate. I’m pleased that the firm again provided strong individualized bonuses that clearly surpassed the Cravath scale for hard working high performers. I also want to applaud the partnership’s increased transparency in sharing information about the firm’s bonus scale with associates.”
News from associates ranging from the relatively junior to relatively senior, and everyone’s happy.

Congrats, Cooley associates! Bonuses will be paid with normal payroll on or about February 15.

UPDATE (3:49 p.m.): But all is not necessarily happy at Cooley. Since we put this story up, we’ve heard from an associate who did receive a market bonus, but notes that they’ve heard of several who fell short of their hours receiving ZERO bonus and a portion of associates who did make their hours but still got below-market bonuses. As this tipster concludes:

If Cooley really does want to compete with the big firms, especially in New York, I think they should get away from individualized bonuses and stick to the market. I say this as someone who has otherwise enjoyed working here.

True. No matter how much faith a young lawyer has in their ability to make hours and pump out quality work, there’s always a bit of this job that’s outside your control. That’s why a high-quality prospect trying to decide between two offers might do well to lean toward the one offering the lockstep market bonus.

UPDATE (2/11/17, 10:45 a.m.): And here’s some bonus news from [one of Cooley’s peer firms](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/associate-bonus-watch-mo-money-at-mofo/) (which basically offers a market scale, at least for folks who made their hours, plus extra cash for high billers).

As noted above, please help us help you when it comes to bonus news either at Cooley or at other firms. As soon as your firm’s bonus memo comes out, please [email it to us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Bonus) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Bonus”) or text us (646-820-8477).

# Finance And Law: Are Lawyers Overpaid?
## Finance professor Michael McDonald explains why lawyers deserve what they get.

The answer is…. No. But given recent [salary announcements](http://bit.ly/2016salaryincreasePromo), let’s talk about why. After all, as recent news coverage shows, your clients are surely [asking this question](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/06/what-do-and-should-in-house-lawyers-think-about-the-biglaw-pay-raises/) — and considering options that might cause attorney wages to fall in the future.

Pay for any group of professionals is often a touchy subject, and that is especially true when dealing with well-educated groups like attorneys. Nonetheless, given the recent trend of large law firms paying their first-year associates as much as $180,000, it’s worth asking the question: are attorneys overpaid?

Attorneys go through three years of law school and four years of undergrad, and thus some individuals who are effectively only just starting their professional careers earn salaries that are considerably higher than other professional groups like nurses and engineers. And if fairness were the only consideration for pay, then one might make a case that attorneys are overpaid. But, of course, that same case would surely apply to professional athletes, Hollywood actors, and many high-ranking executives, all of whom make significantly more than the average attorney.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Instead pay should be based on market wages as a function of supply and demand. And by this measure there is no indication that attorneys are overpaid. In a capitalist system, resources are allocated based on the price that people are willing to pay for goods and services. As long as there is a demand for a particular service, prices should keep rising until sufficient supply exists to meet that demand.

That is precisely what happens in the market for attorneys. There is significant demand for attorneys leading to high wages. Those high wages in turn give many college students an incentive to study law and become attorneys. In some time periods and some regions of the country, the supply of attorneys has outstripped demand. When this happens, many prospective attorneys leaving law school do not get jobs. In those markets, attorney wages rise more slowly (or stay stagnant), and existing attorneys are forced to spend more time and money marketing themselves, which lowers their effective wage rate.

As long as there are no significant artificial barriers that stop attorneys from entering or leaving the market, supply and demand should act in concert to regulate attorney wages. The rise in salaries to $180K annually for some first-year associates is a function of that supply and demand. There are only a finite number of very intelligent and articulate individuals out there – paying those individuals is not going to be cheap.

With all of that said, attorney wages may in the future may actually fall. There are two problems that are exacerbating the issue of wages for attorneys. One is on the demand side and the other is on the supply side.

On the supply side, many law schools continue to overenroll and produce too many law students. As a result, many graduates from reasonably strong law programs can’t find jobs when they graduate. That puts obvious pressure on wages. As more and more students in the future look for high-paying professional careers and see advanced degrees as a route to future prosperity, that problem will remain acute. This issue is not new, though.

What is new is the trend towards effective substitutes for attorneys. From e-discovery tools to websites offering pre-packaged legal documents, the legal profession is facing greater changes today than it has in decades. Attorneys ignore these trends at their own peril.

How can attorneys combat these dual issues? Perhaps the best solution is price transparency. Effective price advertising gives the customer a clear indication of how much they are paying for an attorney’s services and lets the customer see the value the attorney or law firm provides in comparison to the cost.

There’s just something about a global pandemic that just inspires (some) folks to try and make an extra buck.

Ang Chong Yi is [an associate in the Singapore office of Milbank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chong-yi-ang-3315b56b/?originalSubdomain=sg). He is also one of the lawyers behind the, now defunct, website lawmentors.sg, and it’s this second thing that’s gotten him into some hot water.

UPDATE: It appears that Ang is no longer an associate at Milbank, it seems his firm email has recently been disabled.

### [ Is The Future Of Law Distributed? Lessons From The Tech Adoption Curve ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/is-the-future-of-law-distributed-lessons-from-the-tech-adoption-curve/)

Lawmentors was designed as a pay-to-play “mentor network” that claimed to have contacts at Biglaw firms in the United States and the U.K. and charged mentees between one-and-a-half to two months salary for the privilege of their expertise. The website promised “hands-on coaching and practice” to allow members to “outshine all fellow practice trainees and secure a training contract.”

All of which was supposed to help these wannabe lawyers deal with the economic upheaval surrounding COVID-19, which Lawmentors described as “a brutal fight for career survival.” The website went on say that, due to the novel coronavirus, legal “work has largely dried up.” They estimated 700 new graduates would be in competition for between 150 and 200 new jobs due to hiring freezes and other austerity measures, saying the pandemic will lead to a “shrinking legal market” and that two out of three law graduates will “never get the opportunity to practice as lawyers.”

But the Singapore Law Society is investigating the website and called its claims “speculative” and “unsubstantiated.” [According to the Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/mentoring-platform-under-investigation-for-%E2%80%98speculative%E2%80%99-claims-%E2%80%98opportunistic%E2%80%99), LawSoc president Gregory Vijayendran had this to say about Lawmentors:

We strongly caution parents and law graduates to be discerning about hungry wolves in sheep’s clothing who seek to prey financially on the vulnerability of law graduates. Such opportunistic operators and disservice providers will face the wrath of the Council of the Law Society and the Society’s right thinking members.

That’s… not mincing words. And National University of Singapore’s law dean Simon Chesterman said, “Fearmongering of this sort during a public health crisis is irresponsible and misleading.”

In response to the uproar over the website Ang said, “I meant it for interest gauging, but took it down after people said it was not right to take money from students who are just starting to look for jobs. No formal programme was started, no money was taken from them.”

Well, I guess there’s something to be said for the effectiveness of good, old-fashioned outrage.

# Maximizing Your Chances Of Receiving A Full-Time Offer After Summering
## Each person has their own way to connect with people with whom they used to work, and this can help folks obtain full-time associate offers.

Although most people recognize that we are only about midway through the summer, for summer associates, the season is almost done, if it hasn’t finished already. Since summer associates need to head back to their law schools by the middle or end of August, most law firms wrap up their summer programs by the beginning of August to give their summers plenty of time to get back into the swing of things on campus. Some summer associates are fortunate enough to get full-time offers while they are working at firms for the summer, but some summer associates need to wait to receive offers. Indeed, I did not know if I’d be invited to return to the firm where I summered until October after I complete my summer associate gig. There are a few things that summer associates can do to maximize their chances of receiving a full-time offer if they are waiting to hear back from a firm.

Stay Top Of Mind

It may seem obvious, but staying in the minds of the people with whom the summer associate worked is a good way to maximize chances of receiving an offer. Depending on the circumstances, this can take a number of different forms. For instance, I knew a summer associate who was a real asset for his law firm’s softball team. Each week, this summer associate starred on the firm’s softball team, where he was a big help.

After he returned to law school, he still made sure to schlepp back to the city where he summered to play on the firm’s softball team once or twice a week for the rest of the season. This person’s law school was in the general vicinity of the law firm’s office, but this was by no means an easy trip for the summer to take, and the summer probably had other time commitments once he returned to campus. However, I am sure that all of the people at the firm appreciated that this summer came back to lend his talents to the firm’s softball team, and when it came time to extend full-time offers, this attorney got a job even though others were not so lucky. Of course, not everyone is an excellent softball player, but each person has their own way to connect with people with whom they used to work, and this can help folks obtain full-time associate offers.

Stay Interested In Projects

Some summer associates often work on long-term projects that are handled by a firm. For instance, when I was a summer associate, I worked on a few long-term litigation matters that had been creeping their way through federal court for years. It was clear that I would likely be working on these same matters if I was hired as a full-time associate.

I made sure to set up alerts for each of the matters on which I worked as a summer associate so that I could stay apprised of all the news concerning those matters. Sometimes, I would reach out to people with whom I worked and give them my two cents about some of the news stories I saw about these matters. I think that the people at the firm at which I worked appreciated that I took such an active approach in staying on top of these matters, and that couldn’t have hurt when it came time for the people at the firm to decide which summer associates would receive full-time offers.

Keep Looking

If your firm takes a long time to get back to you about a full-time offer, it may not hurt to keep looking for other employment opportunities. This helps ensure that if you do not receive an offer from the firm due to performance issues, economic problems, or other reasons, you have other options available. The 3L on-campus recruiting process is typically pretty robust and might be overlooked by some law students.

Since it took several months for me to hear back from my firm about a full-time associate position, I kept looking for work after I graduated from law school. I interviewed with some other law firms and a few public interest positions. I also remember interviewing for a clerkship with the Supreme Court of Alaska when one of the justices of that court stopped by our campus in the fall. Of course, it probably wouldn’t have been great if people at my firm found out I was looking for new employment opportunities, but in many instances, it is important to have a backup in place in case it takes a while for firms to get back to summers about full-time positions.

Of course, we all know that the vast majority of summer associates are offered full-time positions at law firms, so many summers do not need to sweat receiving a full-time offer. However, summer associates can still increase their chances of receiving a full-time offer from law firms.

# After Rainmaker Departures, Biglaw Firm Cancels Summer Program

What is going on at the Cadwalader D.C. office? First came the news that they [lost four rainmaking antitrust partners](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/08/musical-chairs-cadwalader-antitrust-stars-decamp-for-paul-weiss/?rf=1) to Paul, Weiss, and now they’ve cancelled their summer program. What? Yup. You read that right.

The D.C. office of Cadwalader is forgoing its summer program in 2017.

Students at American University Washington College of Law who had signed up to interview with the D.C. office of Cadwalader during on-campus recruitment got an email telling them the program is no more — at least for this year:

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Cadwalader DC greatly appreciates your interest in the firm and the DC office and wants to inform you that their plans have changed and the DC office will not hold a summer program next summer. Although Cadwalader DC will not be recruiting on campus this year, they are excited about returning to campus for summer 2018 as well as for 3L hiring. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Jason Beekman, Manager of Attorney Development and Legal Recruitment [ ]. The firm looks forward to keeping in touch.

And it isn’t as if American Law student are being punked — students at George Washington Law School also received notification that summer program was being cancelled:

Thank you for registering to attend Cadwalader’s hospitality suite on Tuesday. Unfortunately, the firm has decided to cancel their hospitality suite and interview schedule as they will no longer be hosting a summer 2017 program.

Welp, this is a… bold move.

The summer associate program is a major component of modern Biglaw recruitment. Canceling a summer program is generally reserved for firms experiencing [dire financial issues](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/struggling-firm-may-be-canceling-its-summer-program/) (the move got a particularly bad rap in 2012, when Dewey & LeBoeuf [pulled the plug on its summer program](https://abovethelaw.com/2012/04/we-dont-have-any-summer-associates-dewey-and-additional-info-about-a-possible-criminal-probe/) just days before the demise of the firm became official), or firms with such a great reputation they can [buck the prevailing employment model](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/06/biglaw-firm-decimates-summer-associate-program/).

It is unclear exactly what the thinking behind Cadwalder’s cancellation was — but we reached out to the firm for comment, and it is only the D.C. office that is on a break:

Our summer programs in our NY and Charlotte offices are on track as usual. We are as committed as ever to our Washington office, however, to be fair to students interested in our DC office, we decided to take a year off from having a DC summer program to allow us to have more clarity on our hiring needs before recruiting incoming DC associates for the Fall of 2018.

Reading between the lines, it seems entirely possible that the departure of big-name partners had an impact on their summer program. At least the firm made the call before extending offers to law students, and they can now plan accordingly.

Several schools have seen their first-year enrollments climb by double-digit percentages, which is a welcome change for some schools. [[Law.com](https://www.law.com/2018/08/21/first-year-enrollment-soars-by-double-digits-at-some-law-schools/)]

* Speaking of law schools, if you’re trying to get into an elite school, then your GPA obviously needs to be really high. But how high are we talking here? All of the top 10 schools have median GPAs of 3.7 or higher. Good luck out there!

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
What an attorney working overseas does in a typical day depends on the practice area. It also depends on local regulations governing the practice of law, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Many of our major trading partners allow experienced American attorneys to practice U.S. law or work under the supervision of a local attorney.

The work will also vary depending on the setting. The most common scenarios include working in an overseas office of a U.S. law firm or as a local hire in a foreign law firm. But American attorneys can also work in-house for the local subsidiary of a U.S. multinational company, or directly for a foreign multinational company.

Common denominators, however, are that most practices are transactional and the deals typically have an international component. One example is a strategic alliance or joint venture between an American company and its foreign counterpart to develop and commercialize the specified technology. Other examples include a cross-border business combination or the simultaneous issuance of securities in multiple jurisdictions.

Many of these transactions could be serviced by a U.S. law firm working with unaffiliated local counsel. But U.S. law firms with substantial international business have determined that it makes sense to service these deals with American (and their own foreign) attorneys located in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdiction. Local law firms with substantial international work also hire American attorneys to help them in cross-border transactions.

Overseas-based attorneys may also coordinate with local attorneys to provide guidance to U.S. companies on compliance with local regulations in their day-to-day operations. They also provide guidance to foreign companies on compliance with U.S. regulations, which run the gamut from data privacy to proprietary trading.

- Who do you work with?
In most situations, attorneys working overseas interact with their colleagues as they would in a U.S.-based setting. The nature of the contact with foreign clients depends on a variety of factors, including corporate culture and language barriers. Local regulations regarding the practice of law may also impact the nature of client contact.

- What does a common career path look like?
High-quality transactional experience and excellent academic credentials are prerequisites to overseas job postings, which are highly coveted. U.S. law firms tend to second their own experienced associates to overseas posts. The best way to secure an overseas assignment with either a U.S. or foreign law firm is to first do great transactional work at a large law firm in the U.S.

If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
If all goes well, seconded attorneys typically return to work at the firm in the U.S., where they will continue to work on international transactions. Others get jobs as in-house counsel at multinational companies either in the U.S. or overseas. Some of these companies might be clients of the firm that the attorney served while posted overseas.

American attorneys working as local hires in foreign law firms frequently have fixed-term contracts of two or so years. They can try to extend their terms, but should think about their next move well before the expiration of their contracts.

Attorneys looking to return to a new firm or company in the U.S. should emphasize the quality and quantity of the deals that they worked on while overseas. This may help to overcome any bias among U.S. hiring managers who might perceive overseas experience as quirky and unsophisticated.

- If variety is the spice of life, how spicy is this practice area?
Attorneys based overseas are likely to encounter a variety of legal issues, as well as a regulatory environment and business practices that are unique to the jurisdiction or the region, which makes practicing overseas interesting. Outside of work, chances are they will live in or near a world-class city with many opportunities to explore and sightsee, attend cultural events and try new foods.

- How much wear and tear?
Deal flow varies like it does in U.S.-based transactional practice, so there will be extremely busy times followed by not-so-busy times. Time zone differences and business cultural norms may create pressure to stay at the office even if one is not busy.

Non-practice factors like homesickness, an unfamiliar culture and language barriers may add stress, which increases wear and tear. Married couples might feel stressed, especially if one spouse wants to be there more than the other, or if the other spouse cannot work due to visa restrictions or an ill-fitting job market, or cannot join the expat because of work or family commitments at home.

- Of the people in this practice group who hate it, what exactly do they hate about it?
A common complaint is burnout from a workflow that can be difficult to predict, but this is also true for transactional attorneys based in the U.S. Another common complaint is that overseas practice may not live up to expectations, especially after the initial excitement of working overseas wears out.

Another problem may be more prevalent in foreign law firms than in overseas offices of U.S. law firms. An American attorney expecting to work on substantive legal matters may end up spending a disproportionate amount of time correcting the English in locally produced documents. If the governing law of the document is local law, this makes it difficult for the American attorney to provide legal guidance.

Foreign language ability is not always a prerequisite, but if it is, it almost always means native or near-native speaking and writing ability. If it is not a prerequisite, an attorney with foreign language ability may be frustrated by the lack of opportunity to use those skills in a business setting.

- Of the people in this practice group who love it, what exactly do they love about it?
It’s a great opportunity to gain international legal experience, become acclimated to global business practices, and build a global network of contacts. If the firm has good deal flow, the attorney should have little difficulty translating substantive legal skills acquired overseas to a law firm or in-house position back in the U.S.

- Are there common avenues out of this practice area?
Most Americans working overseas return to U.S.-based practice, either in the same firm or company, or with a new firm or company.

- What are some market trends that impact this practice area?
International transactional deal flow depends on a variety of legal factors. For example, international tax law can drive companies to engage in transactions to shift income-producing assets like intellectual property to low-tax jurisdictions. Deal flow can also be directed to specific jurisdictions based on business-friendly corporate governance, merger control, and labor and employment laws, among others. Deal flow is also impacted by interest rates, and volatility in the financial markets, including currency markets. Another factor is the international political climate, which if uncertain, can stifle transactions that may otherwise make business sense.

- If you had to recommend one candidate from a room crowded with recent bar exam graduates, what specific qualities would he or she have that would ensure success in this practice area?
A good candidate would have a few years of transactional legal experience at a large law firm or in-house legal department. The candidate should be curious, flexible and non-judgmental. Being bilingual helps, but in many cases is not necessary.

Candidates should conduct thorough due diligence before agreeing to work overseas. For example, Americans working abroad are subject to special federal tax filing requirements, including the requirement to annually notify the IRS of any foreign bank or other financial accounts.

So, we know that Rudy Giuliani[ no longer works at Biglaw giant Greenberg Traurig](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-officially-done-with-biglaw-career/) — he has to devote himself full time to the spectacle that is Donald Trump’s legal defense. Now we are getting a little more color on what went on behind the scenes.

As one of his first acts as lawyer to the president, Giuliani went on cable news to take their defense to the people, because apparently that’s how we lawyer now. These controversial appearances were filled with interesting nuggets about the alleged hush money paid to Stormy Daniels by Trump fixer and lawyer Michael Cohen and whether the president paid back the money to his lawyer. Though Giuliani has had to walk back some of his statements, a key component of his argument is that the way the payment to Daniels was handled — Cohen laying out the money without the knowledge of Trump — was standard operating procedure:

“That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do, out of his law firm funds,” he said on Fox News. He added, “Michael would take care of things like this like I take care of this with my clients.”

But, in[ a statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-resigns-law-firm-greenberg-traurig.html) to the New York Times, Greenberg Traurig wants the world to know they conduct their business a little differently:

“We cannot speak for Mr. Giuliani with respect to what was intended by his remarks,” said a spokeswoman, Jill Perry. “Speaking for ourselves, we would not condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made or otherwise without the knowledge and direction of a client.”

Because legal ethics, they are still a thing.

When confronted with his now former firm’s statement, Giuliani laughed and spewed more hot air:

Mr. Giuliani laughed when read the statement from the firm. “First of all, I don’t think they really understand what I said,” he said. He said he was referring to a nondisclosure agreement that Mr. Cohen had negotiated. “That’s a very common part of a settlement,” he said. “In fact, any lawyer would negotiate that for a client.”

Oh, I think they understand exactly what you said.

# The Global 100: The Richest Law Firms In The World (2020)
## Which firms are at the very top of the list this year?

Law.com recently published its latest edition of the Global 100, a ranking of the world’s 100 largest law firms by total revenue. (Even an important ranking like this — released on September 21 — was easy to miss amid the news that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had passed away.) How did these firms do in the year that was? As we learned from the [most recent Am Law 100 rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/05/breaking-down-the-2020-am-law-100-rankings/), 2019 was a pretty good year for Biglaw firms, with some of the planet’s top-grossing firms setting financial records. What are we looking at in terms of the big picture?

Overall, the Global 100’s gross revenue grew by 4.7 percent, bringing the collective earnings of these firms up to $119.6 billion. Of course, this is nowhere near the heights reached in 2018, when gross revenue for the Global 100 increased by 8.1 percent, but when Biglaw is up by $5.4 billion, there’s not much room for complaints. The United States continues to dominate the list, and this time around, 50 firms had more than $1 billion in revenue — and the vast majority of those firms are based in the U.S.

Here are the [top 10 firms of the 2020 Global 100](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/09/21/the-2020-global-200-ranked-by-revenue-405-68243/) (i.e., the top 10 firms ranked by 2019 revenue). Each of these firms has their most lawyers in the U.S. — except Dentons:

Expect things to look a lot different when the 2021 edition of the Global 100 comes out, as 2019 was the calm before the never-ending storm that is the coronavirus crisis. Revenue will likely be down, profits per equity partner will likely be down, and head count will almost certainly be down. Enjoy looking at these financials while you can.

The highest court in France [has ruled](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000046555948?init=true&page=5&query=&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=juri) that employees have a legal right to not be fun at work. What a quirky story, right? Feel free to make all the “congratulations to all the tax lawyers” jokes you want!

At least “not being fun” is how the media seem to be covering the case. Headlines surrounding the decision zero in on the “[right to not be fun](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/27/france-man-fired-company-drinking-culture/)” and the “[right to be boring](https://nypost.com/2022/11/25/frenchman-wins-the-right-to-be-no-fun-at-work/),” which are both technically accurate in describing the court’s ruling to the extent the French court described the employee’s decision to eschew after-work happy hours as a matter of free expression.

But perhaps these headlines gloss over some very important details.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
The man, identified in court documents as “Mr T” apparently pities the fools who like to enjoy the office. After joining Cubik Partners, a business consultancy, in 2011, Mr T was fired in 2015 for not joining in the workplace “fun.” Specifically, Mr T didn’t want any part of after work drinks and other team-building activities.

Or, to get [a little more specific](https://www.businessinsider.com/man-won-legal-right-not-be-fun-at-work-alcoholism-2022-11):

According to the Court of Cassation, the company’s “fun” values included regular obligatory social events that culminated in “excessive alcoholism encouraged by colleagues who made very large quantities of alcohol available,” as well as “practices pushed by colleagues involving promiscuity, bullying and incitement to various excesses.”

It’s not “excessive alcoholism” to attend events where large quantities of alcohol are available. But let’s put a pin in that one and consider that maybe the coverage should spend a little less time on “he didn’t like going to the bar on Friday with co-workers” part and a little more time focused on the, and we quote, “practices pushed by colleagues involving promiscuity, bullying and incitement to various excesses” part of this opinion.

The court – the highest in the French legal system – also outlined various “humiliating and intrusive” practices promoted by Cubik Partners including simulations of sexual acts and the obligation to share a bed with a colleague.

YES… WHAT ABOUT THE SIMULATIONS OF SEXUAL ACTS AND SHARING BEDS PART? This seems so wildly more important than not wanting to join the official happy hour. It’s also not in any way related to “not being fun” or “being boring” — this is straight up harassment culture. The coverage mostly misses the point in framing this as a matter of being boring, but also, why is a court even opening the door to the suggestion that this might be about a right to not be fun?

It’s about the company not having the right to harass people! Has everyone lost their minds?!?

Obviously, a peer pressure culture that bullies employees into drinking is inappropriate, but pushing people to attend events where alcohol is served is not “excessive alcoholism.” And under no circumstances should be looped in with “not wanting to be subjected to sexual harassment.”

In a profession like a business consultancy, being able to navigate an alcohol-fueled social gathering and be “fun” may actually be critical to the job. Sometimes a consultant is going to have to get drinks with a client. The consultant doesn’t need to drink, but they still need to know how to be engaging and entertaining in that setting. If all this case dealt with was “consultants firing an employee who can’t wine and dine clients,” this ruling would be incredibly stupid.

But it’s not, and conflating “being social” with “sexual harassment” like the court and the media have here is deeply problematic.

This came up in Biglaw a few years ago when firms publicly began to phase out summer associate “boozefests” citing the risk of harassment at social events. But then they suggested replacing trips to the bar with [watching associates work out](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-summer-programs-phasing-out-boozefests-to-create-all-new-worse-sexual-harassment-opportunities/) as if that doesn’t invite all manner of ogling and harassment. Maybe focus on “stamping out harassment” instead of rearranging the deck chairs by canceling the cocktail party!

Because like Mr T here, most lawyers need to be sociable if they want to build a career in this industry. Glad-handing clients and securing referral networks require being “fun” and, yes, that often means knowing your way around a bar whether the attorney is personally drinking or not.

There is no related requirement that anyone needs to be “good at harassment” to advance a career.

We have some unfortunate news today from New York, where an beloved member of the legal profession passed away due to complications of coronavirus.

[Steven M. Edwards](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/edwards-steven-m/) worked as an of counsel attorney in Quinn Emanuel’s New York office. Recall that Quinn Emanuel was one of the [first New York firms to close its doors](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/quinn-emanuel-new-york-coronavirus/) after a partner tested positive for COVID-19 in early March.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
According to the firm, Edwards died sometime on April 8, 2020. Quinn Emanuel described Edwards as a “superb lawyer,” “a wonderful human being,” and “a passionate champion for social justice” in a [kind memorial](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/news-events/in-memory-of-steven-m-edwards) on its website, where his professional accomplishments were carefully curated:

A graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law, Steve started his career at Cravath, Swaine and Moore after which he started his own firm, Davis Weber & Edwards, which became the New York office of Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells), where he headed the Litigation Group in New York.

Steve was a long standing fixture in the legal community serving, among other things, as the President of the Federal Bar Council from 1998 to 2000, Chair of the Antitrust Section of the New York State Bar Association, President of the Federal Bar Council American Inn of Court, sitting on the Advisory Committee for Civil Rules of the United States District Courts of the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, and was the founder and editor emeritus of the Federal Bar Council News.

Edwards was also an avid musician, with accolades like being a member of the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and writing the rock opera “Something Afoot.” He often played bass with his band, the Law Dogs.

We here at Above the Law would like to extend our sincere condolences to Steven Edwards’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.

# The Best Biglaw Firms For Minority Attorneys Who Want To Make Partner
## Did your law firm make the cut for this important metric?

As we mentioned earlier this week, while more than 30 percent of law students are minorities, only 15 percent of lawyers and less than 9 percent of partners are attorneys of color. In fact, the number of minority equity partners has only increased from 7.08 percent to 7.87 percent since 2015. Racial diversity in law firms seems to have effectively flatlined, leaving minority lawyers at a disadvantage. Making partner remains the gold standard, but with so few people of color having attained this achievement in Biglaw, it’s enough to make minority attorneys leave their firms in search of more fruitful endeavors with the government or in-house.

At some law firms, however, it’s a completely different story. At some law firms, minority attorneys are mentored, sponsored, and pushed to build networks that will allow them to receive an invitation to the equity partnership ranks.

In order to recognize the Biglaw firms that take special efforts to maintain a diverse partnership, for the first time ever, [Law360](https://www.law360.com/articles/954556) (sub. req.) has created a list of the top law firms for minority equity partners.

Law360 surveyed more than 300 firms for its 2017 Law Firm Diversity Snapshot, and those firms were then ranked based on the percentage of equity partners who self-identified as minorities. Law360 then went further, and broke the firms out into tiers depending on size for a peer-to-peer comparison.

In the biggest of Biglaw category (600+ attorneys), the top five firms are:

- Wilson Sonsini: 20.3 percent
- White & Case: 18.8 percent
- Morrison & Foerster: 14.9 percent
- Lewis Brisbois: 14.4 percent
- Paul Weiss: 14.0 percent
For Biglaw firms with slightly smaller headcounts (300-599 attorneys), the best for minority partners are:

- Fragomen Del Rey: 18.5 percent
- Carlton Fields: 17.3 percent
- Fenwick & West: 15.5 percent
- Winstead: 11.5 percent
- Cadwalader: 11.1 percent
For the smallest of Biglaw firms (150-299 attorneys), these are the best for lawyers of color:

- Atkinson Andelson: 25.0 percent
- Best Best: 20.0 percent
- Hanson Bridgett: 19.4 percent
- Sedgwick: 18.4 percent
- Munger Tolles: 17.1 percent
Check out Law360 for [rankings of the smallest law firms](https://www.law360.com/articles/954556) (20 to 149 attorneys).

Strategies for ensuring minority lawyers have a good shot at making partner differ from firm to firm, and include formal mentorship programs, business marketing workshops, and integration into the firm’s community at large. These measures have been met with success, but there is still a difficult road ahead.

Of those on the biggest of Biglaw list, Wilson Sonsini has the highest percentage of minority equity partners, at 20.3 percent. The rest of the ranked firms fail to break 20 percent minority equity partners — save for Atkinson Andelson, which assists its minority lawyers with their confidence building by allowing them to dive into client matters without supervision very early on in their careers — and these are the best of the best. While these firms should be applauded for their efforts to increase racial diversity, there is still much more work to be done.

Must be Thursday.

We all knew that there would be consequences after the Supreme Court decided the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard case, but did we know how far and wide [its tentacles would reach](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SCRJ_SFFA-v-Harvard-FAQ.pdf)?

Here’s one example: America First Legal has filed a formal complaint against several judges in the Southern District of Illinois, alleging that these three judges are accused of “ongoing unlawful judicial race and sex discrimination that violates Rule for Judicial-Conduct and Judicial-Disability Proceedings 4(a), Judicial Code of Conduct Canon 2(A), and the Fifth Amendment.” The judicial complaint alleges that [certain standing orders](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/ethics-complaint-spotlights-judges-courtroom-advocacy-policies) allowing newer women and minority lawyers to argue cases in the circuit “have established policies of granting oral argument in a case based partly on a lawyer’s sex and race. Those policies constitute judicial misconduct because they unlawfully discriminate, evidence judicial bias, undermine faith in the judiciary’s integrity, and violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment.” Phooey.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
Just let a newer woman or minority attorney try to get some chances that men have always had in the profession and they pout (yes, men do pout). How far may a judge in his or her discretion provide courtroom opportunities for younger lawyers without ignoring Students for Fair Admissions? Is it up to [the individual judge to decide](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/ethics-complaint-spotlights-judges-courtroom-advocacy-policies) how to handle? Could that be considered a matter of “judicial discretion”? It’s the old story of how do you get experience unless you get experience.

After close to 50 years in practice, I feel like [Sisyphus](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Sisyphus), schlepping that rock up the mountain and never reaching the summit. One friend fulminated on a regular basis that white guy lawyers like him were being discriminated against. Now, after Students for Fair Admissions, he can stop whining.

Rant Two: And if women had ever had the audacity to think (yes, we do think) that sexual harassment was pretty much a thing of the past, just look at the hijinks, or rather, lowjinks at the most recent Legalweek conference.

A few examples: An invitation to a threesome; a proposition by a needy male lawyer prompted by his pregnant wife on bed rest; pestering a woman to the extent that he had to be escorted out, even after a drink thrown at him did not deter him; being grabbed under the skirt by a coworker; being pulled into the men’s room and not allowed to leave; and [other similar horror stories](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/02/sexual-harassment-allegations-pile-up-at-annual-legal-tech-conference/). I am not making these up. I wish I were.

Do you think that the clueless will ever understand that a conference is not a sex-themed Disneyland ticket? Does going to a conference give attendees a pass to act despicably and not worry about whether what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas? No carte blanche for frat party antics, please. I thought we had moved beyond that, but I was wrong. My bad. Perhaps taking away the alcohol consumption might make the conferences more dry, literally and figuratively, but would that be such a bad idea?

Meanwhile, even though the federal district here in Los Angeles has ruled that disgraced and disbarred lawyer Tom Girardi is competent to stand trial for his various alleged misdeeds, his attorney in Chicago is asking for a second competency hearing. Because the charges in the Chicago case do not mirror the ones in the Los Angeles case, Girardi might not be competent to understand them, so argues his lawyer. The judge presiding over the Chicago case suggested that the request for a [second competency hearing be deferred](https://www.dailyjournal.com/articles/376999-girardi-lawyer-wants-new-competency-hearing-in-chicago) until after the conclusion of Girardi’s Los Angeles case, which is scheduled for May. The Chicago judge also severed Girardi’s case from those of the other defendants, so [he will be tried separately](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/illinois-judge-gives-disgraced-lawyer-girardi-his-own-trial?source=newsletter&item=read-text&region=digest) at a date to be determined.

And two of the attorneys in Girardi’s defunct law firm have had [their wrists slapped](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/mypmkozddpr/State%20Bar%20Court%20ruling%20-%20David%20Lira.pdf) by the California State Bar. While the Office of Chief Trial Counsel pushed for David Lira’s interim suspension from the bar, pending trial, the State Bar Court trial judge instead imposed upon Lira, Girardi’s son-in-law, interim restrictions placed on his ability to practice.

The other attorney, [Keith Griffin, received a one-year suspension](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/klvydgaarpg/State%20Bar%20Court%20ruling%20-%20Keith%20Griffin.pdf), with six months actual suspension, and placed on one year’s probation with certain terms and conditions. The State Bar Court trial judge determined that Griffin did not conspire with Girardi to steal client funds, nor did Griffin “act with venality. Though some of Griffin’s acts of concealment were intentional, this court has no doubt that Griffin wanted the clients to be fully and timely paid. But it was the manner and approach taken by Griffin that was ineffectual and misguided, breaching his fiduciary duties.”

The stories do not end there, as the California Supreme Court makes the final calls on disciplinary decisions. Stay tuned.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

# Mentoring As An Act Of Selfishness

I gotcha with that title, didn’t I?

But it can be true, at least within law firms: You can act as a mentor purely because of selfishness.

Within a law firm, a senior person often chooses to mentor a junior person. But who, and why?

Who?

The senior person ordinarily mentors only the junior person who is good. A rare few people might choose to mentor a fool, for whom they had no respect. But that’s not usual. Typically, a senior person works with a junior person who is great. The senior person teaches the junior person about the practice of law, introduces the junior person to important folks, invites the junior person to co-author articles, invites the junior person to participate on panels, and otherwise advances the junior person’s career.

Why?

Is that pure altruism?

I think not.

First, it’s not pure altruism; it’s human nature. (Maybe the fact that I posit “altruism” and “human nature” as opposites suggests more about me than I should reveal publicly.) If you meet somebody who’s good, you help that person.

Second, it’s a little bit of altruism. You should help younger people. If you meet somebody who’s good, that’s the one to help.

But third — and this is really my point — it’s also selfishness. Good associates are in high demand at law firms. Bad associates are not. (Why should a partner never call the head of the L.A. office and say, “I have a case with some L.A. tentacles; who can you offer me?” Because the head of the L.A. office will naturally give you the associate who has some free time. That’s terrible! The person has free time only because the person is no damn good! You want the person who’s already ferociously busy, because that’s the talented one.)

Anyway, if there is — and, believe me (I worked at a large firm for 20 years), there is — competition among partners for associates who are good, then how is a partner to ensure that good associates want to work for the partner? By being perceived as a good partner to work for: You’re the partner who hands out good work, introduces associates to clients, creates business development opportunities for associates, goes to bat for associates who are up for partnership, and so on. In other words, to get good associates to work for you, be a mentor!

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
It’s not altruism; it’s selfishness: Being a mentor is the way you get talented associates to work on your matters.

I grant that this doesn’t apply across the board. In a corporate structure, you have six or eight direct reports who will report to you until they quit, retire, get promoted, get fired, or die. There’s less internal competition for talent (as exists within law firms), and you don’t have to be a good boss to convince these people to work for you. (Perhaps you have to be a good boss to keep your direct reports from quitting, but that’s not the same as the competition for talent within large law firms.) You might nonetheless mentor your direct reports out of a sense of human decency, or obligation, or because your corporation requires it, or whatever. But it’s not quite the same as at a law firm.

Moreover, there are certainly some people who choose to act as mentors to people outside their own organizations: There are senior people who help junior people whom they met at a bar event, or on a non-profit board, or whatever. Maybe those mentors are acting out of altruism (or friendship, or some such thing).

But within law firms, there are really two reasons to be a mentor: The first is altruism. The second is pure selfishness.

Lawyers in the Am Law 100 considering an in-house move can expect substantially higher salaries than those lacking large firm experience, according to a survey released this week. 

The 2021 In-House Compensation Report from BarkerGilmore, a legal and compliance recruitment firm, reveals that in-house lawyers with Am Law 100 experience had average total compensation packages that were 35% higher than those for lawyers with no law firm experience. The difference was highest at the general counsel level, which showed a 41% gap. 

In-house lawyers with experience in smaller firms were also more highly compensated than those with no law firm experience, though they still trailed the Am Law 100 lawyers at the general counsel, managing counsel, and senior counsel levels.

Ever wonder which giant law firms are the ones helping startups grow and realize their full potential? [Kruze Consulting did.](https://kruzeconsulting.com/blog/post/top-5-startup-law-firms/) Kruze is a CPA, tax and consulting firm and they looked at the legal spend at over 140 Seed, Series A, and Series B U.S. startups. All told, these startups spent $18 million dollars on legal services over the course of a year. That breaks down to a yearly legal spend of $77,150 on average per startup, while $38,990 is the median legal spend per startup.

So without further ado, the top five startup Biglaw firm, based on the amount of money billed to startup clients, are:

1) Fenwick & West
2) Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati
3) Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian
4) Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe
5) Perkins Coie

The data was also sliced a slightly different way — by number of startup clients in the analysis — to get these (slightly) different rankings:

1) Fenwick & West
2) Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian
3) Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe
4) Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati
5) Goodwin Procter

Fenwick partner Kristine Di Bacco said her firm focuses on getting startup clients through all stages of their legal needs:

“We are proud of the work we do with early stage startups, from financing to IP to acquisition advice. Startup founders turn to us because they know we can support them from their first financing round to their IPO and beyond.”

# Being The Kind Of Lawyer That Actually Makes The World A Better Place
## You are more than your last achievement.

In this episode, I speak with Heather Weigler, Assistant Attorney General at the Oregon Department of Justice, about escaping Biglaw and making the world a better place. Heather tried to eliminate the existential dread and unhappiness from work that affected her life and well-being. Gender imbalance in the legal realm further motivated her to volunteer to help women gain their place in the industry.

Tune in to know how Heather manages to be more than her last achievement, finding that unicorn of a legal job, and using stand-up comedy and TikTok as a release from job stress.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wore when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

The first time I was pregnant, I was incredibly anxious to tell my firm.

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I was new to the firm. It was in a new state, for which I had uprooted my spouse and dog to move away from all of our family. I had also been dealing with infertility for years. At the time, I was undergoing treatment for a pituitary adenoma (a fancy way of saying a tumor) that was screwing with my hormones and was the root cause of my infertility. Long story short, I was starting to wonder whether I could even conceive in the first place. Imagine my surprise two months into my brand new job when I found out I was pregnant.

I was incredibly anxious to tell my firm.

To be frank — I worried that I would lose my job.

I waited as long as possible to say anything. At 21 weeks, when I was showing and could no longer hide it with ponchos, I broke the news. Then I put my head back down and worked as hard as I could straight through marching out the door to the hospital while in labor, all in an effort to prove my worth to the firm so that when I took my parental leave I could rest assured I was coming back to a job that I very much wanted. This approach may have eased my anxiety, but on reflection it did a disservice to my team and my clients. I did not plan for a successful transition to and out of parental leave in a way that served my clients or my colleagues.

Looking back, two points jump out at me.

First, what a difference it would have made for me then if I had the assurance that in my firm becoming a parent was celebrated, that pregnant team members were welcomed, that the firm would support my transition to parental leave and welcome me back from it without experiencing the motherhood penalty so many of us face. Second, if I had a do-over, I would have been much more intentional about planning for parental leave so that I did not leave my colleagues or clients in the lurch.

On the first point, I cannot even begin to tell you the number of conversations I see frequently in law mom groups that I am part of that all share the same fear:  mothers scared to tell employers they are pregnant. The conversations generated by these fears run the gamut. You can really tell the difference between mothers who have worked in very supportive environments and those who experienced the confirmation of their worst fears by being terminated or sidelined. Every time, I am left with this thought: What is it going to take to finally change the tune at firms, so that parents no longer need to fear if or when to raise the question of growing their family? How sad it is that firms do not realize the goodwill and employee loyalty they could generate by cultivating a culture that celebrates and supports families at every stage.

I now know that my job was never on the line because I was pregnant.

How do I know this?

From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
I’m pregnant. By the time this article is published, I’ll have just crossed over into my second trimester.

Driven mostly by my desire to be much more intentional about planning for my parental leave, I shared the news with my managing partner the day I had my first prenatal appointment. In the conversation that followed after breaking the news, I also shared why I made the decision to disclose the news so much earlier this time. I was frank, sharing the anxiety I had then and also sharing how great an impression it made on me at the time that my firm not just stuck with me but also allowed me to take maternity leave despite having been at the firm for less than the minimum time needed to qualify under FMLA.

“That’s just not our culture,” my managing partner responded. “It never would have happened.”

I’m tearing up as I write this because this goes back to my first point. I wish I had known that six years ago.

In the time since I was previously pregnant, my firm has demonstrated its support for parents. The firm now offers 12 weeks fully paid parental leave that can be used at any point within the first 12 months after adding a new child to the family — by birth, or surrogacy, or adoption. By either parent, regardless of gender, whether or not you are the one who physically gave birth. I’m proud to say the leave has been used (and supported) by both fathers and mothers in my firm.

I have six months to prepare for the leave I plan to take. I’m already working with my coach on it. This time, I have no concerns over the stability of my job or whether it will be there for me when I come back. I’m more concerned about making sure that I have a solid plan in place to either wrap up projects before my due date or to transition them to colleagues for while I am away, and making sure my clients know who will be serving them in the interim. The relief I feel in knowing I can focus on this preparation and not on proving my worth is immeasurable.

I’m a damn good tax attorney.

I will be one until I go out on leave, while I am out on leave, and when I return.

Wish me luck.

# Some 'Competitive' Biglaw Firms Will Likely Bow Out From The COVID Bonus Wars

‘Why did I pick this firm?’

A lot will have pressure to do it, and maybe some will and some won’t. I think the [financial] variation is causing many law firm chairs to be performing a very delicate balancing act. There will be a group of firms, perhaps as large as a quarter of the Am Law 200, that doesn’t have as much flexibility to stay as competitive as they historically have.

— Kent Zimmermann, a consultant for Zeughauser Group, commenting on the [COVID bonus wars](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2020/09/17/associate-bonus-wars-rage-even-in-2020-but-should-some-firms-sit-it-out/) that are currently ongoing among elite Biglaw firms. Thus far, Kirkland & Ellis, a firm that’s known for being competitive on pay, has already [decided not to participate](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/kirklands-not-giving-special-bonuses-and-associates-are-salty-about-it/) in the announcement of fall bonuses.

# The Hunger Games And The Law Firm Life
## Law firm life is like the Hunger Games -- and that's not entirely bad, according to partner Jayne Backett.

“The odds are never in our favor.”

I’ve not traditionally been a fan of science fiction, but something about the Hunger Games films really captivated me. It’s that eerie undertone that the films portray about social control and how, at the heart of all things, the strongest motivating force for individuals is to remove their loved ones from poverty.

The Hunger Games chose a fitting protagonist in Jennifer Lawrence, who has emerged as a trailblazing female voice in Hollywood. Not only has she spoken out about the unfair body image expectations on women in the media, but she has written passionately about gender pay gap issues. In a [Lenny Letter](http://www.lennyletter.com/work/a147/jennifer-lawrence-why-do-i-make-less-than-my-male-costars/) she wrote about how, when the wages of some of her co-stars were leaked on the internet, she was angry with herself for not negotiating harder, but then she felt held back by wanting to be liked and not wanting to seem “difficult” or “spoiled”. Lawrence articulated in the letter how at work she expressed an opinion in a matter-of-fact way, only for a male colleague to recoil as though she was angry.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.

People are simply not conditioned to straight-talking women. Indeed, there was quite a scandal at the start of this year when Jennifer Lawrence mocked a disengaged reporter who was questioning her whilst on his mobile phone. People accused her of being arrogant and conceited and rude. Not many people acknowledged that the reporter who was taking up her valuable time couldn’t focus enough on what he was asking her to remember that they were at the Golden Globes and not the Oscars. As women, we are expected to sugarcoat everything, and we do so for fear of being seen as too aggressive. I have lost count of the number of times people have told me I am aggressive (because I happen to be extremely straight-talking).

Working in a law firm can be a lot like being in the Hunger Games. It’s most potently apparent when you start out as a trainee or first-year associate and then again when you become a partner. You are intensely monitored, your behaviour is analysed and questioned at every turn, and you are largely pitted against peers to measure your performance and determine your suitability for productivity and survival. No one takes a single thing you say or do at face value; you constantly have to prove your worth.

The whole practice of the law, in fact, relies on a constant underlying hunger. You have to be hungry to learn, hungry to take on enormous workloads, hungry to succeed in creating phenomenal work product, and hungry to win new work. When I see junior lawyers practicing the law without an attitude that resembles that of a salivating wolf, I don’t trust them.

I recall an incident with a junior lawyer who I was once briefing on some work and they had the audacity to yawn lazily and rock back on their chair in the midst of the briefing. To be fair, the information I was delivering was undoubtedly mind-numbingly dull, but that was irrelevant since that person should have been biting my arm off to take the work from me. Like Jennifer Lawrence with the disengaged reporter, my respect for that person and their capability to do their job dropped off a cliff. Part of me did naturally wonder if that person would have treated a senior man in the same way that they were treating me. In any case, once I didn’t believe they were committed and hungry, it was unlikely that they ever would be. This is called the [“Pygmalion Effect”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect), where your beliefs about people become self-fulfilling.

Law firms depend on a combination of [hothousing](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/hothousing) and the Pygmalion Effect to create a super-league of lawyers within their organisation. Hothousing involves a level of close mentoring, confidence building, and boundary breaking. By boundary breaking, I mean pushing people (sometimes unwillingly) outside of their comfort zones, but in a way that provides them with the support they need to fall back on if it proves too difficult. This might be asking someone to prepare for and lead a client call when they are very junior or draft documents that would traditionally be prepared by people many years above their qualification banding. Giving a junior the chance to tackle a task and stepping in to guide them when things go off track is the way law firms can realise a return on their investment most quickly, since the business model depends on doing high-quality work at the most cost-effective level to remain competitive. Additionally, by using the Pygmalion Effect and treating members of the team as though they are part of the Top Gun Academy, reinforcing their status as “the elite”, “the top one percent” and “the best of the best”, you generate a self-belief and unison within the team that drives a commitment to achieve ever loftier goals.

However, one of the biggest differences between the Hunger Games and the legal profession is that the Hunger Games encouraged the disadvantaged, poor and starving people to compete in the games because it was sporting entertainment for the wealthy Capitol dwellers. The legal profession has been a closed-door environment, with very few opportunities for people from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds to enter.

This is why the wonderful work of organisations like Aspiring Solicitors and the Diversity Access Scheme in the UK legal market is so crucial, but, as with much change, political weight is also required to make positive and impactful waves on the way businesses operate. It will be with that in mind that we await the full effect of the implementation of the apprenticeship levy in the UK from April next year. The levy will require businesses with a wage bill exceeding £3m per annum to contribute 0.5% of their overall wage bill to fund apprentice schemes, but, critically, part of the levy can be banked by way of e-vouchers for a business to reclaim on apprenticeship training within its own organisation.

Conversely, those who may be particularly apt for law firm life, those with a voracious hunger to make change in their social and financial stratas, have been largely shut out of the profession. The irony of this, in a profession based on justice and equality, should not be lost. Not having a chance to compete is, after all, worse than having the chance and the odds not being in your favor.

This year may have begun solidly, but we are now in an unanticipated recession and the landscape looks very different for law firms in this second quarter and beyond. We anticipate that first-half results will be challenging. Managing cash flow—from recording time to collecting on inventory to managing expenses—will be key. And as we hear from many law firms, so will staying close to clients and finding ways to bring value to them in these unprecedented and troubling times.

— Gretta Rusanow, managing director and head of advisory services within Citi Private Bank’s Law Firm Group, noting that [while Biglaw had a decent first quarter, many challenges lie ahead](https://www.law.com/2020/05/13/after-a-strong-first-quarter-citi-says-firms-are-focused-on-cash-flow-292-67123/), with median projections of 15 percent declines in second-quarter demand and revenue, both of which are driven by an estimated 11 percent lengthening of the collection cycle.

Listen, full disclosure. I’m not a plant person. I’ve tried, really I have. Especially during quarantine, keeping some houseplants alive and thriving seemed like an admirable hobby. I even downloaded the Planta app to remind me when they need to be watered or misted or re-potted. But, it was mostly a disaster more likely to draw gnats than grow new leaves. I’ve since move on to bird watching and the Merlin app, which I’m much more successful at (I spotted 4! American Goldfinches this morning), but my failure to develop a green thumb still sticks in my craw.

In any event, Kramer Levin is the latest firm to give associates and staffers a little token of appreciation. We’ve seen [hats](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-says-youre-expecting-a-bonus-but-please-accept-this-hat-instead/?rf=1), an [RV visit](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-decided-road-trip-not-bonuses-is-the-way-to-associates-hearts/), [take out](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/firm-ignores-biglaw-special-bonus-trend-gives-associates-the-gift-of-takeout-food/), and [stress balls](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/biglaw-firm-hands-out-stress-balls-in-lieu-of-special-bonuses/) so far. And Kramer Levin has decided to gift plants, which, for fellow brown thumbs like me, is basically a guilt trip waiting to happen as you slowly watch the flora die.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…

But, the thing is, [associates at the firm are already salty](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/kl-special-bonuses/) about the hours requirement linked to their special bonuses. And, well, plants aren’t going to change that.

But listen, don’t take my word for it. Let’s check in with some tipsters at the firm.

After special bonuses tied strictly to client billable hours which was a higher requirement than customary yearly threshold, Kramer Levin shows “appreciation” by sending everyone a plant.

LOL Kramer levin giving associates plants for “staff appreciation day” what an absolute joke. The firm is consistently out of touch with its associate base and is increasingly off market in its comp structure

Folks sure don’t seem pleased.

I get that the gesture was well intentioned, but when associates feel like they’re getting the shaft on bonuses, these gestures will continue to frustrate.

# After Nixon Peabody Hitched Itself To Donald Trump, Blindsided Partners Told To Get Over It
## Nixon Peabody's attempt to explain its representation of Donald Trump raises more questions than it answered.

Yesterday, Nixon Peabody managing partner Steve Zubiago convened a special firm-wide meeting regarding [the firm’s new client Donald Trump](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/biglaw-firm-adds-donald-trump-as-client-rest-of-the-firm-may-not-be-too-happy-about-it/). While every other Biglaw firm has [cut ties with any partner taking on Trump](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/biglaw-partner-leaves-firm-to-represent-donald-trump-in-criminal-case/) in a bid to shield the firm’s professional reputation from getting compromised by public stances like downplaying January 6 as mere puffery… [like Nixon Peabody just did](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2023/11/Trump-Nixon.pdf).

The message to the nervous partnership: Get over it.

In a meeting that reportedly lasted less than 15 minutes and offered no opportunity for questions, Zubiago informed the firm that he didn’t think the firm would suffer reputational damage because, so far, it hasn’t garnered much media traction (other than Above the Law of course).

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.

Yes, nothing says “we’re not worried about this coverage” like a hastily thrown together firm-wide meeting that ends with a refusal to take questions.



In our original coverage, sources suggested that the representation had skirted existing intake procedures and we wondered if Zubiago had perhaps not known of the impending debacle beforehand. At the meeting, Zubiago confirmed that any claim that he was unaware of the firm taking the case is untrue.

Oh. That’s much worse then.

According to reports from Nixon sources, Zubiago then informed the collected firm that the Trump matter is not unique and that Nixon takes on many new matters that are not publicized to the rest of the partners. Not sure the message, “if this took you by surprise, you should get a load of all the other potentially damaging representations we take on without your knowledge” is going to play as well with a crowd of risk-averse attorneys as he thinks.

Zubiago apparently added that the case came through the Republican Party as opposed to Trump directly, a distinction without difference since the firm is representing “Donald Trump” regardless of who referred the matter.

But the fact that Trump is the actual client is key to the weirdest tidbit from the account of this meeting: Zubiago seemingly suggested that he was taken off guard by the January 6 reference in the case.

HOW?!?!?

Yes, it is entirely possible to argue that a private citizen cannot invoke the Fourteenth Amendment to bar a candidate from appearing on the ballot and leave it at that. But Donald Trump is the client. He’s literally not shut up about how he did nothing wrong on January 6 since… January 6. His people inject it into conversations about the weather! I think Rudy has it as a tattoo! Was the theory that he wouldn’t demand it have a starring role in his attorney’s brief in a case ABOUT JANUARY 6?!?!?

# Being In-House Is Not Necessarily What You Think It Is
## It’s no surprise that a recent survey of in-house counsel revealed that they are not necessarily a bunch of happy campers.

In dinosaur times, there used to be several points of view about in-house counsel jobs. One was that it was a gravy train with regular hours, a steady paycheck, minimal annual increases, but a sense of security that the employment rug was not going to be pulled out from under you. Accompanying that was the “holier than thou” attitude of outside counsel, who thought that in-house attorneys weren’t that smart and were relegated to doing the drudge legal work, while the outside counsel got to work on the Big Important Cases.

Another view was the reverse: outside counsel drooling at the thought of regular hours, steady income, unlikely “off with their heads,” and willing to trade, in a heartbeat, the arduous effort of “dialing for dollars” (e.g., collecting receivables), in exchange for that paycheck but at a usually significant reduction in pay. Of course, outside counsel still had the snobbish attitude toward in-housers, but when the rare in-house job opportunity presented itself, outside counsel resumes would flood the GC’s inbox.

Over the years, the tune has changed and being in-house is no longer the bed of roses that outside counsel considered it to be. Longer hours with demands from various clients flowing in concurrently — and they all want everything done rightthisminute. There’s corporate infighting; you need to protect your back and even your front, especially at acquisition time and especially if you are on the acquiree side. Bye-bye to any sense of job security.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Consider that opportunities for advancement within the legal department may be slim to none, especially if the senior staff is of comparable age to you. Even if the GC and her deputies are “aging out” — to use the politest term I can think of — there’s no guarantee whatsoever that any legal department succession plan will be used. It’s more than likely that the search will be for candidates outside the organization, even if internal candidates are considered. It’s looking in your closet full of perfectly fine clothes and then wailing that you don’t have anything to wear.  Internal candidates are often overlooked and often to the detriment of organizations.

Another consideration: you may well become known as a “subject matter expert.” That is a double-edged sword. You will be respected for the expertise that you bring to that area, and that is a good thing. Clients will come to you directly because they know that you either know the answer or will get it for them. However, being a subject matter expert can also limit your opportunities to expand your knowledge in areas that you might not be familiar with but want to learn. There’s no on-the-job training in in-house departments. They are just too busy and need the new hires to be able to transition into their jobs flawlessly. No time for a learning curve.

So, it’s no surprise that a recent survey of in-house counsel revealed that they are not necessarily a bunch of happy campers. As Joe Patrice points out, to have more than half of in-house lawyers report either actively searching for a new gig or open to consider a new gig is a startling number. One of the knocks on in-house work is an accurate one: in-housers do [more of the routine drudge work](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/most-in-house-counsel-are-open-to-new-jobs/) (you can’t afford for outside counsel to do that work) and, often, the most compelling and interesting work, the “you bet your company” work defaults to outside counsel.

But, as the recent Axiom survey points out, leaving in-house is easier said than done. Axiom lists four factors for the reluctance to switch jobs, [even if the burnout level is approaching 50%](https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2022/10/13/47-of-inhouse-counsel-are-burned-out-but-theyre-not-leaving-why/). The likelihood of a recession is one factor motivating peeps to stay put. For all of us who endured the Great Recession of 2008-10, remember that it was not a good time to move, even if you still had a job to move from and move to.

Another factor: “golden handcuffs.” Income and benefits such as stock options, bonuses, and deferred compensation are other reasons that in-house peeps are reluctant to move. It’s often hard to find an in-house position with comparable compensation and the cachet of a corporate title. (Sorry to tell you this, but some companies scatter corporate titles like grass seed.)

Then there’s good old inertia. First, you must decide to leave, or at least look, then you must revise your resume so that it doesn’t get kicked out by the automated resume screener, and then you must interview, at least several times, if not more. Even if you get the new gig, you are then the new person in the department, getting used to new peeps, new ways of handling matters, a new corporate culture, and a new boss or bosses plus new clients. And if you weren’t already stressed to the max in your current job, a new gig can truly put you over the top of the anxiety scale.

Axiom says the final factor is “normalization,” or the rationalization that this kind of burnout/anxiety is a routine part of law practice, and the grass is not going to be greener anywhere else, despite what you may think or observe. The tendency is to just suck it up.

I’m not saying that that’s what you must do. Weigh the pros and cons of making a move. A move to in-house may be great or a disaster. Just make sure to not only look before you leap but think long and hard about what you are willing to trade. You want the juice to be worth the squeeze.

She’s had a diverse legal career, including stints as a deputy district attorney, a solo practice, and several senior in-house gigs. She now mediates full-time, which gives her the opportunity to see dinosaurs, millennials, and those in-between interact — it’s not always civil.

Ed. Note: Welcome to our daily feature [Trivia Question of the Day!](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/trivia-question-of-the-day/)

The top 25 largest law firms operating in New York had an increase of what percentage of partner promotions from early April 2021 to the present compared with the 12 months prior?

Hint: Of the phenomenon, Adam Smith, Esq. president Bruce MacEwan said, “They’re playing catchup. They had small partner classes and anticipated an uncertain environment, but the environment turned out to be a blow-the-the-lights-out environment, so they need bodies.”

See the answer on the next page.

# Rudy Giuliani Taking Break From Embarrassing Greenberg Traurig To Focus On Embarrassing Himself
## Rudy Giuliani leaves his job after dragging his firm through his shameful tirades.

Mere days after Greenberg Traurig chair Richard Rosenbaum was forced to provide [tepid support](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/only-a-handful-of-lawyers-at-this-firm-support-donald-trump-and-one-of-them-is-rudy-giuliani/) for partner Rudy Giuliani’s increasingly unhinged media appearances as a Trump surrogate, Giuliani has decided to step away from the firm until after the election.

In an email sent to the firm’s top attorneys, Rosenbaum explains that the former NYC mayor and current festering blister of a human being Rudy Giuliani will take a voluntary leave of absence from Greenberg Traurig effective tomorrow through the rest of the election:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  


In any situation like this, one has to wonder exactly how “voluntary” this move really was. It’s hard to believe Greenberg Traurig bigwigs never once had a sit-down to explain how going on TV to explain how Hillary Clinton was “[too stupid to be president](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/nyregion/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump.html)” wasn’t putting the firm’s best foot forward.

The comically tragic element of this whole affair is that Giuliani’s decision required calmly evaluating Trump’s electoral chances — and, by extension, Giuliani’s chances of becoming attorney general or some other such Lovecraftian horror — and deciding that he was still going to walk away and leave his partners and clients in the lurch for a few months. Indeed, it would seem Giuliani — if he’s still viewing this rationally at all — enjoys spouting racist and sexist stuff on TV more than his own job.

A lot of people hate Biglaw practice, but most folks don’t hate it that much.

# Is The NYT Jones Day Take-Down Actually A Take-Down?

It’s not often that you open up the New York Times and see a major investigative story on a Biglaw firm. But in late August, the NYT Magazine ran a sprawling story on how [Jones Day purportedly reshaped the American judiciary](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/magazine/jones-day-trump.html) by masterminding and orchestrating the appointment of a massive number of conservative judges, including no less than three Supreme Court justices.

A few days later, it ran another [extensive piece on how Jones Day ](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/business/abbott-baby-formula-lawsuits-jones-day.html)successfully defended and settled cases on behalf of Abbott Laboratories in a string of cases related to allegedly contaminated powdered baby formula through “scorched earth tactics.”

These articles are unusual. Set aside the fact that often these stories aren’t told because a generalist audience might not find them interesting. Many publications shy away from directly reporting on top law firms for fear of becoming embroiled in a dispute with them — a sort of implicit recognition that the firms are so powerful one might not want to cross them.

For instance, when I’ve written pieces about law firm practices for some publications, I’ve been asked to remove the direct naming of the firms and instead replace that with general descriptions (so imagine instead of me writing this piece directly saying the words “Jones Day,” I’d be asked to refer only to “one of the largest international firms.”) Above the Law has never asked for such treatment and provides a platform for honest discussion in pursuit of improving the industry. Yet, there aren’t many similar avenues. The fact that the New York Times is going full throttle is unique.

These two stories are adapted from “[Servants of the Damned: Giant Law Firms, Donald Trump, and the Corruption of Justice](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/servants-of-the-damned-david-enrich?variant=40153396346914),” the tell-all book by New York Times reporter David Enrich which comes out Tuesday. In it, Enrich apparently also reports that Donald Trump tried to pay a white-shoe law firm [with the deed to a $5 million horse ](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/sep/05/donald-trump-tried-pay-lawyer-horse-book-david-enrich-servants-of-the-damned?fbclid=IwAR1MpRyQfmMVe3mEkkIGaw7s8VsbGcLkuE_m8ds-wng_hEY4Kk6ygbtu1QA)rather than pay an outstanding $2 million bill.

What I think is most interesting about these two Jones Day stories is just how different the upshot of each is, yet both are written in the spirit of revealing that the law firm is something approaching out-of-control.

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In the case of Enrich’s reporting on the evolution of Jones Day into a conservative political force, the reader is confronted with the need to assess whether this is a good or fair thing. The implication of the article is that it is not.

Should a law firm become so enmeshed with a presidential administration that it is hard to “distinguish where Jones Day’s interests ended and the Trump administration’s began”? And if that is fair play in a world of corporate influence and revolving doors in Washington, is the net effect of Jones Day’s influence — which Enrich reports to be to have “helped erase the constitutional right to abortion, erode the separation of church and state, undermine states’ power to control guns and constrain the authority of federal regulators” — good or bad?

In the case of Jones Day’s work to defend Abbott Laboratories, the upshot is that actors like this law firm can help corporations avoid liability for product safety claims through aggressive tactics. The implication is that there is something wrong with this.

These of course are two very different judgments to draw.

As anyone who has [followed my writing](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/the-geopolitics-of-selecting-lawyers/) knows, I believe that there is an increasing imperative for corporate legal departments to be aware of the values of their law firms. Boards are demanding supply chain accountability across issues like sustainability and diversity. [97% of general counsels say](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/97-of-general-counsels-agree-winning-isnt-everything/) they would take action if their law firms didn’t match their values. So, this reporting on one of the most prominent international law firms is a major contribution of data that in-house teams can draw upon when deciding who to work with.

But what is easy to miss is that [there are no universal values.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6963878707765600256/) The subtitle of Enrich’s book about the “corruption of justice” is a categorically opinionated view (as one should be when writing a book). Of course, what that means is that those on the other side of the opinion would probably disregard it as having an agenda and, thus, having no signal. Instead, we should catalogue the facts for future reference.

If you work in a corporation whose public policy efforts align with the direction Jones Day has been pushing America, this would be evidence that they are a great fit and a cause to support. There may be cases where an enterprise absolutely wants a law firm to use “scorched earth tactics” to win. Of course, if the company you work for is pro-choice and anti-guns, or perhaps supporting a broader progressive agenda, then you might think twice about whether they are the right firm to work with in general or on particular matters.

The upshot of all of this is to realize that pretty much everything written about law firms is biased or opinionated. It’s either propaganda (also known as marketing) about how they are the best for their clients and the world or it is reporting which attempts to expose how they aren’t through truth-telling. Somewhere in the middle of all of that are facts being revealed and uncovered about what the firms are actually capable of and what their values are.

At [Hence](http://hence.ai), we’re working to bring this type of data to the moment of selecting a law firm. If an in-house counsel who knew little of Jones Day’s reputation was tasked with vetting the firm, they would probably turn to Google Search, which would turn up both these news stories — and perhaps that of a [recent data breach](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/jones-day-hit-by-data-breach-as-vendor-accellion-hacks-widen). This search would present information completely out of context of the firm’s broader history or relationship with the corporation. By systematizing the collection of such dots of information, we can create a basis for corporate leaders to choose who is a good partner and who is not. While I am arguing against there being an objective good or bad judgment of these firms, I am arguing that judging whether your law firm partners best represent you should include an assessment of the other actions they take. While one can argue that everyone has a right to their own defense, the line between politics and law is very fine, particularly when it comes to outcomes which set legal precedents that override political choices.

We should applaud anyone willing to document in painstaking detail the actions of law firms, as Enrich has, where that would otherwise be left unsaid. But we should be thoughtful in drawing our own conclusions about what’s being said from our own perspectives.

# Biglaw Training Presentation Says 'You Are Online 24/7' And That's Not Even The Worst Advice

Everyone’s talking about this leaked Paul Hastings presentation. A senior associate put together a deck to instruct juniors on Biglaw best practices and included “You are online 24/7” as a bullet point.

And, yeah, that’s off-putting to everyone unwilling to admit that this is exactly how law firms work and [how they’ve worked for decades](https://www.google.com/search?q=so+you+want+to+go+to+law+school&oq=so+you+want+to+go+to+l&aqs=chrome.0.0i512j69i57j0i22i30.4269j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:0d679e5f,vid:nMvARy0lBLE), but for all the furor surrounding the hours, folks are sleeping on just how terrible the rest of this advice is.

Law.com [published this slide the other day](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/04/05/you-are-online-247-why-a-paul-hastings-presentation-went-viral-and-what-it-says-about-law-firm-culture/):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


“The client always comes first and is always right. If a client wants a mountain moved, we move it. No questions.”

This is [exactly how Skadden handled Elon Musk’s Twitter deal](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/twitter-complaint-demonstrates-that-every-lawyer-everywhere-always-is-smarter-than-elon-musk/) and look how that turned out. In fairness, most Biglaw clients are accomplished attorneys themselves and not a billionaire man-child, so most requests won’t suggest waiving due diligence and setting the valuation based on a weed joke. But outside counsel are there to counsel not to rubber stamp. Juniors aren’t going to tell a client no, though they juniors should understand that they work for the firm and that means sometimes they have to help the partners tell the client that the client is stupid.

Gently and deferentially of course.

The rise of remote work has dramatically reshaped the relationship between Lawyers and Law Firms, see how Scale LLP has taken the steps to get…
From [The Team at Scale LLP](https://bit.ly/3HUNY6c)  
“Someone is paying $850+ for one hour of your time. Think about that in everything you do” and “No questions until you’ve tried to figure something out for yourself.” Yes, the client is definitely excited about the prospect of paying $850 so a junior attorney can screw around on Google when they could just call the mid-level and get an answer. No one wants a junior incapable of figuring out the answers eventually, but one of the most important skills they can learn is to gauge the price of pride f**king with you. If it’s a question that’s going to take more than 6 minutes — .1 in law firm lingo — then ask someone else.

The presentation does suggest “talk to your classmates” as a last resort, which reeks of a lazy senior. Why would some random other junior be in a better position than the mid-level working on the same matter?

“‘I don’t know’ is never an acceptable answer.” If that’s the only answer, then this is fair. But “I don’t know… and I’m going to find out” is a very acceptable answer. Attorneys should know what they don’t know and no one is served by making stuff up. Breeding a culture of fear around the idea of admitting a lack of knowledge is how [ChatGPT ends up defaming people](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/jonathan-turley-chatgpt/).

In a statement, Paul Hastings said the material was prepared by an associate “and the views expressed do not reflect the views of the firm or its partners.”

Yeah… maybe the author should have called a senior before running with this training. You know, because it’s all right to ask questions when you don’t really know something.

# How To Be A Crappy Partner, Redux
## Here are a few new ideas that come to mind. Avoid doing them at all costs.

Eight years ago, heaven help me, I published at ATL “[How To Be A Crappy Partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/03/inside-straight-how-to-be-a-crappy-partner/).”

Here’s the backstory:  In my book talks about [The Curmudgeon’s Guide to Practicing Law](https://www.amazon.com/Curmudgeons-Guide-Practicing-Law/dp/1590316762), I explain that I considered writing a chapter called “How To Be A Crappy Partner,” and I give a few examples of what that chapter would have said.

Now, in connection with an ABA podcast, I was asked again to provide examples of being a crappy partner.

On reflection, this could be a very long chapter.

Maybe a book.

A multi-volume set.

Here are a few new ideas that come to mind:

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
“Don’t go dialing for associates late on a Friday afternoon, for God’s sake!  If the client called you on Monday morning, then dial around the office on Monday afternoon to find someone with time to help you.  Don’t realize at 4 p.m. on Friday that you’ve forgotten about the project, and then start dialing for someone who can get you an answer by Monday.  Associates are people too, you know.   We like our weekends.  Not only that — we’re smart people.  We’ll learn pretty quickly not to answer the phone when we see that you’re the one who’s calling late on a Friday.”

Or:

“Don’t give me a deadline of Monday at 9 a.m. when you’re not going to look at the draft for another three weeks!  There’s no need to ruin my weekend unnecessarily.  I understand that you must build in a day or two of slack in case my work’s no good or some essential person becomes unavailable.  But you don’t have to build in weeks of slack that ruin my life for no reason at all.  There’ll be plenty of emergencies at this firm; don’t create unnecessary ones.”

Or:

“If I wrote the memo or article, don’t take my name off the damn thing and replace it with your own.  I work hard writing this stuff; please don’t strip me of all credit.  Now, I’m not crazy:  I realize that, when we file a brief, there might be a reason to have it signed by a partner.  So we can add your name to the brief, and you can sign it.  But the need for your signature is far less on memos or articles.  If I wrote ’em, then leave my name on ’em.  The client won’t be disappointed to see that you passed work down to a junior person, thus reducing expense.  So long as we’re both conversant on the subject, no one will care that I’m the primary author.  And there’s nothing more unfair than removing my name from the by-line of an article, replacing my name with yours, and then adding a first footnote thanking me for my ‘research assistance.’  If I wrote the thing, give me credit.  To do otherwise is just to be a jerk unnecessarily.”

Or:

“Keep me in the loop, for God’s sake!  On most cases, you know everything:  The client is calling you, talking to you, and explaining stuff to you.  All the other associates are reporting to you about what they’ve learned.  But I don’t know anything.  No one’s talking to me.  All I know about the case is what you tell me.  So don’t give me disembodied research projects.  Help me become a lawyer.  Tell me about the client, the situation, and why I’m doing what I’m doing.  That’s the only way to keep me engaged, and it’s the only way to show me what a real lawyer does.  Please make me effective and help my career; don’t stymie it.”

I’m working up a head of steam here!  I told you it could be a multi-volume set.

But you’ll have to come up with other examples on your own.  Have at it.

# Co-Chair Of Biglaw Firm Charged In College Admissions Scandal
## The allegations are shocking.

Gordon Caplan

You’re probably starting to hear about the [college admissions scandal](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/feds-uncover-massive-college-entrance-exam-cheating-plot-n982136) rocking the 1 percent. In recently unsealed documents, 40 people have been charged in a $25 million college entrance exam cheating scandal which include actresses Felicity Huffman (of Desperate Housewives fame) and Lori Loughlin (of 90s nostalgia fest, Fuller House). The scheme had the rich who were worried about their children’s ability to get into elite colleges and universities like Stanford, Georgetown, and USC pay money to have their kids recruited as athletes (without them being athletes) or helping students cheat on admissions exams.

According to the indictment, Willkie Farr co-chair [Gordon Caplan](https://www.willkie.com/professionals/c/caplan-gordon-r) paid $75,000 to college coaches turned government cooperating witnesses for a scheme to have someone else take an admissions exam for his daughter. As part of the scheme, Caplan’s daughter would have to get an accommodation for an untimed exam — though there is no indication Caplan’s daughter actually had a learning difference to justify it — and then a professional test taker would swoop in and take the exam, getting her the scores necessary to get into her dream schools.

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
In a recorded conversation, a cooperating witness explained to Caplan how the scheme worked:

So here’s the first thing we need to do. And I think I mentioned this to your wife. We need to get your daughter tested for a learning difference. Here’s why. If she gets tested for a learning difference, and let’s say it’s my person that does it, or whoever you want to do it, I need that person to get her 100% extended time over multiple days. So what that means is, we’ll have to show that there’s some discrepancies in her learning, which there’s gotta be anyways. And if she gets 100%, Gordon, then, I own two schools. I can have her test at one of my schools, and I can guarantee her a score. If it’s ACT, I can guarantee her a score in the, in the 30s. And if it’s the SAT, I can guarantee her a score in the 1400s. Now, all of a sudden, her test score does not become an issue with all the colleges. Because she’s strong enough. Then, if we clean up her transcript, then her ability, with her athletic ability and her testing and her getting better at school, it’s much easier to get her into school, because you’re not fighting huge obstacles at the types of schools you’re talking about. Now, if we do that, there’s a financial consideration that you have to pay to the school to get it done, because this is absolutely unheard of, to make this happen. I can make scores happen, and nobody on the planet can get scores to happen. She won’t even know that it happened. It will happen as though, she will think that she’s really super smart, and she got lucky on a test, and you got a score now. There’s lots of ways to do this. I can do anything and everything, if you guys are amenable to doing it.

So Caplan’s daughter wouldn’t even know the helping hand she got to get into college. As the cooperating witness went on to explain to Caplan:

She doesn’t know. Nobody knows what happens. It happened, she feels great about herself. She got a test a score, and now you’re actually capable for help getting into a school. Because the test score’s no longer an issue. Does that make sense?

And though Caplan expressed a little hesitancy in contributing to upending the college entrance playing field in favor of his daughter, the prospect of his daughter getting into elite schools was enough to convince him:

CW-1: What happened is, all the wealthy families that figured out that if I get my kid tested and they get extended time, they can do better on the test. So most of these kids don’t even have issues, but they’re getting time. The playing field is not fair.
CAPLAN: No, it’s not. I mean this is, to be honest, it feels a little weird. But.
CW-1: I know it does. I know it does. But when she gets the score and we have choices, you’re gonna be saying, okay, I’ll take all my kids, we’re gonna do the same thing. (laughing)
CAPLAN: Yeah, I will.

In a follow-up conversation between Caplan and the cooperating witness, Caplan expressed concerns over getting caught in the scheme. He even requested that his daughter did not score too well on the ACT, less the scheme become obvious:

CAPLAN: Yeah, I– I don’t want it to be higher than a 32.
CW-1: Okay. So–
CAPLAN: It’s just– it’s just going to be hard to justify in light– light of– [CW-1] look–
CW-1: No, It–
CAPLAN: I, this is all a hope, right? What she– what we hope she can do.
CW-1: Right.
CAPLAN: We hope she can get a 32 or pretty close thereto.
CW-1: Got you. So can I just– I want to clarify. So she’s going to take the test on her own, she’s going to do her best, all that stuff, and then we’re going to do our magic on the back end.
CAPLAN: You’re going to– you’re going to do what you do.
CW-1: Okay, all right, I just want to make sure that the — I just want to sure that we’re all on the same page. That essentially, that’s why I know I can get a 31,32, you know, so we’re going to aim for 31, so that if we go 30 or 32 we’re safe, how’s that?
CAPLAN: I think that’s fine.

Caplan ultimately wired $75,000 to the cooperating witnesses as part of the scheme. Caplan has been charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud.

The allegations in the indictment are just an astonishing display of elitism and rule breaking. It’s like every hard-working poor kid’s worst dream — not only do they have to beat an educational system that is slanted against them, but rich parents are able to throw money at illegal schemes to get their kids into the best colleges, all with the kid under the illusion they really deserved the place they got.

We reached out to Willkie Farr for comment, but have not received a response as yet.

# Skadden Associate With ALS Stars In 'No Ordinary Campaign,' Documenting His Fight To Cure The Disease

“This is our closing argument for our lives.”

These are the powerful words that Skadden associate [Brian Wallach](https://www.skadden.com/professionals/w/wallach-brian-s) uttered during congressional testimony as he advocated for ALS patients — himself included. Wallach was given just six months to live when he diagnosed with ALS in 2017, and ever since, he’s been in a race against time to change the world for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Six years have passed, and through his hard work, not only has Wallach been making meaningful changes, he’s been winning, big time.

Shortly after his diagnosis, in 2019, Wallach and his wife, Sandra Abrevaya, founded [I AM ALS](https://iamals.org/), a patient-led movement leading the fight for a cure to the disease. Their original goal was to raise $100 million of new funding to find a cure within three years, but thanks to Wallach’s lobbying, they’ve far surpassed that. Between 2019 and 2021, he was able to convince Congress to increase government spending on ALS to $80 million annually, and on top of that, people with ALS are now able to immediately access Social Security benefits. Wallach’s dedication to the cause also led to the passage of the [Accelerating Access to Critical Therapy for ALS Act](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/accelerating-access-critical-therapies-als-act-act-als) (ACT for ALS) — legislation that he helped write — that will afford $100 million annually as part of a five-year action plan for research grants that will speed the development of therapies that can prevent, diagnose, treat, and cure ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Wallach was recently profiled in [“No Ordinary Campaign,”](https://noordinarycampaign.com/) an award-winning documentary film that follows him and his wife as they attempt to forge a path to the future for ALS patients. Check out the trailer:


I recently had the pleasure of chatting with Wallach about the film, his work with Skadden, and what he hopes to achieve next. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our lively conversation.

Staci Zaretsky (SZ): No Ordinary Campaign is such a wonderful, emotional, inspiring film. I’m so happy that you did this and that you were able to share your story and share all of your successes with so many people.

Brian Wallach (BW): It was a big undertaking. If I’m honest, Sandra didn’t want to do it at first because of how much we had to open up our lives to the world. But now we are both really thankful that we did it because so much of what you see cannot be repeated because of my progression and because of the unique situation we found ourselves in with a group of people who were determined to change the world and change the ALS story.

SZ: What an enormous achievement for helping to pass ACT for ALS. How can lawyers keep this progress moving along? What can people do to keep helping?

BW: I was actually one of the people who wrote ACT for ALS, so my background as a lawyer was incredibly helpful for drafting it and for making an argument for it. So number one would be for lawyers to work with nonprofits and with clinics and then with researchers to draft legislation that can help improve the healthcare system piece by piece as much as I want to overhaul it. If we change it piece by piece, before we know it, we’ll have a way better system.

Number two is it would be amazing for lawyers who have a background in trusts and estates and who have a background in Medicaid or Medicare to volunteer to help people with ALS or any other disease who do not know how to navigate the complexity of the system or how to plan their will or their trust so they don’t have to worry about that as they are fighting.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Number three, I would ask all law firms, big and small, to follow the example set by Skadden and make sure to have at least one pro bono client who is a nonprofit in a disease space. Because what I found is that so many nonprofits call me for legal advice and I have to remind them that I was a federal prosecutor and a criminal defense lawyer, so I can’t necessarily instantly help them with, for example, putting together a 501(c)3.

SZ: You brought me to my next question. How has Skadden supported you through your journey?

BW: There’s too many ways to count. Let me just give you a few. Number one is that they’ve enabled me to maintain my practice and I’ve been able to work on exoneration for a man who was convicted of murder in the 1960s. I also have been able to work on voting rights cases, as well as cases for our corporate clients. So for me, that’s been really important to maintaining a balance between who I was and who I am.

Number two, the firm has been amazing in helping I AM ALS grow from an idea to a full-fledged nonprofit that is redefining how we do patient advocacy.

Number three, the firm is a big family and has wrapped me and my family in love and support every step of the way. For example, I have a call every month with a partner in the Chicago office just to check in, and what he has been doing is inviting other people to join those calls so that I’m able to keep in touch with a lot of folks.

SZ: So how would you say staying active in your professional life has helped you cope with what’s going on with your diagnosis and everything that’s unfolding as this progresses?

BW: I have seen others be consumed by their fight. So for me to be able to step back and do something different gives me the head space and the mental room to deal with the physical changes that I’m living with every day. It gives me a balance that’s really important to my mental health.

SZ: What’s your average day like between doing work and off-the-clock activities?

BW: I still work from nine to six — I have about four or five calls every day and I have to write and respond to emails. At 6:00 p.m., I put away work and hang out with my girls, which is amazing, as well as our one-year-old puppy.

SZ: Do you have any advice for someone else who may be newly diagnosed with ALS?

BW: I will say a few things. Number one, this is the most hopeful era ever for ALS. In the past year, we’ve had three new drugs approved and we have a lot more in the pipeline.

Number two, to make sure to take the space to grapple with your diagnosis. For me, for the first six months, I tried to ignore it and that wasn’t healthy. So what I will say is find another person who has ALS. It may be hard to see them because they’re farther progressed but they will help you deal with your emotions and help you see what’s coming up so that you can prepare for it rather than reacting to it when it happens.

Number three, you’re not alone. It may feel like that, but there’s an amazing community who is waiting for you whenever you’re ready to dive in. Don’t worry, you don’t have to change the world, but if you take action to advocate, it will make you feel like you have some control and some power in a situation that otherwise feels powerless.

SZ: You said, “you don’t have to change the world,” but I really think that you have. I think that you have for a lot of people who have ALS.

BW: One funny story is that what I was going through my diagnosis, we met with a doctor in Boston for half an hour. He and I spoke and he assessed me and at the end of that, he said three things. Number one, “I cannot tell you that you do not have ALS. I think you do.” Number two, he looked at my wife and said, “I’m sorry to inform you that you are stuck with this SOB for a while.” Number three, he looked at me and said, “I have a question. You are a person who speaks for a living. You are a lawyer and you have an amazing network. What if you put that all to use to help rewrite the ALS story?” My mom looked at him and said, “No way,” and I looked at him and said, “I like it.”

SZ: I know you’ve said that it’s time for there to be a first ALS survivor. So with all of the work that you have done, and all of the progress that’s been made, and all of the new medication that that’s been rolled out, do you think that we are approaching that time?

BW: I do. The last medication that was approved by the FDA is one for a genetic cause of ALS. Most of the people with this gene mutation that pass away, pass away within two years. What we are seeing is a handful of patients who are now on the medication, who started on the medication right after their diagnosis, and for some of them they look the exact same as they did when they were diagnosed. So I look at that and I see that we are really close to the first survivors and I plan to be here to be a part of that group.

SZ: I’m happy to hear that, and I’m happy that you have such a bright and positive outlook. Is there anything else that you think the Above the Law audience needs to know about how they can help fight, how they can help you, or how they can get involved with ALS-related causes?

BW: I would say two things. Number one is an easy one, go to [iamals.org](http://iamals.org) and put in your email so that you can get updates from us every week.

Number two is the harder one. Most people have no experience with talking to a member of Congress, so it’s intimidating for them, but the good news is that ATL readers have a lot of training and have the ability to make powerful arguments as to why we need to see certain changes. So I would urge them to get involved in whatever disease fight speaks to them and use their power as a lawyer to affect change and cause good trouble.

Wallach is currently looking for a streamer to give this amazing documentary a home. If you’re in a position to help, please do what you can to make sure more people are able to see this incredibly moving and inspirational film.

On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, we’d like to thank Brian Wallach of Skadden and I AM ALS for taking the time to share more about his journey with ALS, and ways that attorneys can get involved to help beat this disease.

# Weil Gotshal Year-End Bonuses Are Nice, But That Doesn't Mean Everyone Is Happy
## Associates have some mixed feelings at the firm.

Year-end bonuses shouldn’t be controversial. Indeed, at most firms, seeing as they merely duplicate the already set market rate, the feeling should be “as expected and happy about it.” But when there’s already discontent simmering at the firm, well, even more money isn’t always enough to smooth that over.

Today, Weil Gotshal announced year-end bonuses, in line with the prevailing market rate. The bonus scale is as follows ([you can read the full memo on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/12/weil-bonus/2/)) and, as is typical at the firm, came without an hours requirement:

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Back in the fall, Weil was among the Biglaw firms to hand out [COVID appreciation bonuses.](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/biglaw-fall-special-bonus-tracker-which-biglaw-firms-are-handing-out-cash-for-associates-hard-work-during-the-pandemic/) But Weil had a [unique spin on those bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/weil-offers-a-new-take-on-fall-bonuses-theyre-hours-based-and-theyre-huge/) — though they were, in theory, very large, they came with a steep billable requirement (compared with other firms that doled out the bonuses based on class year). So, even though those bonuses were in addition to the year-end bonus numbers, it caused quite a bit of consternation among associates. And now with the year-end bonuses simply a match of the prevailing market rate, well, it’s clear attorneys will have to bill a lot of hours to earn themselves full market compensation. As a tipster at the firm noted:

Disappointed in Weil.  They have always paid market bonuses without an hours requirement.  Even though they are having an exceptional year, they are paying below market bonuses for many attorneys.  For a senior associate to make a market bonus, they’d need to bill 2300+ hours.

That’s a lot of hours any year, but in 2020 it seems particularly onerous.

Of course, some folks with particularly high hours were (and remain) happy about using hours rather than seniority to hand out special bonuses. After all, younger associates had to bill far fewer hours to hit or exceed market compensation. But whatever associates thought about the special bonus system, the year-end bonuses hasn’t changed any of that.

# Elite West Coast Biglaw Firm Comes To Play In The Compensation Game

Woohoo! California-based powerhouse Orrick has announced they are providing associates with raises and special bonuses, just like the rest of their peers.

This summer has been a great one if you’re a Biglaw associate — at the most elite firms, natch — looking to put a dent in your student loans. The summer of raises started when Milbank thrilled the Biglaw world with new base compensation for associates. Not to be outdone, this was matched by Simpson Thacher, who topped those numbers with special bonuses. Cravath finally came to play, slightly increasing salaries from the Milbank scale for senior associates. All of which resulted in a [Milbank](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/new-york-to-190k-no-cravath-didnt-make-the-first-move/)/[Simpson](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/biglaw-giant-matches-associate-raises-plus-special-summer-bonuses/)/[Cravath](https://abovethelaw.com/2018/06/cravath-hath-spoken-and-beats-milbank-for-senior-associates/) scale, which Orrick has now met.

There are some differences in how the special bonuses will be handled. No, it isn’t the numbers — those remain the same:



But associates will get half the special bonus now, then have to wait till the end of the year to get the full dollar amount. Sucks if you were thinking of lateraling this year, but given the number of associates and the mid-year cash flow issues some firms have, it’s at least understandable. The special bonus money will be in addition to end of the year bonuses, plus the firm seems pretty generous about hours requirement to receive the bonus:

We will work with your practice group leadership to award these special bonuses based on your overall contribution, including qualitative performance. For this special bonus, 1,850 client representation hours (annualized from December 1, 2017 (the start of our performance year) through May 31, 2018) will be our general guideline for hard work; however, hours alone are never the only determining factor in understanding performance and they won’t be here. Half of this bonus will be paid on July 13 and the other half with our usual year-end bonus award.  If you do not qualify for this special bonus today, but finish the performance year strong, you will become eligible to receive the full special bonus then.  We believe – and our conversations with you have affirmed — that this payment approach is the fairest way to award these bonuses, ensuring that your full-year contribution is considered.  We are awarding these bonuses because we want you to be part of our team; and so for that and other reasons you will need to be employed with the firm at the time we make these bonus payments to receive them. Bonuses will be adjusted for start dates after December 1, 2017 and reduced hours arrangements (but not for leaves of any kind).

But the real way the firm is showing that they want to reward the hard work of everyone at the firm is in spreading the wealth to career associates and project attorneys:

In addition, we will increase base salaries for career associates and project attorneys, recognizing the enormous contribution that these important and growing teams make to our clients and our firm.

Nicely done.

Litigation finance — [what’s the deal with that?](http://mentalfloss.com/article/59044/whats-deal-whats-deal-did-seinfeld-actually-say-it) There are lots of ways to look at this increasingly important field. For example, you might think of litigation funding as a [big help to clients](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/what-should-lawyers-look-for-in-litigation-financing/) (if you’re a litigator), an [uncorrelated asset](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/litigation-finance-truly-an-uncorrelated-asset/) (if you’re an investor), or a [great new exit option](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/01/a-front-row-seat-to-the-rise-of-litigation-finance-an-interview-with-marla-decker/) (if you’re a Biglaw associate looking to try something new).

At last week’s [Litigation Funding Forum](https://litigationfundingforum.com/tickets/?utm_source=DealFlow+Events&utm_campaign=39013852a1-LITFUND_FWD_DFEVENTS_CAMPAIGN_2019_03_12&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e08bf40efd-39013852a1-87946539&mc_cid=39013852a1&mc_eid=553f6a885d), Scott Mozarsky — current [Regional Managing Director at Vannin Capital](https://www.vannin.com/bios/people.php?people=scott-mozarsky), former President of Bloomberg Law, and [contributor to these pages](https://abovethelaw.com/author/scottmozarsky/) — offered another interesting framing for funding.

“What intrigues me about litigation funding is how it solves problems,” Mozarsky said. “For litigants, think of access to justice problems, and access to capital problems. For law firms, which are becoming commoditized, think of growth and differentiation challenges.”

Which brings me to another interesting panel I attended at the Forum, “Litigation Funding in Patent and Intellectual Property Cases.” The complex and challenging world of patent and IP law presents a number of problems to be solved — and litigation financing can help with many of them, as I learned from the panelists:

- [Michael Gulliford](https://litigationfundingforum.com/speaker/michael-gulliford/) (moderator), managing principal at Soryn IP Group;
- [Ron Laurie](https://litigationfundingforum.com/speaker/ron-laurie/), chairman of InventionShare;
- [Phil Hartstein](https://litigationfundingforum.com/speaker/phil-hartstein/), president and CEO of Finjan Cybersecurity; and
- [Heather J. Kliebenstein](https://litigationfundingforum.com/speaker/heather-j-kliebenstein/), partner at Merchant & Gould.
Michael Gulliford opened by observing that litigation finance is an appealing alternative investment right now, given the relatively high prices for other asset classes, with patent cases in particular generating a lot of interest. So in this sense, funding is a solution to the problem of finding reasonably priced, [non-correlated assets](https://abovethelaw.com/2019/04/litigation-finance-truly-an-uncorrelated-asset/). But financing IP cases has its pitfalls; if you’re going to work in this space, you need the expertise.

Ron Laurie of InventionShare — an engineer turned IP lawyer (a founding partner of the Silicon Valley office of Skadden Arps) turned IP investment banker — certainly has such expertise. In his current role as an IP-focused banker, he advises parties to M&A transactions about intellectual property issues, which historically have been treated as an afterthought in many tech transactions.

Why? Laurie chalked it up to the bankers: “When working on a deal, the traditional investment bankers know that the last thing they want to do is introduce any topic that will create a price gap, increasing the risk that the deal won’t close — and that they won’t get paid.”

So historically in tech deals, both sides (or the bankers to both sides) tended to pay little attention to the value of IP assets, meaning that “the acquirer would get the IP basically for nothing” — even if that IP might actually be worth billions. This insight is what led Laurie to become an investment banker focused on enhancing the value of IP assets in complex corporate transactions in the tech space. (Laurie contrasted the tech space with the biotech/pharma space, where it’s all about the value of the IP, and where the parties focus intensely on patent valuation.)

Given his focus on M&A deals, why does Laurie care about litigation? Because valuing IP assets can be very difficult, and patent litigation is the most effective mechanism that currently exists for determining the value of an IP asset. As Laurie put it, “Until a judge and the Federal Circuit tell you the value of your patent, you don’t really know.” After litigation resolves the status of a patent, generating a final determination of its validity and eliminating the risk of it someday being held invalid, that “de-risked” patent is worth so much more.

So patent litigation sounds very useful as a valuation method — but the problem is that it’s also very expensive. According to Gulliford, a straightforward, single-patent case, outside the pharma space, could take anywhere from $2.5 million to $5 million to litigate. And that litigation, including possible appeals to the Federal Circuit or even the Supreme Court, could drag out for anywhere from three to seven years.

This is where litigation financing comes in. Phil Hartstein of Finjan, which has a large and very valuable portfolio of IP that it licenses, is a regular user of litigation funding.

“You can’t run a licensing program today without having some amount of litigation,” he said. “We run a litigation program not because we like litigation, but because it’s a prerequisite for setting up and maintaining a successful licensing program.”

Finjan has annual litigation spend of somewhere between $16 million to $18 million — and as a public company, litigation expenses show up on its balance sheet. Working with funders like Soryn allows Finjan to protect and monetize its valuable IP while keeping expenses to a minimum.

And the funders who have worked with Finjan have been very pleased as well, according to Hartstein. In one case, the company borrowed $10 million and returned $15 million to its funders in short order; in another, the company borrowed $10 million and paid back $19 million before too long.

Litigation funding has also been a boon to IP litigators and law firms. Heather Kliebenstein of Merchant & Gould, which first started exploring the space about two years ago, said her firm has benefited in two ways. First, its clients avail themselves of financing opportunities, which helps them move forward with cases they might otherwise not pursue. Second, the firm gets hired by litigation financiers for due diligence, when the funder wants an outside opinion on the merits of a patent case that it’s thinking about funding. Kliebenstein said she receives about two to three requests each week that are related to funding, either from a client who wants to explore financing or from a funder who wants help with diligence.

“I wouldn’t say it’s out of control,” she said of interest in funding, “but it has blossomed in the past six to twelve months.”

As Michael Gulliford of Soryn noted, however, players in the IP space need to stay on their toes, because both Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court have upended the space in recent years. These legal changes have affected everything from what’s patentable ([Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Corp._v._CLS_Bank_International)) to how and where litigation takes place (the [America Invents Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leahy-Smith_America_Invents_Act) and [TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/tc-heartland-llc-v-kraft-foods-group-brands-llc/)) to what remedies are available ([eBay Inc. v. MercExchange LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay_Inc._v._MercExchange,_L.L.C.)). All these shifts how long a case might last and how lucrative it might be.

So navigating the rapidly changing world of IP law can be trickier than ever, for plaintiffs and lawyers alike. But with the help of litigation funding, solving the problems and facing the challenges can be that much easier.

# The Final Gasps Of A Defunct Biglaw Firm
## We are still feeling the repercussions of 2012.

[Dewey & LeBoeuf](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/dewey-leboeuf/) (through its forebears) may have officially ended its 100+ year run as a law firm in 2012, but the legal ramifications have been ongoing. There have been [convictions](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/05/holy-crap-dewey-know-who-was-convicted-of-felony-charges/) for some of the leaders that steered the once famed white shoe firm into financial ruin — though [no jail time](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/10/no-jail-time-for-convicted-dewey-cfo/). But one of the lagging cases has been the Securities and Exchange Commission’s civil complaint against former Dewey executives.

Last week the SEC announced a settlement of that case with several of the key players. Former Dewey chairman Steven Davis agreed to pay a $130,000 civil penalty; former finance director Francis Canellas agreed to pay $43,178; and former Dewey controller Thomas Mullikin agreed to pay $8,635.78. All that is in addition to the $35,000 former Dewey executive director Stephen DiCarmine agreed to pay earlier this year.

While the $216,000+ might sound nice, as Law.com [reports](https://www.law.com/2018/09/04/sec-reaches-financial-settlements-with-ex-dewey-leboeuf-leaders/?et=&bu=&cn=&src=&pt=), that dollar amount isn’t what the SEC originally imagined they’d be able to collect:

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Still, the civil penalties and disgorgements are a small fraction of the fraud that the [SEC initially alleged](http://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2014-45) was at issue in the case.  At the same time that [criminal charges were announced](http://www.law.com/americanlawyer/almID/1202647450291) in 2014, the SEC alleged in a civil complaint that five Dewey executives and finance professionals facilitated a $150 million fraudulent [bond offering](http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/2010/04/deweyoffering.html) by the law firm, [which collapsed in 2012](http://www.law.com/id=1202556308476/Dewey-Effectively-Done-As-Firm-Files-for-Bankruptcy-Protection/). The SEC alleged that Dewey leaders devised ways to artificially inflate income and distort financial performance, while claiming that the firm’s private bond offering “seized on phony financial figures.”

There is still an outstanding case against the former Dewey executives. They face a civil suit in federal court based on statements made as part of a 2010 bond offering:

Aviva Life and Annuity Co. sued Davis, DiCarmine and Sanders in one case and Canellas in a separate suit for distributing false and misleading information regarding Dewey’s financial condition. Both suits, as well as the SEC action, were put on hold during the criminal trials.

2012 may seem like a long time ago, but as the long legal woes of the once great Dewey prove, Biglaw is still feeling the ramifications of that time.

As Litera notes in its latest M&A Trends report, today’s robust M&A market is the product of factors like low interest rates, a stock market rebound, and stockpiles of private capital.

This is a market with new levels of urgency, certain to push dealmakers to take ever-increasing diligence risks, pursue ever-riskier transactions, and possibly cut corners.

Such an environment presents significant challenges for corporate lawyers, who have a core responsibility of helping their clients avoid buyer’s remorse down the line.

This free on-demand webinar will look at the findings from the M&A Trends report, and detail steps transactional lawyers should consider to minimize these types of risks.

You’ll learn:

- Navigating new factors like PPP loans, EIDL loans, and coronavirus compliance in due diligence
- Avoiding common problems that have emerged, like valuation difficulties or challenges in compiling accurate data
- Emerging tools that can deliver on total diligence in a transaction

# Choo-Choo! Top 50 Firm Boards The Biglaw Bonus Train

Yet another Biglaw firm’s bonus train just pulled into the station, and associates are pleased as can be.

Akin Gump — a firm that took home $1,208,738,000 gross revenue in 2020, putting it in 33rd place in the most recent Am Law 100 — announced that it would be matching the Cravath/DPW year-end and special bonus scale for associates and counsel earlier this morning.

Here’s what that bonus scale looks like at the firm:

Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
Class Year	Year-End Bonus	One-Time Special Bonus
Class of 2021	$15,000 (pro-rated)	n/a
Class of 2020	$20,000	$4,000
Class of 2019	$30,000	$6,000
Class of 2018	$57,500	$11,500
Class of 2017	$75,000	$15,000
Class of 2016	$90,000	$18,000
Class of 2015	$105,000	$21,000
Class of 2014 +	$115,000	$23,000
Before attorneys can go chug-chug-chugging along into bonus paradise, they must have billed 1950 or more hours this year (with pro bono hours, general counsel hours, business development hours, and up to 100 hours of time spent on recruiting, diversity & inclusion, and/or innovation activities counting toward meeting that goal). Associates and counsel whose performance and productivity were “extraordinary” will be awarded additional bonus money.

Congratulations to everyone at Akin on the generous bonuses!

# Biglaw Firm Announces Bonuses Topping The Market Scale
## Firm delivers for associates.

If you’ve got to wait until January to learn about your bonus, the least the firm can do is toss you a little extra to make it worth the wait.

Latham & Watkins is a January bonus player who understands the pain of waiting while your peers at other firms celebrate holiday bonuses. So again this year, Latham is offering a sliding scale of bonuses that top the market base for most associates.

Here are the median and top bonuses by class year announced in the Latham memo. Bonus payments kick in at a 1900-hour minimum:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


Comparing these numbers to last year, there’s definitely a bump for the big revenue firm. Taking the median bonuses of each year:

2019 Median	2020 Median
1st	$15,000	$15,000
2nd	$25,000	$25,875
3rd	$52,500	$53,000
4th	$68,500	$71,500
5th	$85,000	$88,500
6th	$97,500	$100,000
7th	$107,500	$116,000
Last year, the table included one more class year at $110,000. They appear to be sucked up into the 7th year plus class this time around. Otherwise, the firm is showing off another strong year of growth.

Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs.

The U.S. is very competitive in CrossFit, so I would have zero chance to qualify as American, but I was able to qualify as an Iranian. It is pretty exciting for me to represent Iran and to be able to compete at the highest level of the sport.

I am heading down to Madison on July 27, which is four or five days before the competition even starts, just to get acclimated to the humidity, the time change. I realistically expect to be cut early on as they narrow the field down to the top competitors, but [am] hoping to do as well as I can on the first couple of days.

— [Payam Saljoughian](https://www.hansonbridgett.com/Our-Attorneys/payam-a-saljoughian), 32, a senior counsel at Hanson Bridgett, commenting on his [upcoming appearance](https://www.law.com/2019/07/12/this-hanson-bridgett-lawyer-is-set-to-represent-iran-at-the-crossfit-games/) at the Reebok CrossFit Games, where he’ll [represent Iran](https://games.crossfit.com/athlete/34025). Saljoughian is a dual citizen of Iran and the U.S., and was only able to qualify for this year’s event because the [qualifying system was changed](https://www.law.com/2019/07/12/this-hanson-bridgett-lawyer-is-set-to-represent-iran-at-the-crossfit-games/) to be based on citizenship instead of on location. “I don’t train as much as I would if I was not an attorney,” he says.” “But I like balancing both, it is just about time management and consistency.”

# A Federal Judge's Rather Rude Joke About Lesbians

Judge William J. Bauer (via YouTube)

Earlier this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, heard oral arguments in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College. The issue (as stated in the vacated three-judge panel [opinion](http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2016/D07-28/C:15-1720:J:Ripple:con:T:fnOp:N:1801805:S:0)): “whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from or offers redress for discrimination based on sexual orientation.”

The law prohibits employment discrimination “because of sex,” and so the question is whether sexual-orientation discrimination falls under this term. As explained by Mark Joseph Stern of [Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/12/01/_7th_circuit_judges_shred_arguments_that_civil_rights_law_doesn_t_protect.html), “Some federal courts, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, have found that sex discrimination encompasses sexual orientation discrimination—and that anti-gay workplace discrimination is thus already illegal nationwide. Wednesday marked the EEOC’s first opportunity to test this interpretation in a federal appeals court since it adopted the theory in 2015.”

Here’s what jumped out at me (and several tipsters) from the [oral argument](http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/sound/external/nr.15-1720.15-1720_11_30_2016.mp3) (starting around the 37-minute mark):

JUDGE RICHARD POSNER: Why do you think there are lesbians?

JUDGE WILLIAM BAUER: What was the question?

[Laughter.]

Okay, that wasn’t the joke. People laughed because Judge Posner asked a question you don’t often hear in a federal appellate argument, and Judge Bauer asked for clarification in an amusingly befuddled sort of way.

[JOHN MALEY](http://www.btlaw.com/john-r-maley/) [counsel for appellee Ivy Tech]: Why do I think, uh, people are….

JUDGE POSNER: Why do you think there’s this… type of person?

MALEY: The caselaw has cited to….

JUDGE POSNER: This is not a caselaw question. What is the cause of lesbianism?

MALEY: It’s now an immutable characteristic, is what the medical professionals say….

JUDGE BAUER: It’s not just ugly men, huh?

From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Wow. I can’t put it any better than [Mark Joseph Stern](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/11/30/_7th_circuit_considers_anti_gay_employment_discrimination_under_title_vii.html): “Bauer is 90 years old, and that is the kindest thing I can think to say about him at this time.”

When I first heard about this exchange, I wondered also about the appropriateness of Judge Posner’s unorthodox “why are there lesbians” line of questioning. But if you listen to it in context, it makes much more sense (and is, by the way, very Posnerian in its pragmatism). Per Stern:

Posner explains that homosexuality appears to be “part of your genetic makeup,” meaning lesbians are “significantly different from other women.” His point is that, genetically speaking, sex literally includes sexual orientation….

And so Posner’s point is quite germane to a discussion of whether discrimination because of sexual orientation constitutes discrimination “because of sex.” (In addition, as Courthouse News [points out](http://www2.courthousenews.com/seventh-circuit-poised-to-grant-major-gay-rights-victory/), the questioning reflects Posner’s “long-standing interest in the biological roots of sexuality, which he examined in his 1992 book, [Sex and Reason](http://amzn.to/2h2Csvu)” (affiliate link).)

Here’s the other part of the argument that will interest [Article III groupies](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/11/21/scotus-watch) and other fans of the federal judiciary (via [Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/11/30/_7th_circuit_considers_anti_gay_employment_discrimination_under_title_vii.html)):

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Gail Coleman, arguing for the EEOC, follows up [Lambda Legal attorney Gregory Nevins’s] sturdy performance with a clear reiteration of his most critical points—but gets sidetracked by a few silly questions from Judge Diane S. Sykes, who seems to be auditioning to fill the Supreme Court vacancy.

Judge Sykes’s audition is timely — President-elect Donald Trump has said he’ll announce his SCOTUS nominee [“pretty soon”](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/12/trump-to-make-scotus-great-again-pretty-soon/) — but I take issue with Stern’s characterization of her questions as “silly.” If you listen to the relevant part of the argument (starting around 24:00), you’ll see the point she is trying to make. Her argument, in a nutshell: we should compare the alleged treatment of plaintiff Kimberly Hively — a gay, qualified woman — to the treatment that would be given to a gay, qualified man. If Hively and this hypothetical male employee get treated differently, then that would be discrimination “because of sex”; but if they both get the same (mis)treatment, then there’s no discrimination “because of sex.”

This strikes me as reasonable. And Congress could take this whole issue off the plate of courts by simply passing the [Employment Non-Discrimination Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Non-Discrimination_Act) (ENDA), which would ban discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. This method of achieving the (very admirable) goal of prohibiting sexual-orientation discrimination would be preferable to having it done by courts.

I do think, however, that Judge Sykes’s argument would be more persuasive if the Seventh Circuit were writing on a blank slate. The problem for her is Supreme Court precedent, most notably [Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/from-bathrooms-to-body-art-emerging-issues-in-employment-law/?rf=1) (holding that gender stereotyping is actionable as sex discrimination) and [Loving v. Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) (striking down state laws banning interracial marriage — and, by the way, the basis for an [acclaimed new movie](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/11/standard-of-review-loving-is-a-tonic-for-election-blues/)).

Here is how Judge Frank Easterbrook, a leading conservative legal mind, raises Loving (in a question directed to John Maley, counsel to Ivy Tech):

I’d like you to focus on Loving v. Virginia from 1967. State law bans marriages between a black person and a white person. And the Supreme Court holds that that is race discrimination. Here we have an employer’s ban on relations between a woman and a woman. Why isn’t that sex discrimination by exactly the reasoning of Loving?

Maley offers some non sequiturs, like “I recall Loving being a constitutional decision on marriage,” and gets promptly pounced upon by Judge Easterbrook, Judge Posner, and Chief Judge Diane Wood (three of the fiercest intellects on the federal bench, and not a trio you want to mess with).

EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum, speaking to Mark Joseph Stern post-argument, expressed optimism: “The lawyer for Ivy Tech had no answer to the Loving question! None. Judge Easterbrook was right on target. Different judges discussed different theories, but they all led to one conclusion: Sexual orientation discrimination always involves gender. It is sex discrimination.”

Feldblum declined to predict the outcome, but I will: Hively and the EEOC will win before the Seventh Circuit. But who will write the opinion, and what reasoning will it employ? That’s anyone’s guess.

# Willkie Announces Fall Bonuses, Blowing Off Cravath Followers

After Cravath decided to abdicate its role as Biglaw’s compensation Pied Piper and step away from the [Fall appreciation bonus scale set by Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/09/wow-davis-polk-raises-the-bar-on-bonuses/), every firm to issue a statement since has sheepishly refused to hand out bonuses. The most common statement from these firms amounted to “we’re totally killing it out there and revenues are as high as ever despite unprecedented economic headwinds and we can’t be prouder of the work you’re doing and, just maybe, we’ll reward you for it in March!”

As you might imagine, this is cratering morale at these firms.

From the perspective of the partners, they worry that headlines announcing big paydays for associates while the rest of the country struggles [would come across as insensitive](https://abovethelaw.com/2020/10/whats-the-real-reason-biglaw-firms-are-begging-off-fall-bonuses/). It makes superficial sense until you break it down to “out of sensitivity to the plight of Americans these days, we think that money is better suited in the hands of the millionaire partners than the deeply indebted middle class associates and staff.” That… looks less sensitive.

Willkie Farr considered all this and decided to become the first firm since Cravath’s announcement to follow Davis Polk’s lead and issue Fall bonuses. The Executive Committee informed associates minutes ago that they’d be seeing a little boost to their income in these trying times (and that email is available on the next page):

- Class of 2019: $7,500
- Class of 2018: $10,000
- Class of 2017: $20,000
- Class of 2016: $27,500
- Class of 2015: $32,500
- Class of 2014: $37,000
- Class of 2013: $40,000
And, of course, the firm stated that it intends to pay its regular annual bonuses as well. Associates have described themselves as “beyond elated.”

It appears as though the Bonus Wars are back on! Keep your eyes on what firms do in the coming days because the pressure is back on to keep up with the Bonus pack.

# At Which Firms Are Women Thriving? Findings From The ATL Law Firm Gender Diversity Index
## Findings and analysis from the ATL Law Firm Gender Diversity Index.

Law firms blow a lot of rhetorical hot air affirming their commitment to achieving gender diversity in the workplace. Yet, despite some isolated efforts to hire and retain more female attorneys and promote more women into partnership, little tangible progress has been made to improve the position of women in the profession. Prior to our publication of [The Law Firm Gender Diversity Index](https://abovethelaw.com/careers/law-firm-gender-diversity-index-2016/), information on diversity efforts had been largely anecdotal. The Index, created by [NavForward](https://navforward.com/#/home) in partnership with ATL — and sponsored by [Bloomberg Law](http://www.bna.com/bloomberglaw/) — is the first study to ever collect and analyze raw data on gender diversity in the legal market. The Index categorizes every lawyer in the largest 1,200 firms in the country and is the most comprehensive and accurate database of its kind available anywhere.

Today, we make available for free download [a white paper](http://info.abovethelaw.com/law-firm-gender-diversity-index) with findings from and analysis of the [NavForward](https://navforward.com/#/home) data. How do diversity statistics vary across markets and practice areas? What is the correlation between recruitment of female attorneys and their promotion? Which firms are demonstrating that it is possible for law firms to maintain a highly demanding work environment where women not only belong, but thrive? [Download the white paper here](http://info.abovethelaw.com/law-firm-gender-diversity-index).

# Partners, Associates, Staff Flee Biglaw Firm After Merger Efforts Crumble
## And the firm may be giving up an office as well.

Less than two weeks ago, Stroock’s merger talks with Nixon Peabody [fell apart](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/biglaw-merger-effort-crumbles/), and since that time, a steady stream of lawyers and legal professionals have headed for the exits.

Stroock — which had apparently been in merger talks with several firms — has now lost two partners and more than 20 litigation attorneys and staff to Steptoe & Johnson, a firm that was once considered a [potential merger partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/02/this-biglaw-firm-has-the-urge-to-merge-but-cant-find-a-willing-partner/).

But attorneys aren’t the only thing Stroock stands to lose to Steptoe. The [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/18/stroocks-losses-to-steptoe-amount-to-more-than-20-lawyers-and-staff/) has the details:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Sources with knowledge of both firms also said Steptoe … is in talks to take over the New York-based law firm’s Los Angeles office lease, in a scenario in which Stroock would shed its sole West Coast outpost. …

The more than 20 professionals leaving for Steptoe include Michele Jacobson, chair of the firm’s general litigation practice and co-chair of its reinsurance practice group, and Julia Strickland, managing partner of the firm’s Los Angeles office and head of the firm’s national financial services litigation, regulation and enforcement group.

Sources claim that the final number of lawyers and legal professionals leaving Stroock for Steptoe from the firm’s insurance and consumer finance litigation practices could reach up to 30 in total. But how big of a loss will this really represent for the firm?

Here are some additional insights from [Am Law](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/07/18/stroocks-losses-to-steptoe-amount-to-more-than-20-lawyers-and-staff/):

One source familiar with Stroock said Jacobson and Strickland were in groups that were “self-contained and not among the more profitable for the firm,” and their departures “will not have a significant impact,” The American Lawyer previously reported.

“Stroock’s core business is intact,” the source said.

Sources familiar with the moves also said Strickland and colleagues’ imminent exits, along with Stroock’s Los Angeles office, could be beneficial as it would allow the firm to shed personnel and overhead costs associated with that office.

# From Decision To Action: A Step-By-Step Blueprint For General Counsel Implementing An ESG Program
## Launching an ESG program necessitates commitment from the top.

You have committed to your annual strategic objectives, and one of them is to build an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) program. This is a great choice. More than 50% of general counsel list ESG as a top 5 risk for their company, and regulations are starting to shift ESG from voluntary to mandatory. But, where do you start?

ESG is a rapidly evolving area. We didn’t learn about this in law school, and there aren’t very many CLEs on the subject. Even if found, a course probably would not cover the practical steps to moving the ball forward on ESG in an organization.

Not to worry. I have you covered. This guide will walk you through the process of building an ESG program step-by-step.

Step 1: Build Executive Buy-In

Launching an ESG program necessitates commitment from the top. Build an ESG business case that identifies the benefits of acting now. These could include regulatory compliance, cost savings, competitive positioning, brand, and talent recruitment and retention. You can find more on building a business case in [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christineuri_esg-budget-hacks-activity-7089974818556497920-YyJu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

Step 2: Establish Governance

ESG is becoming a material risk for companies. Investors expect this risk to be managed appropriately. Train your board and executive team on ESG so that they will be equipped to make decisions and discuss ESG risks with stakeholders. Ensure that both your board and executive team have at least one person with substantial ESG knowledge and allocate leadership roles and responsibilities. Decide whether ESG risks will be overseen by the full board or a subcommittee and establish reporting routines to support this oversight.

Step 3: Start A Cross-Functional ESG Team (e.g., Taskforce, Committee)

ESG touches every part of a company. Therefore, it’s crucial to build a cross-functional team responsible for integrating ESG into your company’s operations. Include senior representatives from sustainability, finance, legal/compliance, risk, strategy, sales, operations, and human resources. Leverage this team to identify the ESG work that is already being done across the company, pinpoint ESG pain points in their departments, and highlight opportunities the company could capture by improving its ESG performance.

Step 4: Add Outside Strategic Expertise

ESG programs require a broad range of expertise. The types of expertise vary depending on geography, industry, size, and business model. You will likely need outside help to measure your carbon footprint. Other types of expertise you may need include regulatory compliance, supply chain, carbon reduction, and technology.

Step 5: Collect ESG Data

Transparent reporting on ESG is expected by regulators, investors, and clients. This requires data from across the organization. The most challenging and most important data to gather will be your carbon emissions, including direct emissions from your operations, indirect emissions from the use of energy at all your locations, and indirect emissions from your suppliers and products. Start the data collection process as early as possible.

Step 6: Take Action

ESG requires a lot of planning, meetings, policies, and reporting. With all of this, it can be easy to forget that the most important part of any ESG program is taking action to improve your performance on material issues. Choose no more than three actions and focus your efforts on those areas. Top focus areas to consider are carbon reduction, biodiversity, and DEI.

Step 7: Align On KPIs And Reporting

ESG has many reporting frameworks. You will need to select at least one. Start by determining whether the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is likely to apply to your company. Consider any reporting requests that you have received from investors and clients. Major frameworks include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), UN Global Compact, and the recently released IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

Step 8: Plan For Improvement

ESG is not a one-time project. It is a mindset that must be integrated into the company’s daily operations. As you are designing the program, ask yourself whether you are building ESG processes that can and will continue even if the individuals involved change, whether you will be able to collect data the same way next year, and whether your reporting will capture improvements year over year.

Implementing an ESG program is a strategic imperative amid shifting regulatory landscapes and increasing risk awareness. Executive commitment, robust governance, and cross-functional collaboration are all critical to success, as is taking tangible action in prioritized areas like carbon reduction. You have the tools you need to tackle this challenge. The most important thing is to start. Small steps over time lead to big results.

# The Biglaw Firms With The Best Compensation (2022)
## Money isn't all that matters in this brand new ranking.

What does it take to cultivate job satisfaction at a law firm? In a new report from BTI Consulting, associates pointed out exactly what they wanted from and valued in their work lives, and which firms were the best at committing to their overall happiness.

According to BTI, Biglaw associates are looking for these eight core activities from their firms when it comes to their overall professional happiness:

### [ Generative AI In Legal Work — What’s Fact And What’s Fiction? ](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit) 
Zach Warren from the Thomson Reuters Institute discusses the potential and the pitfalls.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1052766&action=edit)  
- Commitment to helping associates in their career
- Specific action to help develop a career path
- Access to training they need
- Good mentoring
- Optimism about growing within their firm
- High levels of job satisfaction
- Being well paid
- Having at least one partner watching out for them
After going evaluating 4,000 responses, BTI found that 147 Biglaw firms did the best job when it came to associate satisfaction. But which firms did the best in each category? Earlier this week, we covered the firms that were considered the best at [helping associates](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/the-biglaw-firms-that-are-best-for-associate-satisfaction-2022/) in their careers and those with partners who have associates’ backs, as well as the firms that have helped associates [build their careers](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/the-biglaw-firms-associates-rank-as-the-best-of-the-best-2022/) and provided access to the training they want and need.

Today, we’re going to take a look at the thing that makes the world go ’round: money. Biglaw associates certainly enjoy being paid handsomely — and we here at Above the Law have tracked [raises](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/biglaw-raise-tracker-2022/) and [bonuses](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/11/biglaw-bonus-tracker-2021/) for years — but there’s much more to compensation than just a dollar amount. Here’s what BTI evaluated:

Associates rely on a subjective formula to evaluate how well they are paid. This formula includes salary, bonus, competitive norms, hours of work expected, hybrid work policies, perceived control over working hours, treatment by partners, feedback, and the opportunity they see for themselves within the firm. Market rate salaries are minimum expectations.

That said, associates singled out 29 law firms that were able to offer a “winning comp combination,” but these eight firms were identified as the best of the best when it comes to all matters of compensation:

- Baker Donelson
- Choate
- Debevoise & Plimpton
- Faegre Drinker
- Fenwick & West
- Hunton Andrews Kurth
- Katten
- Milbank
Congratulations to each of these firms. When market money is just the baseline, providing associates with a better quality of life will get your firm a boost when it comes to overall “compensation.” Great work!

# Biglaw Firms Score With Historic Offer And Acceptance Rates For Summer Associate Recruitment
## Law students will be raking in money at these firms after they graduate. Congrats!

For the past few years, law student recruitment for summer associate programs has been incredibly successful, harkening back to a time when law students quickly accepted the offers that Biglaw firms handed out like candy. Amid an unprecedented cash rush for associates and high demand for legal services, the 2021 recruitment cycle was no different — offers were plentiful, and acceptance of those offers was even higher. Things are going smashingly well in the Biglaw sphere when it comes to recruitment.

According to the latest recruiting figures from the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), offer rates from Biglaw summer programs remained close to historic highs, with 97% of second-year law students receiving offers for full-time employment as associates after graduation. Acceptances of those offers reached an all-time, historic high of 89%. What’s even more exciting is that this historic acceptance rate is significantly higher than acceptance rates measured before the Great Recession, which tended to hover between 73 to 77 percent.

Here’s what James Leipold, NALP’s executive director, had to say:

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
“Law firms have been scrambling for talent at both the lateral and entry levels. As a result, recruiting activity in 2021 was robust, with offer rates for summer spots reaching their highest mark since 2007. … The pandemic has changed some of the methodologies of the law firm recruitment process, but it has not dampened any of the competition. The OCI screening interview process is likely to remain virtual, or at least partially so, and 2L recruiting is likely to continue to happen early and fast. For 1Ls, recruiting is also likely to be robust, particularly for diversity fellowships, and with a little luck, the renewed energy around 3L recruiting will remain for some time.”

But don’t get too excited, because Leipold cautions that this isn’t likely to last forever. “Tempering that fairly rosy picture is the inevitable boom and bust cycle of law firm profitability,” he said. “This hot talent market will inevitably cool, one way or another.”

Here are some interesting facts about the summer programs of 2021:

- What with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 60% of law firms held a hybrid summer program with a mix of both in-person and virtual programming, while 28% held an entirely virtual program. Just 12% of firms held an entirely in-person program.
- The average summer program class size in 2021 was 12, up from 11 in 2020. Let’s not forget that the average summer program class size was 13 in 2019, and it had previously been flat at 14 from 2016 to 2018. (Compare this to the history of summer programs at the biggest of Biglaw firms (700+ lawyers), where summer class sizes have continuously fallen since 2016 (from 22 in 2016 to 20 in 2017 and so on).)
- For 1Ls who worked as summer associates, offer rates for a second summer at their firms were also history, at an all-time high of 93%, with an acceptance rate of 72%. According to firms, more than half (55%) of 1L summers were diversity fellows.

Congratulations to all law students who went through the entry-level recruitment cycle in 2021, as things seem to have worked out marvelously for them, no matter how much the pandemic may have tried to interfere. Let’s be thankful that a new generation of associates wasn’t lost thanks to COVID.

# Top 50 Biglaw Firm Cracking Down On In-Office Attendance
## Bonuses are on the line if attorneys don't come to the office more often.

The aftereffects of the Covid pandemic can still be seen in Biglaw. Gone is the necessity of in-office attendance in order to bill, bill, bill. But firms would still like its attorneys to be in the office some of the time — firm leaders have repeated said they see a benefit in associate development when folks are in the office. However, striking that the balance of in-office and work-from-home time continues to be a challenge.

Arnold & Porter, a firm ranked #49 on the most recent AmLaw list, is definitely feeling those growing pains. The firm has settled on a 50% in-office policy, but actually getting attorneys to stick to that policy has been a real issue. According to insiders at the firm, leadership did a spot check to assess compliance with the policy, and found ~40% of attorneys (partners, counsel, attorneys, senior attorneys, associates, and senior associates) are in the office less than 25% of the time.

So now they’re pulling out the big guns to get those butts in the office. Today the firm rolled out their plan to keep attorneys on the straight and narrow. And they’re going to drop hammer if folks don’t comply. Tipsters say the firm will “email each attorney a monthly report tracking their individual in-office attendance, with noncompliance leading to check-ins, warnings from practice group leaders / firm leadership, and potentially impacted bonus awards, holds on bi-weekly paychecks, and/or an increased in-office requirement for noncompliant attorneys, with exceptions for vacations, trial, or leave.”

A&P [isn’t the first firm](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/another-major-law-firm-goes-full-big-brother-to-enforce-office-attendance-policy/) to get serious about coming into the office, but such punitive measures are far from the industry standard. Above the Law will continue to monitor how in-office policies are being handled in the Biglaw trenches.

# Biglaw Firm Announces One-Time Only Bonuses For Counsel And Senior Attorneys
## A Biglaw firm actually remembers its counsel in this year of big bonuses.

As Above the Law [has written](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/counsel-bonuses/) many times in the past, compensation for Biglaw counsel is a bit of a crapshoot. At some firms, counsel watch senior associates blow by them in total compensation. While other firms reward special counsel with the top bonus tier, or provide some kind of off-grid individualized bonus commensurate with experience level. And many more are left out of the big bonus game entirely.

The newly merged Troutman Pepper decided not to leave its senior folks hanging. The firm[ previously announced](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/04/troutman-pepper-special-bonuses-raises/?rf=1) special bonuses (and raises) for associates. Their most recent announcement focuses on the compensation of senior attorneys and counsel.

Because 2021 is so unusual — at least as far as attorney compensation goes — Troutman Pepper decided to announce one-time only bonuses for senior attorneys and counsel. But those numbers are based on what the firm collects:

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  


And yes, bonuses are always nice, but that doesn’t mean folks are happy, as a tipster says:

They are again choosing to not adjust counsel salaries, instead adopting a one-time “special” bonus structure that maxes out at $4k less (and is paid two months later) than what a seventh year associate will receive for billing 1950 hours (including 100 pro Bono hours) with no collection requirement.

It should be noted that in the firm’s memo ([available in full on the next page](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/08/troutman-counsel-bonuses/2/)), the bonus amounts are characterized as a “minimum” number. The firm also anticipates a “significant majority” of counsel and senior attorneys will qualify for them and “many” will receive higher amounts based on both the dollars collected and other, discretionary criteria.

# Put Me In, Coach

The NCAA national basketball championship is right around the corner, and another crop of student athletes will get a chance to make a name for themselves on the big stage. I’m here to talk about a different member of the team, however: the coach.

How Coaches Matter

Conventional wisdom has long held that effective coaching can have a major impact on a team’s win-loss records. For once, conventional wisdom and rigorous analysis are in agreement. For example, a pair of University of Chicago professors recently published [a paper applying statistical analytics to detect the effect that coaches have in varying major sports](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Do-Coaches-Matter.pdf). It’s a fun read for the casual fan, and their conclusions are intriguing.

Across the board, it appears that good coaches have a definitive impact on how their teams play and win. What’s most thought-provoking, though, is that the types of impact a coach has vary depending on the sport in question.

The college basketball coaches, for example, tend to have a bigger impact on the total amount of points scored in a game (by both teams) than they do on the difference in points between the teams. Coaches that emphasize fast-breaks and quick possessions tend to both score more and weaken their own defenses, while coaches that teach a slower style depress scoring on both sides of the court. Baseball coaches, by contrast, had most of their impact in one specific phase of the game: defense. Coaching was found to explain 28 percent of the variation between teams on how much they allowed the other side to score, a monstrous difference. Football coaches have an entirely different area of greatest impact: fumble and penalty prevention. Unlike in baseball, where coaches make their mark by making discrete, strategic, in-game decisions, NFL coaches can make big gains by instilling a culture of discipline into their teams, reducing dropped balls and lost yards on penalties.

Keeping The Talent Happy

Sports is fun and all, but I think research like this matters, even in a column focused on law firm management. Like sports, law is very much a talent game. No matter what practice you’re in, there is likely a huge pool of competition out there with your same basic skill set. The clients you develop and the firm you join are based on how well you develop your own talent. The best attorneys have the best shot of making the big impacts and bringing home the big checks. The difference between a good attorney and a great one can be the difference between a client making billions or going bankrupt. In the criminal world, it can be the difference between prison and freedom, life or death.

Talent matters in law, and talent needs to be managed. Professional sports teams manage their talent through intense one-on-one coaching by a large team of full-time coaching professionals dedicated to helping their players and their team win. Law firms tend to manage their talent with mostly full-time practioners with no formal leadership or management training.

Can you guess which one of these approaches is more successful?

Putting Thought Into Action

In law firms, “management” is not emphasized. Part of the reason is intuitive. Most lawyers didn’t go to law school to be managers. They went to law school to learn how to practice law. As a result, across the industry, it’s rare to find lawyers who are passionate about management or who are willing to educate themselves about the topic.

Another reason law firms lack significant robust management structure is that lawyers are notoriously unwilling to accept direction or coaching. It’s been [well documented](http://www.managingpartnerforum.org/tasks/sites/mpf/assets/image/MPF%20-%20WEBSITE%20-%20ARTICLE%20-%20Herding%20Cats%20-%20Richards1.pdf) that, as a group, lawyers are off-the-charts on autonomy and skepticism in their personality profiles. The combination of healthy egos and the fact that partners are the “owners” of the business can make law firm leadership seem impossible.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But it’s not just personality, it’s also money. Part of the reason management is de-emphasized in law firms is compensation related. The primary driver of a typical law firm partner’s compensation is their productivity: how much business have they generated, how much have they collected as working attorneys, what is their profit margin, etc. In most firms, a partner’s performance as a practice group leader is rarely a major factor in determining their pay.

Firms get what they pay for, however, and what happens is a manager’s title largely becomes honorary. Rather than focusing on developing the talent and putting new plays together, practice groups function largely as a loose affiliation of lawyers that occasionally lunch together and go through an agenda that was prepared a few hours before the meeting.

This isn’t a failing of practice group managers — it’s a failure of senior management in creating structures and incentives to promote the development of the team as a whole.

So what are law firms to do?

Let’s Get Professional

Recognizing all of the challenges above, many law firms have tried something novel: they have started to take a cue from sports teams and good businesses by taking the full-time practioners largely out of the management equation.

I’ve [long argued](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/ceo-without-law-degree) that law firms would be better run if professional managers, some of whom may not have JDs, play a larger role in running law firms. Although this could come in the form of a COO or a CEO, it can also take the form in more of the day-to-day management of law firms at the practice group level.

Increasingly, law firms are enlisting the help of non-lawyer professionals who can help practice group leaders do their job more effectively. The role of these practice group leaders is monitor performance of group members, identify cross-referral opportunities, create substantive agendas for meetings — essentially, everything a practice group leader should be doing but probably isn’t because they are focused on their practice. Realizing the need for professional management in law firms, many universities and law schools are now even [offering degrees](https://cps.gwu.edu/law-firm-management-master-professional-studies) to non-JDs in law firm management.

Another step firms need to take is to adopt a flexible management structure. Perhaps out of an innate desire to standardize and fit everything into a neat little box, many law firms decide on a management structure and apply it across the board to all practice groups, without considering whether that management structure is actually the best one for the job. Just like you may want a baseball coach focused on defense, where they can make the most difference, you may want different leadership styles and structures at different places in your firm. It may be that a firm’s large litigation department benefits from a strong hand with unilateral authority to steer the ship, while their small IP group thrives best with decision-making by committee. Applying the same management model to all groups is convenient from an administrative perspective, but potentially disastrous in terms of actual outcomes and talent utilization.

Coaching Consciously

Biglaw managers, here’s your homework: go figure out if, and how, you’re coaching your talent to succeed. Then ask whether you chose that coaching system, or fell into it by default. I suspect the answers for many of us will be dispiriting at first, but learning our weaknesses is the first step to correcting them.

Making the conscious choice to invest in your people is always going to be the right call.

# Twitter v. Musk: Will The Spat About Spam Be Settled In Court?
## Neither of the parties has acknowledged an industry standard for determining the number of spam accounts. What could possibly go wrong?

As many predicted, Elon Musk backed out of his attempt to acquire Twitter after a public spat about fake and spam bots in its userbase. In response, Twitter sued Musk, demanding specific performance to force Musk to purchase Twitter for $44 billion. Why are fake accounts such an issue for Musk? And what is this lawsuit going to accomplish?

For some, this turn of events is strange considering that when all of this began, Twitter’s board of directors and many of their notable users did not want Musk to purchase the company. The board implemented a poison pill which would have made it extremely costly for Musk to purchase a majority share. Several prominent users deleted their Twitter accounts in response and others threatened to do the same if the purchase was completed.

Twitter, in its quarterly SEC filings claims that less than 5% of its users are spam or fake accounts. But this calculation is not based on any industry standard, if one exists. The calculation is done through their own internal audits using automated and manual reviews. It acknowledges that independent audits from third parties and using competitors’ methods could result in a different (and possibly higher) percentage.

Musk’s reason for terminating the purchase was due to Twitter’s failure to provide information — to his satisfaction — on fake and spam accounts. He wanted to verify Twitter’s claim that less than 5% of its users were fake. He also claimed that several key employees were fired without his permission, which was in violation of the merger agreement.

In its complaint, Twitter stated that it provided all of the information that Musk requested, even allowing him to have access to the “firehose,” which is a live feed of tweets, likes, and retweets. Twitter also argues that Musk cannot terminate the agreement because he has violated the merger agreement by making disparaging tweets about the company during negotiations. These tweets and Musk’s change of heart has lowered Twitter’s stock value and hurt its reputation.

Fake and spam accounts can be problematic. They inflate the number of users, which might upset advertisers who want to reach a certain number of monetizable active daily users. Similarly, these accounts could make certain people appear more popular and influential than they actually are by inflating their follower count. Worst of all, fake accounts can be used to spread lies and harass other users. These accounts can send automated tweets promoting Viagra or the latest Ponzicoin. If these accounts go unchecked, users might switch to another platform like TikTok, Twitch, or Truth Social. Advertisers will take their money elsewhere.

On the other hand, spam and fake accounts can be used for good. Some people use alter ego accounts to disclose sensitive and confidential information in the public interest. Automated accounts can also be useful for announcing stock prices and sales, for those who want such information.

As this lawsuit proceeds, Musk and his legal team will again demand the information he wanted during the discovery process. Since both sides disagree about the level of cooperation, the judge is likely to pay close attention to the reasonableness and specificity of Musk’s demands and whether Twitter is willing to provide the information requested.

Assuming Twitter provides Musk with the information he requested regarding fake and spam accounts, Musk will likely use his own methodology and metrics to determine whether Twitter’s 5% claim is correct. If Musk’s findings show a higher number of fake accounts, will the court accept his conclusion and allow him to walk away from the deal? Keep in mind that neither of the parties has acknowledged an industry standard for determining the number of spam accounts. There may be an issue as to what a fake or spam account is.

Also, the lawsuit may provide information on why Musk really wants to buy Twitter. Or whether he wanted to buy it at all. There is [talk](https://fortune.com/2022/07/09/how-elon-musk-bizarre-twitter-takeover-saga-could-have-just-been-a-cover-for-him-to-sell-8-billion-in-tesla-stock/) that this offer was a ploy by Musk to sell his Tesla stock at its peak without spooking investors and possibly lowering the value of outstanding Tesla stock. Or did he just want to reinstate the accounts of former president Donald Trump and the Babylon Bee?

This lawsuit raises some interesting questions. But it seems like as the case progresses, it seems less likely that we will get answers. Instead, there will be more negative press about both Musk and Twitter. So it might be in everyone’s best interest to settle this lawsuit sooner than later.

# Morning Docket: 10.04.17
## * Two-time presidential candidate and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton will travel to Wales next weekend to receive an honorary doctorate degree from Swansea University, but that's not the only honor she'll receive while there. Swansea's law school is being renamed, and will soon be known as the Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law. Congratulations! [[Wales Online](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/hillary-clinton-visiting-swansea-next-13689302)] * Special counsel Robert Mueller has added an appellate lawyer from the Justice Department's criminal division to his team. Per a spokesperson, Scott Meisler, who had not been previously identified as being involved, joined the effort in mid-June. Meisler is a 2005 graduate of the Georgetown University Law Center. [[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer/justice-department-appeals-lawyer-on-mueller-russia-probe-idUSKCN1C82PY)] * Winston & Strawn may have more than 900 lawyers, but according to the firm's managing partner, that's still not good enough. You can soon expect the firm's corporate transactions practice in New York to expand, its D.C. office to grow in size, and its West Coast presence to double or triple. [[Big Law Business](https://biglawbusiness.com/reflecting-industry-law-firm-wants-to-be-bigger/)] * According to Altman Weil’s MergerLine, law firm mergers are now on pace to break a 2015 record. Thus far in 2017, 76 tie-ups have been announced, which may lead the industry to surpass its previous high of 91 mergers. The number of law firm combinations could even exceed 100 this year. Exciting times...

The legal profession, ever-fluid and dynamic, offers both promise and challenges. For young attorneys on the cusp of their careers, understanding the nuances of top law firms can pave the way for a future marked by growth and success.

“In the constantly shifting landscape of law, being well-informed and strategic in your early career choices isn’t just beneficial; it’s imperative,” mentioned [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) Director, [Anna Szymczak](https://laterallink.com/team/anna-szymczak/).

Paul Hastings firmly holds the top position with an enviable average score of 4.996. Their prowess shines distinctly in areas such as “Interesting Work” and “Partner-summer associate interaction,” both recording a perfect 5.000. Equally commendable is their emphasis on an accurate “Firm Self-portrayal,” with an outstanding score of 5.000.

“Selecting the right firm involves more than just considering its reputation. It’s about balancing one’s goals with the firm’s ethos, the quality of mentorship, and the type of work offered,” said [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) Principal, [Susan Agopian](https://laterallink.com/team/susan-agopian/).

Boasting an international footprint, Clifford Chance has shown remarkable ascent. Their commitment to “Real Work” and “Training and Guidance” is evident, with both categories hitting a perfect 5.000. This combination of global reach and attention to attorney growth underscores their dedication.

“Starting out in the legal field isn’t merely about joining a prestigious name. It’s about finding a place that promotes growth, provides hands-on experience, and cultivates a solid legal foundation,” observed [Romina Filippou](https://laterallink.com/team/romina-filippou/), Senior Director at [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/).

Duane Morris, not far behind, boasts an overall score of 4.977. Their focus on providing “Real Work” and ensuring robust “Associate-summer associate interaction” is evident, with both sectors securing a 5.000. This indicates an environment where budding attorneys don’t just work but actively engage and form meaningful connections.

In the competitive legal realm, these scores are more than just numbers. They serve as guiding lights for those navigating their career choices. Firms like Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer and Cahill Gordon & Reindel have also demonstrated excellence in “Training and Guidance” and “Communication of Goals and Expectations,” respectively.

“Early career decisions can set the trajectory for an attorney’s future. Aligning with seasoned recruiters who truly understand the legal world can be the difference between a good and a great start,” articulated [Kelly Rizo](https://laterallink.com/team/kelly-rizzo/), [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) Senior Director in our Texas office.

As the legal world continues to evolve, so do the opportunities and challenges that come with it. “The choices made today influence the career paths of tomorrow. Rely on insights, mentorship, and the wisdom of those who have tread similar paths to make those choices wisely,” advised [Lateral Link](https://laterallink.com/) Senior Director, [Tori Keith](https://laterallink.com/team/tori-keith/).

# The Defenestration Of Affirmative Action By SCOTUS Was Swift. What’s Next For The Legal Profession?
## Opponents of race-conscious admission policies have found their long-lost political bedfellows in the judicially active conservative majority of SCOTUS.

“Did you think we’d be fine? / Still got scars on my back from your knives / So don’t think it’s in the past / These kinds of wounds, they last and they last / Now, did you think it all through? / All these things will catch up to you / And time can heal, but this won’t / So if you’re coming my way, just don’t.” — [Taylor Swift](https://genius.com/23827524)

Last month, in the words of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, SCOTUS rolled “back decades of precedent and momentous progress” and “cemented a superficial rule of [colorblindness](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/affirmative-action-in-law-the-four-letter-phrase/) as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society.”

SCOTUSblog Columnist Amy Howe succinctly [recounts this latest historic ruling](https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-affirmative-action-programs-in-college-admissions/) in the context of past decisions. As Howe highlights:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Thursday’s ruling was the latest in a series of challenges to the role of race in university admissions. In both the North Carolina and Harvard cases, the plaintiffs had asked the justices to overrule Grutter. In her opinion for the majority in that case, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor reaffirmed that “student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions,” but she warned that race-conscious admissions policies should not last forever. In 25 years, she suggested, “the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest” in diversity. …

In a 40-page opinion that addressed both the Harvard and UNC cases, [Chief Justice] Roberts began with a review of the Supreme Court’s past decisions interpreting the equal protection clause. Those decisions, he concluded, reflect the clause’s “core purpose”: “doing away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race.” He emphasized that the Supreme Court had only allowed universities to use race-based admissions programs “within the confines of narrow restrictions.” But the Harvard and UNC programs, “however well intentioned and implemented in good faith,” Roberts explained, do not comply with those restrictions.

Opponents of race-conscious admission policies have found their long-lost [political bedfellows](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/29/us/affirmative-action-supreme-court) in the judicially active conservative majority of SCOTUS. In the words of Roosevelt Institute Program Manager Shahrzad Shams, “[affirmative action](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/2023/06/29/the-end-of-affirmative-action/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw5f2lBhCkARIsAHeTvli2FvOVH4w7pZos02dVZA0jvnmrqPLkTHaPo_EW6MSfIHVDq_03oSAaAn5WEALw_wcB) has become the latest victim of the Supreme Court’s agenda to roll back major civil rights gains.”

Needless to say, bad facts and [hard cases make bad law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_cases_make_bad_law#:~:text=Hard%20cases%20make%20bad%20law%20is%20an%20adage%20or%20legal,range%20of%20less%20extreme%20cases.). Harvard certainly didn’t do itself any favors by allegedly ranking Asian American applicants lower than others on traits like “positive personality,” likability, courage, kindness, and being “widely respected.” Or by discovering though a 2013 internal investigation, but not publicly acknowledging, its bias against Asian American applicants in its admission policies, as highlighted by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html).

In fact, Justice Clarence Thomas prefaced his decision to speak up in support of the ruling, saying “race-based discrimination against Asian American students compels me.” I won’t dig into the irony of his statement or opine on other substantive issues behind this historic ruling today, but longtime readers may be familiar with my past affirmative action coverage from 2015-2019 in the articles below:

After all, people of color in the legal profession have increased [by less than 1%](https://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/minorities-in-the-legal-profession-have-increased-by-less-than-one-percent-since-2000/) since 2000.

In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
The stakes are high for the legal profession, which remains significantly less diverse than the U.S. population. ABA data shows that 19% of the country’s lawyers are people of color, compared with 40% of the overall population. By contrast, 36% of physicians are minorities, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, and 30% of dentists are minorities, according to the American Dental Association.

And Bloomberg Law Reporter Tatyana Monnay [notes](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/affirmative-actions-demise-threatens-big-law-diversity-pipeline):

Some law firm leaders said the court’s decision won’t affect their diversity, equity, and inclusion priorities. Other observers worry that a groundswell of diversity initiatives in the wake of the 2020 police-killing of George Floyd, and the reckoning that followed, won’t last. The court’s decision “is now going to put on display how committed you actually are to diversity,” said Lauren Jackson, assistant dean of career services at Howard University’s law school.

Meanwhile DEI offices and programs in higher education are under assault in  [Texas](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/new-texas-bans-law-diversity-offices-state-higher-education), [Florida](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1176210007/florida-ron-desantis-dei-ban-diversity), and [30 other states](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/anti-dei-legislation-tracker/#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%20more%20than%2030%20bills%20across%20the%20country,most%20recently%2C%20one%20in%20Texas.).

So where does the legal profession go from here? Earlier this month, Lateral Link’s Gloria Sandrino, Christina Ahn, and Amy Langan provided a roadmap for how someone can redouble their efforts when it comes to fostering diversity in the legal profession. In their article, [Promoting Diversity In Law: A Strategic Guide For Navigating The Post-Affirmative Action Legal Landscape](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/07/promoting-diversity-in-law-a-strategic-guide-for-navigating-the-post-affirmative-action-legal-landscape/), they describe and recommend:

- Deepening partnerships with law schools and alumni associations
- The power of personal interaction and mentorship programs
- Tailored mentorship: fostering success for diverse students
- Collaborative partnerships: supporting racially diverse attorneys
- Curating initiatives for diversity in law firm partnerships
- The importance of intentionality in diversity efforts
The Diversity Movement (TDM) CEO Donald Thompson echoes this sentiment in his [WRAL op-ed](https://wraltechwire.com/2023/07/12/diversity-equity-inclusion-after-supreme-court-decision-where-does-private-sector-stand/): “The fear is real, but the response can’t be to cower. Instead, we need to double-down on DEI programming, not just because it’s the correct thing to do morally or ethically, but because it is what customers, employees, shareholders and stakeholders want.”

If you are looking for a good place to recommit to your DEI voyage, I highly recommend you explore the [TDM Library](https://thediversitymovement.com/library/) free trial. This is a great resource for ideas and strategies to improve diversity in your law firm’s talent acquisition, recruiting, and workplace processes (Disclosure: I’m a board advisor for TDM).

Lastly, please let us know if your law firm or law school has instituted specific initiatives or targeted programs to increase diversity among its ranks in response to this historic SCOTUS decision. We’d love to learn more from our readers about how the legal industry is reacting to this latest ruling.

The wealthiest law firm out there [joined the special bonus march](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/kirkland-special-bonus-2021/) back in, well, March. But it turns out the firm wasn’t quite done rewarding its associates for the work they do to keep cash gushing through the door like the blood tide from the Shining.

The firm just announced that associates can go ahead and expense 10 non-work meals up to $100 each. The firm isn’t picky about just picking up associate tabs — attorneys are allowed to expense meals with anyone they want.

So, like, if you have still managed to have friends after spending time in biglaw, you can treat them to dinner.

Well, yes, you would need to still have friends. But maybe this can be the incentive to reach out and reconnect with some people. It’s $1000 of free food, folks. That’s a fantastic gesture.

When [Davis Polk offered associates gift packages](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-tells-associates-thank-you-with-extra-special-gifts/) in addition to special bonuses, [we discussed](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/thinking-like-a-lawyer/2021/03/who-wins-the-jingle-war-cellino-or-barnes/) how important it is to give associates gifts they have to use for their own enjoyment. The grind can be dehumanizing and big bonuses are great and essential but the temptation to dump that all into loan repayment is real. And even if that’s the best life decision, it still leaves you on the back end feeling a little hollow as you go right back to working without feeling like you got anything tangible out of it. So give an extra grand or so in goods and services that associates need to experience. A nice meal, a vacation, an exercise machine… whatever.

15 years of “How Appealing” — reader mail: Today’s email is from reader Paul Vinegrad:

I love everything about your blog. Convenient daily access to quality legal news is invaluable. Your blog consistently links to articles, cases and commentary that open my mind to a wide variety of important and timely legal issues.

I dislike when you go on a (well-earned) hiatus to work on appellate cases, attend a conference, or go to a Phillies game. Your Twitter feed sometimes fills the gaps. But I prefer your blog.

P.S. I am a long-time Mets fan. So, missing your blog because you are watching the Phillies (hopefully lose, at least to the Mets) is particularly frustrating.

Congratulations! Not many blogs have survived 15 years!

Thanks so very much, Paul. One of my best friends is a Mets fan, so you are in good company. I will post another reader email tomorrow.

# What Do Millennial Lawyers Actually Think?

[](http://bit.ly/2sJ0rne)Given that millennial workers currently make up the largest portion of the U.S. workforce, their distinctive working style has naturally contributed to a shift in workplace priorities that is still taking shape. However, understanding this cohort’s unique perspective is arguably necessary in order to ensure that your firm stays at the forefront of the changing landscape and is able to adapt accordingly to the positive qualities that make millennial generation workers valuable to law firms.

In partnership with our friends at [Major Lindsey & Africa](http://bit.ly/2ptVOJW), we wanted to delve into the dynamics of this apparent cultural shift within law firms. Starting today, we are running a series of quick surveys intended to capture the viewpoint of younger lawyers and help determine what differentiates them from both their (non-attorney) generational peers and their older colleagues.

Today’s [survey ](http://bit.ly/2sJ0rne)(part of a series of three) concerns the “[“Priorities” ](http://bit.ly/2sJ0rne)of millennials within the workplace, with this year’s iteration diving deeper into business development experiences. Please take a couple of minutes and [tell us what you think](http://bit.ly/2sJ0rne). (Please note we are not exclusively interested in hearing from millennials; lawyers of all ages are encouraged to take [the survey](http://bit.ly/2sJ0rne).)

### [ How Will Walgreens’ Expansion Into Specialty Pharmacy Affect The Industry? ](https://medcitynews.com/2024/04/walgreens-specialty-pharmacy-drugs/)
Walgreens announced that it is expanding its specialty pharmacy offerings. Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# How Biglaw Should Be Responding To The Black Lives Matter Protests
## The work for racial justice never ends.

Folks who are on the frontlines of diversity and inclusion issues are doing a lot of work right now. Amid the nationwide racial reckoning going on right now, folks who’ve made a career trying to make our workplaces more diverse are still doing that work and dealing with their own trauma at the same time.

In this episode of the Jabot, I talk with Lia Dorsey, newly elected President of the Association of Law Firm Diversity Professionals and Director of Diversity and Inclusion at Dentons, about Biglaw’s response to the violent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery and the Black Lives Matter movement.

The Jabot podcast is an offshoot of the Above the Law brand focused on the challenges women, people of color, LGBTQIA, and other diverse populations face in the legal industry. Our name comes from none other than the Notorious Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the jabot (decorative collar) she wears when delivering dissents from the bench. It’s a reminder that even when we aren’t winning, we’re still a powerful force to be reckoned with.

# Biglaw Chair Slams The Traditional Law Firm Model
## He calls Biglaw hierarchical, parochial, colonial and unequal.

Traditional international firms hire lawyers in the old colonial power to “capture” work where the colonial powers took advantage of the people and resources of the country. They cling to the outdated notion that it is still effective for a law firm to treat its own talent in a hierarchical, parochial, colonial and unequal way.

They believe one location should tell others what to do (hierarchical); they assume that high quality lawyers can only be found in the North and the West (parochial); they presume that lawyers in the North and the West should, by rights of history and tradition, take the lead in serving clients in other regions (colonial); and they operate on the principle that only a handful of offices should do high value work while others are treated as branch offices (unequal).

— Joe Andrew, global chairman of Dentons, teeing off [in The Lawyer](https://www.thelawyer.com/dentons-chief-the-old-law-firm-model-is-simply-colonial/) on the traditional Biglaw model. He goes on to contrast that model with Dentons, calling attention to Dentons going with African firms to create a pan-African law firm owned and controlled by Africans.

# More Law Firms Should Offer Teambuilding Bonuses
## Law firms can benefit from people getting rewarded for building morale around an office.

Different law firms have varying bonus policies for their attorneys and staff. Some firms offer lockstep bonuses based on the years of experience each attorney has, and other firms offer discretionary bonuses based on the level of work that attorney produced in a given year. Still other firms base bonuses on the number of billable hours an associate billed over a period of time. However, more law firms should consider offering bonuses based on factors other than direct productivity or profitability for a firm.

I was recently talking to a contact who works in the financial sector. This person said that during the annual review process, the employer asked all employees to nominate people to receive a bonus based on how much that person fostered team spirit and morale around the office. Indeed, I think the company may have even set aside a certain amount of the bonus pool to such discretionary bonuses. This bonus generally went to people who arranged social events for people outside of the office or for folks who had organized events for people’s birthdays. This type of bonus was really interesting to me since I had never heard of it when I worked at other firms before starting my own practice.

Law firms can benefit from people getting rewarded for building morale around an office. As many of us know from firsthand experience, law firm work can be quite the grind. Legal work comes with tons of conflict, stress, and tension as people need to fight for the rights of their clients to the exclusion of benefits that might go to other parties.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
In addition, law firm office life is usually not the best. Associates typically need to fight for work opportunities, billable hours, and assignments in order to advance in their careers. Very few associates end up making partner, and in order to obtain this credential, people usually need to put in long hours and compete against their peers for extended periods. Moreover, law firm offices usually have the same level of monotony as any other workplace, and now that law firms are forcing people to return to offices, lawyers need to experience this discomfort like they did before the pandemic.

Teambuilding bonuses might help ameliorate the grind that exists at many offices. The ability to earn bonuses would at least partly be taken out of the hands of the partners and returned to associates. Of course, this is not entirety a popularity contest, since associates would need to describe the efforts of an associate to build team morale and why another attorney deserved a bonus. However, such bonuses could positively impact the environment of an office.

When I worked as an associate attorney at various law firms, it was difficult to arrange associate social events and focus on team morale. I had all of my assignments to complete, and this took up all of the brain space I might have used to plan events and focus on teambuilding. Moreover, since bonuses are usually based on billable hours, people are incentivized to spend any free time churning out billables more than anything else. However, if people had the ability to earn bonus money for something other than logging more hours, it would incentivize people to focus more on teambuilding.

Moreover, offering teambuilding bonuses is just the right thing to do in order to reward those people who contribute to a law firm in nontraditional ways. For instance, I worked at a law firm that had a seasoned associate who worked there for ages who we called “the Godfather.” Whenever we had a question about New York procedure or substantive law, we would usually ask this associate the query since he had a wealth of knowledge about our area of the law. Sometimes, this person would basically hold court and just teach associates about various legal concepts that were helpful to all of us.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
This associate was not paid particularly well, and I am sure that all of the time that this person spent on tutelage detracted from the amount of time that he had to bill hours. But the efforts of this associate helped develop many of the newer associates and added to the fabric of the firm. A teambuilding bonus would have not only rewarded someone like this person but would have made it more likely that this person stayed with the firm since he knew that he was getting recognized for his efforts.

Of course, law firms have limited bonus pools, and it is sometimes difficult for law firms to change how they compensate people. Nevertheless, more law firms should consider teambuilding bonuses to help build the fabric of a law firm and reward those people who go out of their way to positively impact morale at a shop.

The only thing worse than being tied to your [BlackBerry](https://abovethelaw.com/blackberry-crackberry/) at all hours is missing something important because you were not tied to your BlackBerry the hour you were needed.

Wait, this just in. There is something worse than missing a crucial request because you weren’t checking your BlackBerry. That would be when the partner you are working for emails all of the firm’s associates reminding them to compulsively check their BlackBerries because of your mistake.

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
Welcome to the world of a [Quinn Emanuel](https://abovethelaw.com/quinn_emanuel/) associate. The associate apparently didn’t send a fax because he hadn’t been checking emails after business hours. QE partner [Bill Urquhart](http://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/urquhart-a-william.aspx) decided to use the incident as a teaching moment for the entire firm….


Here is Urquhart’s message:

From: A William Urquhart.
To: Attorneys.
Time: 9:21 a.m.
Re: CHECK YOU EMAILS OFTEN [sic]

Now more than ever there are many talented lawyers and law firms competing for our business. Doing really good legal work is not enough. Clients expect that and well they should given what we charge for our services You must all realize that we are in a service business. In this day and age of faxes, emails, internet, etc. clients expect you to be accessible 24\7. Of course, that is something of an exaggeration — but not much.

LESSON NUMBER ONE: You should check your emails early and often. That not only means when you are in the office, it also means after you leave the office as well. Unless you have very good reason not to (for example when you are asleep, in court or in a tunnel), you should be checking your emails every hour. One of the last things you should do before you retire for the night is to check your email. That is why we give you blackberries. I can assure you that all of our clients expect you to be checking your emails often. I am not asking you to do something we do not do ourselves. I can assure you that John Quinn, Peter Calamari, Mike Carlinsky, Faith Gay, Fred Lorig, etc. all check their emails often.

Yesterday I was working with a relatively new associate on a project which both he and I knew was a rush. It was for a relatively new client whom we were trying to impress. The associate did a nice job under pressure. Before I left the office at about 7:30 I sent an email to this associate asking him to perform a task — fax a draft letter for review and comment. I assumed the task was done. Turns out the associate left the office and did not check his emails until this morning. I assumed the task had been completed. It had not been. In this case it was no harm no foul, but I think we can all imagine scenarios when this could be a disaster.

CORRECTION: The original version of this post had a line in the blockquote that was not in the Urquhart email. (It was actually commentary on the email from a source.) That line has been removed. I apologize for posting an incorrect version of the email.

Urquhart’s message is harsh. But is it fair?

Biglaw associates, the next time a family member or spouse asks you why you have to check your BlackBerry all the time, even for the fleeting hours that you are not at work, feel free to send them Urquhart’s email. The next time some law student starts talking about work-life balance and you want to strangle him, send him Urquhart’s email instead.

But don’t forget that this email works to your benefit as well. The next time some happy hippie types call you overpaid and undeserving of your high salary, send them Urquhart’s email and ask them if they have any conception of what working hard even means. The next time some person claims that you have an entitlement complex, send them Urquhart’s email. And the next time you’re in Vegas, laughing at “the poors” waiting to get a seat at the five dollar blackjack table, send yourself Urquhart’s email.

Because, in a way, Bill Urquhart’s email summarizes everything you really need to know about the life of a Biglaw associate. Partners expect you to be on call. In exchange, you get paid a lot of money.

# Vault 100 Rankings: The Most Prestigious Law Firms In America (2019)
## Money continues to matter most for Biglaw associates.

What do associates at major law firms care about more than money? Prestige, of course. But, at the end of the day, sometimes being a leader when it comes to compensation is enough to boost a firm’s prestige. As luck would have it, the closely watched Vault 100 rankings are here to remind lawyers at the nation’s largest law firms during this summer’s salary wars about exactly which ones are considered the most prestigious.

In last year’s Vault 100 rankings, Cravath — the firm that recently rocked Milbank’s new $190K associate salary scale with over-the-top monetary compensation for senior associates — retained its number 1 slot after elbowing Wachtell Lipton out of the position it had held for 13 years in 2016. Was Cravath able to keep its cachet as the most prestigious Biglaw firm in the country in the latest Vault rankings?

Of course it was. Here’s what Matt Moody, Vault’s senior law editor, had to say about Cravath’s placement in the latest rankings: “With a steadily increasing lead over the past three years, Cravath has established itself as the nation’s top law firm. Cravath is the market leader in compensation, with associates across the industry measuring their pay against ‘the Cravath Scale,’ and the firm has been integral in shaping the legal industry for centuries, so it is unsurprising that associates view it as the best.” Sorry, Wachtell, but Cravath is now .322 points more prestigious than your firm.

Although Cravath and Wachtell kept their first- and second-place spots in the latest edition of the Vault rankings, there was some movement in the middle of the Top 10. Without any further ado, here are the Top 10 Most Prestigious Law Firms based on Vault’s Annual Associate Survey for 2019:

- [Cravath, Swaine & Moore](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/cravath,-swaine-moore-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/wachtell-lipton-rosen-katz/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/skadden,-arps,-slate,-meagher-flom-llp-and-affiliates/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Sullivan & Cromwell](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/sullivan-cromwell-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Latham & Watkins](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/latham-watkins-llp/company-overview.aspx) (+2)
- [Davis Polk & Wardwell](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/davis-polk-wardwell/company-overview.aspx) (-1)
- [Simpson Thacher & Bartlett](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/simpson-thacher-bartlett-llp/company-overview.aspx) (-1)
- [Kirkland & Ellis](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/kirkland-ellis-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/gibson-dunn-crutcher-llp/company-overview.aspx) (no change)
- [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison](http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/law/paul,-weiss,-rifkind,-wharton-garrison-llp/company-overview.aspx) (+1)
There were two noteworthy moves within the Top 10. This is the first time Latham has reached the Top 5 in Vault history, a sign of the firm’s kung-fu grip on prestige — though funnily enough, the firm still hasn’t announced any news as far as its salary scale is concerned. Paul Weiss is new to the Top 10 this year, kicking Weil Gotshal down to No. 11. It’s also worth mentioning that Milbank slipped down two spots to No. 40 in this year’s ranking, but we imagine that the firm may see an increase in its rank next year due to the fact that the firm was the first to kick off this round of raises.

As for notable moves outside the Top 10, Wiley Rein made its way back into the Top 100 for the first time since 2013, while Kasowitz Benson dropped out of the Top 100 entirely (and we’re all but certain that the firm’s association with the Trump administration had absolutely nothing to do with that).

# The Garden Renovation: A Personal Tale Of Optimizing Legal Team Operations
## The journey of optimizing legal operations with AI, much like renovating a garden, is an ongoing process of growth, learning, and adaptation.

Several summers ago, I decided to rejuvenate my long-neglected garden. As I surveyed the overgrown weeds and unkempt flower beds, I realized that this was more than just gardening; it was a project in optimization, much like the challenge of integrating AI into our legal team operations.

Assessing The Legal Landscape: Weeding Out Inefficiencies

Just like I surveyed my neglected garden, our legal team embarked on a journey of self-reflection. We dug deep into our existing processes, identifying the legal weeds that hindered our growth. It was time to clear the clutter and make room for something beautiful — the integration of AI.

Envisioning The Legal Oasis: Aesthetic And Efficient Operations

Just as I had a vision for my garden — a perfect blend of aesthetics and functionality — we envisioned a legal operation where routine tasks were as seamless as a well-tended flower bed. AI became the secret ingredient to make this vision a reality, allowing our legal team to focus on more strategic and fulfilling work.

Identifying Priorities: Tending To The Legal Roses

In the garden, I identified areas that needed immediate attention — the overgrown rose bushes. Similarly, we pinpointed critical legal processes that would benefit most from AI integration. Like a master gardener focusing on the most delicate blooms, we aimed to optimize the core of our legal operations.

Optimizing Legal Operations: AI As The Master Gardener

Document Review and Management

Pruning was essential for my garden’s health. Similarly, we pruned our document review process with AI tools, automating sorting and analysis to save time and increase accuracy — much like giving our legal operations a trim for improved health.

Contract Analysis and Management

The tedious task of contract management was like weeding the garden — necessary but time-consuming. AI became our diligent gardener, automating contract analysis, tracking, and compliance. Now, our legal garden was well-maintained and thriving.

Legal Research

Good research in gardening leads to better plant care. Likewise, AI optimized our legal research, swiftly sifting through databases for relevant case laws and precedents. It was like having a well-informed horticulturist guiding our legal decisions.

Challenges And Solutions: Reshaping The Legal Landscape

Resisting the Urge to Overhaul Everything

Just as I resisted the urge to redo the entire garden at once, we approached AI integration in phases. Starting with the most critical areas ensured a smoother transformation without overwhelming the legal landscape.

Training and Adaptation

Introducing new gardening techniques required learning and adaptation. Similarly, our legal team needed training to effectively adapt to new AI tools. It was about cultivating a mindset ready for growth.

Continuous Evaluation

Gardening is an ongoing process. Similarly, we continuously evaluated the impact of AI tools on our operations, ensuring our legal garden was always evolving, adapting, and blooming.

Collaborating For Custom AI Solutions: Cultivating Bespoke Legal Tools

Inspired by my collaboration with a landscape architect, we partnered with AI developers to create custom solutions tailored to our specific legal processes. It was like having a team of expert gardeners crafting unique strategies for our legal garden.

Lessons Learned and the Path Forward: Blooming into the Future

Start Small and Scale

In gardening, starting with a small patch can lead to significant transformations. We applied this principle by starting AI integration in small, manageable areas before scaling up. It’s about nurturing growth gradually.

The Importance of Maintenance

Just as a garden requires ongoing care, AI tools need regular updates and maintenance. Our legal garden, like a well-pruned hedge, remained effective and secure.

Flexibility and Adaptability

Gardening taught me to be flexible and adapt to changing conditions. Similarly, our approach to AI integration was flexible, adapting to new technologies and changing legal landscapes.

A Flourishing Legal Operation — Our Legal Oasis

Today, my garden is a source of joy and relaxation, a testament to careful planning, patience, and continuous care. Similarly, our legal team operations have been transformed by the thoughtful integration of AI. We’ve seen significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and client service.

The journey of optimizing our legal operations with AI, much like renovating a garden, is an ongoing process of growth, learning, and adaptation. It requires a balance of innovation and practicality, a willingness to embrace new tools while staying grounded in the fundamentals of legal practice.

This experience has reinforced my belief that the key to success in a garden or a legal team lies in thoughtful planning, embracing change, and a commitment to continuous improvement. As we move forward, the lessons from my garden continue to inspire our approach, guiding us towards a more efficient, agile, and future-ready legal practice.

So, fellow legal gardeners, may your legal oasis bloom with success and innovation!

[As expected](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/07/no-stranger-to-paying-support-after-screwing-around-elon-musk-faces-twitter-lawsuit-over-failed-deal/), Twitter has sued Elon Musk, [filing a complaint](https://abovethelaw.com/uploads/2022/07/Twitter-Musk-Suit.pdf) drafted by Wachtell and Wilson Sonsini litigators. But as Twitter delivers over 60 pages of thoroughly brutal allegations painting Musk’s business acumen as only slightly removed from handing a seal three beach balls and several billion dollars, my primary takeaway from the complaint was: joy.

Real, genuine, Biglaw joy.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Elite law firms aren’t known for giddy feelings, but the whole deal reads as lawyer fun from start to finish. From Simpson Thacher and Wilson Sonsini [negotiating a deal](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/twitters-musk-deal-steered-by-wilson-sonsini-simpson-thacher) tailor-made for this moment, getting every concession along the way. To counseling Twitter through the deal as Musk managed to live up to every one of the attorneys’ rock-bottom expectations. To the moment Wachtell got to come in and take the deal shepherded by two other firms and turn it into an absolute scorcher of a complaint. Everyone deserves credit and the closing dinner on this one may actually cost a billion dollars and be entirely worth it.

I could never roast Elon as hard as Wachtell roasts Elon in their brief.[https://t.co/24YC0Ne76X](https://t.co/24YC0Ne76X)

Indeed. This is the first tweet of a thread livetweeting her reading of the complaint which is worth a look.

But the lawyerly action starts at paragraph 32:

The following day, on Sunday, April 24, 2022, Musk tried again to force Twitter’s hand. He delivered a letter to the board repeating that his $54.20 per share offer was “best and final,” threatening once more to sell all of his shares if his bid were rejected, and saying he would propose a “seller friendly” merger agreement to be signed before the market opened the next day. Musk’s counsel sent over a draft agreement, reiterated that Musk’s offer was not contingent on any due diligence, and underscored that the form of the proposed agreement was “intended to make this easy on all to get to a deal asap.”

Twitter and its counsel harbored real fears that Musk might bypass the company and take the deal directly to shareholders, so it wasn’t all fun and games in April. And that’s when Musk told them that he wanted a “seller friendly” agreement that wasn’t contingent on due diligence.

Let’s get some footage of the Twitter legal team upon hearing that:



Every good negotiation begins with taking all your leverage off the table!

But it didn’t end there, because Twitter’s transactional lawyers then got a chance to negotiate like kids in a candy store with grandma:

The agreement was negotiated through the night and, in the process, became even more seller-friendly. Among the provisions not contained in Musk’s proposal but included at Twitter’s insistence were an undertaking by defendants, including Musk, to “take or cause to be taken . . . all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable” to obtain the financing (already committed) to consummate the transaction, Ex. 1 § 6.10(a); a clear disclaimer of any financing condition to closing, id. § 6.10(f); and a right on Twitter’s part to request and promptly receive updates from Musk about his progress in obtaining financing, id. § 6.10(d). These provisions ensured that financing would be no obstacle to closing and that the company would have the right to stay informed of Musk’s progress in arranging his financing.

Working through the night must have never felt so good.

The day after the parties announced the merger agreement, I predicted Tesla investors would flee in droves and blow up a huge chunk of Musk’s wealth because they would, justifiably, fear tying their money to someone who would enter a deal like this. And that was before I knew he’d ASKED for it to be seller friendly.

Twitter lawyers must have had the same thought about the risks this announcement posed to Musk’s finances because they asked for AND GOT this qualification too:

Twitter further negotiated to narrow the circumstances under which -13- defendants could escape the deal by claiming a “Company Material Adverse Effect.” In addition to excluding, for example, market-wide and industry-wide effects and circumstances and declines in stock price and financial performance, the final definition excluded matters relating to or resulting from Musk’s identity or communications, “performance” of the agreement, and any matter disclosed by Twitter in its SEC filings other than the “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” sections of those disclosures. Id. Art. I.

A master class in covering client ass. Which is of course a transactional attorney’s job.

It’s not like Musk didn’t have representation. Musk was represented in this deal by Skadden, prompting someone to ask me how Skadden could’ve let something like this happen. I dunno, but…



What’s Skadden supposed to do? As long as everything is legal and the firm provides Musk with complete information about what’s going on, Skadden kind of has to roll with it. I refuse to believe Skadden wanted to waive every possible protection to create an absolute disaster of a deal for Musk, but based on the narrative of the complaint, he seems to have kept telling them to go ahead.

Twitter also negotiated the right to demand specific performance, which seems particularly relevant right now:

OK, here we are!

Very first thing, confirming that indeed, Twitter is asking that the Court force Musk to buy Twitter at the contract price.

Again, this case is *NOT* about a $1 billion termination fee.
1/ [https://t.co/SIW53JZNkE](https://t.co/SIW53JZNkE) [pic.twitter.com/YbKw6TmUmt](https://t.co/YbKw6TmUmt)

— Raffi Melkonian (@RMFifthCircuit) [July 12, 2022](https://twitter.com/RMFifthCircuit/status/1546965752913268746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

It’s hard to imagine it will come to that, because specific performance is such a drastic form of relief and one expects that someone will prevail upon Musk to settle before that happens. But Twitter obviously owes it to its shareholders to demand the full $40-some-odd billion rather than settling for the $1B alternative relief — though given Musk’s antics, it’s probably in the best interests of the shareholders to take less and keep Musk’s hands away from the rudder.

After celebrating a slam dunk agreement, Twitter lawyers had to weather the road to closing. Musk had waived due diligence so nothing could really derail this deal “absent a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material covenant breach by Twitter.” As the complaint notes, “Musk had to try to conjure one of those.”

He began slow with [disparaging posts about Twitter](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/04/elon-musk-already-breached-the-twitter-takeover-agreement-with-his-stellar-record-of-following-the-rules/), giving Twitter an excuse to kill the deal. With billions and billions on the line, Twitter refused the bait.

So then he goes after the existence of bots. Twitter has made consistent, qualified representations that bots make up fewer than 5 percent of its users. Despite waiving diligence and having made the existence of bots one of the reasons for his decision to buy the company, Musk suddenly demanded to know more about bots and threatened the deal if bots amounted to more than 5 percent (which… unless they amounted to something crazy like 50 percent there’s little chance it would be material, but this is the smell of desperation here).

So Twitter gave him a detailed report on how it calculates bots on May 13 (sample of roughly 9,000 accounts). Musk immediately goes on Twitter and says Twitter samples 100 accounts?!?! Then he tweets about Twitter complaining that he seemingly lied about the methodology. And then on June 30…

Indeed, in a June 30 conversation with [Twitter CFO Ned] Segal, Musk acknowledged he had not read the detailed summary of Twitter’s sampling process provided back in May.

Holy hell. What is even going on here? He’s tweeting allegedly wild misrepresentations about the methodology before reading it? This is the moment firms started preparing their pitches for the litigation business.

Musk’s whole defense seems to be that Twitter didn’t give him information when the allegations suggest he waived his rights to most information, they provided him with tons of information gratuitously (including a raw feed of all of Twitter amounting to 49 tebibytes which I didn’t even know was a real number until now), and then this galaxy brain admits to Twitter that he’s not even looking at it.

Musk’s got Skadden already and is [bringing on Quinn Emanuel](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/07/twitter-gets-ready-to-sue-elon-musk-hires-elite-merger-law-firm/) for this case. I’m thinking, for them, this set of facts does not spark joy.

And Musk’s continued tweeting definitely doesn’t. You know there was an internet hoax claiming that Twitter had banned Musk after the deal went sour. Why? He’s just pumping out more and more damning evidence for Twitter’s claim that he’s only trying to hurt the company and exit the deal. Let him keep talking!

In the early morning of July 11 (Eastern time), Musk posted Tweets implying that his data requests were never intended to make progress toward consummating the merger, but rather were part of a plan to force litigation in which Twitter’s information would be publicly disclosed:



We talked about that one on the left earlier in the week, noting that Professor Hasen had [already pegged that one for an exhibit number](https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1546346105662648320). So it’s safe to say that the lawyerly joy of watching every prediction in this case come to pass immediately has spread to law professors too.

I continue to be flummoxed by Musk’s theory that he’ll ever see this data in court. How is it relevant? He waived diligence and Twitter claims that its public SEC filings reflect its testing methodology. The only relevant evidence would seem to be “what’s your methodology and does it consistently turn up a fewer than 5 percent figure?” He agreed to buy the company based on that representation so the only discovery he should get would be limited to those reps… which is probably all in the report he’s never read anyway.

There’s a long way to go and Musk will have a chance to explain all of this, though with most of the worst allegations backed by publicly available tweets, it’s hard to see how.

But right now, let’s just appreciate the moment. This is one of those rare cases where everyone (on Twitter’s side anyway) from the birth of the deal to the courthouse steps has seen the fruits of their labor immediately pay off. For a job that’s usually messy and built off compromise and caveats, that’s fun to witness.

# Small-Firm Lawyer Tells Biglaw Team To 'Eat Bowl Of Dicks' During Settlement Negotiations
## Don't try this 'confidential negotiating tactic' in practice, folks.

Generally, when opposing counsel tells you to “eat a bowl of dicks,” you know that your settlement talks are going nowhere fast. When opposing counsel later informs you that he’s going to “let the long dick of the law f*ck [your client],” then you know that something may be amiss. When opposing counsel then begins to refer to you as a “cumstain” and a “limp dick mother f*cker,” you may realize that your settlement talks have gone completely off the rails. When opposing counsel threatens to “water board each one of [your client’s] trolls who show up for depo without any mercy whatsoever,” and claims that he “know[s] where you live,” you know it’s time to file ex parte with a judge to get some much-needed relief.

This is what happened in a recent dispute between [Christopher Hook](http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Licensee/Detail/255080), a plaintiffs’ lawyer in California, and a legal team at Sheppard Mullin led by partner [Peter Klee](https://www.sheppardmullin.com/pklee). The matter itself is a simple insurance dispute over about $200,000, but Hook’s conduct has turned it into a complete circus sideshow. Sheppard Mullin represents Allstate and Hook represents a couple trying to fight the company for an ever-increasing amount of funds, into the millions.

In a [declaration](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.758790/gov.uscourts.cacd.758790.22.0.pdf) supporting Allstate’s [ex parte application](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.758790/gov.uscourts.cacd.758790.21.0.pdf) for relief, Klee says Hook “bombarded” him and his colleagues with “over 100 emails.” Here’s a taste of what went down between Hook and the lawyers at Sheppard Mullin:

That’s a special brand of legalese that you don’t get to see every day — and it’s not even the best part. In response to Sheppard Mullin’s ex parte application, Hook filed a response claiming that this was a “confidential negotiating tactic,” and he realizes that his language may have “crossed the line.” Check it out (emphasis added):

No further action has been taken by the judge in this case yet, but we can’t imagine that Hook — who has no prior disciplinary actions against him — will be able to make his way out of this incredibly messy episode unscathed.

UPDATE: It seems Judge Otis D. Wright issued the following order in this case:

# Wachtell's Co-Chairs Step Down After 17 Years, Ushering In New Leaders
## They led the firm through good times and bad, and still came out ahead of the game.

After a 17-year run as the heads of the firm, [Edward Herlihy](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/edherlihy/) and [Daniel Neff](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/daneff/) will step down from their roles as Wachtell Lipton’s co-chairs. According to the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/11/07/wachtell-appoints-new-leadership-naming-nussbaum-and-savitt-as-co-chairs/), Herlihy and Neff will remain on the firm’s executive committee.

During their time serving as the top Biglaw firm’s leaders, Herlihy and Neff responsibly guided the approximately 280-lawyer firm through a great deal of financial growth — not to mention a pandemic. As noted by [Law.com](https://www.law.com/law-firm-profile/?id=318&name=Wachtell,-Lipton,-Rosen-%26-Katz), when the pair first assumed their leadership roles in 2006, the firm’s revenue was $443 million. In 2021, the firm’s revenue was just over $1 billion, with 2022 revenue tracking close behind.

Herlihy and Neff will be passing the reins to [Andrew Nussbaum](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/ajnussbaum/), a corporate partner, and [William Savitt](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/wsavitt/), co-chair of the firm’s litigation department. Savitt will retain his litigation co-chair title with his ascension to co-chair of the firm. The pair offered a brief joint statement to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/still-wachtell-elite-new-york-deals-firm-refreshes-leadership), saying that the firm “is in a position of great strength as we take on the responsibility of leadership,” and that they’re “honored to have been asked to serve the partnership and will do our best to sustain its success.”

# ALERT: Milbank Announces $215K Salary Scale To Kick Off The New Year!!!
## Another round of salary increases may be in the offing.

After a series of compensation hikes and special bonuses, some started to argue that associate salaries had settled for the foreseeable future. Even with revenues hitting all-time highs, some analysts felt that firms had exhausted their appetite for adding permanent expenses and would shift to waging the battle for talent through special bonuses and one-off signing perks, as opposed to further rise in annual salaries.

Milbank, the firm that’s done the most to push the market toward long-term salary increases having raised the bar in 2021 and of course kicked things off in 2016 and again in 2018, has done it again.

Earlier this morning, the firm announced that it would be boosting the salary scale across the board with $10K raises for the four most junior classes and $20K raises for the mid-levels and seniors. Here’s the new scale:

Class	Old Salary	New Salary
Class of 2021	$205K	$215K
Class of 2020	$215K	$225K
Class of 2019	$240K	$250K
Class of 2018	$275K	$285K
Class of 2017	$305K	$325K
Class of 2016	$330K	$350K
Class of 2015	$350K	$370K
Class of 2014+	$365K	$385K
This applies to all associates in the US, London, Asia, and São Paulo offices and will be retroactive to January 1.

Congratulations to Milbank associates and… probably a lot of associates at other firms soon too.

Remember everyone, we depend on your tips to stay on top of important bonus updates, so when your firm matches, please text us (646-820-8477) or [email us](mailto:tips@abovethelaw.com?subject=%5BFirm%20Name%5D%20Matches) (subject line: “[Firm Name] Matches”). Please include the memo if available. You can take a photo of the memo and send it via text or email if you don’t want to forward the original PDF or Word file.

And if you’d like to sign up for ATL’s Bonus Alerts (which is the alert list we also use for salary announcements), please scroll down and enter your email address in the box below this post. If you previously signed up for the bonus alerts, you don’t need to do anything. You’ll receive an email notification within minutes of each bonus announcement that we publish.

# Can Data And Analytics Help Close The Biglaw Gender Gap?

When ATL launched the [Law Firm Gender Diversity Index](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/04/the-atl-law-firm-gender-diversity-index-2016/) last year, probably the most discouraging finding from the data is that hiring more women attorneys is insufficient to close the gender gap in law firms. Firms’ increased hiring of women simply is not translating to more women in partnership or in leadership roles.

We are publishing a [new report](https://info.abovethelaw.com/gender-diversity-index-update), taking a deeper look into the Index’s data and attempting to identify actions that firms can take to address and begin alleviating the gender disparities that continue to permeate the law firm landscape.

Law firms can take cues from their corporate counterparts when trying to determine how to begin tackling these serious issues. While initiatives like the [Mansfield Rule](https://abovethelaw.com/tag/mansfield-rule/) and corporate incentive programs are a step in the right direction, a continuing hindrance in adequately addressing the gender gap has been the lack of meaningful data. Only data can give us an accurate measure of where the shortfalls lie and which areas need the most improvement.

While we hope the Index will begin filling those holes, the rapidly emerging and increasingly powerful field of legal analytics holds promise that we will identify not just how many women are being hired and promoted, but whether or not those women are being given the same meaningful roles and experiences that their male counterparts receive. Data and analytics will go a long way toward finally making real progress in closing the gender gap.

If you haven’t yet heard about [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.pro/), a natural language processing artificial intelligence tool that was released at the end of November 2022, now’s the time to learn about it. All signs indicate that this cutting-edge technology and other tools like it will have a significant impact on the practice of law.

ChatGPT has the potential to disrupt the way that work gets done across industries, with an impact on print and online publishing, internet search, education, the creation of business and legal documents, and much more.

What Is ChatGPT?

At its most basic, ChatGPT is a chatbot. But it’s also much more than that and represents the next phase of information gathering and distribution.

On the [ChatGPT website](https://chatgpt.pro/), it is described as “a large language model developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) that can be used for natural language processing tasks such as text generation and language translation [….] One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to generate human-like text responses to prompts. This makes it useful for a wide range of applications, such as creating chatbots for customer service, generating responses to questions in online forums, or even creating personalized content for social media posts.”

Right now, it is available for free. However, there has been such a demand for it that the servers are often overloaded, and it can be difficult to access. However, in the very near future, ChatGPTPro may be available for a fee, making a more stable version of it readily accessible.

Why Does ChatGPT Matter?

ChatGPT matters because it represents the next stage of what’s possible using AI technologies. This chatbot is so sophisticated and fast that it can produce complex, useful responses to a vast variety of inquiries.

Notably, its output isn’t always accurate, as I discuss more fully below. However, it is accurate enough that Google has identified it [as “code red” with the potential to upend Google search](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/chatgpt-caused-code-red-at-google-report-says/), and a team was assembled to address the threat. Similarly, Microsoft is in talks to [invest $10 billion into ChatGPT and is already planning to leverage its technology](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/technology/microsoft-says-it-will-roll-out-chatgpt-on-its-own-ai-service-after-reports-it-will-invest-10-billion-into-openai/ar-AA16r9cv) to roll out the service into its own platforms.

But Will It Really Impact Lawyers?

Yes. The current version already provides significant value to lawyers, and that value will only increase exponentially when improved versions are released. As legal technology companies begin to incorporate ChatGPT into their platforms, much like Microsoft plans to do, it will offer immeasurable benefits and time-saving potential for legal professionals.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
How Will Lawyers Use It?

I tested ChatGPT in a variety of contexts and was incredibly impressed.

Initially, I submitted a query asking it to draft a blog post about the impact of the metaverse on the practice of law, which was my focus in [my last Above the Law column](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/12/why-should-lawyers-care-about-the-metaverse/). I submitted the request three different times, and the response varied each time. I shared the results [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nikiblack_chatbot-chatgpt-ai-activity-7006632157641072640-njLi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). All things considered, the chatbot did a bang-up job and even included a few points I hadn’t considered.

I also asked it to draft documents often used in law offices, and the results were provided in mere seconds. In this[ LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nikiblack_chatgpt-legaltech-ai-activity-7007040455687217153-cMsB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) I shared the draft documents created by the chatbot, which included:

- A demand letter in a personal injury case
- A discovery demand in a criminal case
- A demand letter in a contracts case
- A technology job NDA
- An employment agreement for a vice president.
As you’ll see in the post, the results were a great start. Certainly, the document provided was, at most, a very rough draft that would require many edits. But for a new solo practitioner, this tool offers lots of potential.

But Are The Results Reliable?

I asked the ChatGPT to “write a LinkedIn post about how I was quoted in an article about how lawyers can use ChatGPT and whether it will replace lawyers.” I then created [a LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nikiblack_chatgpt-is-impressive-but-can-and-should-activity-7011343724060266496-8uwy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) using the chatbot’s output.

There’s no doubt that it provided a decent working draft. However, there were a few problems, not the least of which is that it provided a purported “quote” on my behalf, but it was one that the chatbot simply pulled out of thin air. Another notable issue was it spelled “judgment” with an “e” in the middle (i.e., “judgement”), which is not the norm in the legal profession.

This draft LinkedIn post is a great example of why ChatGPT is not yet an adequate substitute for lawyers — or social media consultants. It gets some things right, but it also completely fails in other respects.

For now, it’s a great start, but that’s all it is. No matter what you’re using ChatGPT for, whether for personal or professional reasons,  you’ll need to have a full understanding of the topic at hand and thoroughly review, edit, and supplement the draft language it provides you.

ChatGPT and tools like it are the future, and this technology is improving incredibly quickly. But for now, they’re not ready for prime time — at least, not quite yet.

Experts think that this move could yield several strategic benefits, given the higher profit margins associated with specialty medications compared to traditional drugs. They also think Walgreens’ move could lead to greater competition, consolidation, and innovation within the broader pharmacy industry.

# Fried Frank's Chair Steps Down After 10 Years, Ushering In New Leaders
## He led the firm through good times and bad, and still came out ahead of the game.

After a 10-year run as the head of the firm, [David Greenwald](https://www.friedfrank.com/professionals/david-greenwald) will soon step down from his role as Fried Frank’s chair. Greenwald started his career at the firm, and though he took a break to work at Goldman Sachs for a time, he eventually returned to the place where it all began and will enter retirement in early 2024.

During his time serving as Fried Frank’s leader, Greenwald responsibly guided the approximately 700-lawyer firm through a great deal of financial growth — not to mention a pandemic. As noted by the [American Lawyer](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2023/10/02/fried-franks-greenwald-to-step-down-as-firm-plans-new-leadership-in-2024/), when Greenwald first assumed his leadership role in 2013, the firm’s revenue was just under $500 million. In fiscal 2023, the firm’s revenue is now just under $1 billion.

Greenwald will be passing the reins to asset management partner [Kenneth Rosh](https://www.friedfrank.com/professionals/kenneth-rosh), who currently leads the firm’s private equity funds group while serving as a member of the firm’s governance committee. He will assume his new duties as chair in March 2024, when the firm’s new fiscal year begins. M&A and private equity partner [Steven Epstein](https://www.friedfrank.com/professionals/steven-epstein), co-leader of the firm’s M&A practice, will serve alongside Rosh as managing partner, while litigation partner [Scott Luftglass](https://www.friedfrank.com/professionals/scott-luftglass), co-leader of the firm’s securities and shareholder litigation practice, will serve as vice chair.

# Landlord Refuses To Rent To Lawyers, Which Doesn't Sound Shady At All
## There are so many legitimate reasons to keep lawyers out!

Every year or so we hear about another lawyer or law student encountering a curious bit of professional discrimination. When seeking out a new apartment, the landlord will hand over a boilerplate lease with a buried provision right next to “no pets” where the tenant commits to not being a lawyer.

At least that’s the usual, sneaky way that it gets worked in. Sometimes, like in this email a tipster sent us today, the landlord comes right out and says it:

As I said, this company is not unique, but perusing the company website, I came up with this:



That’s the most painfully Boston thing I’ve seen since Marky Mark ate a lobstah roll riding on Wally the Green Monster’s back.

Attorneys are not a protected class and landlords can and do discriminate based on people’s jobs all the time. Usually they’re doing it because they don’t think the tenant can make rent with their current occupation, rather than locking out the prototypical professional.

From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
But why are landlords refusing to rent to legally skilled tenants? Let’s brainstorm some possible reasons!

- Neighbors complain about sight of walking shell of human being.
- Fear that next big bonus might lead tenant to abandon lease for bigger apartment as opposed to servicing $250K debt.
- Constant bing of handheld device registering increasingly insistent partner emails throughout the night.
- Never know when an ERISA lawyer is going to lose it and start screaming in the courtyard about vesting and backloading.
- Tenants coming home at 4:30 a.m. are a real drag for the late night keggers everyone else in the complex likes to throw.
- The recycling hub isn’t built for this much yellow legal pad paper.
- Cascade of gentle sobbing throughout the weekend too much for other tenants.
- Sometimes the rest of the building just wants to discuss Suits in peace without someone pointing out that it makes no goddamned sense.
- The week after the first adverse possession lecture is always a nightmare.
- You can’t get the full deposit back after painting a mural of The Creation of Adam with a naked Antonin Scalia touching the hand of God.
Or, as the tipster put it:

No doubt the reason must be because they don’t want to hear constant arguing over originalism vs natural law, and not at all because a law student/lawyer would be able to notice illegal things they’re up to.

Yeah, it’s probably all the originalism and not serious concern that a tenant with a basic grasp of building codes will eat into a profit margin inflated by putting off required upgrades. Definitely the originalism.

[](https://amzn.to/2suzgfs)In September 2009, as part of the ABA Journal’s “Legal Rebels” nationwide tour, I had the pleasure of [interviewing Steven Brill](http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/david_lat_interviews_steve_brill), founder of the American Lawyer magazine and Court TV. We covered a wide range of topics — Yale Law School, the First Amendment, copyright law — but they all revolved around our shared labor and love, legal journalism.

Earlier this month, I connected with Brill again, but this time about a much bigger subject: the half-century breakdown of the American economy and democracy. It’s the subject of his newest book, [Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America’s Fifty-Year Fall — and Those Fighting to Reverse It](https://amzn.to/2suzgfs). I predict that Tailspin, an ambitious, insightful, and provocative work, will soon hit the bestseller list (just like [America’s Bitter Pill](https://amzn.to/2xsKo2c), Brill’s 2015 book about the problems with our health care system).

When I visited Brill last week in his offices in Midtown Manhattan, he was extremely busy — in full book-promotion mode, a few days before his [appearance on Meet the Press](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-may-27-2018-n877866) (among many other shows). But he graciously took the time to field my questions. Here’s a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of our conversation.

### [ Navigating Financial Success by Avoiding Common Pitfalls and Maximizing Firm Performance ](https://abovethelaw.com/?sponsored_content=navigating-financial-success-by-avoiding-common-pitfalls-and-maximizing-firm-performance)
In this CLE-eligible webinar, we’ll explore the most common accounting pitfalls and how to avoid them for your firm.
From Pilot and Above The Law  
DL: Tailspin is in many ways a story about lawyers and the legal profession. Many of the heroes and villains in the book are lawyers and judges. How would you describe the role of lawyers, judges, and the legal profession in the fifty-year fall that you chronicle?

SB: If you look at the rise of the “knowledge economy” that’s central to my thesis, you’ll see that the leaders of it, other than software engineers, are lawyers and bankers. Stock buybacks, proxy fights, tender offers — a whole series of legal and financial engineering moves have changed the nature of the American economy. These moves have put knowledge workers on top, and they’ve been able to pull up the ladder on everyone else.

Lawyers are everywhere in this story. Lawyers are spearheading the corporate takeover fights, moving assets around as opposed to creating them. Lawyers are going to court, inventing fabulous new interpretations of the First Amendment or due process to benefit corporations. Lawyers are lobbying, sending a zillion lobbyists to the regulatory agencies and to Congress.

DL: And you’re unsparing of yourself in terms of your own role in creating the status quo, discussing how the American Lawyer magazine and its Am Law 100 rankings have contributed to Biglaw’s obsession with profits per partner over public interest. Do you regret launching either the American Lawyer or the Am Law 100?

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
SB: No, not at all. You have to balance the good and the bad — and I don’t think it’s a close call. In a free-market economy, people will want market information. The American Lawyer and the Am Law 200 provide market information, allowing recruits and clients to tell these law firms apart.

The problem with good information is that people can use it in the wrong way. I’m not blaming the victims here; it’s just a fact of democracy. But I don’t shrink from the notion that the American Lawyer and the Am Law 100 have caused a lot of harm.

DL: In any event, the Am Law 100 rankings are here to stay. We can’t put the genie back in the bottle or stick the forbidden fruit back on the tree. And to its credit, the American Lawyer has made some efforts to combat the deleterious effects — such as launching the [A-List rankings](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/07/the-2017-a-list-arrives-to-salve-that-itch-you-had-for-another-law-firm-ranking-this-week/), which take into account factors like pro bono work, diversity, and association satisfaction, as well as financial performance. What else can be done to address the fallout?

SB: It’s disappointing to me that leaders of the bar haven’t emerged to advocate a more responsible bar, one that strikes a balance between individual achievement as well as the common good. Why would someone graduate from our alma mater and then go to a law firm so they can help write legal briefs that keep injured consumers out of court?

I listened to two speakers at this year’s [Yale Law School graduation](https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/yale-law-school-2018-commencement-power-law-photos-video-speeches), [YLS professor] Stephen Carter and [California Supreme Court Justice] Goodwin Liu. Both gave very good talks, focused on the role of lawyers today in advancing the public interest. They were serious about public service, and so were the graduates —– but many of them will end up writing briefs for big banks.

ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
DL: In your discussion of proxy fights and LBOs, you describe the well-known Skadden Arps versus Wachtell Lipton rivalry — and you seem to give Marty Lipton the moral high ground, in terms of his criticism of corporate raiders and their focus on short-term results. As a Wachtell alum myself, I can’t say I disagree — but how would you respond to the critics who claim that Lipton’s worldview is self-serving, given that Wachtell often defends companies and existing management?

SB: [The [late Skadden name partner](https://abovethelaw.com/2011/02/skadden-name-partner-joe-flom-r-i-p/)] Joe [Flom] is not here to argue the other side, but I understand the argument. Yes, many companies are badly run — and if activist investors wants to improve shareholder value, who is Marty Lipton to say they can’t do that?

But there’s no question that the result of short-term thinking has been very bad for the country. For example, take executive compensation and corporate acquisitions. A lot of CEOs do acquisitions just so they can be CEOs of bigger companies — which, when the compensation consultants come around, means bigger compensation for the CEO.

DL: You express optimism about the pushback against short-term thinking in corporate America. But at the same time, hedge fund magnates who make money by pressuring companies to “increase shareholder value” seem to be doing better than ever. Do you really think that a more stakeholder-oriented view can and will take hold?

SB: Yes, I do. This is one area where you can see the possibility of both incremental and not-so-incremental reforms. For example, imagine weighted votes for how long a shareholder has held their shares, or a change to capital-gains taxation that would favor holding stocks for longer periods of time.

I talk in the book about Facebook — which, recent controversies aside, has been a very good investment. The company’s dual-class share structure has given Mark Zuckerberg the ability to focus on the long term, without fear of being taken over by another company after going public.

DL: You express skepticism towards the doctrine of commercial free speech — but at the same time, you have spent much of your career in the for-profit media sector. Do you see any tension between these two views?

SB: No, I don’t. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court just veered out of its way to give First Amendment protection to corporations of any kind. That was wrong.

The case involved a media company that wanted to make a documentary about Hillary Clinton. Who is the FEC [Federal Election Commission] to say they can’t do that? The result of Citizens United was correct — but the dicta in that case now means that everyone can do everything in terms of corporate free speech.

DL: And what, in your view, can be done about the problem?

SB: We need to pass a constitutional amendment to fix this. Some might say it’s naïve to think it can be done, given the difficulty of amending the Constitution. But public disgust around money in politics is growing so rapidly that something like this is actually possible.

One of the overriding themes of the book is: how does all this change? And one answer is that things will get so bad that they’ll get good again. The public will get so disgusted, and we’ll decide that we’re not going to take it anymore.

And money in politics is really issue number one. You can trace practically all of our other problems — health care, the tax code, infrastructure — back to money in politics.

DL: In your discussion of the “too big to jail” problem, you talk about government not cracking down enough on corporate wrongdoers, as well as the related issue of the revolving door between government and law firms. Do you have any thoughts on how to address these problems?

SB: The press has to get a lot better at writing these stories. They present settlements with big companies as big victories, but in many cases, they’re not harsh enough — and should actually be bad items on the government lawyers’ résumés.

As for the revolving door, it’s not bad that prosecutors know they can make a good living somewhere after their government service. What needs to be fixed is that the people in charge need to have real guidelines for dealing with corporate wrongdoing, and the country needs a culture of personal responsibility for the common good.

DL: What you’re calling for sounds a lot like noblesse oblige — which was something that, for all its faults, the old-boy network did believe in, to a certain extent.

SB: Absolutely. There were many bad things about the old ways of doing things — my wife had to be taken thorough the side door of a private club when she was having lunch at her Wall Street law firm — but there was a certain sense back then of, “I got it good, so I need to give something back.”

When I was at the American Lawyer, I used to make fun of lockstep compensation, another old way of doing things. But it did have the virtue of not making partners compete with each other. If one partner has low hours because of pro bono work or because he’s sick, that’s okay — we are partners.

The whole thing is about balance. Communism in theory is good because everyone eats. But under Communism, if you have no incentives, then no one eats. You need a balance. The whole history of our country is about striking a balance between individualism and equality.

DL: You end on an optimistic and hopeful note, but when I read the book, the forces contributing to decline generally sounded much more powerful to me than the forces of reform you highlight. Do you truly think that the trends you describe in the book can be reversed — especially since, as you describe so well in the book, many reforms end up being twisted or “boomeranging”?

SB: In doing the reporting for the book, to understand the problems, I met so many people working against the problems. I talk about them in the book — the people behind organizations like Issue One, OpenSecrets, C4Q (Coalition for Queens), and Baruch College, to name a few.

They’re not crazy or naïve or stupid. They’re resilient — and there are millions of people like them out there, who are going to lead that revolution.

In the end, what choice do we have? This country isn’t just going to roll over.

DL: Which brings us to President Donald Trump, of whom you’re not a fan. Does his presidency give you pause in terms of thinking that the country can be turned around?

SB: Trump is going to help break the fever. When the coal miners realize that they haven’t gotten their jobs back, when factory workers don’t have jobs on Election Day 2020, they’re going to blame someone — and sooner or later, they won’t blame the Democrats.

Of course, we need political figures who can lead these people. Hillary [Clinton] just wasn’t able to connect. But even if she had gotten those 70-something thousand votes, we would still be having a conversation about a country in paralysis.

Trump rode a wave of frustration and got 46 percent of the popular vote. If someone can ride that same wave, but without cynicism and division, that someone should be able to get 56 percent.

DL: In closing, what can lawyers and law students do to help take back our economy and our democracy?

SB: It’s so obvious, but always think about the balance between personal achievement and the common good. That’s what the law is for.

Earlier this year, a leader in the field of litigation finance, our friends at Lake Whillans, provided a look at the [“White Sandal” firms of Silicon Valley](https://abovethelaw.com/2016/05/the-white-sandal-elite-the-go-to-law-firms-of-silicon-valley/) — an indisputable tech hub where all manner of innovation is thriving. [Lake Whillans](http://www.lakewhillans.com) supports innovative entrepreneurs and businesses across the country, including those in other vital epicenters of tech innovation. Over the coming months, we will explore the legal markets in these hubs, each unique in its own right.

Today, we look to Boston, which is home to a flurry of startup activity, fueled by a robust level of venture capital funding and a high concentration of sheer talent, exemplified by world-class universities, notably Harvard and MIT.

Of course, the Boston legal market — like that of [Silicon Valley](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/litigation-finance-leader-lake-whillans-expands-opening-palo-alto-office-300230623.html) — extends well beyond the cadre of long-established Biglaw titans (e.g., WilmerHale, Ropes & Gray) to include a complex ecosystem of specialist boutiques and smaller firms with deep local roots and thriving practices in areas ranging from estate planning to restructuring to white collar defense. And in these hotbed cities of tech and startup activity, there’s also plenty of cutting-edge patent, IPO, and M&A work.

In our series of White Sandal round-ups, Lake Whillans presents this handy primer on The Go-To Law Firms of Boston. These firms not only can handle every transactional need, but they do anything from taxes to setting up HR review processes. Engaging these firms can help the tech startups, unicorns, and venture capitalists of the new economy avoid or contain problems down the road. Should legal issues arise, Lake Whillans can step in and help resolve them.

##1. Best Firm for One-Horned Horsey Creatures: [Choate Hall & Stewart LLP](https://www.choate.com/)

Carney, Jr. Carney cemented his status as one of the legends of the criminal defense world with his defense of some of Boston’s most notorious figures, including mobster “Whitey” Bulger, accused terrorist Tarek Mehanna, and Planned Parenthood shooter John C. Salvi. On regular days, his practice routinely represents everyday criminals in all stages of the criminal justice process.

# Another Elite Firm Matches New Special Bonus Scale
## We're bringing the whole gang into this special bonus job.

Bonus season in Biglaw is a lot like a heist movie. One character gets a crazy idea. But, for whatever reason, it doesn’t quite work out for them. They’re just not ready to tackle this alone. Enter the older and wiser character who explains that this is going to have to be a much bigger job. Then the next act involves the newly appointed leader going around and visiting the old crew to bring them back for one last score. After initial pushback, accompanied by saying something like, “I’m getting too old for this,” one by one the crew responds, “[You son of a bitch, I’m in!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkZpgEhxAYo)”

[Willkie Farr took the first shot](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/willkie-spring-bonuses-2021/) with a $7,500-$40,000 special bonus. [Davis Polk came in and raised the stakes](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/davis-polk-spring-special-bonus-2021/) to $12,000-$64,000 spread over two payout dates. And since then it’s been a non-stop parade of top firms declaring, in deeds if not words, “You son of a bitch, I’m in.”

Just last night we got [Cleary](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/cleary-spring-bonus/) and [Paul Weiss](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/paul-weiss-special-bonus-2021)… so obviously Debevoise wasn’t far behind with another Wednesday evening announcement. But with a twist!

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  


Yes, Debevoise is joining [Skadden](https://abovethelaw.com/2021/03/skadden-spring-bonuses/) in offering equal distributions instead of weighting the bonus toward the latter date. Though unlike Skadden, who paid out the back end in December, Debevoise is pushing that latter payout date up to September.

Congratulations everyone. Can’t wait for the annual bonus sequel… maybe some time around Thanksgiving?

Full memo on the next page.

# The Client Service A-Team: Ranking The Biglaw Superheroes Of Client Service (2023)

Which Biglaw firms are most beloved by general counsel for their superior client service? If that seems like it was a steep hill to climb during the roller coaster of a year that was 2022, that’s because it was. The BTI Consulting Group set to find out which firms handled the task with ease with its latest ranking, the Client Service A-Team. In case you’re unfamiliar with this ranking, it measures the top 30 law firms corporate counsel identify as delivering the very best in terms of client service. (This year, because midsize firms really excelled while under fire, the ranking that now covers the Client Service 30, the Client Service 100, and the Client Service 200.)

To compile the ranking, BTI Consulting spoke with more than 350 in-house decision-makers who were asked to name firms that excelled in 17 different client-service-related activities, seven of which reigned supreme above all overs, including: mobilizing resources quickly, fielding the absolute best team, quickly assessing the situation, a commitment to help, delivering value for the dollar, client focus, and understanding the client’s business.

So, which firms are considered the best of the best when it comes to client service? Per BTI Consulting, the firms that made the latest top 30 ranking performed 70% better than the typical firm in terms of client service. As the ranking notes, “client service stalwarts continue to invest relentlessly [in client service] — no matter how well they do. They are convinced they can do better.”

Here are the top 10 firms that made the [Client Service A-Team](https://bticonsulting.com/themadclientist/clients-single-out-law-firms-delivering-the-best-client-service-by-name), whose names were mentioned most often across all categories:

1. Kirkland & Ellis
2. Ogletree
3. Jones Day
4. McGuireWoods
5. Gibson Dunn
6. DLA Piper
7. Littler
8. Ropes & Gray
9. Mintz
10. King & Spalding

Kirkland & Ellis is the new leader of the pack, kicking Jones Day out of the top spot after a six-year stint there. [Law360](https://www.law360.com/corporate/articles/1593697?) (sub. req.) has additional details:

According to Michael Rynowecer, president of BTI Consulting, Kirkland secured the No. 1 spot due to its hard work and commitment to delivering the best client service and experience.

“They’re one of the firms that really brings not just legal skills, but their clients say they bring business understanding and business savvy and business intelligence and new approaches,” Rynowecer said.

If attorneys at your firm make more of an effort to better understand your clients’ businesses, then you may find your place of work on this list next time around. Congratulations to all 30 firms that made it to the highest ranks of the Client Service A-List. You’ve proven yourselves to be outstanding when it comes to making corporate clients happy, and that’s worth celebrating.

# Trump Predicts Justices Ginsburg And Sotomayor Will Die During His Presidency

Do you need your rage-o-meter to get revved up this morning? Maybe a weekend of social media posts from the women in your life explaining how they have been subjected to sexual harassment or sexual assault wasn’t enough. Well, now Donald Trump is predicting he’ll appoint four Supreme Court justices before his time in office is up.

According to a [report from Axios](https://www.axios.com/trumps-four-justices-2497007846.html), Trump does some nifty math to get to that number. He’s, of course, counting the appointment of Neil Gorsuch. Then he’s counting on Anthony Kennedy to live up to[ the rumors](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/06/no-justice-anthony-m-kennedy-is-not-retiring-tomorrow/) and retire (if Justice Kennedy cares about his legacy on gay rights, he better stay right where President Reagan put him). But to get to the last two appointments he wants, he has to kill off some female jurists:

### [ The Business Case For AI At Your Law Firm ](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/) 
ChatGPT ushers in the age of generative AI – even for law firms.
From [THOMSON REUTERS](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/04/the-business-case-for-ai-at-your-law-firm/)  
“Ok,” one source told Trump, “so that’s two. Who are the others?”

“Ginsburg,” Trump replied. “What does she weigh? 60 pounds?”

“Who’s the fourth?” the source asked.

“Sotomayor,” Trump said, referring to the relatively recently-appointed Obama justice, whose name is rarely, if ever, mentioned in speculation about the next justice to be replaced. “Her health,” Trump explained. “No good. Diabetes.”

Of course Trump would just love it if a pair of powerful, outspoken women got out of his way.

Listen, prognosticating on the health of Justice Ginsburg is practically a cottage industry. She’s an elderly woman whose age is clearly wearing on her. But, her workout regimen is [no joke](https://abovethelaw.com/2017/02/ruth-bader-ginsburg-is-fit-as-hell/), so that — plus a lot of prayers and well wishes from liberals — will hopefully be enough to get her to survive this administration. But Justice Sotomayor’s [Type-1 diabetes](https://abovethelaw.com/2010/01/scotus-justice-sonia-sotomayor-has-star-power/) shows no signs of slowing her down. If you can’t grab ’em by the pussy, you might as well imagine them dead.

Frankly, this reads more like the president’s wish list of things he wants to happen. Fortunately, unlike healthcare, he can’t really sign an executive order to force anyone’s hand.

When a Republican can’t get the Eleventh Circuit’s William Pryor — [this Judge Pryor](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/11/federal-judge-weeps-for-poor-defenseless-federalist-society-ruthlessly-bullied-by-legal-bloggers/) — to take their side, you know they’re in trouble. When Judge Pryor issues “to put it mildly, a total body slam,” against your argument, well, you’re in for a bad time.

Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows wanted the Georgia RICO charges against him stemming from his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election removed to federal court, claiming the charges were related to his work as a federal official. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court ruling, with the aforementioned Judge Pryor basically saying, LOL, no.

### [ Legal AI: 3 Steps Law Firms Should Take Now ](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)
If 2023 introduced legal professionals to generative AI, then 2024 will be when law firms start adapting to utilize it. Things are moving fast, so…
From [LexisNexis](https://bit.ly/3x7bHOy)  
Hogan Lovells partner Neal Katyal appeared on MSNBC’s The Beat last night to chat about the Eleventh Circuit’s “total body slam.”

“And to basically summarize what this long opinion says, Chief Justice Pryor just basically said, look, if you’re the White House chief of staff, launching a coup is not in your job description. That’s the opinion, plain and simple.”

And Katyal doesn’t think Meadows should be optimistic that the Supreme Court will save him on this one, saying, “I don’t think there’s any chance that this case is going to be something that the Supreme Court is going to grant and rule for Mark Meadows on. This is going nowhere fast.”

The march of Biglaw salary matches continues. Following Milbank’s decision to up associate base salaries, firms have started to join the party with raises here and there.

Moments ago, one of the largest firms in the world opted to join the prevailing scale. And with over 4,000 attorneys at this point and around $3.1B in revenue, DLA Piper is a behemoth by any measure.

DLA’s associates received some “verein good news” — Swiss business organization puns are too rare to pass up — today when the firm adopted the new scale. The firm employs a joint “Level/Year” compensation system, but the new scale boils down to this:

Class	New Salary
Class of 2021 (Level 1)	$215K
Class of 2020 (Level 1)	$225K
Class of 2019 (Level 1)	$250K
Class of 2018 (Level 2)	$285K
Class of 2017 (Level 2)	$325K
Class of 2016 (Level 2)	$350K
Class of 2015 (Level 2)	$370K
Class of 2014+ (Level 3)	$385K
Associates will see these amounts retroactively applied in their January 28th payout.

Congratulations to all.
